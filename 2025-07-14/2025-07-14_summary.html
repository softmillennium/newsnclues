I really don't want to write what I'm about to write. As someone who regularly tries to get close to the active combat zone of Russia's war against Ukraine, tell the stories of those in the middle of it — soldiers and civilians — and bring them out to the wider world despite the physical danger involved, I have endless respect for colleagues around the world who do the same.

I never thought that I would now be the one needing to speak up about a colorful, well-written, and beautifully photographed piece of war journalism. But yet here we are.

Here we are because on July 12, The New York Times released a field report from Russian territory in Kursk Oblast, after it had been retaken from Ukrainian forces in March this year. The piece ran — and still stands there on the Times website — with the following headline: “A Landscape of Death: What's Left Where Ukraine Invaded Russia.”


In these fraught times, the New York Times has made a seemingly deliberate and very self-aware choice to paint a picture of this war without the understanding of who is in the right and who is in the wrong.
    

I want to believe that I'm tolerant and flexible, and understand that different publications in different countries might look at this war a little bit differently than us here at The Kyiv Independent. And overall, of course, we understand and place a very high value on the importance of the world not forgetting about this war.

We now stand at one of the most crucial moments in Russia's full-scale war — where the events of the next few months, particularly in the United States, could play a deciding role in whether our home, Ukraine, exists as an independent country in a few years' time or not.

In these fraught times, the New York Times has made a seemingly deliberate and very self-aware choice to paint a picture of this war without the understanding of who is in the right and who is in the wrong.

On the surface, the article by the German-Russian Magnum photographer Nanna Heitmann is very well put together — impressive writing, emotional quotes from suffering civilians and soldiers, the proper caveats on casualty figures stated by Russian authorities, and, of course, Heitmann's compelling photography, for which she has gained numerous accolades in her career so far.

There's just one small problem. You could take this text, these images, flip it and make it about a Ukrainian settlement after liberation from Russian forces, and it would read the exact same way.

This shouldn't need to be spelled out — this piece proactively creates a narrative of moral equivalence in a war where the moral landscape could hardly be more black and white.

It seems like it should be obvious to anyone — but for some reason, not to the New York Times editorial board.

Let's talk a little bit about access. Having worked in this field for almost three years now, I can tell you that soldiers don't usually want to have to babysit journalists in a war zone. That's why embedded front-line access is not always an easy thing to come by, let alone for a photographer working for the newspaper of an “unfriendly nation.”

There are three reasons why soldiers are ready to bring journalists to the front line: either they've received an order from higher up to do so, they see a direct personal benefit in bringing these journalists along, or there's simply a great deal of personal trust — or perhaps even friendship — with the journalist. Sometimes it's a combination of those factors.

When I went to Kursk Oblast myself in the weeks after Ukraine's incursion last year, I went twice: once unofficially, with my soldier friends, and once on an official press tour organized by the Ukrainian military.

In this case, Heitmann, the photographer and reporter, was embedded with units of the Akhmat Chechen Special Forces Unit — better known as the Kadyrovites.

This unit forms the core of the personal military of the brutal Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov, and these soldiers, having taken part in Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine since the very beginning, have been implicated in numerous war crimes against civilians and prisoners of war in Ukraine as part of the aggressor's army.

This isn't the first time that Heitmann has worked with Akhmat either. Her work previously sparked outrage in Ukraine when an image of a wounded soldier at one of Akhmat's field hospitals near occupied Bakhmut was placed alongside the image of a Ukrainian child — in a diptych presented by World Press Photo in an attempt to show the duality of war — or something ridiculous along those lines.


Would it be seen as acceptable by the New York Times editorial board to have their journalist embedded with a Nazi German SS unit on the battlefields of Eastern Europe in World War II?
    

Here, we have one of the most notoriously brutal military units of this war, the elite guard of a fascist regime within a larger fascist aggressor state — giving this Western reporter repeated, exclusive access to the front line.

Once again: three reasons. An order from the top, perception of personal benefit, or simply high levels of trust and/or friendship. Feel free to make your own conclusions.

I really hate the fact that I have to go there — but would it be seen as acceptable by the New York Times editorial board to have their journalist embedded with a Nazi German SS unit on the battlefields of Eastern Europe in World War II?

Going forward, I could nitpick at the text: the headline “A Landscape of Death,” apparently caused by Ukraine's “invasion of Russia;” the quotes from civilians, proactively chosen, describing Ukraine being pushed into a war of “brother against brother;” the lack of any critical context about the nature of the unit that Heitmann was embedded with; or about the fact that this destruction was only caused as a consequence of Russia invading Ukraine in the first place.

But at the end of the day, this is just a very simple question of moral fiber.

As a flagship Western media outlet, in a country that has long been the center of the free world – but is now facing a moral crisis of its own – The New York Times has an inherent duty to document these historic events with some level of moral grounding.

I'm not saying that no reporting should be done from Russia. When thinking about how to do it right, I think of the brave and dignified BBC correspondent Steve Rosenberg, who is there, occasionally rubbing shoulders with the Kremlin inner circle, but doing so with the clear, focused understanding that he is covering the attempt by a massive, tyrannical empire to annihilate an independent state.

And once again, the last thing I want to do is to look like I'm attacking a colleague. But here, instead of reporting like that of Rosenberg, what we get from Heitmann and The New York Times is reporting more along the lines of that of Anastasia Trofimova, the Russian “independent” filmmaker who — after directing documentaries with Kremlin propaganda channel RT — made her film, “Russians at War,” about the “human side” of those soldiers who signed up to kill and torture, steal and rape in Ukraine for money. It's a disappointment but not a surprise that Trofimova and Heitmann have worked closely together on numerous occasions.

Which brings me back to my own trips to Kursk Oblast.

Given the adrenaline of Ukraine finally bringing the war to the territory of the aggressor state, the fact I work for a Ukrainian outlet, and that I know people who have been killed by Russia's war — my reporting might have been biased and perhaps unsympathetic to the Russian civilian victims of Ukraine's incursion. And yet, when we were on the territory of another sovereign state, I understood that something here was inherently different.

For that reason, I said as much in my reports. I explained in our video story that our access was controlled by the Ukrainian military, and that this was an unprecedented situation — for a Ukrainian war reporter to be entering another country with an occupying army, speaking to civilians to whom the soldiers personally brought us to. In this managed environment, nothing I saw or heard about the treatment of the locals could be taken as representative fact.

The historic moment demanded that we report on this. But there were ethical problems, and we acknowledged them from the outset.

Neither in this article from Heitmann, nor in the other work she has done inside occupied Ukrainian territory, is any of that self-awareness evident.

Perhaps including it would ruin her next opportunity to embed with Akhmat. Perhaps it wasn't there in the first place. I don't know.

What I do know is that this kind of reporting is inherently immoral. And in a time where Americans — from ordinary voters, to thought leaders, and up to the president himself — are more vulnerable to “both-sidesing” narratives on this war than ever, an approach like this could have real consequences for the future existence of Ukraine.

The New York Times, you can and must do better.

EPA's move comes as it slashes climate research  funding and cuts weather forecasting and scientific agencies' staff

Trump officials' recent attempt to dispel concerns about “chemtrails” has perplexed and angered some experts who say the administration has itself promoted the conspiracy theory while also spreading climate misinformation.

“This is an intriguing strategy … in an administration that, depending on agency, is actively promulgating conspiracy theories or at least conspiratorial thinking,” said Timothy Tangherlini, a professor at the Berkeley School of Information who studies the circulation of folklore and conspiracy theories.

On Thursday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched a website about contrails, trails of white vapor emitted aircrafts. Conspiracy theorists call the streaks “chemtrails” and believe they contain polluting chemicals meant to achieve mass sterilization, weather control or other nefarious plots. Though “it is reasonable to ask questions”, those beliefs are inaccurate, the page makes clear.

Officials also launched a second webpage focused on geoengineering, which correctly notes that schemes to “cool the Earth by intentionally modifying the amount of sunlight” are “being studied”. It says “current federal research activity should not be interpreted as endorsement”, though without explicitly stating that these efforts have not been widely practiced.

The websites were published as baseless rumors swirled claiming weather-altering technology fueled recent catastrophic flooding in Texas. The EPA, however, says it “planned long ago to release these new online resources” which it had been “working on for months”.

“Regarding the flooding, EPA stands ready to help Texans get back on their feet in the wake of this tragedy,” a spokesperson said.

Sijia Xiao, a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who for a 2021 study interviewed 20 current and former chemtrails believers, said the conspiracy theory attracts many people looking for simple explanations to tragedies.

“Several participants in my interviews, they related chemtrails to their personal health problems or environmental concerns like pollution,” she said. “And in this example of the Texas flood, I think people are trying to attribute a clear cause to a real life issue.”

But as it addresses false causes of the floods, Trump has continually shunned research into the climate crisis, which he has dismissed as a “hoax”. Research shows the deluge in the US south-west would have been less intense if not for the climate crisis, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels.

“Rather than addressing climate change – which makes floods like those in Texas, North Carolina, New Mexico, and Illinois more intense, more deadly and more frequent – Trump's EPA is wasting taxpayer money chasing baseless conspiracy theories that scientists debunked years ago,” said the Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a climate hawk. “It's a distraction from the Trump administration's free pass to big oil on its pollution.”

Since Trump re-entered the White House in January, EPA has slashed funding for climate research, removed all mentions of climate from federal websites, and cut staff for weather forecasting and scientific agencies. He has also cracked down on climate accountability efforts, including lawsuits accusing big oil of a conspiracy to spread climate misinformation.

The president has also repeatedly referred to green regulations as a “scam” and repeated climate denialist talking points, while his administration has spread misinformation about elections and vaccines. As recently as two months ago, Robert F Kennedy Jr, Trump's health and human services secretary, also suggested that the chemtrail conspiracy theory is real, saying in a televised town hall he would “do everything in my power to stop” their spread.

Even after Zeldin announced the new initiative, Kennedy appeared to maintain his position, praising the administrator and Trump for taking on the “diabolical mass poisoning of our people, our communities, our waterways and farms, and our purple mountains, majesty”.

“It's all contributing to this environment, this idea that you should have low trust in institutions,” said Tangherlini, the folklore expert. “And when you have low trust in institutions and in the information sources that you have access to, you are going to come up with a plausible story that resonates.”

Some have been able to integrate the new EPA websites into those stories, claiming they merely provide evidence that the government is continuing to cover up information about chemtrails.

“Conspiracy theory is a self-fulfilling feedback loop where everything can be turned into evidence of supporting their beliefs,” said Xiao.

Though the chemtrail belief is not based in reality, real conspiracies have existed through American history, said Tangherlini, including ones that involved the cover-up of covertly sprayed chemicals.

Today, the Trump administration is openly dismantling protections against toxic and planet-warming pollutants, allowing corporations to truly conspire against the American people, said Aaron Regunberg, climate accountability project director at the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen.

“Just like big tobacco lied about cigarettes causing cancer, big oil has spent decades running a vast conspiracy to deceive the public on climate change,” he said. “That's why Maga [Trump's Make America Great Again movement] wants us talking about this chemtrails garbage – because there's a real conspiracy implicating their big oil cronies that they don't want the American people to think about.”

Sayfollah Musallet is at least the ninth US citizen to be killed by Israeli forces or settlers since 2022.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

The family of 20-year-old U.S. citizen Sayfollah Musallet is being joined by a number of advocacy groups in demanding a full U.S.-led investigation into the young man's fatal beating by Israeli settlers in the West Bank last week — and pushing back against the corporate media's characterization of the brutal attack.

“We demand the U.S. State Department lead an immediate investigation and hold the Israeli settlers who killed Saif accountable for their crimes,” said the family in a statement, referring to Musallet by his nickname.

The family described how Israeli settlers “surrounded Saif for over three hours as paramedics attempted to reach him, but the mob of settlers blocked the ambulance and paramedics from providing life-saving aid.”

Musallet's brother finally was able to retrieve him and bring him to a nearby hospital, but he died from his injuries before arriving there.

The State Department has said little about the killing of Musallet, who was a 20-year-old Palestinian-American with dual citizenship who was born in Florida, where he was still living when he traveled to the West Bank to visit family for the summer.

The Trump administration told Al Jazeera late Friday that the department “has no higher priority than the safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas,” and said it was “aware of reports of the death of a U.S. citizen in the West Bank,” but did not provide further details about how it was proceeding following Musallet's killing.

Meanwhile, rights advocates condemned The New York Times‘ reporting on the attack, which it called “a clash.” It cited the Israeli government's claim that “the violence began when Palestinians threw stones at Israeli civilians.”

“This was a lynching, not a ‘clash,'” said Imraan Siddiqi, executive director of the Washington State office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).

Musallet is at least the ninth U.S. citizen to be killed by Israeli forces or settlers since 2022. The U.S. government has historically accepted the results of Israel's investigations into killings like those of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh and activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi.

Under pressure, the Department of Justice finally opened a probe into the 2022 fatal shooting of Abu Akleh, but more than three years after her killing it has not released its findings.

None of the Israeli killings of U.S. citizens have resulted in criminal charges.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee told Al Jazeera Saturday that the U.S. “must stop treating Palestinian American lives as expendable.”

“Israeli settlers lynched 20-year-old Palestinian American Sayfollah Musallet, while U.S. officials stayed silent,” the group said. “Sayfollah was born and raised in Florida. He was visiting family for the summer in the West Bank when settlers beat him to death while he protested illegal land seizures.”

Musallet's family said his killing is “an unimaginable nightmare and an injustice that no family should ever have to face.”

“We demand justice,” they said.

Zeteo journalist Mehdi Hasan noted that along with the Trump administration near-silence, Florida's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has so far said nothing publicly about the killing of the Tampa resident.

“Why do Israelis keep murdering Americans?” said Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of Democracy for the Arab World Now. “Perhaps it's because they know our government will never do a damn thing about it?”

“Not even a word of condolence offered to his family, not from ‘America First' President Trump, not from the Florida governor, not from the State Department,” she said. “Seems it's always just really Israel First for these folks.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Agents tear-gassed community members, including children, as crowds attempted to protect farmworkers from arrest.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

An immigration raid in Camarillo, California, on Thursday led to an hourslong standoff between protesters and federal border agents, who blocked the roads with military-style vehicles and tear-gassed community members, including children, as crowds attempted to protect dozens of farmworkers from arrest.

The Department of Homeland Security said over 300 immigrants were detained in dual raids on cannabis farms and agricultural fields in Camarillo and the coastal city of Carpinteria. One farmworker fell from the roof of a greenhouse during the immigration raid and later died of his injuries. Jaime Alanís, 57, had worked at the farm in Camarillo for 10 years and provided for his wife and daughter who live in Mexico. Alanís is the first known person to die during an immigration raid since President Trump returned to office.

“It was almost unlike anything that we had ever seen before,” says Angelmarie Taylor, a student and volunteer with 805 Immigrant Coalition who was present during the raid in Camarillo.

“We're talking about human beings. We're talking about parents, just like the gentleman that passed because of the chaotic actions of ICE,” says Luis McArthur, mayor of nearby Oxnard.

Trump signals backing for Pam Bondi amid calls from Maga world for her dismissal

Donald Trump has defended attorney general Pam Bondi amid calls from Maga world for her to go.

In a lengthy social media post, Trump hit out at complaints from critics who have accused Bondi of withholding more information about Jeffrey Epstein's sudden death and his so-called client list.

“LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB,” Trump wrote in all caps, encouraging his supporters to “not waste time and energy” on Epstein.

Bondi suggested to Fox News in February that Epstein's client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”. She had also repeatedly pledged to reveal potentially damaging evidence including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs” relating to Epstein.

But the justice department last week released a memo concluding there was no evidence suggesting the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender kept a “client list” to blackmail high-profile figures. It also found no evidence to suggest foul play in Epstein's death, which had previously been ruled a suicide.

Bondi sought to clarify her remarks in the White House on Tuesday, telling reporters that she had been commenting on the entire Epstein “file” and other files.

Tucker Carlson has told NBC News this morning that he now believes the justice department doesn't actually have “much relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes”. “Rather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn't back up, and this current outrage is the result,” Carlson said.

A coalition of mostly Democratic-led states filed a lawsuit today challenging a move by Donald Trump's administration to withhold about $6.8bn in congressionally approved federal funding for K-12 schools.

Attorneys general or governors from 24 states and the District of Columbia sued in federal court in Providence, Rhode Island, arguing that the US Department of Education and the office of management and budget threw schools nationwide into chaos by unconstitutionally freezing funding for six programs approved by Congress.

The freeze extended to funding used to support the education of migrant farm workers and their children; recruitment and training of teachers; English proficiency learning; academic enrichment; and after-school and summer programs.

The administration also froze funding used to support adult literacy and job-readiness skills.

The government was legally required to release the money to the states by 1 July, the lawsuit said. Instead, the education department notified states on 30 June that it would not be issuing grant awards under those programs by that deadline. It cited the change in administration as its reason.

An OMB spokesperson at the time cited an “ongoing programmatic review” of education funding and said initial findings showed what he termed as a misuse of grant funds to “subsidize a radical leftwing agenda”.

OMB also raised objections to the use of the grant money to support scholarships for immigrant students and lessons that involved LGBTQ+ themes.

The Democratic-led states said the sweeping funding freeze has disrupted school systems, resulting in summer school and after-school programs being canceled or put at risk and the halting of other initiatives with little time for school districts to fill in the holes left in their budgets.

The states say the administration violated the US constitution by disregarding Congress' sole authority over spending and ran afoul of federal administrative law by freezing the funds without any reasoned explanation.

The states also say the administration failed to abide by procedures of the Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from unilaterally refusing to spend funds appropriated by Congress unless certain steps are followed.

The lawsuit follows a series of other cases Democratic-led states and others have filed challenging the administration's sweeping efforts to freeze or terminate federal funding for programs out of step with Trump's agenda.

The notorious new “Alligator Alcatraz” immigration jail in the Florida Everglades contains hundreds of detainees with no criminal records or charges, it was disclosed yesterday, as lawmakers decried “inhumane” conditions inside after touring the facility.

Donald Trump has insisted that the remote camp in swamp land populated by pythons and alligators was reserved for immigrants who were “deranged psychopaths” and “some of the most vicious people on the planet” awaiting deportation.

But at least one detainee shouted out to politicians during Saturday's visit that he was a US citizen, the Democratic Florida congressman Maxwell Frost said. And the Miami Herald obtained and published a list of 700 people held in cages showing that at least 250 had committed no offense other than a civil immigration violation.

Authorities have refused to release a list of those sent there by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (Ice). The Florida department of emergency management, which operates the hastily assembled tent encampment, did not respond to a request from the Guardian for clarification or comment.

Frost said the revelations, and the lawmakers' visit, raised new questions about the legality of the camp, which federal agencies in court documents have insisted is entirely a state-run and -funded operation.

There are Ice agents there every day, and I was told directly from the guy running the whole thing that Ice tells them exactly what to do, how to put everything together.

They gave them the instructions on how to do the cages, the food, who comes in and goes out. It's Ice making all the decisions, and he was very clear that the role the state is playing is logistical. This is a federal facility. Ice is calling all the shots.

Joe Biden has denied claims that his circle of aides acted without his knowledge when he granted a slew of pardons and commutations in the final days and hours of his presidency.

“I made every single one of those,” the former president told the New York Times in an interview published yesterday when asked about claims that he was incapacitated and unaware of clemency decisions. Biden called the people making those claims “liars”, adding: “They know it.”

Donald Trump's successor and predecessor in the Oval Office issued three sets of clemency during his final days, including reducing sentences of hundreds of non-violent drug offenders and commuting the sentences of 37 federal death row inmates to life without parole.

He pardoned his son, Hunter Biden, of convictions on federal gun and tax charges, too. And he also granted pre-emptive pardons to other members of his immediate family, along with the former top public health adviser Dr Anthony Fauci and ex-joint chiefs of staff chair Gen Mark Milley.

Conservatives have alleged that the commutations and pardons, along with executive orders passed during his term, are not binding because they were signed using an autopen printer to reproduce a signature and could therefore not be verified as being directly authorized by Biden himself.

In the NYT interview, Biden hit back at that suggestion, telling the Times he hadn't personally signed the orders simply “because there were a lot of them”.

“The autopen … is legal,” Biden said. “As you know, other presidents used it, including Trump. But the point is that … we're talking about a whole lot of people.”

Biden has previously pushed back on Republican claims he was unaware of what was being issued in his name.

“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency,” he said in June. “I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false.”

In his most recent remarks, to the Times, Biden accused Republicans of using the autopen issue as diversion.

They've lied so consistently about almost everything they're doing. The best thing they can do is try to change the focus and focus on something else. And … I think that's what this is about.

Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte took a bit of a back seat as Donald Trump answered questions from reporters in a media session that just ended.

But Rutte did say that Germany, Finland, Canada, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Denmark would be among the buyers to supply Ukraine. He said “speed is of the essence here,” and that the shipments should make Putin “reconsider” peace negotiations.

Trump said the weapons the US would send to Nato to support Ukraine in its war against Russia would include Patriot missile systems and batteries, Reuters reports.

“It's a full complement with the batteries,” Trump said when asked whether he would send Patriot missiles specifically.

“We're going to have some come very soon, within days... a couple of the countries that have Patriots are going to swap over and will replace the Patriots with the ones they have.”

Trump's threat to put “severe tariffs” on Russia over the Ukraine war comes amid a bipartisan push for sanctions on Moscow.

The bill, backed by Republican senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal, calls for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports, according to the Associated Press. The move essentially targets countries like China and India, which account for about 70% of Russia's energy trade and finance much of Moscow's war effort.

It's worth noting that Donald Trump did not provide specifics on how the tariffs on Russia would be implemented. 
 “I use trade for a lot of things,” he added. “But it's great for settling wars.”

Donald Trump is still speaking now in the Oval Office alongside Nato leader Mark Rutte.

Trump, while announcing Patriot missiles being sent to Kyiv, said the US will impose “very severe tariffs” on Russia in 50 days if there is no deal to stop the war in Ukraine.

While the Maga world is in disarray over the Epstein files, president Donald Trump is hosting Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte in the White House for talks that will also include state secretary Marco Rubio, defense secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Congress.

Trump announced he was sending Patriot missiles to Ukraine to assist in the war against Russia. He also said he was “disappointed” in Russian president Vladimir Putin for failing to agree to a deal to stop the war.

For those who need a refresher on who deputy FBI director Dan Bongino is, here's a quick recap.

A former New York police officer and Secret Service agent who provided security to presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama, Bongino is best known as a far-right Maga podcaster and conspiracy theorist, who vocally supported Donald Trump's lie that the 2020 presidential election was “stolen”.

Bongino had never served in the FBI, and his appointment as deputy marked the first time in its 117-year history that the second-in-command post has not been held by one of its senior agents.

A former Fox News Host, Bongino has written books alleging the existence of a “deep state” conspiracy against Trump. He also ran unsuccessfully three times as a Republican in congressional races in Maryland and Florida.

As a podcast host, Bongino spent years pushing Epstein conspiracy theories, and has reportedly been very upset with attorney general Pam Bondi over how the Epstein files were handled.

“Bongino is out-of-control furious,” a source close to Bongino told NBC News. “This destroyed his career. He's threatening to quit and torch Pam unless she's fired.” Axios reported that Bongino didn't show up to work on Friday, and the row prompted Trump himself to step in.

Asked by reporters yesterday if Bongino would remain in his position, Trump said:

Oh I think so ... I spoke to him today. Dan Bongino, very good guy. I've known him a long time. I've done his show many, many times. He sounded terrific, actually.

Here's more on Bongino from my colleague Robert Tait:

Donald Trump managed something unusual last week. In his administration's claim that it did not have a list of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged clients, and that the convicted sex offender was not murdered, it succeeded in upsetting the rightwing influencers and commentators – and reportedly even Trump's deputy FBI director – people who typically champion his every move.

“This stinks. This just reeks,” was the verdict of Jesse Watters, the primetime Fox News host. He added:

The feds spent decades investigating Epstein and have had total access to his property for years, they still cannot give us a straight answer? This is not anything new; the government has been keeping us in the dark for generations.

Watters was careful not to criticize the Trump administration directly, blaming “the feds” as he described Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and Kash Patel, the director of the FBI, as “great Americans”.

But within the rightwing, Epstein-curious sphere, others had continued to wade in. “Pam Blondi [sic] is covering up child sex crimes that took place under HER WATCH when she was Attorney General of Florida,” wrote Laura Loomer, the 32-year-old conspiracy theorist whose influence over Trump has come under scrutiny.

Loomer accused Bondi of failing to pursue legal action against Epstein, despite lawsuits being filed against him in Florida. “She is afraid of that being discussed and brought to light. She needs to be fired. She has tainted the investigation,” Loomer concluded.

When the justice department said that Epstein did not keep a client list and no more files related to his sex-trafficking investigation would be made public, the White House claimed Bondi had been talking about the “entirety of all of the paperwork and relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes”, which satisfied few rightwing commentators, many of whom have built careers on propagating conspiracy theories.

“We were all told more was coming. That answers were out there and would be provided. Incredible how utterly mismanaged this Epstein mess has been. And it didn't have to be,” said Jack Posobiec, who promoted the baseless theory that high-level Democrats were running a child sex ring out of a Washington pizzeria. Posobiec was among a group of rightwing influencers who were given binders labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1” during a visit to the White House in February – although many were disappointed that those documents contained little new information.

The ire was also inspired by the justice department releasing an 11-hour video showing the exterior of Epstein's door, apparently in an effort to show no one entered his cell at the time he died. But a minute of the video was missing, which satisfied few on the right.

“There are some extremely bizarre things about the video of Epstein's cell that Pam Bondi's DOJ released as proof no one killed him. First, a full minute appears to be missing from the video and secondly, it does NOT appear to be the same cell as the photo released on Jan 5, 2020,” wrote Robby Starbuck, a rightwing influencer and Trump supporter. “Anyone else find this extremely troubling?”

Others were more direct. “NO ONE IS BUYING THIS!! Next the DOJ will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed.' This is over the top sickening,” Alex Jones, the rightwing commentator and conspiracy theorist, wrote on social media.

Donald Trump has defended attorney general Pam Bondi amid calls from Maga world for her to go.

In a lengthy social media post, Trump hit out at complaints from critics who have accused Bondi of withholding more information about Jeffrey Epstein's sudden death and his so-called client list.

“LET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB,” Trump wrote in all caps, encouraging his supporters to “not waste time and energy” on Epstein.

Bondi suggested to Fox News in February that Epstein's client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”. She had also repeatedly pledged to reveal potentially damaging evidence including “a lot of names” and “a lot of flight logs” relating to Epstein.

But the justice department last week released a memo concluding there was no evidence suggesting the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender kept a “client list” to blackmail high-profile figures. It also found no evidence to suggest foul play in Epstein's death, which had previously been ruled a suicide.

Bondi sought to clarify her remarks in the White House on Tuesday, telling reporters that she had been commenting on the entire Epstein “file” and other files.

Tucker Carlson has told NBC News this morning that he now believes the justice department doesn't actually have “much relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein's sex crimes”. “Rather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn't back up, and this current outrage is the result,” Carlson said.

Over the weekend, FBI director Kash Patel denied swirling resignation rumors over reported unhappiness at the justice department decision to close the book on Jeffrey Epstein after administration officials teased a big reveal earlier in the year.

In a Saturday social media post, the agency director said in a social media post at the weekend: “the conspiracy theories just aren't true, never have been. It's an honor to serve the President of the United States – and I'll continue to do so for as long as he calls on me.”

Over the past week, Maga hardliners, including Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, former White House adviser Steve Bannon and – reportedly – FBI deputy director Dan Bongino, have been strongly critical of a joint decision by US attorney general Pam Bondi and the FBI to not release further information about Epstein held in government files, including a so-called client list.

And on Friday, NBC News reported that Bongino was considering stepping down from his post at the FBI after a “heated confrontation” with Bondi over the issue. CBS News heard that he then didn't show up to work that day.

“Bongino is out-of-control furious,” the person who has spoken with the deputy FBI director said. “This destroyed his career. He's threatening to quit and torch Pam unless she's fired.”

Trump last night played down the resignation rumors, saying he had spoken to Bongino who sounded “terrific”.

But Maga influencer and far-right activist Laura Loomer had this prediction for Politico: “I don't see how there can be a situation where Bongino can coexist with Blondi [Loomer's derisive moniker for Bondi] as attorney general, and so I wouldn't be surprised if we see a resignation from Bongino. Perhaps I'm wrong, but it would not shock me if Bongino resigns in the next week.”

The Democrats are on it too. Later today in the House, representative Marc Veasey is introducing legislation calling for the release of the Epstein files.

Veasey told Politico:

I think [Trump's] trying to protect some billionaire friend of his. That's what he lives for more than anything else in the world: protecting billionaires. Look at what he did with the so-called ‘big, beautiful bill'.

A vote would not only be uncomfortable for House Republicans – it would also keep the story in the news when the president would prefer it to disappear. Trump will probably try to latch on to some other story to try to change the narrative today, so we'll be looking out for that.

Politico also notes that “the growing number of Democrats making similar efforts on the Epstein files spans a wide breadth of the party's membership, from New York representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to Georgia senator Jon Ossoff; from relative backbenchers to members of the Senate leadership, like Hawaii senator Brian Schatz.”

“The influence of climate change has [temperatures] up by several degrees,” the study's lead author said.

Human-caused climate change was responsible for around 1,500 deaths during this year's atypical heat wave across Europe, a newly published rapid study of mortality data suggests.

The study, conducted by scientists at Imperial College of London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, examined 2,300 heat-related deaths across 12 European cities during the heat wave from June 23 to July 2. About two-thirds of those deaths — approximately 1,500 — were directly attributable to additional warming caused by the climate crisis, scientists said.

Those deaths only happened “because of climate change,” said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College. “They would not have died if it would not have been for our burning of oil, coal and gas in the last century.”

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Temperatures across those 12 cities were 2 to 4 degrees Celsius above what would have naturally occurred if not for human-caused climate change, the scientists discovered. 

Certain groups of people, particularly the elderly, were more affected by the rise in heat levels than others — indeed, 1,100 of those 1,500 deaths involved people who were 75 years of age or older.

“The influence of climate change has [temperatures] up by several degrees and what that does is it brings certain groups of people more into dangerous territory. … For some people it's still warm fine weather but for now a huge sector of the population it's more dangerous,” said lead author of the study Ben Clarke of Imperial College.

The climate crisis also likely contributed to higher rates of wildfires seen across Europe. More than 200,000 hectares of land have burned across European Union member states since the start of the year, more than twice the average that has burned annually from 2006 to 2024. Around 1,118 wildfires have been detected across the EU, too — a 56 percent increase from last year. 

While wildfires can be natural phenomena, scientists around the globe largely agree that the drying conditions leading to an increase in wildfires are caused by the climate crisis.

“The evidence connecting the climate crisis and extreme wildfires is clear. Increased global temperatures and reduced moisture lead to drier conditions and extended fire seasons,” an article from The Nature Conservancy published earlier this year explains. “Prolonged heatwaves can take what was once a natural event in the fire-cycle process and supercharge it into a maelstrom that devastates entire communities. And, crucially, worsening wildfires mean larger amounts of stored carbon are released into the atmosphere, further worsening climate change.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Ehud Olmert says plan would be ethnic cleansing, and anger at Israel over Gaza war is not all down to antisemitism. Plus, why are numbers of first-time US homebuyers at a generational low?

Good morning.

The “humanitarian city” Israel's defence minister has proposed building on the ruins of Rafah would be a concentration camp, and forcing Palestinians inside would be ethnic cleansing, Israel's former prime minister Ehud Olmert has told the Guardian.

Israel was already committing war crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, Olmert said, and construction of the camp would mark an escalation.

“It is a concentration camp. I am sorry,” he said, when asked about the plans laid out by Israel Katz last week. Once inside, Palestinians would not be allowed to leave, except to go to other countries, Katz said.

What did Olmert say about the rise of anti-Israel sentiment? “In the United States there is more and more and more expanding expressions of hatred to Israel. We make a discount to ourselves saying: ‘They are antisemites.' I don't think that they are only antisemites, I think many of them are anti-Israel because of what they watch on television, what they watch on social networks. This is a painful but normal reaction of people who say: ‘Hey, you guys have crossed every possible line.'”

It's been nearly a month since immigration raids in LA and the surrounding region sparked massive protests. But as the weeks wear on and the demonstrations die down, the Trump administration's enforcement operations show no sign of slowing.

Lawyers and advocates say that those arrested, including some US citizens, have been targeted for arrest at random – and likely because of how they look.

In a legal complaint, legal aid and immigrant rights groups have accused the Department of Homeland Security of engaging “in an extraordinary campaign of targeting people based on nothing more than the color of their skin, and in some cases, where they live or work.”

Have there been any legal developments to disrupt the raids? Yes. On Friday, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order against the government's aggressive immigration sweeps, barring federal agents from stopping people in the district unless there was “reasonable suspicion” that a person was violating immigration law.

EU ministers are meeting on Monday for urgent talks after the US president, Donald Trump, threatened to impose 30% tariffs on the bloc – despite what they believed were promising talks with the US administration on how to avoid them.

The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has called on the EU to “defend European interests resolutely.” It came as the EU moved to de-escalate tensions after the blunt move by Trump on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Trump said he would be making “a major statement” on Russia on Monday, indicating the US would announce a plan to sell Patriot air defence systems and other weapons to Ukraine, amid growing White House exasperation with Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire.

Why else is Trump in the news? He attended the Fifa Club World Cup final at a sold-out MetLife Stadium on Sunday in East Rutherford, New Jersey, but was greeted by widespread boos.

Rosie O'Donnell has shrugged off a threat from Donald Trump to revoke her US citizenship on the grounds that she is “a threat to humanity”. The New York-born comedian said she was the latest in a long list of artists, activists and celebrities to be threatened by the US president.

The historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the monument's North Rim has been destroyed by a fast-moving wildfire, the park said yesterday. The blaze has forced officials to close access to that area for the season.

A century after Irish nuns first began to bury hundreds of infants in what would become a mass, unmarked grave, archaeologists and other specialists will start excavating the site in Tuam, County Galway.

Economic instability is keeping the housing market at a standstill, with the number of new homeowners at its lowest point in three decades. Last year, the average age of a first-time homebuyer was 38 years old, a record high; in the 1980s the average was in the late 20s. How did we get here?

Researchers have found extensive evidence that social media amplifies the loudest and most extreme voices while muting the nuanced and the boringly reasonable. And much of that distortion, it turns out, can be traced back to a handful of hyperactive online voices: just 10% of users produce roughly 97% of political tweets. But there's a way out, say researchers.

The devastating 4 July floods in Texas struck as the climate crisis worsens, and as the Trump administration's hollowing out of federal agencies has left critical services under severe strain. Yet, despite the scale of devastation, there has been little public reckoning over climate breakdown or the erosion of essential public services. Why is the most disaster-prone US state is so allergic to preparing for disasters?

Scientists have detected ripples in space-time from the violent collision of two massive black holes about 10bn light years from Earth. The black holes, each more than 100 times the mass of the sun, began circling each other long ago and finally slammed together.

WASHINGTON, July 14. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump is considering supplying JASSM air-launched cruise missiles to the Ukrainian armed forces, the Military Watch Magazine reported citing an anonymous source.

According to the media outlet, "the missiles would equip the Ukrainian Air Force's growing fleet of F-16 fighters, which although comprised of obsolete Cold War era variants, could serve as effective launch platforms for the missiles while flying deep behind friendly lines."

The JASSM is a weapon with a range of about 370 kilometers. The JASSM-ER modification has a range of 1,000 kilometers.

Earlier, Axios reported that, later on Monday, Trump intends to announce a new plan to arm Ukraine that will include sending offensive weapons to Kiev. Sources told the news portal that the plan will likely "include long-range missiles that could reach targets deep inside Russian territory, including Moscow." However, the sources are unaware of any final decision regarding this.

Previously, at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington, the American leader told reporters that the US will send additional weapons to Ukraine, including Patriot air defense systems paid for by the European Union.

            US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel to the United Kingdom in September for an “unprecedented” second state visit at the invitation of King Charles, which is unlikely to have any public-facing events.
    


            The visit is scheduled for September 17-19, the palace announced Sunday, coinciding with a recess in the House of Commons. That removes the possibility of Trump addressing a joint session of parliament – a prospect that some MPs had urged the Speaker of the House to refuse.
    


            King Charles will host Trump at Windsor Castle, about an hour from central London, the palace said in a statement. The usual venue for state visits, Buckingham Palace, is undergoing significant renovations this year.

            Windsor was also the site of French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit last week, before Macron traveled to London to attend a summit at Downing Street and deliver a speech to parliament.
    


            Typically, second-term US presidents are not invited for a second state visit. In keeping with tradition, former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were offered lunch or tea with the monarch during their second administrations.
    


            But the “unprecedented” offer was extended on the king's behalf by Prime Minister Keir Starmer during his trip to the White House earlier this year, which Trump enthusiastically accepted. A formal invitation was then sent in June, but the two leaders were unable to meet during the summer due to scheduling conflicts.
    


            CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
    


            “His Majesty has known President Trump for many years and looks forward to hosting him and the First Lady later this year,” a palace aide told CNN in June.
    


            More specifics about the state visit will be released in the future, the palace statement said. As with every state visit, it will include a full ceremonial welcome and state banquet. All senior members of the Royal Family are expected to take part.
    


            Trump is also embarking on a private visit to Scotland later this month, where he will meet with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, according to a Downing Street spokesman. Downing Street said the meeting will not be a formal bilateral.
    


            Trump is expected to attend the opening of a new course at his golf resort in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The president owns another golf course – Trump Turnberry – in Ayrshire, Scotland.
    


            During his first formal state visit in 2019, Trump was hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth at Buckingham Palace. But due to security concerns, there was no public procession along The Mall in London, and the president arrived by helicopter.

Politics of carmaker's owner has soured sentiments in Grünheide, south-east of Berlin, where the factory promised jobs and revitalisation

When Elon Musk advised Germans to vote for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) in elections last year, Manu Hoyer – who lives in the small town where the billionaire had built Tesla's European production hub – wrote to the state premier to complain.

“How can you do business with someone who supports rightwing extremism?” she asked Dietmar Woidke, the Social Democrat leader of the eastern state of Brandenburg, who had backed the setting up of the Tesla Giga factory in Grünheide.

Hoyer said that in Woidke's “disappointing, but predictable” answer, he denied the charge. “He said he didn't know him personally. As if that excused him.”

She had co-founded a Citizens' Initiative to oppose Musk's plans, announced in 2019, to build in the sparsely populated municipality in the sandy plains south-east of Berlin. The initiative's fears at the time were largely over the potential environmental impact of the plant on the region's pine forests and groundwater.

However, more recently it is Musk's politics that have caused particular alarm. Not only has he offered his high-profile support to far-right European parties, but at a rally after Donald Trump's inauguration he appeared to twice make the Nazi salute.

In the meantime Tesla sales have slumped, especially in Europe – where new vehicle sales fell for five consecutive months despite an overall growth in the electric car market.

Heiko Baschin, another member of the citizen's initiative, said he had been watching with a certain amount of schadenfreude. “We put our hopes in this,” the carpenter said, discussing the change in the company's fortunes on a recent forest walk in the shadows of the sprawling Grünheide factory.

As sales have declined, the factory has suffered. Shifts manufacturing the Y-Model have been reduced from three to two a day. The trade union IG Metall – which recruited several hundred workers despite opposition from Tesla – has urged the company to consider putting workers on “kurzzeit”, the short-time work allowance much of the embattled car industry has introduced to enable it to retain workers during a downturn.

The regional press has reported how unsold Teslas have been moved on transporters en masse to a former East German airport 60km (37 miles) away, where, hidden behind trees and parked alongside solar panels, they bake in the sun.

Musk's apparent Nazi salute was in general met with shock and horror in Germany but did not play large in Grünheide, until campaign groups projected an image of it on to the facade of the Tesla factory, provocatively placing the Nazi-associated word “heil” in front of the Tesla logo.

The shock caused by the incident was palpable on the factory floor, workers told the tabloid Berliner Kurier. “At Tesla Germany they had pretended they had nothing to do with (Musk) and were keeping quiet,” it wrote. Now they could no longer ignore their association.

Workers are hard to reach, most having been forced to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). But on Kununu, a job portal where employees can anonymously vent their feelings about their workplace, one Tesla worker has written: “The brand once stood for cosmopolitanism, progress, and tolerance, but now it stands for the exact opposite. That bothers almost everyone here, and you can feel it”.

Almut, a resident of Grünheide, said local politicians were keen to cite the benefits Tesla had brought to the region, but “neglect to mention at the same time the problematic reality that we are subsidising the richest man in the world, who in no way takes any social responsibility for what happens here”.

She said local people joke among themselves about what might take the place of the factory, should Tesla fail. “A munitions factory? A prison? In some ways these would seem like favourable alternatives,” she said. The only positive contribution as she saw it that Tesla had contributed to Grünheide was a robotic lawn mower it had donated to the local football club.

Two weeks before the salute, Musk had followed his endorsement of the AfD in the German federal elections with an hour-long conversation with the anti-immigrant party's co-leader, Alice Weidel. The two discussed topics including Hitler, solar power and German bureaucracy, which Musk said had required Tesla to submit forms running to 25,000 pages in order to build the Grünheide factory. Unmentioned was the fact that the AfD had vehemently opposed the Tesla factory, citing its fears over US-driven turbo capitalism and a watering down of workers' rights. “People really need to get behind the AfD,” Musk said.

For Grünheide's residents who oppose Musk, their preoccupation remains the impact of the factory on their rural community, which is characterised by its woodlands, lakes and rivers.

Existing cycle paths have been diverted, and new roads have required the felling of large swathes of pine forest, threatening the already perilous supplies of drinking water in a region declared a drought zone, the driest anywhere in Germany.

The 300-hectare (740 acre) large factory complex itself is due to be expanded in the near future by a further 100 hectares, under plans signed off by Grünheide's mayor despite a local referendum in which 62% expressed their opposition.

Supporters point to the 11,000 jobs the factory has created, and the boost it has given to the local economy in a region of the former communist east and which was one of the lowest-performing in the country. Some young people enthuse that the trains to Berlin now run more regularly, the supermarkets are better stocked, and that their home town is now on the map as a beacon of “green capitalism” alongside Shanghai, Nevada and Austin, locations of the other Tesla factories. They hanker for an invitation to the “rave cave” techno dance space Musk has allegedly constructed within the factory complex.

The recruitment page of the factory's website – which emphasises that diversity is at the core of its business model – shows a lengthy list of positions needing to be filled, from shift managers to maintenance technicians.

Nevertheless, the mood has cooled even among those who used to enthusiastically speak out in favour of Tesla, such as a group of local teenage schoolboys who habitually flew drones over the site when the factory was under construction and proudly posted the footage from them on YouTube – until Musk asked them to stop. “Nobody is willing to speak publicly about Tesla/Elon any more … even anonymously,” one told the Guardian via text message, without elaborating.

There was no response to a request for an interview with the company or for access to the factory.

Arne Christiani, the mayor of Grünheide and an unwavering Musk enthusiast, said he was confident Tesla would stay in Grünheide and would thrive. He was unmoved, he said, by what Musk said or did. “You have to distinguish between what happens in the US and here in Grünheide,” he said.

Hoyer, who lives 9km from the factory, said she had not relinquished her dream of one day being able to see a starry sky from her garden again. “Since the factory was built the light pollution from the round-the-clock operation has put paid to that,” she said, showing before and after pictures on her mobile phone.

 This article was amended on 14 July 2025. Grünheide is south-east, not south-west, of Berlin.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has named First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko as the next prime minister of Ukraine, he said on July 14, launching a government reshuffle.

"I have proposed that Yuliia Svyrydenko lead the Government of Ukraine and significantly renew its work," Zelensky said in a post on X. "I look forward to the presentation of the new government's action plan in the near future."

Zelensky said he had met with Svyrydenko earlier in the day to discuss cooperation with the U.S. and Europe, strengthening the economy, boosting arms production, and reforming the executive branch.

According to Ukraine's constitution, the parliament appoints the government. 

For Svyrydenko to become the next head of government, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal must formally submit his resignation to parliament, which is then obligated to vote on the issue.

If the parliament supports Shmyhal's resignation, the government resigns, and lawmakers have 30 days to vote on the next prime minister.

Svyrydenko said she would soon present the list of proposed ministers.

The parliament's next session is to begin this week. Zelensky's Servant of the People party controls the majority of seats, at least 231 out of 450, and is expected to support the president's decision swiftly.

Rumors about replacing Shmyhal — the country's longest serving prime minister — have circulated since last summer. Although Zelensky replaced several officials in September 2024, Shmyhal remained in office.

When asked when certain weapons, including missiles to Patriot air defense systems, were expected to arrive in Ukraine, Trump responded by saying "a full complement with the batteries... We're going to have some come very soon, within days."

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is being considered for the role of Ukraine's Defense Minister as part of an anticipated government reshuffle, two sources close to the Defense Ministry told the Kyiv Independent on July 14.

The Kyiv Independent asked teens in Ukraine aged between 14 and 17 about their experiences during Russia's war.

"We're gonna be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs that are about 100%, we call them secondary tariffs," Donald Trump said in a joint press conference in the White House alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

"From the EU perspective, the talks are about more than three Patriot systems for Ukraine," a German government spokesperson said.

Russian troops launched drone attacks on Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts on July 14, killing one person and injuring at least 21, local authorities reported.





"I have proposed that Yuliia Svyrydenko lead the Government of Ukraine and significantly renew its work," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"We discussed the path to peace and what we can practically do together to bring it closer," President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote.

"The Baltic region is tense due to the aggressive policies of European coastal states," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

The aircraft had three crew members and two technicians on board, Russian pro-government media outlet Kommersant reported.

"Constructive dialogue between Russia and the U.S. will always achieve more than the tired, destructive language of pressure," Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote. 

The deployment took place in Sumy Oblast, a northeastern region bordering Russia that has recently faced renewed Moscow's attempts to advance.

MOSCOW, July 14. /TASS/. Russia is ready to hold another round of talks with Ukraine, but Ukraine is clearly not in a hurry to do so, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted.

"Kiev is clearly taking its time. We still await proposals concerning the timelines. The Russian side is willing to continue and hold a third round [of talks]," he said.

The second round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was held in Istanbul on June 2. The meeting lasted just over an hour, and the delegations communicated in Russian. The sides exchanged documents showing their vision of various aspects of resolving the conflict. Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, Russia's chief negotiator, said that Moscow had submitted a two-part memorandum to Kiev. Russia and Ukraine also agreed to carry out an "all for all" exchange of seriously ill prisoners of war and those under 25 years.

Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, called for "constructive dialogue" between Washington and Moscow on July 13, amid rising tensions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. 

Dmitriev's remarks come as Trump appears to reassess his Ukraine policy following a surge in Russian attacks and Moscow's continued rejection of a ceasefire.

"Constructive dialogue between Russia and the U.S. will always achieve more than the tired, destructive language of pressure," Dmitriev wrote on X. 

"Only cooperation brings real peace, stability, and global security. (former President Joe) Biden's mistakes and deception will be corrected — the world deserves better."

The U.S. president recently pledged to send more Patriot air-defense systems to Kyiv. If approved, this transfer would be his first military package to Ukraine not initiated by the previous Biden administration.

Trump had previously resisted new military appropriations for Ukraine, instead focusing on persuading Putin to negotiate. But repeated Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities and the Kremlin's stated intent to escalate its offensive appear to have forced a shift. 

Axios reported on July 14 that Putin told Trump during a July 3 phone call that Russia plans to intensify operations in eastern Ukraine over the next 60 days.

The Trump administration is expected to announce a new weapons plan that could include long-range missiles and other offensive systems. Senator Lindsey Graham told Axios that Trump is "really pissed at Putin" and promised a "very aggressive" statement.

Kyiv-born Dmitriev was previously appointed by Putin as a special envoy for economic affairs, tasked with facilitating dialogue with the Trump administration.

His call for dialogue follows months of failed efforts by Trump to broker peace through backchannel talks and two rounds of direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine in May and June, which produced only limited prisoner exchanges.

When asked when certain weapons, including missiles to Patriot air defense systems, were expected to arrive in Ukraine, Trump responded by saying "a full complement with the batteries... We're going to have some come very soon, within days."

Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal is being considered for the role of Ukraine's Defense Minister as part of an anticipated government reshuffle, two sources close to the Defense Ministry told the Kyiv Independent on July 14.

"We're gonna be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days. Tariffs that are about 100%, we call them secondary tariffs," Donald Trump said in a joint press conference in the White House alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

"From the EU perspective, the talks are about more than three Patriot systems for Ukraine," a German government spokesperson said.

Russian troops launched drone attacks on Kharkiv and Sumy oblasts on July 14, killing one person and injuring at least 21, local authorities reported.





"I have proposed that Yuliia Svyrydenko lead the Government of Ukraine and significantly renew its work," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.

"We discussed the path to peace and what we can practically do together to bring it closer," President Volodymyr Zelensky wrote.

"The Baltic region is tense due to the aggressive policies of European coastal states," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said.

The aircraft had three crew members and two technicians on board, Russian pro-government media outlet Kommersant reported.

"Constructive dialogue between Russia and the U.S. will always achieve more than the tired, destructive language of pressure," Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, wrote. 

The deployment took place in Sumy Oblast, a northeastern region bordering Russia that has recently faced renewed Moscow's attempts to advance.

The Senate this week is set to consider a $9.4 billion rescissions package that would codify cuts identified by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)—including cuts to National Public Radio (NPR), the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and foreign spending.

President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) can spare no more than three defections to pass the cuts. But with time running out, several Senate Republicans have expressed skepticism about the proposed cuts.

No Canadian licence plates were visible on Main Street in Presque Isle, Maine on a recent Saturday, as the region's leaders seek to persuade Canadians to return. Photographed July 5, 2025.Nathan VanderKlippe/The Globe and Mail

New signs greet Canadians still crossing the border into northeastern Maine with a cheery bilingual message of “Bienvenue à nos amis canadiens!” Officials have taken care to ensure the Maple Leaf is still fluttering, and that frayed flags are replaced. The airport in Presque Isle has urged its employees to be delicate in conversation with Canadian travellers who may not want to hear American views on trade and tariffs.

No joking about the 51st state, local tourism authorities have urged. No chatting even amongst staff about how nice it would be to get to Canadian Tire without a passport, lest a Canadian customer overhear.

Any of that at this moment is in “especially poor taste and we can treat the topic like talking about politics between staff and customers – we just don't do it,” said Jacob Pelkey, the Aroostook County tourism developer with the Northern Maine Development Commission.

The county, which stretches around the northeastern corner of Maine and is home to nearly half of the state's points of entry with Canada, is hoping it can find a new language to reassure Canadian neighbours — some of them family relations and fellow church members, others long-time customers — and keep them coming to the U.S.

For months, rhetoric from the White House has kept large numbers of those travellers away (then-prime-minister Justin Trudeau, too, specifically urged Canadians not to vacation in Maine). Local businesses that depended on customers from neighbouring New Brunswick have seen sales fall by a quarter, with April and May land crossings into Maine down nearly a third from last year. Canadian students at a local university switched to online courses rather than risk intense border scrutiny. 

Opinion: I'm staying in Canada. But I feel for the people trying to lure us back to the U.S.

The quest to find a more welcoming vocabulary has, however, thrust this part of Maine into a confrontation with the limitations of language. 

What turn of phrase, after all, can soothe the economic pain of businesses struggling to cope with punishing new tariffs or, at the very least, dramatic new uncertainty? What can anyone in Maine say that will prove more convincing than the latest social-media post from the U.S. President? Can anyone find a way to speak louder than Donald Trump?

It's worth trying, Mr. Pelkey said: “It is always good to talk out loud, and that makes it easier to work together.”

Finding the right words, however, has not proven easy. 

“Other than, 'I'm sorry' — I don't know what else to say,” said county administrator Ryan Pelletier. “We're kind of paralyzed by what's happening.”

“I could beg. That's about it. 'Please,' I guess,” said Joe Marino, the meat manager of Andy's IGA in Houlton, Me., a family-owned grocery store that once counted on Canadians for 30 per cent of its business. Today, that has shrunk to 7 or 8 per cent, he says. 

“The state of Maine should be scratching and clawing to try and get as many Canadians across the border as they can,” Mr. Marino said. 

Yet he struggles to think how that can be done. Not only have tensions with the U.S. kept some from Canada away, but the exchange rate has made cross-border shopping less attractive, while countertariffs have made it potentially costly for Canadians to bring goods back home.

Any future improvement in fortunes will, Mr. Marino believes, “boil down to money — is it worth your while to deal with the border crossing?”

As a state, Maine has sought to ensure it is, at the very least, not making the situation worse. Last month, Democratic Governor Janet Mills travelled to New Brunswick to tout a “centuries-old friendship” that, she said, “remains strong.” While in the province, she heard from Canadians, including a board member for Saint John Pride, that many no longer feel safe in the U.S. 

Some in Maine have decided it's best to say nothing at all. 

“I don't want my employees engaging with my Canadian customers about some of the negativity or the rhetoric around, say, the North American free-trade agreement,” said Scott Wardwell, director of Presque Isle International Airport. 

“I mean, this whole thing isn't going to be decided between an airport employee and a passenger flying out. It just isn't. So there really isn't any value in entering into that debate.”

The Presque Isle airport has been an important nexus for Canadians. Stephen Harper touched down here in 2007 when he arrived to attend a pond hockey tournament in nearby Plaster Rock, N.B. The airport's aviation fuel comes from the Irving refinery in Saint John. Corporate jets for Irving and McCain use its facilities. 

Opinion: My family's 40-year tradition of travelling to the U.S. for baseball games pauses in the Trump era

“You can just imagine if I have an employee start yakking about the 51st state or, ‘We don't really need Canadians' and so on — that's not going to send the right message to my customers,” Mr. Wardwell said.

So far, that strategy seems to have proven effective. The airport tracks licence plates in its overnight parking facilities and the percentage of Canadians vehicles has remained constant, at roughly 40 per cent. Many, however, come not to stay in the U.S. but to board a JetBlue flight through Boston to the Caribbean. 

Outside of the airport, the decline in Canadian traffic is noticeable. On a recent Saturday afternoon in Presque Isle, only one out-of-state plate was visible on Main Street. It was from Montana.

Nearly 100 kilometres up the border, Canadian traffic is down by 40 per cent at Bob's Service Center, which looks out on the bridge crossing the Saint John River into Madawaska, Me. 

Tim Lausier, who co-owns the gas station and corner store with his sister, has deep personal connections with Canada, where he was born and still regularly attends hockey games. 

In the past few months, though, travel to New Brunswick has meant getting an earful. Employees of one plastic manufacturer stopped coming to his service centre after tariffs hit their business. 

Mr. Lausier doubts he will ever see all of his previous customers again, and he wonders what good any words on a sign can do at a time like this.

 “They're not coming,” he said. “They're not going to see those signs.”

            Several children were killed in an Israeli airstrike at a water distribution point in central Gaza Sunday, health officials said, one of several deadly incidents in the territory that come as ceasefire talks in Doha falter.
    


            Hopes had been high for the latest negotiations but after days of negotiations the two sides accused each other of blocking an agreement while on the ground there has been no let-up in Israel's military campaign, which resumed when the last ceasefire collapsed in March.
    


            The Palestinian health ministry reported Sunday that 139 bodies had been brought to Gaza hospitals in the past 24 hours, with a number of victims still under the rubble. The number is the highest reported since July 2 and brings the total number of people killed since October 7, 2023 to 58,026, according to the ministry.
    


            That was before the Israeli airstrike Sunday killed six children and four others at a water distribution point in central Gaza, according to Al-Awda Hospital. Video from the chaotic scene showed multiple casualties including children amid buckets and water carriers.
    


            The Israeli military acknowledged that an airstrike targeting an “Islamic Jihad terrorist” had gone wrong and the “munition fell dozens of meters from the target,” saying the incident was under review.
    


            Also in central Gaza on Sunday, at least 12 people were killed and more than 40 injured when an Israeli airstrike targeted a crowded junction, according to Dr. Mohammed Abu Salmiya, Director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex central Gaza City. The dead included a prominent doctor, Ahmad Qandeel, described by the health ministry as “one of Gaza's most respected medical professionals.”
    


            “Conditions on the ground are worse than they've ever been,” the acting director of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), Sam Rose, told CNN on Monday. “There's a certain tragic and horrific and numbing inevitability about this that the longer it goes on, the worse it will get.”
    


            He said Palestinians in Gaza are forced to make “impossible choices” between starvation or risking death to secure aid.
    


            Sunday's heavy toll followed several deadly incidents Saturday. The ministry said 27 were killed and many more injured when Israeli troops opened fire on people trying to obtain aid from a distribution site near southern Rafah run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).
    


            GHF denied the claim, saying “there were no incidents at or in the immediate vicinity of our sites” on Saturday.
    


            The Israeli military also denied that anyone was injured by gunfire from its troops in the vicinity of the site but said it continued to review the reports. It told CNN Sunday it had no further comment.
    


            However, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said its field hospital near the site had received 132 patients suffering from weapon-related injuries. Twenty-five were declared dead on arrival and six more died after being admitted – the largest number of fatalities since the hospital began operations in May 2024, according to the ICRC.
    


            “This situation is unacceptable. The alarming frequency and scale of these mass casualty incidents underscore the horrific conditions civilians in Gaza are enduring,” the ICRC added.
    


            Nearly 800 Palestinians were killed while trying to access aid in Gaza between late May and July 7, according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), when the GHF began operating.
    


            Elsewhere in Gaza, 13 people were killed Saturday in airstrikes in Al-Shati refugee camp near Gaza City, in the north of the territory, according to Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of Al-Shifa Hospital. Salmiya told CNN that 40 injured people had been admitted. Geolocated video showed at least one child among the victims.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces said Sunday it had destroyed weapons and tunnels used by Hamas in northern Gaza and the air force had carried out attacks on more than 150 targets across the Gaza Strip, including “booby-trapped buildings, weapons depots, anti-tank missile and sniper positions.”
    


            The spike in casualties in Gaza comes as talks on agreeing a new ceasefire deal and hostage continue in Doha, with optimism having faded that an agreement can be quickly reached.
    


            US President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff said he's meeting with Qatari officials Sunday on the sidelines of the Club World Cup football match in New Jersey as he remains “hopeful” for the prospect of a Gaza ceasefire.
    


            Despite days of proximity talks in Doha between Israel and Hamas, significant gaps remain between the warring parties.
    


            An Israeli source familiar with the matter said last week that the outstanding issue was where  the Israeli military would redeploy in Gaza once the ceasefire takes effect. The latest proposal called for the military to withdraw from parts of northern Gaza on the first day of a ceasefire and from parts of southern Gaza on the seventh day.
    


            The detailed maps were left to negotiations between Israel and Hamas, and that appears to be the main sticking point.
    


            The talks had “stalled,” a senior Hamas official told CNN on Saturday, claiming Israel had added new conditions, “the latest being new deployment maps for the Israeli army's presence in the Gaza Strip.”
    


            In a video message released Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel accepted the latest ceasefire plan presented by the US special envoy Steve Witkoff – but that Hamas had rejected it.
    


            “We accepted the deal, the Witkoff Deal, and even later the version that the mediators proposed to us — we accepted that too. Hamas rejected it,” Netanyahu said.

            Netanyahu said Hamas wants to stay in Gaza “so it can rearm and attack us again and again.”
    


            He said he was determined to bring the hostages back and to defeat Hamas.
    


            “What we need to do is the right thing: insist on the release of the hostages and insist on the second objective of the war in Gaza — the elimination of Hamas and ensuring that Gaza will never again be a threat to Israel.”
    


            “I won't compromise on these missions,” Netanyahu added.
    


            Israel's Hostages and Missing Families Forum issued a statement Sunday, accusing Netanyahu of creating a “false impression” that a comprehensive deal is unattainable, contrary to public will.
    


            “Anyone who sabotages such an agreement is willfully acting against the Israeli people for political survival,” they warned, adding, “That is how history will remember him.”
    


            Recent opinion surveys in Israel suggest overwhelming approval for a deal that would end the war and return all the hostages, living and dead. A poll for Israel's Channel 12 Friday said that 74% of the public believes that Israel should end the war in Gaza in exchange for the return of all the abductees in one step, with only 8% supporting the phased deal that the government is trying to promote.

MOSCOW, July 14. /TASS/. Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) reported apprehending a 24-year-old female citizen of Russia and Ukraine who was recruited by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) to blow up the car of a Russian Defense Ministry officer ahead of Victory Day.

"The Federal Security Service thwarted a terrorist attack against a senior officer of the Russian Defense Ministry plotted by the SBU in the Republic of Crimea," the FSB said.

"On instructions from the SBU, a female citizen of Russia and Ukraine, born in 2000, was supposed to blow up a Russian officer in his personal car by using an explosive device, transferred to her, before Victory Day in May 2025," the FSB specified.

According to it, SBU employees who recruited the attacker and trained her to commit a crime have been identified. The suspected attacker has been detained, and components of a Western-made explosive device have been confiscated from her. Criminal charges of committing a terrorist act and high treason are pending against the detainee.

President Donald Trump said he spoke to FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino on July 13, indicating that the two remain close despite reported friction over the release of the Jeffrey Epstein documents.

“I spoke to him today. Dan Bongino is a very good guy. I've known him a long time,” Trump told reporters outside Air Force 1. “He's in good shape.”

The attorney general spoke about the DOJ's efforts to protect religious freedom rights during a hearing and indicated to lawmakers that she was focused on a range of religions, from Judaism to Islam.

The Sunshine State ranks as the nation's number one defender of religious liberty out of all 50 states, according to the First Liberty Institute's fourth annual Religious Liberty in the States (RLS) index. 

For the first time, Florida tops the national rankings, followed by Montana, Illinois, Ohio and Mississippi. Illinois and Mississippi have garnered a spot in the top five every year since the index was first released by the First Liberty Institute's Center for Religion, Culture & Democracy (CRCD) in 2022.

The index uses a detailed scoring system measuring legal protections and ranking states based on the percentage of possible safeguards they have adopted. 

This year, with 2025's rankings, nearly 55 percentage points separates Florida from the last-place state, West Virginia, which has been last on the index for three years in a row.

"We find that the states are laboratories of religious liberty where different protections for free exercise can be implemented and tested," CRCD Executive Director Jordan Ballor wrote in an introduction for the 2025 index. "One of the major goals of the RLS project is to raise awareness of what different states are doing. There are positive lessons to be learned from this experimentation, as states that have been at the vanguard of protecting religious liberty can serve as exemplars for states that have lagged behind."

The index's accompanying report points out that Florida "is an exemplar" for how state lawmakers can improve their protections around religious freedom. According to the report, the Sunshine State has improved nearly 20 percentage points since the first RLS index was released in 2022.

Much of this improvement came from legislation passed in 2023 strengthening religious protections that allow healthcare providers to refuse to participate in medical procedures or services, such as abortion or sterilization, based on their religious or moral beliefs. The report also pointed to Florida's passage of legislation in 2022 protecting houses of worship from discriminatory treatment during pandemics and other emergencies.

"Florida holds several #1 rankings, leading the nation in education, economy, and tourism – and now, Florida is #1 in religious liberty," said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. "We're grateful for this recognition from the First Liberty Institute, which has just named Florida the number one state in the nation for protecting religious liberty."

"This year's findings show clearly that states taking legislative action are pulling ahead," added Kelly Shackelford, president, CEO and chief counsel at First Liberty. "Under the leadership of Gov. DeSantis, Florida passed real laws that protect real people, and now the Sunshine State is the national leader in protecting religious liberty. It's time for more states to follow Gov. DeSantis's example and adopt strong religious liberty laws."

While Florida was pointed to in the RLS index as an "exemplar," the report stated that religious freedom was becoming increasingly "tenuous" in the blue state of Illinois. The move downward for the Land of Lincoln was not because the state repealed protections, but mainly because it has not implemented new protections that other states, like Florida, have, the report noted.

Per the 2025 RLS report, almost all of Illinois' protections came when the state was more conservative between 1934 and 1998.

In an effort to demonstrate the dangers of "complacency," the report also pointed to Colorado when Republicans "routinely" had control of both houses of the state legislature. The environment was friendly toward religious liberty, but lawmakers did not pass much in the way of protections, according to the report. It said the state's complacency contributed to Colorado's "abysmal" 43rd-place finish in the 2024 RLS rankings and 34th finish in the 2025 rankings released Monday.    

The First Liberty Institute said the results of the 2024 election may give some people the idea that passing laws protecting religious liberty is not as important, but the conservative Christian legal group warned this is "emphatically not the case," noting that data shows passing such laws is just as critical amid a "favorable" political climate.

You might need to lie down for a bit after “Eddington.” Preferably in a dark room with no screens and no talking. “Eddington,” Ari Aster's latest nightmare vision, is sure to divide (along which lines, I'm can't fathom) but there is one thing I think everyone will be able to agree on: It is an experience that will leave you asking “WHAT?” The movie opens on the aggravated ramblings of an unhoused man and doesn't get much more coherent from there. Approach with caution.

We talk a lot about movies as an escape from the stresses of the world. “Eddington,” in which a small, fictional town in New Mexico becomes a microcosm of life in the misinformation age, and more specifically during the pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests, is very much the opposite of that. It is an anti-escapist symphony of masking debates, conspiracy theories, YouTube prophets, TikTok trends and third-rail topics in which no side is spared. Most everyone looks insane and ridiculous by the end, from the white teenage girl (Amélie Hoeferle) telling a Black cop (Michael Ward) to join the movement, to the grammatical errors of the truthers, as the town spirals into chaos and gruesome violence.

Joaquin Phoenix plays the town sheriff, a soft-spoken wife guy named Joe Cross, who we meet out in the desert one night watching YouTube videos about how to convince your wife to have a baby. He's interrupted by cops from the neighboring town, who demand he put on a mask since he's technically crossed the border.

It is May 2020, and everyone is a little on edge. Joe, frustrated by the hysterical commitment to mandates from nowhere, finds himself the unofficial spokesperson for the right to go unmasked. He pits himself against the slick local mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), who is up for reelection, in the pocket of big tech and ready to exploit his single fatherhood for political gain. At home, Joe's mother-in-law Dawn (Deirdre O'Connell) spends all day consuming internet conspiracy theories, while his wife Louise (a criminally underused Emma Stone) works on crafts and nurses unspoken traumas.




Joe's eagerness to take on Ted isn't just about masking. Years ago, Ted dated his now-wife, a story that will be twisted into rape and grooming accusations. Caricatures and stereotypes are everywhere in “Eddington,” but in this world it feels like the women are especially underwritten — they are kooks, victims, zealots and the ones who push fragile men to the brink. But in “Eddington,” all the conspiracies are real and ordinary people are all susceptible to the madness. In fact, insanity is just an inevitability no matter how well-intentioned one starts out, whether that's the woke-curious teen rattled by rejection, or the loyal deputy Guy (Luke Grimes) who is suddenly more than happy to accuse a colleague of murder. Louise will also be swayed by a floppy-haired internet guru, a cult-like leader played with perfect swagger by Austin Butler.

The problem with an anarchic satire like “Eddington,” in theaters Friday, is that any criticism could easily be dismissed with a “that's the point” counterargument. And yet there is very little to be learned in this silo of provocations that, like all Aster movies, escalates until the movie is over. There are moments of humor and wit, too, as well as expertly built tension and release. “Eddington” is not incompetently done or unwatchable (the cast and the director kind of guarantee that); it just doesn't feel a whole of anything other than a cinematic expression of broken brains.

Five years after we just went through (at least a lot of) this, “Eddington” somehow seems both too late and too soon, especially when it offers so little wisdom or insight beyond a vision of hopelessness. I wonder what world Aster thought he'd be releasing this film into. Maybe one that was better, not cosmically worse. 

It's possible “Eddington” will age well. Perhaps it's the kind of movie that future Gen Alpha cinephiles will point to as being ahead of its time, a work that was woefully misunderstood by head-in-the-sand critics who didn't see that it was 2025's answer to the prescient paranoia cinema of the 1970s.

Not to sound like the studio boss in “Sullivan's Travels,” trying to get the filmmaker with big issues on the mind to make a dumb comedy, but right now, “Eddington” feels like the last thing any of us need. 

“Eddington,” an A24 release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “for strong violence, some grisly images, language and graphic nudity.” Running time: 148 minutes. Two stars out of four.

NEW YORK (AP) — Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he will campaign for mayor of New York City as an independent candidate, staying in a crowded field running against surging left-wing Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani.

In a video, Cuomo, who last month suffered a bruising loss to Mamdani in the Democratic primary, announced he was making another run to combat the progressive Mamdani, who he said “offers slick slogans but no real solutions.”

“The fight to save our city isn't over,” Cuomo said. “Only 13 percent of New Yorkers voted in the June primary. The general election is in November and I am in it to win it.”

Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams also is running as an independent in the general election and Curtis Sliwa — founder of the 1970s-era Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol — is again on the Republican line.

People opposed to Mamdani's progressive agenda, which includes higher taxes on the wealthy, have called on donors and voters to unite behind a single candidate for the November election. They fear multiple candidates will splinter the anti-Mamdani vote, increasing the Democrat's chances to win.

Mamdani's campaign responded to Cuomo's announcement by saying the ex-governor and mayor are cozying up to “billionaires and Republicans” while the Democratic nominee remains focused on affordability issues.

“That's the choice this November,” campaign spokesperson Jeffrey Lerner said in a statement. 




Cuomo's decision to continue on in the race is the latest chapter in his comeback attempt, launched almost four years after he resigned as governor in 2021 following a barrage of sexual harassment allegations. He denied wrongdoing during the campaign, maintaining that the scandal was driven by politics. 

Cuomo was treated as the presumed frontrunner for much of the Democratic primary, with the former governor boasting deep political experience, universal name recognition and a juggernaut fundraising operation. He limited media interviews, held few unscripted events and avoided mingling with voters. 

That strategy contrasted with Mamdani's energetic street-level campaign centered around affordability issues. The 33-year-old amassed a legion of young volunteers who blanketed the city to build support, while the candidate's savvy social media persona won him national acclaim. 

Lagging behind Mamdani in the vote count, Cuomo conceded the race last month on primary night. Final results released after the city ran through its ranked choice voting calculations showed Mamdani besting the former governor by 12 percentage points. 

Despite the Democratic primary loss, Cuomo had also qualified to run on an independent ballot line in November under a party he created called “Fight and Deliver.” 

As he weighed whether to stay on as an independent, Cuomo began losing support from traditional allies. Key labor unions backed Mamdani and the Rev. Al Sharpton, an influential Black leader, urged Cuomo to step aside. 

Some deep-pocketed contributors have meanwhile aligned behind Adams, who is running as an independent. Although he's still a Democrat, Adams pulled out of the primary shortly after a federal judge dismissed a corruption case against him at the request of President Donald Trump's Justice Department, arguing that the case had sidelined him from campaigning. 

Cuomo, 67, served as governor for over a decade and modeled himself as a socially progressive Democrat who got things done. He pushed through legislation that legalized gay marriage and tackled massive infrastructure projects, like a three-mile bridge over the Hudson River that he named after his father.

Cuomo's national profile peaked in the early days of the nation's coronavirus outbreak during his televised daily briefings. The governor leavened stern warnings for people to wear masks with heartfelt expressions of concern for his elderly mother or brotherly banter with Chris Cuomo, a TV journalist.

His reputation was soon tainted when it emerged that the state's official count of nursing home deaths had excluded many victims who had been transferred to hospitals before they succumbed.

            Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the central bank's inspector general to conduct an additional review of an ongoing $2.5 billion renovation of the institution's headquarters that has drawn fire from President Donald Trump and others, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            Powell made the request “a few weeks ago,” the source said.
    


            The renovation has come up as a new line of attack from Trump, who has railed against Powell for months for not lowering interest rates further. At stake is the Fed's independence, which investors value for the role it plays in shepherding the world's biggest economy.
    


            At his semiannual monetary policy hearing before Congress last month, Powell was grilled by some Senate lawmakers over what they depicted as lavish upgrades to the Fed's headquarters in Washington, DC. Powell said some of those upgrades, such as Italian beehives, are not part of the renovation. Since then, the Fed head has been under fire by top Trump officials, with some accusing him of lying under oath.
    


            During the hearing, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina likened the Fed's renovations to “luxury upgrades that feel more like they belong in the Palace of Versailles.”
    


            Meanwhile, Trump administration officials have continued to pile on to that criticism, ramping up pressure on Powell, who has long resisted the president's calls to lower interest rates.

Trump's increasingly aggressive attacks on Powell aren't what you think



            “The Federal Reserve's Inspector General is considering opening an investigation into the massive cost overruns for their $2.5B+ HQ renovation project,” wrote James Blair, a White House deputy chief of staff, on Monday on X.
    


            Blair is one of three Trump loyalists appointed last week to the National Capital Planning Commission, the federal government's central planning agency for the region, which has an oversight role in the Fed's renovation project.



            The Fed's project was approved by its board in 2017, with construction beginning in 2021. It initially came with a price tag of $1.9 billion in 2019, but that has since ballooned to $2.5 billion. The Fed in an FAQ posted last week said the cost overruns were due to “unforeseen conditions” requiring more spending to rectify, such as “more asbestos than anticipated, toxic contamination in soil, and a higher-than-expected water table.”
    


            Jaret Seiberg, a managing director at TD Cowen, said in commentary issued Monday that “Team Trump is building a case to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for failing to manage the renovation of the central bank's headquarters complex.”
    


            “We still see Powell's firing as unlikely though the risk is growing that pressure from conservative media becomes so great the President feels compelled to act,” he wrote.
    


            By law, the Fed chair can only be fired “for cause,” which is broadly interpreted to mean for malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Fed's handling of its renovation, which administration officials are describing as mismanaged, could be used as one step in a possible pathway for Trump to sack Powell.
    


            Powell has said Fed officials are waiting to see the impact of Trump's tariffs first before lowering rates again. He has said that if it weren't for the tariffs, the Fed would have already lowered rates this year by now.
    


            But that strategy has prompted Trump to relentlessly criticize Powell, hurling at him insults such as “moron” and “numbskull.” Trump has adopted the moniker “Too Late” to refer to Powell, in reference to criticism that the Fed acted too late to respond to inflation's eruption in 2021.
    


            On Monday, Trump continued to disparage the Fed, calling for ultra-low interest rates to reduce the interest costs of the federal government's debt.
    


            ”We should be at 1%,” Trump said at a luncheon event. “We should be less than 1%.”
    


            Trump also told reporters on Sunday that Powell refuses to lower rates “and yet he's spending two and a half billion dollars rebuilding the Federal Reserve building.” (Decisions about rate moves are voted on by a rotating committee of 12 Fed officials, including the chair.)
    


            “So he got this approved, and he started the work during the Biden administration, and he doesn't look like the kind of a guy, frankly, that wants to spend two and a half billion dollars,” he said.
    


            Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council and seen as a front-runner to be Powell's successor, has also slammed the Fed for its renovation project, but he's stopped short of saying the central bank should bend to Trump's will.
    


            “We'll see how the Fed responds to this incredible cost overrun,” Hassett told CNBC. “I think that we've got a real problem of oversight and excess spending.”
    


            “We 100% want independent monetary policy, but it sure looks like they need more congressional oversight on things like the way they build their buildings,” he added.

President Donald Trump criticized Joe Biden over his autopen use after the former president defended himself in a rare media interview amid escalating congressional investigations into his administration.

Trump repeated that Biden's autopen use is “one of the biggest scandals” in “50 to 100 years” because his predecessor “knew nothing about what he was signing.”

“They're going to figure it out, and we'll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday of the congressional inquiries. “It's not supposed to be for signing major legislation.” 

Trump reiterated his claim that Biden aides were “freewheeling” around him, and that they and not the former president were for “open borders” and “transgender for everyone.”

“I think the radical Left people that took — they took over the White House,” he said alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. “If I didn't win, our country was finished.”

Biden, in an interview with the New York Times, his first since he became president in 2021, remained adamant that he “made every decision” when he was in office, but when it came to clemency, he sometimes signed off on criteria rather than individuals.

“I made every single one of those,” he told the news outlet. “And — including the categories, when we set this up to begin with. And so — but I understand why Trump would think that, because obviously, I guess, he doesn't focus much. Anyway, so — yes, I made every decision.”

BIDEN'S STAFF APPROVED MASS LAST-MINUTE PARDONS WITH AUTOPEN

The former president added: “I laid out a strategy how I want to go about these, dealing with pardons and commutations. I was — and I pulled the team in to say this is how I want to get it done, generically and then specifically. And so, you know, that's just — this is how it worked.”

At the same time, Biden did confirm his autopen use, contending it was necessary because “there were a lot” of clemency actions.

“The autopen is, you know, is legal,” he said. “As you know, other presidents used it, including Trump. But the point is that, you know, we're talking about a whole lot of people.”

THE LONG HISTORY AND CONTROVERSY OF PRESIDENTIAL AUTOPEN USE

Biden also scrutinized Trump and Republicans over the investigations, calling them “crazy” and “liars.”

“They know it,” he said. “They've had a pretty good thing going here. They've done so badly. They've lied so consistently about almost everything they're doing. The best thing they can do is try to change the focus and focus on something else. And this is a — I think that's what this is about.”

LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) — NFL Hall of Famer John Elway won't be charged after his business partner Jeffrey Sperbeck was fatally injured falling out of his golf cart at a Southern California golf resort community last April, authorities said. 

Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told KUSA-TV in Denver on Friday that investigators found nothing criminal and ruled it a tragic accident.

Sperbeck, Elway's partner and former agent, died after suffering an injury when he tumbled out of a golf cart driven by the former quarterback on April 26 at The Madison Club in La Quinta, east of Los Angeles. Sperbeck was 62.

Sperbeck's cause of death was “blunt force trauma” and the manner of death was an accident that occurred when the “passenger fell from the golf cart,” the county coroner's report said.

“I've looked at video 100 times and there's no explanation as to why he fell off, he just fell off,'' Bianco said.

Elway didn't immediately comment on the findings. He said in an April statement that he was devastated by the death of his close friend. 

“There are no words to truly express the profound sadness I feel with the sudden loss of someone who has meant so much to me,” Elway said at the time.

Elway's April statement did not address his presence at the scene.

Sperbeck began managing Elway in 1990, when Elway was quarterback for the Denver Broncos. He represented more than 100 NFL players during a three-decade career as an agent and business adviser. 

He was best known as Elway's partner who helped manage the Hall of Famer's extensive off-field business empire, which included restaurants, car dealerships and a winery.

President Donald Trump said Monday he would punish Russia with tariffs if there isn't a deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days. He made the announcement during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

President Donald Trump said Monday he would punish Russia with tariffs if there isn't a deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days, the latest example of his growing anger with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump made the announcement during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

“We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days,” the Republican president said. He said they would be “secondary tariffs,” meaning they would target Russia's trading partners in an effort to isolate Moscow in the global economy.

In addition to the tariff threat, European allies plan to buy military equipment and then transfer it to Ukraine. Rutte said “speed is of the essence here,” and that the agreement should make Putin “reconsider” peace negotiations.

He also touted a recent decision allowing religious leaders to endorse candidates without their organizations losing tax exempt status.

Addressing religious leaders at a White House event, Trump said “you have more power than anybody, but you're not allowed to use your power.”

Russian commentators began to react to Trump's announcement with NATO's Mark Rutte late Monday Moscow time. There has not yet been an official statement from the Kremlin.

“Trump's dream is for war to be a business — to sell weapons to the EU,” Pro-Kremlin military blogger Yuri Kotenok wrote in a post on Telegram.Others made light of Trump's threat of tariffs.

“Oh, how much can change both on the battlefield and with the mood of those leading the U.S. and NATO in 50 days,” said senior lawmaker Konstantin Kosachev.

Trump's remarks quickly turned from religion to the economy. He called Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell “a knucklehead, stupid guy” who is costing the country hundreds of billions of dollars. 

He continued by touting the billions taken in by U.S. tariffs so far.

“I've always made money,” he said. “Now I'm making it for you people.”

The president began his remarks at an event hosted by the White House Faith Office by expressing his support for religion in public life.

“A nation that prays is a nation that prospers,” he said.

President Donald Trump appears to be blaming Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the high cost of housing in the U.S.

Trump on Monday repeated his attacks on Powell for not cutting the Fed's benchmark interest rate, saying that the head of the U.S. central bank has been “terrible” and “doesn't know what the hell he's doing.” Powell has held off on further reductions to the rate controlled by the Fed given Trump's tariffs, saying that Fed officials want to see how the import taxes influence inflation and economic growth.

Trump said the economy was doing well despite Powell's refusal to reduce rates to Trump's liking, but it would be “nice” if there rate cuts “because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.”

The Fed's concern is that rate cuts on the scale discussed by Trump could worsen inflation if, in fact, his tariffs result in higher prices across the U.S. economy. There is also the possibility that tariffs harm economic growth in ways that require rate cuts in order to limit job losses.

Trump is repeating his assertions that his predecessor's use of the autopen is a major scandal.

He was asked for his reaction to Biden's comments to The New York Times that he approved a series of pardons at the end of his term, then directed the use of the autopen to make them official. Trump responded of his predecessor, “"I guarantee he knew nothing about what he was singing.”

Trump added that it was unfortunate that Biden got to use the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office just like he does.

And he noted that, while the use of the autopen is legal, it is “not supposed to be for signing major legislation” and things like presidential pardons.

Trump derided the Gaza Strip as “one of the worst real estate deals ever made” and suggested that its formation involved giving up “oceanfront property.”

The president has for months suggested that Israel could seize control of Gaza amid its war with Hamas there, and then cede it to the U.S.Trump has said repeatedly that U.S. authorities could then transform the area into a Riviera-like resort.

Trump said one of his administration's chief foreign envoys, Steve Witkoff, would be working on Gaza and that there could be something “fairly soon to talk about” on that front.

Trump and Rutte say Germany is going to supply Ukraine with a massive amount of weaponry, including Patriot missile defense systems, as part of the broader initiative by the U.S. and the alliance to shore up Ukrainian defenses.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is due to meet later Monday with Pete Hegseth to discuss the Patriot transfers, which Trump and Rutte said could occur within days.

Trump repeated his frustration that Putin has resisted making a deal with Ukraine to end the war. 

He said his conversations with the Russian president “are always very pleasant,” but “then missiles go off that night.”

Putin “knows what a fair deal is,” Trump said.

Trump seems increasingly sanguine about European nations playing a larger role in opposing Russia's war with Ukraine and spending more to help increase military security on the continent.

Trump says he's pleased with Europe spending more on defense — after many NATO members at a recent summit in The Hague agreed to increase spending to 5% of their GDP — and reiterated his complaints that the U.S. still spends heavily to defend Ukraine.

“The spirit they have is amazing,” Trump said. “Ultimately, having a very strong Europe is a good thing,” Trump said. 

Trump says of a GOP-championed sanctions package against Russia, “I'm not sure we need it.”

The president noted shortly thereafter, however, that some top Republicans in the Senate were working hard on the matter. He added that he didn't want them to “waste their time.”

“It could be very useful, we'll have to see,” Trump said.

The president also talked about how the finished legislative sanctions package could eventually punish Russia with tariffs exceeding 100%. But he said he plans to impose 100% tariffs unilaterally soon if Russia's war in Ukraine isn't concluded.

Trump says the European governments will then transfer the munitions to Ukraine under a new deal to support Kyiv in defending itself against Russia.

Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday with Rutte that those transfers — combined with a threat to impose 100% tariffs on all Russian exports if a peace deal isn't reached within 50 days — should serve as notice to Putin that he's serious about ending the war.

Trump did not provide details but said the weapons would include Patriot missile defense batteries.

Mark Rutte said Europeans will buy weapons from the U.S. to equip Ukraine, and that the armaments and equipment should cause Russian President Vladimir Putin to “reconsider” peace negotiations.

Rutte said Ukraine would get “massive numbers of military equipment” such as missiles, air defense systems and ammunition.

“Speed is of the essence here,” said Rutte. He said Germany, Finland, Canada, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and Denmark would be among the buyers to supply Ukraine.

The president promised “biting” tariffs if the war doesn't end. He described them as secondary tariffs, meaning they would target Russia's trading partners. If implemented, it would be an attempt to isolate Moscow in the global economy.

“We're going to be doing very severe tariffs if we don't have a deal in 50 days,” Trump said during a meeting with NATO's secretary general.

The president suggested such levies could feature 100% tariffs. It wasn't immediately clear what products could be targeted.

Trump's cuts to international programs, tariffs on allies and partners, and unfriendly moves against international students have “deeply” undermined U.S. competitiveness in its rivalry against China, warned the Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a report released today. 

The report calls for action by Congress to rebuild tools to restore the U.S. global reputation and influence so that U.S. won't be unseated by China as the world's leading power.

“America's retreat from the world will have real and lasting consequences for the American people,” it says. “A retreat from the system that we helped build following the Second World War — based on democracy, economic interdependence and American values — means China is increasingly able to set the global agenda at the expense of U.S. interests.”

Data from CoinMarketCap showed Bitcoin climbed above $123,000 early Monday, up from about $108,000 only a week ago. The cryptocurrency is now the fifth most valuable asset class in the world at $2.4 trillion, with a higher market cap than Amazon.

The House is under pressure from Trump and the big-spending crypto lobby to quickly pass legislation including a bill passed last month by the Senate to regulate so-called stablecoins. The House is considering far more sweeping cryptocurrency market structure legislation. 

Trump, once a skeptic, vowed to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. He and his family have moved into mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin.

The S&P 500 was edging down early Monday, still within 0.5% of its all-time high set on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite were holding steady in their first trading after Trump said he plans 30% tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union starting Aug. 1, the same deadline he announced for Japan, South Korea and a dozen other countries.

The latest postponements allow time for more dealmaking to mitigate economic damage. Enacting all his import taxes on U.S. consumers would raise the risk of a recession and raise U.S. debt pressure as big tax cuts add to the deficit.

Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts the Trump administration “will ultimately de-escalate, especially if there is a new bout of heightened bond and stock market volatility.”

As Trump slaps trading partners with tariffs rather than slog through prolonged negotiations, pressures the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and launches a new investigation aimed at reshaping higher education, it's clear that threats are a permanent feature of his presidency. 

He's tightening his grip on independent institutions, with fewer checks on his power. Republicans in Congress fear primary challenges, and the Supreme Court is stocked with his appointees.

Trump's allies believe his aggression is required in a political ecosystem where he's under siege from Democrats, the court system and the media. Critics fear he's eroding the country's democratic foundations with an authoritarian style.

“Pluralism and a diversity of institutions operating with autonomy — companies, the judiciary, nonprofit institutions that are important elements of society — are much of what defines real democracy,” said Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard University. “That is threatened by heavy handed, extortionist approaches.”

They met in Kyiv on Monday as anticipation grew over a possible shift in the Trump administration's policy on the three-year war.

Zelenskyy said he and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg had “a productive conversation” about strengthening Ukrainian air defenses, joint arms production, purchasing U.S. weapons in conjunction with European countries and the possibility of tighter sanctions on the Kremlin.

Trump has increasingly expressed frustration about Russian President Vladimir Putin's unbudging stance on U.S-led peace efforts. “I am very disappointed with President Putin, I thought he was somebody that meant what he said,” Trump said late Sunday. 

“We hope for the leadership of the United States, because it is clear that Moscow will not stop unless its ... ambitions are stopped by force,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.

These children attend after-school and summer programming at a Boys & Girls Club, YMCA or public school for free thanks to funding set Congress set aside for academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families. Many now face closure as the Trump administration withholds more than $6 billion in federal education grants to align with his priorities.

Ninety-one of the 100 school districts receiving the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. 

“I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,” said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican.

Spending bills almost always need some bipartisan buy-in to get 60 votes to avoid a filibuster in the 100-member Senate. This week's effort is different.

Congress set up a process under President Richard Nixon to speedily claw back previously approved spending authority with only a simple Senate majority. It's a rarely employed maneuver. Trump proposed 38 rescissions in 2018, but that package stalled.

“How Republicans answer this question on rescissions and other forthcoming issues will have grave implications for the Congress, the very role of the legislative branch, and, more importantly, our country,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned in a letter to colleagues. 

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said he's disappointed to see Schumer “implicitly threaten to shut down the government.”

The Trump administration is likening this as a test case and says more could come if Congress goes along.

Trump has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting — the full amount it's due to receive during the next two budget years. 

The corporation distributes more than two-thirds of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations. Much of the rest supports national programming through National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System.

The potential fallout has generated concerns among Republicans. Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota says these radio stations “are the only way of really communicating in the very rural areas of our state, and a lot of other states as well.”

In recent testimony, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought criticized a “Sesame Street” town hall on CNN about combating racism.

Senate Republicans will test the popularity of Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts this week by aiming to pass Trump's request to claw back $9.4 billion in public media and foreign aid spending.

Senate Democrats are trying to kill the measure, but they need help from a few Republicans.

A rarely used tool allows the president to request the cancellation of previously approved funding authority, triggering a 45-day clock under which the funds are frozen. If Congress fails to act before that clock expires Friday, the spending stands.

The House has already approved Trump's request on a mostly party line 214-212 vote. The Senate has little time to spare. Another House vote will be needed if senators amend the legislation, adding more uncertainty.

European trade ministers are meeting in Brussels following Trump's surprise announcement of 30% tariffs on the European Union.  

“ We should prepare to be ready to use all the tools in the toolbox,” said Denmark's foreign minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, told reporters ahead of the meeting. “So we want a deal, but there's an old saying: 'If you want peace, you have to prepare for war.'”

If Trump makes good on his tariff threats against dozens of countries, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy.

''This is now the time for negotiations,'' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday after Trump sent a letter announcing new 30% tariffs on all EU goods starting Aug. 1.

The America's biggest trading partner and the world's largest trading bloc had been scheduled to impose ''countermeasures'' starting Monday at midnight.

''We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,'' she said. If they can't reach a deal, she said that ''we will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.''

Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary general, is visiting to meet with Trump. Their meeting is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET in the Oval Office.

Trump is expected to move forward with a plan to sell weapons to European allies who can then transfer the weapons to Ukraine.

The president has grown frustrated with Russia's Vladimir Putin and has promised a “major statement” on Monday.

NEW YORK (AP) — It was the scariest choking incident David Palumbo had ever seen.

The 88-year-old man had been dining at a Providence, Rhode Island, Italian restaurant in September 2019. Now he was unconscious, with a piece of bread lodged in his windpipe. Precious minutes went by as first responders were unable to help him with CPR or the Heimlich maneuver.

In an ambulance on the way to the hospital, the elderly man's skin was blue, and firefighters worried he was going to die. Palumbo — a fire department captain — used a scissors-like device called Magill forceps to pull the bread from the man's throat.

“We get a lot of calls in the city for choking,” many of which are resolved before emergency responders even get there, Palumbo added. “This was by far the worst one I've been on in my career.”

Fortunately, the man survived and made a full recovery, he said.

But many elderly people do not. Each year, choking claims the lives of more than 4,100 Americans who are 65 or older. It's the most vulnerable age group, accounting for about three-quarters of U.S. choking deaths, according to federal health statistics. 

The death rate has been relatively steady, but the number has risen, as the size of the nation's retirement-age population grows.

This article is part of AP's Be Well coverage, focusing on wellness, fitness, diet and mental health. Read more Be Well.

In response, a number of companies are marketing antichoking devices to the elderly. Medical professionals have been debating whether to endorse the products, sold under the names LifeVac, SaveLix, VitalVac and the Dechoker.




Dr. Nathan Charlton, a University of Virginia professor of emergency medicine who advises the American Red Cross on first aid, said there is limited evidence for the products and that the Red Cross is still evaluating them.

Here's a look at choking and the best ways to prevent choking deaths.

Choking occurs when food or some other object partially or totally blocks the windpipe, preventing oxygen from reaching the lungs.

Telltale signs include someone reaching for their neck and losing the ability to speak normally. Brain damage can occur after four minutes, and death can come just a few minutes later.

Older adults are at higher risk for a number of reasons. As people get older, mouth and throat muscles can weaken. Older people also make less saliva. Some chronic diseases and medications can make swallowing even harder. Dentures can be a choking risk.

Choking risk can be reduced by cutting food into small pieces, chewing food slowly, drinking plenty of liquids with meals, and not laughing or talking at the same time you are chewing and swallowing.

When someone is choking, you can try perhaps the oldest form of first aid: back slaps. 

There's also the Heimlich maneuver, named after the doctor credited with devising it in the 1970s. It involves standing behind the choking person, wrapping your arms around their abdomen and — with a balled fist — thrusting inward and upward. The idea is that it forces air out of the lungs, and the obstruction with it.

The American Red Cross recommends alternating back blows and abdominal thrusts in sets of five.

That's for situations in which someone is around to help a choking victim. But what if they are alone? 

It is possible for someone try to self-administer a Heimlich by thrusting their abdomen against the back of a chair, Charlton said.

Makers of some the newer anti-choking devices say that's where their products can make a difference. 

“Elderly people probably are not capable of diving on a chair or counter,” said Arthur Lih, the founder and chief executive of LifeVac.

They vary in design, but generally the devices look like a face mask attached to a tube or bellows, with a handle at the end. They typically sell for around $30 to $100.

A choking person dons the mask, pushes down on the handle and then pulls up. That is supposed to create a suction that would pull out the blockage.

Some research suggests at least certain devices can injure the tongue or cause bleeding and swelling in the throat. And the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has reports that some products did not generate enough suction and left people with bruising around the face, lips, and mouth.

An injury report led the FDA to do an inspection and issue a warning letter to Dechoker in 2021.

Manufacturers note their products are registered with the FDA, but that's not the same as an endorsement. Indeed, the agency last year issued a notice to consumers that said it has not approved antichoking devices sold over the counter, because their safety and effectiveness haven't been established.

Lih said the FDA action was in response to the proliferation of antichoking devices entering the market that vary in design and quality.

Right now, the consensus — even among antichoking device manufacturers — is that back blows and abdominal thrusts should always be tried first. (The forceps that Palumbo used are not recommended for the general public.)

Lih said thousands of nursing homes and emergency response agencies have purchased the newer antichoking devices.

One example: The police department in Acworth, Georgia, bought about 75 LifeVac devices after an officer last year used her personal device to save an elderly woman. They are now in every patrol car, said Sgt. Eric Mistretta.

Manufacturers claim the products have saved thousands of lives across multiple countries, but it's tricky to document how well they actually work, said Dr. Cody Dunne, a University of Calgary researcher who has tried.

The early evidence has come from case reports or small studies that used mannequins and cadavers. 

“I think the case is definitely being built,” he said, but more rigorous research is needed. For example, a larger study could compare what happened during choking incidents at nursing homes that stock the devices with those that don't.

Dunne noted, however, that evidence for the Heimlich maneuver and back slaps is evolving, too. He co-authored a study last year that found back blows worked better than the Heimlich or chest compressions.

“We're only now getting good evidence on the old choking techniques, let alone these new ones,” he said.

EAST PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — After driving through a downpour to take her son to day camp, Darleen Reyes told camp administrators the rain would have kept her away but her son insisted on going.

As she marked her son's name present on a clipboard at the Boys & Girls Club camp one day last week, she laughed about braving a flash flood warning to get there.

Before kissing his mother goodbye, Aiden Cazares, 8, explained to a reporter, “I wanted to see my friends and not just sit at home.” Then he ran off to play.

Aiden's one of 1.4 million children and teenagers around the country who have been attending after-school and summer programming at a Boys & Girls Club, the YMCA or a public school for free thanks to federal taxpayers. Congress set aside money for the programs to provide academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families, but President Donald Trump's administration recently froze the funding.

The money for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers is among more than $6 billion in federal education grants Trump's Republican administration has withheld, saying it wants to ensure recipients' programs align with the president's priorities.




In Rhode Island, the state stepped in with funding to keep the summer programs running, according to the Boys & Girls Club of East Providence. Other Boys & Girls Clubs supported by the grants have found ways to keep open their summer programs, said Sara Leutzinger, vice president for communications for the Boys & Girls Club of America. But there isn't the same hope for the after-school programming for the fall.

Some of the 926 Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide that run 21st Century Community Learning summer and after-school programs stand to close if the Trump administration doesn't release the money in the next three to five weeks, Leutzinger said. 

The YMCA and Save the Children say many of the centers they run are also at risk of shuttering.

“Time is of the essence,” said Christy Gleason, executive director of Save the Children Action Network, which provides after-school programming for 41 schools in rural areas in Washington state and across the South, where school will begin as soon as August. “It's not too late to make a decision so the kids who really need this still have it.”

Schools in Republican-led areas are particularly affected by the freeze in federal education grants. Ninety-one of the 100 school districts that receive the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. Of those top 100 school districts, half are in four states: California, West Virginia, Florida and Georgia. New America's analysis used funding levels reported in 2022 in 46 states.

Republican officials have been among the educators criticizing the grant freeze.

“I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,” said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican. “In Georgia, we're getting ready to start the school year, so I call on federal funds to be released so we can ensure the success of our students.”

The Office of Management and Budget said some grants supported left-wing causes, pointing to services for immigrants in the country illegally or LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts.

At the East Providence summer camp, Aiden, a rising third grader, played tag, built structures with magnetic tiles, played a fast-paced game with the other kids to review addition and subtraction, learned about pollination, watched a nature video and ate club-provided chicken nuggets.

Veteran teachers from his school corrected him when he spoke without raising his hand and offered common-sense advice when a boy in his group said something inappropriate.

“When someone says something inappropriate, you don't repeat it,” teacher Kayla Creighton told the boys between answering their questions about horseflies and honeybees.

Indeed, it's hard to find a more middle-of-the road organization in this country than the Boys & Girls Club.

Just last month, a Republican and a Democrat sponsored a resolution in the U.S. House celebrating the 165-year-old organization as a “beacon of hope and opportunity.” The Defense Department awarded the club $3 million in 1991 to support children left behind when their parents deployed for the Persian Gulf. And ever since, the Boys & Girls Club has created clubs on military installations to support the children of service members. Military families can sign up their kids for free.

“I suspect they will realize that most of those grants are fine and will release them,” said Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education policy think tank, speaking of the Trump administration's review of the 21st Century Community Learning Center grants.

But not everyone is so sure.

Aiden's mother has started looking into afternoon child care for September when kids return to school in Rhode Island.

“It costs $220 a week,” Reyes said, her eyes expanding. “I can't afford that.”

The single mother and state worker said she'll probably ask her 14-year-old son to stay home and watch Aiden. That will mean he would have to forgo getting a job when he turns 15 in the fall and couldn't play basketball and football.

“I don't have any other option,” she said.

At home, Aiden would likely stay inside on a screen. That would be heartbreaking since he's thrived getting tutoring and “learning about healthy boundaries” from the Boys & Girls Club program, Reyes said. 

Fernande Berard learned about the funding freeze and possible closure from a reporter after dropping off her three young boys for summer camp. “I would be really devastated if this goes away,” said the nurse. “I honestly don't know what I would do.”

Her husband drives an Uber much of the day, and picking up the kids early would eat into his earnings. It's money they need to pay the mortgage and everything else.

If her boss approves, she'd likely have to pick up her children from school and take them to the rehabilitation center where she oversees a team of nurses. The children would have to stay until her work day ends.

“It's hard to imagine,” she said.

U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Monday, as anticipation grew over a possible shift in the Trump administration's policy on the three-year conflict. Zelenskyy called the meeting with retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg “productive.”

U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly said during his campaign that, if elected to a second term, he would be able to end the war between Russia and Ukraine “in 24 hours.” But since his Jan. 20 inauguration, the road to a peace deal has been fraught with changing dynamics between the U.S. leader, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Trump's rhetoric toward both Zelenskyy and Putin has evolved since the beginning of the year. On Monday, Trump said he'll punish Russia with tariffs if there isn't a deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days, the latest example of his growing frustration with Putin.

At the outset of his second term, Trump was conciliatory toward Putin, for whom he has long shown admiration. But in recent days the Republican leader has expressed increasing exasperation with Putin, criticizing the Russian leader for his unbudging stance on U.S-led peace efforts and for prolonging the war.

Until recently, Trump had repeatedly said Russia seemed more willing than Ukraine to get a deal done.

Trump appears to have softened toward Zelenskyy after a February blowout in the Oval Office. And, in a reversal, has promised to send badly needed Patriot air defense missiles to Ukraine amid Russia's stepped up aerial attacks.

Russia's bigger army is pressing hard on parts of the 620-mile (1,000-kilometer) front line, where thousands of soldiers on both sides have died since the Kremlin ordered the full-scale invasion in February 2022.

June brought the highest monthly civilian casualties of the past three years, with 232 people killed and 1,343 wounded in Ukraine, the U.N. human rights mission in Ukraine said Thursday.




Here's a look at what Trump has said so far during his second term:



“We want to end that war. That war would have not started if I was president.”

Trump says his new administration has already had “very serious” discussions with Russia and that he and Putin could soon take “significant” action toward ending the conflict.





“A Dictator without Elections, Zelenskyy better move fast or he is not going to have a Country left.”

Trump's harsh words for Zelenskyy on his Truth Social platform drew criticism from Democrats and even some Republicans in the United States, where defending Ukraine from Russian aggression has traditionally had bipartisan support. Zelenskyy said Trump was falling into a Russian disinformation trap — and he was quickly admonished by Vice President JD Vance about the perils of publicly criticizing the new president.



“You're gambling with World War III. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have.”

Trump and Vance berated Zelenskyy over the war in Ukraine, accusing him of not showing gratitude after he challenged Vance on the question of diplomacy with Putin. The argument in the Oval Office was broadcast globally. It led to the rest of Zelenskyy's White House visit being canceled and called into question the U.S. support of Ukraine in its defense against Russia's 2022 invasion. A few days after the blowup, Trump temporarily paused military aid to Ukraine to pressure Zelenskyy to seek peace.

“I don't think he's going to go back on his word. You're talking about Putin. I don't think he's going to go back on his word. I've known him for a long time. We've always gotten along well.”

Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, the U.S. president said he trusts the Russian president to hold up his end of a potential peace deal. The comments were among the last positive remarks Trump made about Putin this year.





“I am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing. Vladimir, STOP! 5000 soldiers a week are dying. Lets get the Peace Deal DONE!”

In a Truth Social post, Trump was reacting to Russia attacking Kyiv with an hourslong barrage of missiles and drones. It was the first of his rare criticism of Putin amid increased Russian attacks on Ukraine.



“A lot of his people are dying. They're being killed, and I feel very badly about it.”

Trump addressed the toll on Ukrainians during an interview with ABC News after he met with Zelenskyy on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral. It was the first time the two leaders had met since the Oval Office spat, and signaled a shift in Trump's attitude toward the Ukrainian president.

“I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!”

Trump's Truth Social post made it clear he was losing patience with Putin as Moscow pounded Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities with drones and missiles in stepped-up aerial attacks.





“He was very nice actually. We had a little rough times, sometimes. He was ... Couldn't have been nicer. I think he'd like to see an end to this, I do.”

Trump had a closed-door meeting with Zelenskyy during a NATO summit in The Hague. Trump's comments to reporters later also opened the possibility of sending Patriot air-defense missiles to Ukraine.





“We get a lot of bull--—t thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth. He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.”

Trump also said he's “not happy” with his Russian counterpart and that Moscow's war in Ukraine is “killing a lot of people” on both sides. Trump's comments during a Cabinet meeting came a day after he said the United States would send more weapons to Ukraine. It was a dramatic reversal after earlier announcing a pause in the delivery of previously approved firepower to Kyiv, a decision that was made amid concerns that America's military stockpiles had declined too much.



“I am very disappointed with President Putin, I thought he was somebody that meant what he said. He'll talk so beautifully and then he'll bomb people at night. We don't like that.”

Trump's remarks to reporters came as Russia has intensified its aerial attacks against Ukraine.



“I don't want to say he's an assassin, but he's a tough guy. It's been proven over the years. He's fooled a lot of people before.”

Trump pushed harder against Putin during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. He said if there was no deal to end the war within 50 days, the U.S. would impose “secondary tariffs,” meaning taxes would target Russia's trading partners in an effort to isolate Moscow.

Trump and Rutte also discussed a rejuvenated pipeline for U.S. weapons. European allies plan to buy military equipment and then transfer it to Ukraine.

Bitcoin continued its rapid climb and hit another all-time high Monday as U.S. lawmakers begin a week focused on passing pro-crypto legislation.

Data from CoinMarketCap showed bitcoin climbed above $123,000 early Monday, up from about $108,000 only a week ago. The world's oldest and most popular cryptocurrency is currently the fifth most valuable asset class in the world at $2.4 trillion, giving it a higher market cap than Amazon.

The enthusiasm for bitcoin comes as the U.S. House is set to take up several pieces of cryptocurrency-related legislation in what's been dubbed “crypto week” in Congress. Lawmakers have been under pressure from President Donald Trump and the big-spending crypto lobby to pass legislation quickly.

That includes a bill passed last month by the Senate that would regulate a type of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins. The House is also set to take up a cryptocurrency market structure legislation that is far more sweeping.

Trump, once a skeptic of the industry, has vowed in his second term to make the U.S. the global capital of crypto. Meanwhile, he and his family have moved aggressively into nearly every corner of the industry: mining operations, billion-dollar bitcoin purchases, a newly minted stablecoin and a Trump-branded meme coin. 

The crypto industry has rapidly become a major player in Washington after feeling unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. The industry spent huge amounts on last year's elections and has been spending heavily on lobbying and other influence efforts this year.




Bitcoin has seen a significant rebound since April, when it briefly dipped below $75,000.

Spot bitcoin ETFs are becoming increasingly popular since launching last year and several publicly traded companies have made using debt and stock sales to buy bitcoin their primary business strategy. 

Created in response to the 2008 financial crisis, bitcoin has taken a highly volatile path to mainstream acceptance. Its backers say the asset is like a “digital gold” that can act as a hedge against central bank and government malfeasance. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever be created. 

“Bitcoin's price is finally catching up to what's been building under the surface,” said Adam Back, CEO of the crypto company Blockstream. “This is institutional demand aligning with bitcoin's fundamentals, and a fixed supply doing what it was designed to do.”

            Spanish police have arrested eight people after three nights of clashes between far-right groups and North African migrants in a town in southeastern Spain, the government said on Monday.
    


            In one of Spain's worst such flare-ups of recent times, several dozen youths, some hooded, hurled glass bottles and other objects at riot police in Torre Pacheco on Sunday night, Reuters journalists saw.
    


            Police fired rubber bullets to quell the unrest.
    


            The trouble stemmed from an attack last week on a man in his late 60s that left him injured and recovering at home.
    


            The victim told LaSexta broadcaster last week that he had been on a walk in a cemetery garden when two men, speaking in a language he did not understand, ran towards him, one in an agitated state.
    


            “He threw me to the ground and hit me. It all happened very quickly. I think they hit me and then left,” said the man, whom LaSexta and other media identified as Domingo Tomas.
    


            Authorities said they arrested two foreigners suspected of being involved in the assault though they were still looking for the main perpetrator, who had been identified.
    


            The other six - five Spaniards and one person of North African origin - were arrested for assault, public disorder, hate crimes or damage to property, the Interior Ministry said.
    


            Migrants, many of them second-generation, make up about a third of Torre Pacheco's population of about 40,000.
    


            The area around the town also hosts large numbers of migrants who work as day laborers in agriculture, one of the pillars of the economy in the Murcia region.
    


            “I ask the migrant community not to leave their homes and not to confront rioters, because confrontation achieves nothing and ultimately makes us all afraid,” local mayor Pedro Angel Roca told national broadcaster TVE.
    


            Speaking to radio station Cadena Ser, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska attributed the violence to anti-immigration rhetoric from far-right groups and political parties such as Vox, which he said unjustifiably links immigration to crime.
    


            The violence in Torre Pacheco was organized and fomented by calls on social media, the minister added.
    


            Vox leader Santiago Abascal denied any responsibility for the incidents and said the government's migration policies were to blame.
    


            Spain has been open to migration and its economic benefits, even as other European governments have tightened borders. But debate has reignited, led by Vox, as plans to relocate unaccompanied underage migrants from the Canary Islands to the rest of Spain have been confirmed in recent weeks.
    


            “Spain is not a country that hunts down immigrants, and if we have to take to the streets, it is to defend the rights of thousands of people who are completely trapped and distressed by this hunt for immigrants,” Migration Minister Elma Saiz told El Pais newspaper.
    


            Abdelali, a North African migrant who lives in Torre Pacheco and declined to give his surname, said he was afraid of riding his scooter for fear of being hit by bottles from rioters.
    


            “We want peace. That's what we want, we don't want anything else,” he told Reuters on Sunday.
    


            In 2000, violent anti-immigration protests broke out in the Almeria town of El Ejido in southern Spain after three Spanish citizens were killed by Moroccan migrants.

            Cameroon's 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who has held an iron grip on the Central African nation for nearly 43 years has launched a reelection bid that could keep him in power until almost his 100th birthday.
    


            “Much remains to be done,” said Biya, who is in the twilight of his seventh term in office. “The best is yet to come,” added the Cameroonian leader in a statement on Sunday.
    


            Biya is seeking a fresh seven-year term in a presidential election scheduled for October, despite reports that his health has deteriorated. He said his decision to extend his grip on power rested “on urgent appeals coming from the 10 regions of our country and from the diaspora.”
    


            His announcement comes months after his office pushed back on speculation he was unwell or had died following a lengthy absence from the public eye.
    


            Discussions about his health were later banned in the media, with the Cameroon interior ministry declaring it a national security matter.

            For years, rumors about Biya's health and whereabouts have been major talking points in Cameroon, where he has rarely been seen in public. He has maintained a strong grip on the nation, however, winning multiple re-election victories – some by a landslide.
    


            Biya came to power in 1982 and has remained in office for more than four decades, becoming one of the globe's longest-serving heads of state, excluding monarchs. He is only the second president to lead Cameroon since it achieved independence from France and Britain in the early 1960s.
    


            Questions swirled around the prospects of Biya seeking an eighth term in office with many local leaders urging him to seek a new mandate. However, some of his allies have quit his government and launched their presidential bids.
    


            Defeating Biya at the polls may not come easily for his opponents, according to political analyst Collins Molua Ikome, who is based in Germany.
    


            Ikome told CNN that Cameroon's opposition, which comprises more than 300 political parties, is too fragmented to dislodge Biya's ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) party at the October polls. Only a coalition, he said, could pose a threat to the president.
    


            “They (the opposition) don't stand a chance as individual candidates. If they form a transitional coalition then maybe they might,” he said.
    


            In March last year, plans by two opposition parties to create a coalition were dubbed illegal by the country's interior ministry, a move described by Human Rights Watch as “part of a government crackdown on opposition and dissent.”



            Biya's long rule has been marred by widespread accusations of human rights violations that included “extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detentions, torture… unfair trials, and persecution and imprisonment of people for their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity,” according to rights group Amnesty International.

President Donald Trump is set to meet with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday as the United States warms up to the idea of providing Ukraine with missiles in its war with Russia.

Trump teased a “major announcement” on Monday regarding Russia, and it is expected to be more weapons for Ukraine.

Sources told Axios that the announcement is a new weapons package for Ukraine, including offensive and defensive missiles, which would be a major shift for Trump. The administration paused a defensive missile shipment to Ukraine not long ago, but the president repealed the decision.

The package is likely to include long-range missiles that can strike deeply into Russian territory. Trump has refused to provide these before to avoid escalating problems with Russia.

“Trump is really pissed at Putin. His announcement tomorrow is going to be very aggressive,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said.

The plan, to be revealed in the meeting between Rutte and Trump, will see European countries pay for U.S.-made weapons that will be delivered to Ukraine. It was proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky two weeks ago at the NATO summit.

The plan presumably boosts the U.S. defense industry while Ukraine receives the weapons it desires in its conflict against Russia, which started in 2022. An official suggested Zelensky made a good argument.

“Zelensky came like a normal human being, not crazy, and was dressed like a somebody that should be at NATO. He had a group of people with him that also seemed not crazy. So they had a good conversation,” a U.S. official told Axios.

The likely source of Trump's renewed vigor to defend Ukraine is his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he once prioritized relations with. Trump is angry with Putin's decision to press on with the conflict against Ukraine with little willingness to work toward a ceasefire, an objective Trump aspires to achieve in his presidency.

In Putin's July 3 call with Trump, the Russian leader indicated he had little interest in de-escalation and was pressing forward with the war. Trump said he made “no progress at all” toward ending the war in his call with the leader.

He reportedly told French President Emmanuel Macron after the call that Putin wants to “take all” of Ukraine.

Trump told reporters Sunday that he was sending Ukraine various weapons, including “pieces of very sophisticated” military equipment, such as Patriot air defense batteries. He said European countries “are going to pay us 100% for them. It is going to be business for us.” The president added that he was “disappointed” in Putin for seeking peace before waging an intensifying war.

The president is also considering authorizing new funding for the war, the first time he has done so since reentering office.

There's hope that the weapons could change the trajectory of the war. Russia launched more aerial attacks last month than at any other point in the conflict, causing the most civilian deaths in the war. Zelensky said that, nevertheless, Russia has underperformed its expectations of the assault.

“We see the enemy's intentions and attempts to advance, and it is important that each of these attempts is being thwarted thanks to the resilience of our units and active defense,” Zelensky said on Telegram. “The Russian army has fallen far short of its command's expectations for this summer.”

“Our units will continue to destroy the occupiers and do everything possible to bring the war onto Russian territory. We are preparing new long-range strikes,” Zelensky added.

GRAHAM VOWS ‘RECORD LEVEL' OF WEAPONS TO UKRAINE AFTER PUTIN TRIED TO ‘PLAY TRUMP'

Graham hopes the “record level” of weapons can push Russia to the negotiating table.

“Putin made a miscalculation here,” Graham said. “For six months, President Trump tried to entice Putin to the table. The attacks have gone up, not down. One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump, and you just watch, in the coming days and weeks, there's going to be a massive effort to get Putin to the table.”

A wildfire tore through the Grand Canyon's North Rim on Sunday, destroying the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures, and forcing officials to close the area for the season.

Flames from the Dragon Bravo Fire engulfed the lodge, visitor center, gas station, wastewater treatment plant, administrative offices, and employee housing, according to park Superintendent Ed Keable. The National Park Service (NPS) estimates between 50 and 80 structures were lost.

No injuries were reported. All staff and residents cleared the area before the fire advanced, NPS said.

Lightning sparked the Dragon Bravo Fire on July 4. Authorities initially managed the fire with a "confine and contain" strategy. A week later, amid scorching heat, low humidity, and high winds, officials shifted to full suppression as the growing blaze scorched 7.8 square miles.

Aramark, the company that operated the lodge, said all employees and guests were safely evacuated.

"As stewards of some of our country's most beloved national treasures, we are devastated by the loss," said spokesperson Debbie Albert.

HORRIFIED TOURISTS WATCH AS BISON BOILS TO DEATH IN YELLOWSTONE HOT SPRING

Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs called on the federal government late Sunday to investigate the NPS's response to the wildfire and deliver a report "detailing the decisions that led to this devastating outcome."

"They must first take aggressive action to end the wildfire and prevent further damage," she said in a post on X. "But Arizonans deserve answers for how this fire was allowed to decimate the Grand Canyon National Park."

First Baptist Church senior Pastor Robert Jeffress discusses a new study on Americans' church attendance rates and more on ‘America Reports.'

John MacArthur, pastor of Grace Community Church (GCC) in Sun Valley, California, has reportedly been hospitalized with pneumonia following years of health complications.

The announcement regarding the 86-year-old's health came as the congregation was celebrating Sunday service over the weekend, according to The Roys Report. 

"This week, Pastor John contracted pneumonia," associate pastor Tom Patton reportedly announced at the church's 11 a.m. service on Sunday. "He was admitted into the hospital and may be in the presence of the Lord soon."

Patton reportedly asked the congregation to pray for MacArthur, along with his wife, four children and fifteen grandchildren. 

The pastor previously made national headlines after a California judge ruled he could continue holding in-person services despite Gov. Gavin Newsom's statewide coronavirus restrictions.  

MacArthur has suffered from years of health complications while in the spotlight, including a sudden onset of illness during a 2023 service.

Since 2023, he has reportedly undergone numerous surgeries to treat atrial fibrillation and other conditions. 

He was reportedly hospitalized earlier this year while undergoing a "second procedure" on his lungs, according to the outlet. 

"That procedure was successful, and (I) am now back at home," MacArthur previously said in a statement at the time, according to The Roys Report. "The doctors are optimistic about my recovery, and I am eager to return to you once I regain my strength."

However, MacArthur's prognosis reportedly created uncertainty regarding his health among the church's congregants, with Patton telling members of the community that the pastor's recovery from "three surgeries in the second half of 2024" was "slower than expected, and saw "occasional setbacks affecting his heart, lungs and kidneys."

MacArthur has led GCC's congregation for 56 years and is president of Grace to You, a nonprofit organization dedicated to distributing nearly 400 book titles authored by the pastor, according to the church's website.

"We place our dear pastor at the feet of the glorious Savior," Patton was quoted as saying during Sunday's service. "Whom he has served so faithfully for so many years and now awaits His final command to be in his presence forever."

Repealing net neutrality regulations would end the internet as we know it. People would die if President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts were passed. From Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Democrats making alarmist, doomsday claims about Republican policies isn't exactly a new phenomenon. But a Democratic economist just took this ridiculous rhetoric to a new extreme. 

During an interview on ABC News, economist and former Obama administration Treasury Secretary Larry Summers bashed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in particular, highlighting the reforms to the taxpayer-funded health insurance program Medicaid included in the comprehensive bill. Cue the hysteria. 

“The Yale Budget Lab estimates that it will kill, over 10 years, 100,000 people,” Summers said. “That is 2,000 days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend … in my 70 years, I've never been as embarrassed for my country on July Fourth.”

“The Yale Budget Lab estimates that it will kill, over ten years, 100,000 people. That is two thousand days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend…In my 70 years, I've never been as embarrassed for my country on July 4th” – former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers on… pic.twitter.com/T7z6JV7IDf

That's right: The Republicans' modest Medicaid reforms, under which Medicaid spending will still massively increase over the next decade, are supposedly going to “kill” 100,000 people. 

How does Summers arrive at this claim? Well, I tracked it back to a Washington Post op-ed in which a Yale lawyer specifically claims that the bill will cause an “uptick in the uninsured population [that] will translate to about 100,000 more avoidable deaths over the next decade.”

What's the math behind this? Well, the author takes a Congressional Budget Office estimate that 10.8 million people will lose health insurance coverage as a result of the bill's provision and then extrapolates from that number using studies estimating a reduction in mortality correlated with Medicaid expansion. 

But this analysis is wrong on every level and flawed beyond belief. 

First, the input number, 10.8 million losing insurance, is almost certainly wrong, and, regardless, using it in this way is misleading. Why? Well, for example, included in this figure are about 1.4 million illegal immigrants to whom states have extended Medicaid benefits. Illegal immigrants are not supposed to receive Medicaid. But the logic of Summers & co. suggests that by removing them from the Medicaid rolls, we are “killing” possibly thousands of them if they develop medical problems and do not receive taxpayer-funded healthcare. 

That blame-shifting … can't be right. Otherwise, America would be murdering hundreds of thousands of people every day by not extending taxpayer-funded health insurance to the entire global population.  

In a similar vein, about 1.6 million of the people who will be removed under the CBO's estimate are people who are ineligible for Medicaid — for example, they may earn too much money — but are currently enrolled. Many of these people will purchase insurance for themselves or receive it through employment after they lose Medicaid coverage. But the logic of Summers & his ilk suggests that the government cannot remove people from Medicaid who are ineligible under federal law for Medicaid without being morally responsible for thousands of murders. Again, that cannot be right, unless you believe that the U.S. government is murdering people every day by not giving every person in the country Medicaid.  

You get the idea. Yet the numbers here are also likely inflated. The Congressional Budget Office is a respectable institution that does aspire to do its work in a nonpartisan and rigorous way. But when it comes to projecting insurance coverage changes resulting from shifts in federal policy … their track record is very poor. 

According to the Paragon Health Institute, CBO's past projections about the impact of policy changes on insurance coverage were between “10 and 20 times what actually resulted.” It's reasonable to expect that their current estimates are similarly inflated, making projections based on them wildly inflated, too. 

Yet even if the numbers losing Medicaid coverage are exactly as large as the CBO expects, this analysis still doesn't hold water. It relies on a faulty, high-end estimate about the reductions in mortality associated with insurance coverage that is not consistent with most research. While insurance is surely a valuable financial tool, as the Paragon Health Institute's Liam Sigaud explains, “outside of a few vulnerable population subgroups (e.g., children), there is little evidence that insurance significantly improves the health of most people.” Meanwhile, some significant, high-quality research has found no mortality reduction caused by the expansion of health insurance access.

WHY THE KREMLIN HAS DELEGATED ITS TRUMP REBUKES TO PUTIN

So, given that Summers's analysis relies on a supposed reduction in mortality from insurance that does not appear to exist, the entire alarmist “people will die!” narrative is illegitimate.

The truth is that there is no meaningful reduction in the welfare state that some of these critics would ever accept. And the sad fact that so many people believe this fearmongering propaganda is a serious obstacle to preserving our financially unsustainable safety net — for the people who actually need it.

They were already on the edge of extinction. Then Helene hit.

Photography by Benji Jones

HENDERSON COUNTY, North Carolina — Once again, I found myself staring at a crack in a large rock on the side of a mountain. It was June, and rainy, and I was searching for a glossy amphibian called the Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander. These animals, about the length of a human finger, are black with splotches of mint green. That makes them nearly invisible against the lichen-covered rocks they typically hide in. 

I had previously traveled here — to this very rock — in the spring of last year for a story about the salamanders of southern Appalachia. They are spectacular. With somewhere around a hundred species, the region, and particularly western North Carolina, near Asheville, is a global salamander hot spot. It has a higher concentration of salamanders than anywhere else in the world. 

At the time of my 2024 visit, some of Appalachia's salamanders, including the Hickory Nut Gorge green, were already in trouble. These amphibious animals have an incredibly small range — they're found only in one valley, the Hickory Nut Gorge, southwest of Asheville. Commercial development, logging, and other threats shrank their population from as many as tens of thousands to just 300 to 500 individuals total, according to recent estimates. In 2021, North Carolina listed them as endangered and, in 2024, federal officials said protection under the Endangered Species Act may be warranted. 

Then came Hurricane Helene. 

The storm, which struck North Carolina in late September, killed dozens of people. It destroyed thousands of homes, many of which are still in pieces today. But it also took a severe toll on the state's wildlife, the species that make southern Appalachia so unique. Record flooding, landslides, and even some of the recovery efforts have drastically changed the landscape that salamanders rely on. This sudden destruction of habitat — some areas look as though they've been clearcut — is pushing the region's most endangered species even closer to extinction. 

So this June, I came back to witness a rescue mission. Flooding from Helene uprooted the forest around one of the only known breeding populations of Hickory Nut Gorge green salamanders, which makes up a significant portion of the entire species. It's not clear whether they will survive without trees or withstand another severe weather event. Government forecasters have again predicted an above-average hurricane season this year and central North Carolina has already faced deadly flooding from the remnants of storm Chantal, which struck parts of the state earlier this month. In the long term, warming from climate change is expected to intensify both hurricanes and flooding. 

Now, to save this population of greens — and perhaps the entire species — scientists are working quickly to bring a number of them into captivity. It's a strategy that's increasingly common in a heavily altered world: To save animals from blinking out, scientists have to build backup populations and manage them under human care. 

If you're just passing through Asheville, it's hard to imagine that less than a year ago the city was hit by one of the worst natural disasters in state history. Downtown is bustling. The River Arts District — which was under water just months ago — looks like any trendy area with busy restaurants and bars.

But if you look more closely, signs of Helene's devastation start to appear. Some sidewalks are missing pieces. Piles of dead trees fill empty lots. There are construction vehicles everywhere. And in some areas the damage is impossible to miss. In a charming district called Biltmore Village, which abuts the Swannanoa River, only the skeletons of some buildings remain, their insides rotted out or washed away.

Even against this backdrop, however, Hickory Nut Gorge still looks worse. Carved by the Broad River, the steep valley of the gorge is harder to access and less populated, and so cleanup has been slow. The original road connecting the gorge's small towns, which were once local tourist destinations, doesn't exist anymore — it was swallowed by the river. You can only reach the gorge now on a temporary road that doesn't show up on Google Maps. 

Homes and inns are broken in half, still unrepaired. Cars and small buildings look like they've been tossed around like toys in a kid's room. 

The flooding here that destroyed human infrastructure also wrecked the forests that blanket the ravine. Downpours triggered mudslides, unearthing boulders and uprooting trees, ultimately leaving large chunks of the gorge deforested. 

That's bad for salamanders, and especially for the Hickory Nut Gorge green, said JJ Apodaca, executive director of the Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, an environmental group. Greens are lungless — they breathe through their skin. But that bit of biological magic requires water, so it only works if their skin is moist. That's why they live within the cracks in rocks on the forest floor: The shady canopy above helps keep their habitat cool and moist. Without shade, they dry out. Plus, greens spend part of the year in trees, where they feed on insects like ants and beetles. 

None of this works without trees. And today, much of this habitat is treeless.

Researchers are still assessing the damage, but early estimates by Apodaca, a salamander scientist, suggest Helene destroyed as much as 30 percent of the greens' total habitat in the gorge. According to the North Carolina Forest Service, the storm damaged more than a quarter of all forested areas in North Carolina counties that it passed through.

One especially destructive blow is visible from the new road through the gorge: High up on the ravine, a large section of forest is missing, leveled by floodwaters or a mudslide. That bald spot is exactly where a population of breeding greens resides — and it's where this rescue mission has been taking place. 

Thunder gurgled in the distance as Apodaca and I hiked into the gorge late one afternoon. Apodaca has a soft spot for the Hickory Nut Gorge green — he was part of the team that first described this animal as a new species in 2019. “They're just cool,” he told me, before explaining that they're visually striking, lungless, adapted to live in rock cracks, and skilled at climbing trees.

After parking on the side of the road that wasn't on Google Maps, we waded across the Broad River — the water was calm and the color of chocolate milk — and then hiked into the woods. The easiest path uphill was through the large patch of forest cleared out by Helene's floodwaters. The ground was muddy and rocky, like the bottom of a river. 

It took us about 20 minutes to reach a large granite outcropping that Apodaca calls Party Rock, so named because it's where loads of greens normally hang out. The boulder, which was lined with several thin crevices, used to be shaded by the forest canopy, but now it's exposed to direct, harsh sunlight that's drying out the rock. 

This spring, once the gorge was accessible and he obtained permits, Apodaca began a rescue operation for the greens living in and around Party Rock. The plan was to bring about two dozen animals into captivity — animals that might otherwise die in the wild — as a sort of insurance policy for the species. 

“The writing was on the wall,” said Lori Williams, a conservation biologist with the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the state wildlife agency, who's involved in the rescue. “We knew we were racing against time to do something.” 

So far Apodaca has rescued 15 individuals, mostly from Party Rock, which he brought to the North Carolina Zoo. Apodaca has a permit to collect another 10 salamanders. That's why we were here now. According to Apodaca and Williams, 25 salamanders is enough to establish a breeding population, but not so many that it will further endanger the wild population. 

“The fact that we've pushed this species so close to the edge makes it really hard to sit back and do nothing once something like this happens,” Apodaca told me. “It's just to the point where we have to do something now or we're gonna lose a species.” 

Apodaca and I spent hours at Party Rock, staring into cracks with a flashlight. We spent so long doing this that I started seeing cracks even where there were no cracks. Every time my brain sensed movement I'd feel a jolt of adrenaline. But 10 times out of 10 it was a giant, leggy camel cricket. Party Rock was a bust. 

As the afternoon dragged on, we searched other boulders and explored some newly opened caves, which are good spots to find greens because they're cold and damp, Apodaca said. At one point I army crawled into a tight opening and when I looked up, careful not to ram my head against the ceiling, I saw a different salamander species staring back at me — a crevice salamander. It was black with cool blue spots. It stood frozen, and I was suddenly very aware that I was an intruder in its home. 

We came across several more crevice salamanders. I managed to cover myself in poison ivy. But we found no greens. Apodaca was still 10 individuals short of his quota. 

It could be that we were too late in the season, Apodaca said. As spring warms to summer, the heat drives the salamanders deeper into their crevices. But another, more troubling explanation is that not many of the greens here survived the damage from Helene, and Apodaca has already captured most of those that did. “This site is probably gone,” Apodaca told me.

Apodaca plans to return to Party Rock in the fall to try and collect more individuals, though he's not sure if they'll be able to hold on that long. For now, the captive population relies on just 15 greens — all but four of which are male. 

In a small windowless room at the North Carolina Zoo, several containers labeled with masking tape sat atop a folding table. They were made of thin plastic and shaped like circular cookie tins. 

Each container, though unremarkable, held something precious inside a bit of damp paper towel: a Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander. Their green splotches looked even more vibrant up close, like they had caught crossfire in a paintball match. Their eyes bulged from their heads and their hands, painfully adorable, had tiny digits that looked like ET's fingers, but in miniature.

These salamanders — which are now in quarantine, away from other amphibians at the zoo — may hold the key to the future of their entire species. 

The goal is to breed these individuals in captivity, said Dustin Smith, the curator of reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates at the zoo, which is also involved in the rescue operation. And luckily, the four females they have in the collection were already pregnant when they were captured and each carrying a dozen or so eggs. 

On the afternoon I visited the captive salamanders with Apodaca, Shaina Lampert, a research associate at the zoo, took out what looked like a very old laptop. It was a miniature ultrasound machine. A cord connected a small probe to the machine, which she gently ran over the belly of one of the female salamanders. Several black circles appeared on the screen: eggs. “This is the next generation of this species,” Apodaca said. 

Ideally, the females will soon lay their eggs, the captive population will grow, and the team overseeing the rescue mission will return some of them back to the wild, Williams said, assuming there's high-quality habitat left in the gorge. That's still unclear.

But ultimately, the success — or failure — in saving the Hickory Nut Gorge green will go largely unnoticed. These animals live in a remote region, tucked away in crevices; they're hard to find even for the few people who know what to look for. Why then does it matter that we save them? 

Like any salamander, like any animal, the greens play an important role in their ecosystem, as both predator and prey. They help limit the number of insects, including those humans don't like. That's been shown to help keep carbon locked up in the forest that might otherwise contribute to climate change. They're little climate heroes.

It's not a stretch to say that without salamanders, forest ecosystems in southern Appalachia could collapse. And those are the ecosystems that provide water to towns and attract tourists that fuel the local economy.

But more than that, Apodaca says, these salamanders simply have a right to exist. That's why he's fighting to protect them — why he's been hiking into a disaster zone week after week.

“I can't make you care more than I can convince somebody that doesn't care about art that the Mona Lisa is priceless,” he said. “You either relish in nature and view the world that has a right to exist beyond us, or you don't.”

Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'

After more than two decades of serving in the U.S. Navy and building government systems, I have witnessed firsthand how millions of dedicated Americans work every day in service of their fellow citizens and the security of our democracy. I have also seen both the immense potential — and frustrating inertia — that plagues public service. An unrealized opportunity exists to connect the U.S. government's critical missions with the transformative power of commercial technology. 

Consider this: of the world's 10 largest companies by market capitalization, a staggering eight are American founded. This is no accident; it is a direct result of our nation's unparalleled entrepreneurial spirit. The critical question, however, is whether our own government is prepared to harness this strategic asset.  

Instead of tapping this engine of innovation, the U.S. government is held captive by its outdated processes. Entrenched legacy vendors have dug their claws in, and this has led to a general resistance to change. As the saying goes, "it takes a while to turn a big ship around."  

US WARFIGHTERS ARE LOSING A MASSIVE FORCE MULTIPLIER ADVANTAGE AS CHINA ADVANCES IN SPACE

That rings true with actual warships and aircraft carriers, but it also applies to how government agencies resist adopting new tools that improve collaboration, efficiency and security. Instead, the U.S. government and its outdated procurement processes cling to existing technology platforms, such as Microsoft's suite of products that have been compromised time and again by China, which also happens to be one of the company's most significant business partners.

Breaking the shackles of "vendor lock-in" — where the government becomes overly reliant on specific vendors even if they underperform — is crucial for fostering a new era of innovation that benefits America. When a company or product fails to perform well in the commercial sector, it's terminated immediately.  

In the public sector, the company is usually allowed to see out their multi-year contracts and when it's finally time to negotiate a renewal, all is forgotten. A more competitive public sector landscape, welcoming innovators and startups, can provide fresh perspectives, specialized solutions, and the speed to address rapidly evolving challenges. 

WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO KEEP AI FROM BECOMING A FAR-LEFT TROJAN HORSE

This is not a unique approach. Other nations are adopting this model, attempting to gain an edge over America. For example, China launched a program in 2023, with 39 partners, including Alibaba Cloud and Baidu, to advance computing power and AI.  

Russia subsidizes companies implementing digital transformation; and Iran, despite sanctions, is investing significantly in AI research and building a sovereign AI ecosystem. Our adversaries recognize that commercial tools drive rapid progress and are actively breaking down barriers to catch up to American AI leadership. 

There are understandable reasons for hesitancy. For years, Silicon Valley has been closely associated with the "move fast and break things" mantra, while the U.S. government has looked on with both envy (of the speed and efficiency) and concern (over potential impacts to its services). However, learning from the commercial mindset of agility and a relentless drive for improvement will help it to serve the American public better. The benefits? Reduced waste, greater efficiency and better taxpayer value.  

EXPERT SPEAKS OUT ON 'PERFECT SOLUTION' TO FEDERAL HIRING ISSUES CREATING NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS

Nowhere is this approach more critical than in national security. The threats America faces are constantly evolving and leveraging emerging technology to do so. Maintaining our edge requires more than just incremental improvements; it demands continuous access to cutting-edge capabilities.

Leveraging the R&D engines of American commercial innovation — in areas like AI, cybersecurity, data analytics and resilient infrastructure — is not just advantageous; it's essential. If Washington fails to leverage this homegrown ingenuity, it does so at our national peril, especially as our adversaries work tirelessly to do just that. 

Other nations are adopting this model, attempting to gain an edge over America. For example, China launched a program in 2023, with 39 partners, including Alibaba Cloud and Baidu, to advance computing power and AI. 

Government agencies tasked with everything from defending the nation to delivering health services need to have immediate access to the latest advancements in AI and data analytics, and they can only do so by leveraging powerful commercial tools with a platform for continuous improvement — an asset for national security and public service.

AI could be used to accelerate some of the government's most notorious backlogs, such as the millions of immigration court cases, the accumulation in environmental reviews for energy projects, and pileups in programs like Social Security or Veterans Affairs healthcare. AI can analyze data at lightning speed, helping federal agencies and their partners deliver on mission-critical work at an accelerated pace.  

The urgent need for a more agile, efficient, innovative and secure government is too significant to ignore. This is a pivotal moment. By embracing the discipline, accountability, and innovative spirit of the commercial sector, the U.S. government can unlock new levels of performance and effectiveness. Change is hard. But as adversaries gain on America — or worse, overtake us — change is mandatory.

Lora Ries, former Department of Homeland Security acting deputy chief of staff, told Fox News Digital the rise in Chinese nationals who crossed the southern border illegally during the Biden administration poses a ‘national security issue.'

One border security expert said the massive number of Chinese illegal immigrants who crossed the United States border during the Biden administration poses a "national security concern."

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported 122 illegal immigrants to China June 3, many of whom were convicted of murder, drug trafficking, rape and human smuggling. Officials said the individuals were taken to China on a "special high risk charter flight."

The Department of Justice on Tuesday charged seven Chinese nationals after they allegedly operated a multimillion- dollar marijuana trafficking ring. According to the Justice Department, the suspects smuggled illegal immigrants through the U.S.-Mexico border to work in marijuana grow houses.

"This case pulls back the curtain on a sprawling criminal enterprise that exploited our immigration system and our communities for personal gain," said U.S. Attorney Leah Foley. 

"These defendants allegedly turned quiet homes across the Northeast into hubs for a criminal enterprise, building a multimillion-dollar black market operation off the backs of an illegal workforce and using our neighborhoods as cover. That ends today."

In fiscal year 2024 alone, according to the House Committee on Homeland Security, over 24,376 Chinese nationals were encountered and 24,214 were apprehended. In March 2024 alone, border encounters of Chinese nationals increased over 8,000% when compared to March 2021. The report was released in April 2024.

Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center and former Department of Homeland Security acting deputy chief of staff, told Fox News Digital in an interview that the sharp increase in Chinese nationals crossing the southern border is "absolutely" a national security concern.

"The numbers rose rapidly during the Biden administration. I mean, pre-Biden, Customs and Border Protection would see about 1,000 Chinese nationals a month nationwide, whether that was at the ports of entry or between ports of entry. And, during Biden's four years, that rose rapidly to 2,000, up to 7,000 a month. It even hit over 8,000 one month in December of 2023. And most of these were between the ports of entry," Ries said. 

Ries fears the Chinese Communist Party was using the southern border as a "tactic" against the U.S. during former President Biden's administration.

"Given the many tactics that the Chinese Communist Party uses against the U.S. — whether that is sending fentanyl precursor ingredients to Mexico to be smuggled into the U.S., killing hundreds of thousands of Americans, COVID-19 from Wuhan, spy balloons, buying farmland near military bases — we have to assume that the CCP took advantage of the open border during Biden's years and sent many Chinese nationals with mal-intent," Ries said.

Former President Joe Biden said in a new interview published on Sunday that he “consciously” made all of the clemency decisions during his presidency, a defense that comes as a House committee is probing the 46th president's use of an autopen for the controversial pardons and commutations.

As his time in the Oval Office came to a close, Biden issued many last-minute pardons, most notably to his son Hunter Biden and other family members, Dr. Anthony Fauci, members of the Jan. 6 committee, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, and a host of others. He also commuted the death sentences of 37 federal inmates, a move that was blasted by critics as an overreach of executive power.

Now, as the House Oversight Committee is looking into the pardons as part of its investigation into Biden's use of the autopen and an alleged cover-up of the former president's “mental decline” by key officials in his administration, Biden is insisting he made “every single one” of the decisions in a phone call with the New York Times.

“I made every single one of those. And — including the categories, when we set this up to begin with. And so — but I understand why Trump would think that, because obviously, I guess, he doesn't focus much. Anyway, so — yes, I made every decision,” Biden said, according to excerpts from the call.

Despite Biden's insistence, however, he also confirmed he did not approve each name for the pardons that applied to groups of people. Instead, he signed off on the standards he wanted to be used to determine which convicts would qualify for a reduction in sentence.

Biden later revealed how that process worked, saying his aides would only read off the names of prominent figures, such as Milley.

“Well, first of all, there's categories. So, you know, they aren't reading names off for the commutations for those who had been home confinements for, during the pandemic. So the only things that really we read off names for were, for example, you know, was I, what was I going to do about, for example, Mark Milley?” Biden explained.

The former president added, “I laid out a strategy how I want to go about these, dealing with pardons and commutations. I was — and I pulled the team in to say this is how I want to get it done, generically and then specifically. And so, you know, that's just — this is how it worked.”

In terms of the autopen, Biden confirmed its usage, saying it was necessary because “there were a lot” of clemency decisions — over 4,000 of them, according to the Pew Research Center.

“The autopen is, you know, is legal. As you know, other presidents used it, including Trump. But the point is that, you know, we're talking about a whole lot of people,” Biden said.

Biden's defense comes as the Oversight Committee is slated to hear more testimonies from Biden's senior staff over the next few weeks. Those include former assistant to the president Annie Tomasini, former chief of staff Ronald Klain, former counselor to the president Steve Ricchetti, former senior adviser to the president Mike Donilon, and former deputy chief of staff for policy Bruce Reed. A former aide to Jill Biden, Anthony Bernal, has also been subpoenaed after previously refusing to testify.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT INVESTIGATION INTO BIDEN AUTOPEN USE PLOWS AHEAD WITH MORE WITNESSES

In the New York Times interview, Biden suggested the investigation was “crazy,” calling the Republicans, and President Donald Trump, probing the idea that his aides covered up his decline “liars.”

“They're liars. They know it. They know, for certain. I mean, this is — look, what they, they've had a pretty good thing going here. They've done so badly. They've lied so consistently about almost everything they're doing. The best thing they can do is try to change the focus and focus on something else. And this is a — I think that's what this is about,” Biden said.

            Three locations used by Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime as torture and execution sites 50 years ago have been added by UNESCO to its World Heritage List.
    


            The three locations were inscribed to the list by the United Nations cultural agency Friday during the 47th Session of the World Heritage Committee in Paris.
    


            The inscription coincided with the 50th anniversary of the rise to power by the communist Khmer Rouge government, which caused the deaths of an estimated 1.7 million Cambodians through starvation, torture and mass executions during a four-year reign from 1975 to 1979.
    


            UNESCO's World Heritage List lists sites considered important to humanity and includes the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Taj Mahal in India and Cambodia's Angkor archaeological complex.
    


            The three sites listed Friday include two notorious prisons and an execution site immortalized in a Hollywood film.
    


Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum, located in the capital Phnom Penh, is the site of a former high school used by the Khmer Rouge as a notorious prison. Better known as S-21, about 15,000 people were imprisoned and tortured there.
    


            The M-13 prison, located in rural Kampong Chhnang province in central Cambodia, also was regarded as one of the main prisons of the early Khmer Rouge.
    


            Choeung Ek, located about 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of the capital, was used as an execution site and mass grave. The story of the atrocities committed there are the focus of the 1984 film “The Killing Fields,” based on the experiences of New York Times photojournalist Dith Pran and correspondent Sydney Schanberg.
    


The Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, and immediately herded almost all the city's residents into the countryside, where they were forced to toil in harsh conditions until 1979, when the regime was driven from power by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam.
    


            In September 2022, the UN-backed Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia, better known as the Khmer Rouge tribunal, concluded its work compiling cases against Khmer Rouge leaders. The tribunal cost $337 million over 16 years but convicted just three men.
    


            Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet issued a message Friday directing people to beat drums simultaneously across the country Sunday morning to mark the UNESCO listing.
    


            “May this inscription serve as a lasting reminder that peace must always be defended,” Hun Manet said in a video message posted online. “From the darkest chapters of history, we can draw strength to build a better future for humanity.”
    


            Youk Chhang, executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, said the country is “still grappling with the painful legacies of genocide, torture, and mass atrocity.” But naming the three sites to the UNESCO list will play a role in educating younger generations of Cambodians and others worldwide.
    


            “Though they were the landscape of violence, they too will and can contribute to heal the wounds inflicted during that era that have yet to heal,” he said.
    


            The UNESCO inscription was Cambodia's first nomination for a modern and non-classical archaeological site and is among the first in the world to be submitted as a site associated with recent conflict, Cambodia's Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said in a statement Friday.
    


            Four Cambodian archaeological sites were previously inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites including Angkor, Preah Vihear, Sambo Prei Kuk and Koh Ker, the ministry said.

Prosecutors in Colorado plan to drop charges against a registered sex offender accused of trying to kidnap a child from an elementary school because he was found incompetent to stand trial.

The 18th Judicial District Attorney's Office, which covers Arapahoe County and includes Aurora and Littleton, informed FOX31 on Friday that it intends to dismiss charges against Solomon Galligan. The 33-year-old faces one count of attempted kidnapping after he allegedly tried to take an 11-year-old boy during recess at Black Forest Hills Elementary School in April 2024.

Aurora police previously reported that Galligan is a registered sex offender, with his registration tied to the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office.

After his arrest, Galligan underwent a mental competency evaluation that determined he was unfit to stand trial. As a result, prosecutors claimed they have no choice but to drop the charges.

Galligan's guilt is not the issue for prosecutors. The alleged crime was captured on video that showed a man chasing after and grabbing at a student as other children ran away.

"It's super scary to watch," Dante White, whose child encountered the suspect, told FOX31 when the incident happened. "Especially seeing the perpetrator, the pictures of him. I would be freaked out if that guy touched me. It was an attempted kidnapping."

In the aftermath of the incident, parents at the Aurora school submitted a 10-page letter to Cherry Creek School District officials, demanding an independent review of the school's handling of the situation.

School district officials conducted an investigation, where former Black Forrest Hills Elementary School Principal Amanda Replogle was replaced, the outlet reported.

"The information obtained through this investigation has led us to decide that we need to make an administrative change at Black Forest Hills," a previous statement from the district sent to FOX31 read. "We are making that change now so that we can move forward with the final weeks of the school year in a positive and productive way."

Replogle admitted that it was a "clear misstep" that the school was not placed on secure status after the incident. 

"I, along with district leadership, own that mistake. There was confusion at the time and we did not know all the details of what occurred as we do now," Replogle said in a letter obtained by FOX31 that was sent to the district.

The school district told FOX31 that reforms have been implemented since the kidnapping attempt, including security protocol enhancements, increased security presence, and prioritizing student mental health support by offering options for indoor recess as an alternative for safety and comfort.

The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump's trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods.

A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products. The increase in containers was not a surprise after President Trump lowered the 145% tariff on Chinese goods to 45%. The deadline for the tariff negotiations with China is currently set for August 12. An increase in U.S. manufacturing orders from China during the pause helped fuel China's trade surplus to $114.7 billion last month.

It's been the busiest June in the 117-year history of the port, but port officials have stressed in recent commentary that the increase in freight should not be referred to as a surge, and that tone was reiterated with the June numbers now official, and an 8% improvement over last year. Port of LA Executive Director Gene Seroka said that more than anything else, the monthly data highlights the tariff whipsaw effect. Imports had slowed significantly in May and continued to drop through the first half of June.

"Shifting timelines simply mean shifting volume and more uncertainty here at the Port of LA," said Seroka. "Looking into August, if everything holds the way we see it right now, I expect volume to ease because of those new tariffs being in place, making it more costly for American importers," he said, citing a National Retail Federation forecast for a double-digit percentage drop in cargo volume from August through November at U.S. ports.

Seroka said the year-end holiday cargo orders should already be in. "It's too late to try to negotiate orders at this point in time for that year-end product," he said.

For importers, even amid the trade war pause, the cost of the mounting tariffs has been significant for their businesses.

Bobby Djavaheri, president of Yedi Houseware, told CNBC during a monthly container update call hosted by the Port of Los Angeles that the layering of China tariffs plus stainless steel tariffs has greatly increased the tariff bill his firm is paying on air fryers and other kitchen appliances.

"Before the tariffs, one load would have cost between $1,500 to $2,000. Now it's between $40,000-$50,000," said Djavaheri.

Mike Short, president of global freight forwarding for C.H. Robinson, said even with the big June numbers at the port, some shippers are reducing import volumes and only bringing in essential products like back-to-school items.

"Others accelerated shipments to beat tariff deadlines from Southeast Asia, and many stuck to their standard peak season schedules, taking a more wait-and-see approach," said Short. "Although we're approaching traditional retail peak season for ocean, it's not likely the industry will see traditional peak volumes, as many of our 7,500 retail customers are working through inventories and being highly selective and strategic, bringing in only the essential products they must import," he said.

Trump last week issued letters covering new tariffs he plans to place on several Asian nations, while recently striking a preliminary trade deal with Vietnam that brings tariffs on many of its products up to 30%.

Short said while the recent deadline extensions provided nearly a month of breathing room, that's not enough time for most ocean shipments, which take on average between 20–30 days of transit time. East Coast travel time can be longer. For U.S. companies that need to bring in product but did not secure ocean freight, more expensive air freight is the only option.

Josh Allen, COO of ITS Logistics, said the landscape of sourcing is changing, and supply chain and logistics professionals are now charged with building new routes to move goods from manufacturing locations to end markets. When a company's manufacturing base is changed to a different country, travel time on the ocean can be longer, and the U.S. port destination can be different. "We are watching and responding to these changes in real time," Allen said. He added that despite a record June for LA's port, the broader trade slump is helping to navigate the changes. "The logistics industry can handle and recover because demand has been depressed," he said.

Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of fashion and accessories company Bogg, started to diversify her company's manufacturing in Vietnam to offset the tariffs on China, but all of the machines, product molds, and raw materials continue to come from China. "We have narrowed the production of our bags from four to two," said Vaccarella. "Originally, we cut our manufacturing by 50% but because we are now manufacturing two bags we added back some orders, but not all."

President Trump's trade deal with Vietnam is still not official, and the initial language on the deal includes a 40% additional tariff on transhipments, a reference to products that begin their manufacturing journey in China even if they are ultimately finished in another nation such as Vietnam.

Bogg temporarily increased prices back in April before Trump paused tariff schedules, but then reinstated the original pricing. "Everything is up in the air because of all the uncertainty," Vaccarella said. "After the April claw back in prices, we announced we would make a decision in July on prices, but we still have no clear picture."

Millions of federal student borrowers whose loans have been in an interest-free pause will see that relief come to an end within weeks.

The Trump administration announced on July 9 that the so-called SAVE forbearance will expire on Aug. 1, and that enrollees' education debts will begin to grow again if they don't make payments large enough to cover the accruing interest.

Nearly 7.7 million federal student borrowers enrolled in the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, the Education Department said in its press release earlier this month.

"There is a short window before interest begins to accrue again for SAVE Plan borrowers, and they need to set aside some time to decide on their next steps," said Elaine Rubin, director of corporate communications at Edvisors, which helps students navigate college costs and borrowing.

Here's what borrowers need to know about the end of the payment pause.

Former President Joe Biden rolled out the SAVE plan in the summer of 2023, describing it as "the most affordable student loan plan ever."

But millions of borrowers who signed up for the plan were caught in limbo after GOP-led lawsuits led to a block on the plan last year. The Biden administration put these borrowers in a forbearance while the legal challenges played out, and stopped interest from accruing on people's debts in the meantime. 

Forbearances are a period during which federal student loan borrowers are excused from making payments.

The Trump administration has called the SAVE plan illegal. In the announcement ending the pause, it said the Education Dept. "lacks the authority to put borrowers into a zero percent interest rate status."

The Biden administration "invented a zero percent 'litigation forbearance,' forcing taxpayers to foot the bill," the Education Dept. wrote.

Borrowers enrolled in the forbearance will not be charged interest retroactively, the department said.

Because the SAVE plan is no longer available and its interest-free forbearance is ending, borrowers need to move quickly to find a new repayment plan, experts said.

Unfortunately, the options are limited.

Currently, there is only one income-driven repayment plan available to borrowers: the Income-Based Repayment plan, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. (Income-driven repayment plans cap borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income, with the aim of making payments affordable.)

President Donald Trump's "one big beautiful bill" establishes another IDR repayment plan, known as RAP, but that plan won't be operational until next year.

"The Department urges SAVE borrowers to consider enrolling in the Income-Based Repayment Plan authorized under the Higher Education Act until the Department can launch the Repayment Assistance Plan," the agency said in its release.

The European Union on Monday called in representatives from Elon Musk's xAI after the company's social network X, and chatbot Grok, generated and spread anti-semitic hate speech, including praise for Adolf Hitler, last week.

A spokesperson for the European Commission told CNBC via e-mail that a technical meeting will take place on Tuesday. 

xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Sandro Gozi, a member of Italy's parliament and member of the Renew Europe group, last week urged the Commission to hold a formal inquiry.

"The case raises serious concerns about compliance with the Digital Services Act (DSA) as well as the governance of generative AI in the Union's digital space," Gozi wrote.

X was already under a Commission probe for possible violations of the DSA.

Grok also generated and spread offensive posts about political leaders in Poland and Turkey, including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Turkish President Recep Erdogan.

Over the weekend, xAI posted a statement apologizing for the hateful content.

"First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced. ... After careful investigation, we discovered the root cause was an update to a code path upstream of the @grok bot," the company said in the statement.

Musk and his xAI team launched a new version of Grok Wednesday night amid the backlash. Musk called it "the smartest AI in the world."

xAI works with other businesses run and largely owned by Musk, including Tesla, the publicly traded automaker, and SpaceX, the U.S. aerospace and defense contractor.

Despite Grok's recent outburst of hate speech, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded xAI a $200 million contract to develop AI. Anthropic, Google and OpenAI also received AI contracts.

Meta on Monday said it has removed about 10 million profiles for impersonating large content producers through the first half of 2025 as part of an effort by the company to combat "spammy content."

The crackdown is part of Meta's broader effort to make the Facebook feed more relevant and authentic by taking action against and removing accounts that engage in "spammy" behavior, such as content created using artificial intelligence tools.

As part of that initiative, Meta is also rolling out stricter measures to promote original posts from creators, the company said in a blog post.

Facebook also took action against approximately 500,000 accounts that it identified to be engaged in inauthentic behavior and spam. These actions included demoting comments and reducing distribution of content, which are intended to make it harder for these accounts to monetize their posts.

Meta said unoriginal content is when images or videos are reused without crediting the original creator. Meta said it now has technology that will detect duplicate videos and reduce the distribution of that content.

The action against spam and inauthentic content comes as Meta increases its investment in AI, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday announcing plans to spend "hundreds of billions of dollars" on AI compute infrastructure to bring the company's first supercluster online next year.

This mandate comes at a time when AI is making it easier to mass-produce content across social media platforms. Other platforms are also taking action to combat the increase of spammy, low-quality content on social media, also known as "AI slop."

Google's YouTube announced a change in policy this month that prevents content that is mass-produced or repetitive from being eligible for being awarded revenue.

This announcement sparked confusion on social media, with many users believing this was a reversal on YouTube's stance on AI content. However, YouTube clarified that the policy change is aimed at curbing unoriginal, spammy and repetitive videos.

"We welcome creators using AI tools to enhance their storytelling, and channels that use AI in their content remain eligible to monetize," said a spokesperson for YouTube in a blog post to clarify the new policy.

YouTube's new policy change will take effect on Tuesday.

The U.S. Department of Defense on Monday said it's granting contract awards of up to $200 million for artificial intelligence development at Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and xAI.

The DoD's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office said the awards will help the agency accelerate its adoption of "advanced AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges." The companies will work to develop AI agents across several mission areas at the agency.

"The adoption of AI is transforming the Department's ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries," Doug Matty, the DoD's chief digital and AI officer, said in a release.

Elon Musk's xAI also announced Grok for Government on Monday, which is a suite of products that make the company's models available to U.S. government customers. The products are available through the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule, which allows federal government departments, agencies, or offices to purchase them, according to a post on X.

Musk's AI startup has launched a new version of Grok and Grok for Government services after the chatbot generated and spread anti-semitic posts and other offensive content, sparking a backlash. 

OpenAI was previously awarded a year-long $200 million contract from the DoD in 2024, shortly after it said it would collaborate with defense technology startup Anduril to deploy advanced AI systems for "national security missions."

In June, the company launched OpenAI for Government for U.S. federal, state, and local government workers.

Trump's Tariffs:

President Donald Trump indicated he is open to more trade negotiations, including with the European Union, even as he insisted that his letters threatening new tariff rates are “the deals” for US trading partners.

“The letters are the deals. The deals are made. There are no deals to make,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday.

White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett speculated Monday that new tariff policies are not yet sparking widespread price inflation because President Donald Trump has convinced more people to buy American.

"There's, I think, a lot of patriotism in the data," Hassett said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" when he was asked to explain why Trump's protectionist policies have not stoked higher prices, despite warnings by many economists.

The National Economic Council director pointed to a recent White House report, which found prices of imported goods fell between December and May.

"My theory, as an economist, of why that is, is that Americans, because of President Trump's leadership, have recognized that when they buy an American product, they not only get perhaps a better product, certainly a better product most of the time, but they're also making their community stronger," Hassett said.

"The bottom line is, people prefer American products," he said. 

"Therefore, the demand for imports has gone way down, so much that even with what tariffs have been there, where people would say, 'Oh, they might increase prices at least a little bit,' we've seen prices going down."

Hassett also argued that countries with which the United States has trade deficits are eating the cost of the tariffs, instead of passing on higher prices to American consumers.

Trump's tariffs are still expected to lead to higher prices this year.

And critics have noted that Trump has at least temporarily pulled back on some of his biggest tariff plans, including many announced during his "liberation day" in early April.

Others note that many importers stockpiled goods in anticipation of incoming tariffs, muting the near-term effects of the duties on prices.

Ernest Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, wrote that the methodology used in the White House's report "will understate tariff effects in their import indices."

Tedeschi, who served as the top economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers under former President Joe Biden, also cited data from Harvard University's Pricing Lab showing that prices on imported goods have risen since early March, when U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China took effect.

Overinflated home prices, high mortgage rates, rising supply and falling demand are all joining forces to cool the nation's housing market.

Annual home price growth in June was just 1.3%, down from 1.6% growth in May and the slowest rate in two years, according to ICE, a mortgage technology firm.

Nearly one-third of the largest 100 markets are now showing annual price declines of at least a full percentage point from recent highs, and the trend suggests more markets will do the same. Single-family home prices were up 1.6%, while condominium prices were down 1.4% nationally.

Inventory has been rising steadily over the past year, up 29% in June compared with the same month last year. The gains, however, began slowing this past spring. The average rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage has hovered in the high 6% range for most of this year, double what it was during the early days of the pandemic, when home prices initially took off.

"There are two competing forces in the housing market right now," said Andy Walden, head of mortgage and housing market research at ICE. "Increasing inventory levels are helping to make homes more affordable, but prices are falling in an increasing number of markets and homes are taking longer to sell, which could make homeowners reluctant to list."

Regionally, prices are still seeing big gains in the Northeast and Midwest. They are softening in the South and West. Cape Coral, Florida, saw the biggest decline, with prices down just over 9%. Austin, Texas, and Tampa, Florida, are also seeing price declines, as are seven of the 10 major markets in California.

Crypto:

Vanguard's campus in Paoli, Pennsylvania.

Bitcoin is not “appropriate” for long-term investors. Also, digital assets are more a speculation and less an investment. And they're an “immature asset class” with little history and “no inherent economic value” that can wreak “havoc” on portfolios. 

Vanguard Group Inc. executives, channeling the logic of the venerable Jack Bogle, have made their opinions on crypto clear. Yet thanks to the cold logic of index investing, the $10 trillion money-management giant is now the biggest backer of Strategy, the software firm that famously reinvented itself as a proxy for Bitcoin and became a poster child for the industry's ambitions.

Extreme Weather:

Debris fill the banks of the Guadalupe River in Center Point, Texas, on July 13.

Central Texas is facing the threat of more flooding as persistent storms bring heavy rain to the area, while a separate system will unleash downpours on New York City and throughout the Mid-Atlantic. 

Monday has begun with one round of rain in Central Texas, which will likely be followed by another later tonight, said Bryan Jackson, a forecaster with the US Weather Prediction Center. On Sunday, recovery efforts in the region were paused as the flood risk rose more than a week after devastating deluges killed at least 130 people and left dozens missing.

The ongoing boom in women's soccer is delivering a tourism spending boost to Switzerland this summer, as international visitors descend for the Euro 2025 tournament.

The number of travelers to Switzerland increased 12% year-on-year over the first week of the competition, according to figures shared exclusively with CNBC by payments giant Visa based on its cardholders. Visitor numbers from Germany, Poland and the Netherlands jumped 25%, arrivals from the U.K. rose 20%, while Italy and France saw upticks of 15% and 10%, respectively.

Spending meanwhile rose 27% for the week starting July 2 across the country's host locations, which include Basel, Bern, Geneva and Zurich, as well as the smaller towns of St. Gallen, Sion and Thun.

Restaurant takings nearly doubled in Bern, as spending on entertainment more than tripled by the picturesque lakeside shores of Thun, which hosted Norway v Iceland and Spain v Belgium last week. Retail goods spending in Switzerland was up 30%, which Visa Europe's Chief Marketing Officer Kim Kadlec said showed the tournament's "powerful ripple effect, with an increase in real-time consumer spending across industries."

The sight of packed major stadiums for women's soccer matches — which are now expected throughout Euro 2025 — once seemed a long way off. The women's game only started to become professionalized at a club level, key to overall talent development, in the 2010s.

Euro 2022, hosted by England, proved a landmark success in terms of reach as more than a decade of grassroots sporting investment, new and expanded broadcasting deals, and increased public and media interest came to fruition.

The nearly 90,000-strong attendance for England's final against Germany at London's Wembley Stadium was the highest-ever for either a men's or women's Euro final, tournament ticket sales increased almost fourfold to 60 million euros ($70 million), and global live TV viewership soared to 365 million from 178 million in 2017 and 116 million in 2013.

Breakthroughs for the global game have also included the equal pay deal agreed stateside in 2022 by US Soccer, and a five-year rights agreement with broadcasters Sky Sports and the BBC for the English Women's Soccer League starting 2025 which is set to give unprecedented reach to matches. Those come even as deal sizes and overall funding and viewership remain dwarfed by the juggernaut of the men's game, the world's most-watched sport.

New records are already being broken at Euro 2025, with advance ticket sales totaling 600,000 and selling out 22 of 31 matches. Of those, 35% were purchased by international visitors, according to organizing body UEFA. 

"Already there are 61,000 Germans, 41,000 English, 16,000 French, 15,000 Dutch and 5,000 American fans," Nadine Kessler, UEFA director for women's football, said in a statement last month.

"I think we are at 114 nationalities and that's exactly what we want – that's unheard of in women's football – and it shows we have taken the right lessons from England 2022."

July 14 marks the start of a weeklong event in Congress that could see further legislative support extended to the cryptocurrency market.

Crypto policy has been a key area of focus for the Trump administration, creating a steady tailwind for the market in recent months. Bitcoin prices recently surged to new record highs as it passed $120,000, sparking bullish predictions for how far the rally could go.

Now, a slew of bills aimed to bolstering digital assets could create a fresh positive catalyst for prices.

This week, House Committee on Financial Services Chairman French Hill recently stated that "The House of Representatives looks forward to considering the CLARITY Act, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, and the Senate's GENIUS Act as part of Congress' efforts to make America the crypto capital of the world."

The CLARITY Act is aimed at defining regulatory oversight for digital assets, while the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act would limit the power of the Federal Reserve to create a central bank digital currency.

Already passed in the Senate, the GENIUS Act would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

Here's what crypto pros told Business Insider about what to expect from this week's legislative crypto bonanza.

While no new crypto bills have been fully passed yet, optimism for legislative support has helped fuel gains for bitcoin and other cryptos this year.

"This growing optimism suggests that clearer rules could restore trust and bring cautious investors back into the fold," Adrian Fritz, head of research at 21Shares, told BI. "US crypto stocks and bitcoin are rallying as traders position themselves ahead of next week's expected publicity."

Fritz also cited stronger global liquidity and lower geopolitical tensions as contributing factors to bitcoin's latest rally past $120,000, but still sees the crypto push on Capitol Hill as an important catalyst.

"[The CLARITY Act] is incredibly important to help further institutionalize and onshore secondary market activity in the US. This should help improve counterparty risk, improve liquidity, and improve the ability for investors seeking risk managed solutions to get them in well regulated vehicles," Tony Fenner-Leitão, president at Cambrian Asset Management, said.

A consensus among many crypto experts is that stablecoins are likely to see significant momentum as crypto week unfolds. This could prove highly beneficial to companies like Circle and Coinbase, which have high exposure to the fiat-backed digital assets.

Fritz said that under the GENIUS Act, stablecoins would be recognized as programmable money, likely leading to further integration into payment systems.

"The stablecoin sector is thus positioned for significant expansion, likely experiencing increased institutional adoption for remittances, e-commerce transactions, and decentralized finance (DeFi) collateral" he said.

He added that blockchain networks, such as ethereum and solana, are likely to rise benefit as well, since they serve as the underlying infrastructure for stablecoins.

Chris Kline, COO & co-founder of BitcoinIRA, also flagged a possible boost to stablecoins, highlighting the benefits for stablecoin infrastructure and compliance frameworks that can stem from further regularity clarity. "Stablecoins and tokenized assets represent the most immediate growth opportunities," he told Business Insider. "These sectors will likely experience complementary rather than competitive development."

Doug Carrillo, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Bitstop & GoldATM predicts that crypto week will spur growth for stablecoins but also highlighted another asset class that's likely to benefit.

"Tokenized assets (treasuries, real estate, gold, etc.) will experience accelerated growth as clear frameworks reduce perceived legal risks, opening opportunities for new markets," he stated.

All three crypto bills being mulled in Congress are expected to garner strong support, and the market implications for such a vote of confidence from lawmakers are powerful.

"Passage in the House would mark a historic milestone as the most comprehensive crypto legislation package ever approved by a chamber of Congress," Fritz noted.

Sahel Ahyaie Assar, an international tax attorney who serves as blockchain and digital asset practice group leader at Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney, sees legislation on stablecoins as being particularly important this week.

"As currently drafted, the GENIUS Act's treatment of decentralized protocols and 'digital commodity' classification will be most impactful. If DeFi protocols receive treatment akin to commodities or software platforms—as distinguished from securities issuers—it may change the entire posture of the U.S. crypto enforcement regime," she stated.

Anthony Tuths, a tax principal and digital asset practice leader at KPMG, predicts that even more changes will be coming for the financial sector in the wake of crypto week.

"As the financial system adopts blockchain technology, you will see markets trade 24/7 and the back-office related support shrink," he stated. "The programmable money and intra-day collateral movements will save large financial institutions billions due to greater capital efficiency."

President Trump's trade war is leading importers to hold more cash and less inventory on their books as they seek to manage a series of tariff increases, additional threats from Trump, and temporary pauses. 

Among both U.S. and global firms, use of supply chain financing programs that allow importers to stretch out payment terms is up, according to Wells Fargo data, anywhere from 5%-10%.

"Cash is good to have," said Jeremey Jansen, managing director, head of global supply chain and trade sales at Wells Fargo. "There is a lot of uncertainty, and if you are a distributor or manufacturer, there is a ton of pressure to push out payment terms," he said.

Delays in the implementation of tariffs, set to expire by August if trade deals are not reached, have played a significant role in the management of inventory and cash in recent months. 

From large retailers to auto parts stores and manufacturers, buyers of both finished goods and raw materials, tariff pauses allowed importers to bring in more inventory. But once the inventory arrives, it may be bound for financing rather than straight to market. 

After an order has been shipped, an invoice is generated. Once that invoice is generated, an importer sends it to the bank where they maintain a supply chain financing program, and the bank pays the supplier. The importer than repays the bank under a timeline negotiated with the bank.

"We are putting money right in the middle of that supply chain," Jansen said.

While the retail sector has traditionally been a client for this type of financing, Jansen said health care firms are a new source of interest as President Trump threatens targeted tariffs on the sector's overseas supply chains.

"We are seeing a significant level of interest in supply chain finance from the health care space," Jansen said. "It can be drug companies, distributors, and pharmacy benefit managers. This industry does a lot of overseas manufacturing, and there is a significant amount of uncertainty regarding tariffs," he added. 

Supply chain financing for Chinese-made goods was steady rather than rising in June, according to Jansen, due to the fact that companies had front-loaded significant inventory in the first quarter of the year.

With the latest round of tariffs on Asian nations announced last week and the recent deal with Vietnam that sent tariffs higher on its goods, Jansen said the bank is monitoring supply chain financing for orders out of countries including Vietnam, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. 

Companies that are bringing in goods under a higher tariff can move that inventory off their books by having a third party, such as a bank, pay for the inventory, making the third party the beneficial cargo owner, storing the goods on the importer's behalf. The importer then pays the third party for the product and storage on an agreed timeline.

"There's an increase in importer interest in financing the inventory on their books," said Jonathan Heuser, head of trade & supply chain finance for Citizens Bank. "With large multinationals potentially holding more inventory, they are interested in ways to unlock working capital associated with that inventory," he added.

Josh Allen, COO of ITS Logistics, says the process of pushing inventory off the balance sheet — often referred to as "vendor management inventory" — is also a common practice in the automotive industry and construction industries.

"It frees up the importer's cash flow, and the third-party owner makes money through the storage and sale back to the importer. It's a win-win for strategic partners," Allen said.

After what had been a dramatic decline in business with Asian countries earlier in the year amid Trump's tariff threats, there has been some recovery in recent months during tariff pauses, according to Heuser. "For China, this recovery has been muted, and volumes are still quite depressed. With India and Vietnam, the recovery has been stronger, and continues to build back," he said.

The trade activity has been uneven across sectors, Heuser said, with agricultural product shipments as one example that has performed better than manufactured products or chemicals. That has become an opportunity for companies that have the ability to source outside of the U.S., for example, supplying Chinese buyers with the same commodity but sourcing it from a non-U.S. jurisdiction. 

But those shifts within the supply chain come with an overall environment which remains cautious, according to Heuser. "Clients are remaining cautious and waiting for some measure of stabilization before taking significant actions or making meaningful changes to supply chains," he said. 

Lending activity, for example, which can often be an indicator of investment and growth plans, remains muted, he added.

The classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich is getting a modern day upgrade and backing from some top athletes.

Jams, a new company created by 26-year-old Connor Blakley, launched Monday and hopes to take on Smucker's Uncrustables as the next locker room and lunch box staple. Like Uncrustables, the sandwiches fall in the frozen foods category.

Backed by names like U.S. soccer legend Alex Morgan and NFL Pro Bowlers C.J. Stroud and Micah Parsons, Jams will be available exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores nationwide.

Uncrustables has dominated the market with a near PB&J monopoly, but Blakley is hoping to differentiate his products by appealing to health-conscious consumers.

"No. 1 is it's no seed oils," he said. "We have no dyes, no artificial flavors or colors, no high fructose corn syrup, and we have the most protein per ounce of any peanut butter and jelly that's currently on the market."

Smucker's parent company J.M. Smucker, late last month said it would remove synthetic food colors from all of its consumer food products by the end of 2027. 

Jams is a slightly larger product than the Smuckers option, at a weight of 74 grams versus Uncrustables' 58 grams. Blakley also said his product has a lower total sugar content, and each sandwich contains 10 grams of protein.

Walmart also stocks Uncrustables at a $4.34 price point. Jams will cost slightly more at $5.97 per box.

Jams will initially be available in two flavors: strawberry and a mixed berry option.

The entrepreneur, who dropped out of high school when he was 17, said he has taste-tested more than 250 iterations of PB&J sandwiches in the process of developing Jams. The sandwiches are manufactured in Ohio and Wisconsin.

But Blakley has a steep hill to climb.

In its most recent earnings call in June, J.M. Smucker said it is on track to generate over a billion dollars in net sales by the end of fiscal 2026 from Uncrustables, noting that they are the No. 1 product in the the total frozen category.

To support the rising demand, Smucker's recently opened its third and largest Uncrustables manufacturing facility in McCalla, Alabama.

Blakley said he believes the key market for his sandwiches will be athletes.

NFL teams consume more than 80,000 Uncrustables per year as a growing number of teams and athletes look for a fast, convenient and filling snack, according to a 2024 report by The Athletic.

"Athletes want to get the best possible products to fuel their body and lifestyle," Blakley said.

He attributed the success of the peanut butter and jelly sandwich to two things: nostalgia and ease.

"I think convenience is really, really a big part of why this category has and will continue to take off," he said.

The European Union has been left scrambling after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would slap a 30% tariff on goods imported from the bloc beginning Aug. 1.

European leaders were quick to respond, saying they would still work to strike an agreement with the U.S. before the start of August. The EU also further delayed countermeasures which were set to come into effect this week and warned that preparations for additional retaliatory moves were underway.

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Monday told reporters that the letter had been received with "regret and disappointment ... especially considering the advanced stage of our ongoing negotiations."

Sefcovic stressed that the EU was still focused on finding a negotiated solution, but was preparing for all possible outcomes — which could include countermeasures. He also said that he would speak to his U.S. counterparts later in the day.

"I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort," the trade commissioner said.

With less than a month before Trump's new deadline, the European Union will have to act fast to prevent the tariffs from coming into effect or risk further escalation.

While EU leaders remain determined to strike a deal, economists and analysts warned that the threat of a 30% tariff rate has nevertheless added fresh pressure to the 27-member block.

"It's very bad news for Europe," Alicia Garcia-Herrero, senior fellow at Bruegel and chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, told CNBC's "Europe Early Edition" on Monday.

"Trump is pushing the commission to really come up with a better deal," she added.

Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, and Inga Fechner, a senior economist at ING who focuses on global trade, struck a similar tone.

"Trump's letter to the EU is not a love letter but also not a hate letter. It's a letter to increase pressure in the ongoing negotiations," they said in a note on Sunday.

The EU however still has options, the economists said, suggesting that one approach could be for the EU to offer to boost its purchasing of U.S. products ranging from soybeans to military equipment.

Brussels could also reduce existing tariffs and other trade hurdles on items such as U.S. cars, or introduce export bans on products that are important to the U.S. such as European-made pharmaceuticals, Brzeski and Fechner said.

"The fourth and final option would be to go into outright retaliation with either increasing tariffs on US goods or the nuclear option in trade: tariffs on digital services but also tighter regulations on US tech firms," the economists suggested, noting, however that this would likely trigger a full blown trade war.

Despite the additional pressure for the EU, the expectation remains that the bloc and Washington D.C. will strike a agreement in the coming weeks.

"I think both sides will strike a compromise. This is in the best interest of both the U.S. and the European Union," said Joerg Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank.

"I expect in the end, a kind of average tariff rate for the European Union for exports to the U.S. in the area of 15%," he told CNBC'S "Europe Early Edition" on Monday.

Notably, this rate would be higher than the 10% that had previously been anticipated by many and is in line with the deal that has been agreed upon by the U.K. and U.S.

Berenberg Economist Salomon Fiedler meanwhile appeared more optimistic, saying in a note that the bank was still expecting 10% duties even as "the risks are now strongly skewed towards higher rates."

One reason for optimism is that Trump has repeatedly taken extreme positions initially, and then later compromised, Fiedler argued. "The fact that Trump only threatened the new 30% rate for 1 August, instead of implementing it more quickly, suggests he is still looking to negotiate," he said.

Trump may also shy away from further tariffs as businesses start passing on higher import costs to consumers, Fiedler suggested. The domestic political backdrop may also change, which could make it less important for the U.S. president to try and keep public attention on trade, he added.

On the flipside, risk factors for higher levies include the unlikelihood that the U.S.' trade deficits — which Trump has often used as an argument for tariffs — will disappear, and the U.S. administration's reliance on tariff incomes to supplement its budget, according to Fiedler.

"The always remote hope of a good negotiation outcome — the bilateral removal of all tariffs and some other trade barriers between the EU and the US — has all but disappeared from view by now," he noted.

Trump's Immigration Policy:

The Trump administration's $45 billion for detention is raising fresh concerns over law enforcement visits to families.

A group of armed federal agents greeted a family in Spokane, Washington, when they opened their front door to run an errand. They bolted back into the house. Undeterred, the agents pounded on the doors and windows, asking for a 16-year-old boy by name.

From inside, the family agreed to speak to the agents and answer a few questions: Was the boy going to school? Was he being fed? How did he injure himself in gym class? Then, the agents left. They haven't returned.

Trump's Tariffs:

Despite the wild swings in trade policies, these entrepreneurs say the math on reshoring doesn't work for them.

For years, it was a winning business model: A startup in the US would have a clever idea for the kind of everyday product that everybody else wished they'd thought of first. The design and innovation were American, but the manufacturing was outsourced to a country with much cheaper production costs, such as China, Mexico or Vietnam.

That model was a feature of many of the businesses that appear on the hit television series Shark Tank, in which entrepreneurs pitch their idea to a panel of potential investors. Landing a spot on the show has been a coveted prize for any small business given the visibility—and sales boost—it typically brings.

French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday announced plans for a substantial increase in defense spending over the next few years, warning of imminent threats to France and wider Europe's security.

″Since 1945, freedom has never been so threatened, and never so seriously," Macron said, addressing leaders of the armed forces on the eve of the Bastille Day national holiday.

″To be free in this world, you must be feared. To be feared, you must be powerful," he said, in comments released by the Elysee Palace. Macron cited Russia, the ongoing war in Ukraine, cybercrime and terrorism as threats to national and European freedom.

Macron called for to raise defense spending by 3.5 billion euros ($4.09 billion) next year and by another 3 billion in 2027. That would take the total amount spent on security that year to 64 billion euros — double the defense budget the the French armed forces had in 2017, when Macron first became president.

French lawmakers must approve the increases before they can be enacted. France's parliament, the National Assembly, has already endured months of wrangling over the wider 2025 national budget and cost savings, with arguments leading to a previous government collapse late last year.

France is attempting to rein in its yawning budget deficit, which hit 5.8% in 2024, along with public debt that amounted to 113% of the gross domestic product over the period.

Macron said more details on the plans would be announced by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Tuesday when he gives an update on the 2026 budget. More "austerity" measures could be revealed at the time — or tax hikes, which would be unpopular with the Right.

On Sunday, Macron called on his compatriots to work for the greater good.

"The nation needs you," Macron said, adding that "every French man and woman must be cognitive of the threat around us," adding that, "we all need to make sacrifices. Freedom has a price tag." 

That price tag might be too high for lawmakers to accept, particularly those on the Left, who are already railing against spending cuts. Savings need to be made to reduce the budget deficit, which the government is targeting at 5.4% this year and 4.6% in 2026.

Getting to the 2026 target implies that 40 billion euros' ($46 billion) worth of savings need to be found this year, Finance Minister Eric Lombard said in April.

"I am sticking to the target of 4.6% for 2026, which will require an extra and very considerable effort worth 40 billion euros," Lombard told BFM TV, in comments translated by Reuters.

"We are in a state of emergency, regarding our budget," he added.

One of Google's most powerful leaders is someone who long tried to distance his company from the search giant.

AI mastermind and chess wiz Demis Hassabis, who founded DeepMind and later sold it to Google in 2014, has been propelled into the center of Google's universe in the past two years amid the frenzied race for AI dominance.

After years of trying to create more independence for DeepMind — shielding the AI research lab from the search giant — Hassabis was thrust into the belly of the beast in 2023 when Google merged DeepMind with its internal AI efforts.

Now, company insiders close to Hassabis say he is destined for even greater heights that may give him more control over the powerful AI technology he builds — and possibly one day lead the company.

Whether he's interested in those ambitions is another matter.

For years, Hassabis hoped the AI race would be one led by academics and scientists in research labs, with international organizations to prevent AI's misuse and to map humanity's path through a new era of technological transformation.

Hassabis now faces the pressures of pushing the frontiers of AI and also building it into Google's commercial products. He's wrangling a 6,000-plus team inside Google's AI engine room that has accrued increasingly more power and talent—Google DeepMind just poached the core team of the AI coding startup Windsurf, which rival OpenAI had previously planned to acquire.

The stakes have never been higher: He has to keep Google ahead of corporate rivals and keep the US ahead of China.

"His rise reminds me of Sundar's," said a longtime Google employee who has worked closely with Hassabis and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. "All of a sudden, you started hearing this name Sundar internally, and he kept having more and more responsibility, and all of a sudden, he was the CEO."

"Demis' rise has been similar," the employee added. "Now, all of a sudden, he's responsible for what is probably the most important team at Google right now."

Business Insider spoke to more than a dozen company insiders for this story. They described how Google tapped its ultimate AI weapon in Hassabis, who has the makings of a CEO — and whose ascent within Google has come with trade-offs. Google declined to make Hassabis available for an interview.

A British-born cognitive neuroscience Ph.D., Hassabis cofounded DeepMind in 2010 with the goal of one day creating a general-purpose artificial intelligence. In 2014, Hassabis sold the company to Google for $650 million with a caveat: It would create an AI ethics board that would limit how Google could use DeepMind's technology.

In the years to come, Hassabis would take this further, fighting to create legal thicker walls between his lab and the search giant, BI previously reported. For one thing, DeepMind's leaders worried that their AI would be used for military purposes.

After ChatGPT became a hit in late 2022, Google leaders ordered several pivots inside the company to address the potential threat to the search giant's business. In DeepMind earlier that year, Hassabis had told staff that he planned to reorient his lab toward building an AI assistant. One former employee said they were confused at the time as to how DeepMind could ever build something that would directly compete with Google's own Assistant.

It soon didn't matter. In 2023, after talks to secure DeepMind's independence failed, Pichai announced the unit would fuse with Google's internal AI lab, and they merged their AI assistant efforts. Google was caught flat-footed by OpenAI's ChatGPT and needed a battle plan. Google DeepMind, a fusion of the company's two premier AI labs, was the answer, and Hassabis is in its driver's seat.

Hassabis has done more managing than ever since. Merging DeepMind with the Brain team from Google Research meant Hassabis had to oversee the merging of two units that historically had behaved more like competitors than colleagues.

Years before the merger, things had gotten so bad between both organizations trying to scoop one another that Hassabis had DeepMind's code locked so it wasn't visible to Google employees. Now, bringing them together meant deciding who should sit under whom, leading to some political infighting, according to multiple people who were there.

DeepMind also used different programming technology than Google — a decision Hassabis made to avoid dependencies on Google teams — and so the merger posed a large technical challenge. A Google spokesperson said these issues had since been resolved.

Thrusting Hassabis into the driver's seat gave him more power but less control. For example, Hassabis has had to change his stance on what were once red lines: In February 2024, Google dropped a pledge made in 2018 not to use its AI for military purposes, following the rest of Silicon Valley. Hassabis cosigned a blog post defending the decision.

"Since we first published our AI Principles in 2018, the AI field has evolved substantially, and we've updated our Principles to more effectively meet the environment of today. Our core commitment remains: benefits must substantially outweigh harms," a Google spokesperson told BI in a statement.

In the merger process, dozens of DeepMind employees left for other labs, pushed out by internal politics and pulled away by a red-hot AI job market. A pullback on publishing certain types of research also rankled some staff, insiders said.

"Some people joined an academic research lab and suddenly they're being asked to build products, and that's not what they wanted," a former DeepMind employee said.

Others were excited by how Google had been shaken out of its slumber, especially when cofounder Sergey Brin returned to the trenches.

The merger has required Hassabis to play a hand in the sorts of Google politicking DeepMind had for a long time avoided to some degree.

AI Studio, Google's AI developer platform, was previously part of Google's Cloud organization and became a point of contention when teams working on Google's other AI cloud platform, Vertex, saw AI Studio as a competitor internally, according to two people familiar with the matter. The AI Studio team moved to Google DeepMind earlier this year, a resolution that Hassabis helped broker, one of the people said.

A spokesperson said that both those products serve different purposes and that DeepMind and Google had historically collaborated.

"There have been many shared views and ways of working between the two teams, and the merger has been very smooth," they said.

Hassabis' new position has some employees wondering if he is being groomed to succeed Pichai and if the CEO chair could give him the level of control over Google's AI he has always wanted.

After all, if Google transforms into the AI-first company Pichai promised in 2016 — the ultimate form of Google, as cofounder Larry Page once saw it — Hassabis is the smartest bet, insiders say.

"My opinion is this is not going to happen," said another person who knows Hassabis. "But I'm less certain about that than I was a year ago."

Others close to Hassabis believe he wouldn't care for such responsibilities. Running Google means overseeing a search business and an advertising empire. It means wrangling a vocal and sometimes unhappy workforce. It means being dragged in front of Congress to answer uncomfortable questions. Above all, it means keeping shareholders happy.

"He does it because he knows the company needs it," said one former executive regarding Hassabis' elevated position running Google DeepMind. "But being CEO would push him away from the things he wants to do. This guy wants to cure cancer."

For Hassabis, the past two years have punched up an already powerful résumé.

He was a chess prodigy at age 4 and master standard by 13. At 17, he joined the computer game company Bullfrog, where, after completing his studies, he later returned to build a multimillion-selling video game (Theme Park; you might have played it). In 2010, he co-founded DeepMind, one of the world's most powerful and successful AI labs.

In 2024 alone, he oversaw a series of Google AI product launches, earned a Nobel Prize for his work on DeepMind's protein folding project, and even slipped in a knighthood for "services to artificial intelligence," bestowed upon him by King Charles III.

People who have worked with Hassabis describe him as a double threat: He's incredibly smart and can dive deep into technical topics. He also has the charm and charisma to stand in front of thousands of people and make them believe AGI will happen — and that he'll be the one to lead them there.

Devang Agrawal, a former DeepMinder, recalled how he was studying for his undergraduate degree when Hassabis visited his university and gave the students a demo where an AI system used reinforcement learning to play Atari games. Agrawal was sold on the mission, and a few years later, he was working for Hassabis.

"I think Demis has this really brilliant quality about him, to talk in an inspirational way," said Agrawal.

"Demis is very good at convincing you that you and him together are going to change the world," said another former DeepMind employee.

Hassabis can also be fiercely competitive, colleagues and friends say.

When asked about Elon Musk's AI ambitions during an interview at Davos in January, Hassabis remarked, "I think I got him into AI in the first place." In an interview with The New York Times last year, he said of fellow DeepMind founder and now Microsoft competitor Mustafa Suleyman: "Most of what he has learned about AI comes from working with me over all these years."

While he's risen as a corporate leader, people who know him say Hassabis sees himself first as a scientist. His work on AlphaFold, a project for predicting the protein structures of the human body, resulted in a new spin-off company and garnered him his Nobel Prize.

"I want to understand the fundamental nature of reality," he said during a fireside chat at Davos in January.

For him, AI is a tool to do that, and he's most comfortable when discussing the Nobel-winning breakthroughs of protein folding and the potential for AI to eradicate diseases.

"If I could wave a magic wand and create the ideal setup, everyone would be working on more narrow AI tools like AlphaFold, " he said at a recent fireside chat at Queens' College at Cambridge University. "But the technology hasn't turned out that way."

After Google bought DeepMind, the AI lab embarked on an initiative — codenamed "Watermelon" and later called "Mario" — to create thicker walls between its group and its funder. It wanted to protect its valuable creations and prevent them from being used for military or surveillance purposes.

To some employees who spoke to BI, the initiative made no sense. Why would Google spend hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire a company it could not control? Hassabis knew he was racing against the clock, multiple former and current DeepMind employees said. One recalled a presentation Hassabis once gave that finished with a warning that AI would eventually become a race.

"To be one of the people at the table to stop other people from doing bad, you also need to be at the forefront," that person said.

In April 2021, Hassabis gathered his employees to announce that the bid to form a separate legal structure had indeed failed. Hassabis spun it as a win: it meant DeepMind would continue to have access to Google's vast computing power, necessary for building vast AI systems and ultimately, Hassabis hoped, artificial general intelligence — a hypothetical level of machine intelligence that surpasses human cognition across a range of areas.

What DeepMind most lacked was leverage. When Hassabis sold the company to Google in 2014, the AI landscape looked starkly different. Before selling to Google, a person familiar with the matter said Hassabis considered forming a second company to build video games and fund DeepMind's research.

Google's $650 million price tag looks like a bargain when compared to OpenAI's $6.6 billion funding round or the $14.3 billion Meta is spending to invest in Scale AI.

Hassabis was simply too early.

"In 2014, DeepMind didn't have enough money," said another former DeepMind employee "They needed to raise it to work on something that seemed crazy to most people."

Google cofounder Page convinced Hassabis to sell, promising to give DeepMind a large amount of independence. The arrangement allowed DeepMind to continue its research without being part of Google's corporate bureaucracy, while also giving the company access to what would become more valuable than anything else: compute power.

"Whereas today there's enough interest where you can raise enough money without giving away the whole company, so they get to retain control. I can just imagine that's how Demis would prefer things — to be in control," one former employee said.

Hassabis now walks a difficult line between his own interests regarding AGI and those of Google's shareholders. Running Google's control room now means pushing the frontiers of AI research while infusing it into the company's suite of products, from Search to Maps to Workspace. Over the past year, the team has absorbed more parts of Google, including the team for its Gemini chatbot, consolidating more power under Hassabis.

At the same time, Google DeepMind has scaled back the types of papers it publishes to prevent rivals from taking Google's ideas. Research breakthroughs relating to Gemini or the pursuit of AGI now stay within Google's walls, according to multiple people familiar with the strategy — another compromise Hassabis has made as the capitalist engine spins into overdrive.

It's a change in tune from 2016 when Hassabis told Bloomberg Businessweek that work on AI should be carried out in an "open way" and that DeepMind did this by "publishing everything we write."

"I think ultimately the control of this technology should belong to the world, and we need to think about how that's done," he said.

​​"Google DeepMind has always been committed to advancing AI research, and we regularly update our policies to preserve the ability for our teams to publish and contribute to the broader research ecosystem," the Google spokesperson told BI.

Almost a decade later, Hassabis appears to still be wrestling with his concerns, though it's unclear if he has the power to do much about them while running Google's corporate AI engine.

At SXSW London in June, Hassabis again called for international cooperation to better safeguard the transformative technology he sees coming.

In recent years, he has become more vocal about his concerns that the world is not ready for AGI. At I/O in May, he and Brin predicted AGI would arrive around 2030.

People aren't thinking enough about AI's long-term implications, Hassabis has said.

"What's going to happen in the next five, 10-year timescale is going to be monumental," he said at Davos earlier this year, "and I think that's not understood yet."

"But I do think we should be thinking very carefully about these next steps."

Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) surged to a fresh all-time high of $123,231 on Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) on Monday morning, capping off a historic week that saw digital asset investment products record $3.7 billion in inflows.

This was the second-largest weekly total ever, according to CoinShares data, with the rally pushing total assets under management (AuM) for crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) to a record $211 billion.

It also marked the 13th consecutive week of inflows, bringing year-to-date figures to $22.7 billion and underscoring growing investor appetite despite volatile macroeconomic conditions.

Bitcoin led the inflow charts, attracting $2.7 billion over the week.

Its total AuM now stands at $179.5 billion, equivalent to 54% of the value held in gold ETPs for the first time.

Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) followed with $990 million in inflows, its fourth-largest weekly tally and 12th consecutive week of positive flows.

The inflows represent 19.5% of Ethereum's total AuM, nearly double Bitcoin's 9.8%.

Ethereum's price responded in kind, rising 18% over the past week to trade above $3,000.

Meanwhile, Ripple‘s (CRYPTO: XRP) rose 7% to $2.97, though it also saw the largest outflows of the week, totaling $104 million. Solana bucked the trend with $92.6 million in inflows.

Among the altcoins, Stellar (CRYPTO: XLM) was the standout performer, posting a 90% surge over the week as retail interest spiked amid broader market optimism.

Regionally, the United States dominated with $3.7 billion in inflows, while Germany recorded $85.7 million in outflows.

Switzerland and Canada saw modest gains of $65.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively.

The growing momentum in digital asset products and Bitcoin's new all-time high suggest institutional capital is returning to the crypto markets with renewed confidence, buoyed by inflation hedging narratives and continued ETF adoption.

Bitcoin BTC$119,946.07 cooled off during U.S. trading hours Monday after nearly topping $123,000 earlier in the session, but market top calls are premature, analysts said.

BTC slipped below $120,000 late in the U.S. day, shedding most of its overnight advance, but holding on to a modest 0.6% gain over the past 24 hours. Ethereum's ether {{ETH}} slid back below $3,000, while dogecoin DOGE$0.1976, Cardano's ADA {{ADA}} and Stellar's XLM {{XLM}} declined around 2%-3% on the day.

Among majors, XRP XRP$2.9328, SUI SUI$3.8447 and Uniswap's UNI {{UNI}} outperformed with 2.5%, 10% and 6% gains, respectively.

Crypto-linked stocks also retraced some of their morning gains, with Strategy (MSTR) and Galaxy (GLXY) still higher 3%-4%, while Coinbase (COIN) gained 1.5%

After BTC surged over 10% in less than a week and some altcoins advancing much more, prices may consolidate as some traders digest the move and realize profits.

Still, this leg of the crypto rally is more likely in the early phases than towards the end, said Jeff Dorman, CIO of digital asset investment firm Arca.

In a Monday investor note, he cited crypto analyst Will Clemente's observation about previous major tops like March 2024's spot bitcoin ETF-related peak and the Dec 2024/Jan 2025 frenzy surrounding the Trump election/inauguration, when open interest in altcoin derivatives flipped that of BTC

"The current rally is nowhere near that," Dorman said.

Volumes on both centralized and decentralized exchanges rose 23% week-over-week, but still aren't near to the levels during other broad-market rallies in the past, Dorman added.

Looking at the big picture, bitcoin is being propelled higher by excessive sovereign debt and investors seeking refuge from monetary inflation, said Eric Demuth, CEO of Europe-based crypto exchange Bitpanda.

He said BTC rising to €200,000 ($233,000), is "certainly a possibility," but the underlying adoption of the asset carries more importance than price targets.

"What happens when Bitcoin becomes permanently embedded in the portfolios of major investors, in the reserves of sovereign states, and in the infrastructure of global banks?," he said. "Because that's exactly what's happening right now."

In the next years, Dermuth expect bitcoin's market capitalization to gradually converge to gold's, currently sitting at over $22 trillion, nine times larger than BTC.

 The House of Representatives is set to vote on three crypto-related pieces of legislation before Congress goes on recess. 

The US House of Representatives is scheduled to consider amendments to three crypto-related bills this week addressing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), digital asset market structure and payment stablecoins.

On Monday, the Republican-led House Committee on Rules will meet to discuss the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act and the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, or GENIUS Act, as part of the party's “crypto week” push. 

Discussions of the three bills included several amendments submitted by Democratic lawmakers to address what they called crypto “corruption” in the US government.

The GENIUS Act, which is expected to be Republicans' priority after the Senate passed the legislation with bipartisan support in June, included four alternative versions of the bill introduced by California Representative Maxine Waters. 

The lawmaker has spearheaded many of the Democrats' efforts in the House to push back against the bills, citing US President Donald Trump's alleged conflicts of interest through his family-backed crypto company World Liberty Financial, its stablecoin, USD1 and his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP).

“This week, the House will consider several crypto bills, including the so-called CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act, which proponents claim will establish a pro-innovation regulatory framework for crypto that also safeguards consumers and investors,” Waters said in a Monday MSNBC op-ed. “But the reality is that they would be passing bills written by and for the crypto industry.”

Related: ‘Crypto Week' approaches: Will these three pro-crypto bills pass?

Among Waters' submitted amendments to the GENIUS Act was a provision to block any US president, vice president, members of Congress and their immediate families from promoting or holding crypto. 

She also proposed that the US Treasury Secretary “cannot deem a foreign country to have a stablecoin regime comparable to that of the US if the current leader of that country has described themselves as a dictator” — possibly a reference to El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who called himself the “world's coolest dictator.” 

On the Republican side, Ohio Representative Warren Davidson suggested an amendment to include additional language for “an individual's right to maintain a hardware wallet or software wallet for the purpose of facilitating the individual's own lawful custody of digital assets.” The provision was identical to the language used in the CLARITY Act.

The House Committee on Rules meeting will mark the first of what could be several attempts from lawmakers in the chamber to get the crypto bills ready for a floor vote before Congress breaks for an August recess. According to the congressional calendar, the House will have only eight days in session in July before going on recess.

“I believe the bills we will have on the floor this week will protect investors, consumers, and make America as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation,” said Arkansas Representative French Hill, who chairs the House Financial Services Committee. 

Before debate on the amendments to the crypto bills and potential votes, lobbying groups tied to the industry urged lawmakers to pass the legislation. Stand With Crypto, an advocacy organization tied to Coinbase, called for action on the CLARITY Act.

 Bitcoin holds above $120,000 as corporate crypto treasury building and robust spot BTC ETF buying continue to support the new price range. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is facing profit booking near $123,000, pointing to a minor consolidation or correction in the near term.

Several major altcoins have broken above their overhead resistance levels, indicating the start of a new uptrend.

Bitcoin (BTC) started the new week on a strong note, rising above $123,000, but higher levels are witnessing some profit booking. A positive sign is that the bulls are trying to maintain the price above $120,000.

Bitcoin exchange-traded funds saw their first-ever back-to-back inflows of more than $1 billion on Thursday and Friday, according to Farside Investors data. That suggests investors expect the rally to continue.

Michael Saylor's Strategy was not to be left behind, and it resumed its BTC purchase after a one-week gap. The company said in a Monday US Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it had bought 4,225 BTC at an average price of $111,827. The latest acquisition boosted Strategy's holdings to 601,550 BTC.

BTC's dominance of the total crypto market capitalization rose above 66% at the end of June but has since retreated below 65%. The small pullback has caused several altcoins to surge in the short term. 

Historically, an altseason starts after BTC's dominance reverses after hitting 70%. Trader and analyst Rekt Capital said in a post on X that one can imagine the extent of the altcoin rally after BTC's dominance drops by double digits. 

Will BTC continue to frustrate the bears or correct in the short term? Could altcoins build upon their rally? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out. 

The S&P 500 Index (SPX) has been maintaining above the breakout level of 6,147, indicating that the bulls are holding on to their positions as they anticipate further upside.

The 6,147 level is the critical support to watch out for on the downside. A break and close below 6,147 may trap the aggressive bulls, pulling the price to the 50-day simple moving average (5,977).

Contrarily, if the price turns up from the current level of 6,147, it indicates that the uptrend remains intact. The index could surge toward 6,500, where the bears are expected to mount a strong defense.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) rose above the 20-day exponential moving average (97.77) on Friday, indicating that the selling pressure is reducing.

The index could extend the relief rally to the 50-day SMA (98.83), which is likely to act as a stiff obstacle. If the price turns down from the 50-day SMA but rebounds off 97.92, it suggests the index has formed a higher low. That enhances the prospects of a rally above the 50-day SMA. If that happens, the up move could reach 100.54 and then 102.

This optimistic view will be negated in the near term if the price turns down sharply from the current level or the 50-day SMA and plunges below 96.37. That could start the next leg of the downtrend to 95.

Bitcoin rallied to a new all-time high of $123,218 on Monday, but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the candlestick.

The overbought level on the relative strength index (RSI) suggests the BTC/USDT pair may enter a minor correction or consolidation in the near term.

The pullback is expected to find support at the 20-day EMA ($111,843). If that happens, it signals that the bullish momentum remains intact. Buyers will then try to push the pair above $123,218, starting the next leg of the uptrend toward the target objective of $150,000.

The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the price plunges below the 50-day SMA ($107,631).

The long wick on Ether's (ETH) candlestick on Monday shows that the bears are active at higher levels.

The first support on the downside is $2,879. If the price rebounds off $2,879, it signals that the bulls are trying to flip the level into support. The ETH/USDT pair may ascend to $3,153 and then to $3,400.

Instead, if the price breaks below $2,879, it suggests profit-booking by short-term buyers. The pair may then descend to the 20-day EMA ($2,707). The bulls will have to successfully defend the 20-day EMA if they want to maintain the bullish momentum.

XRP (XRP) skyrocketed above the $2.65 overhead resistance on Friday, indicating that the buyers have overpowered the sellers.

The bears tried to pull the price back below $2.65 on Saturday, but the bulls held their ground. That suggests the bulls are trying to flip the $2.65 level into support. There is minor resistance at $3, but if the level is crossed, the XRP/USDT pair could soar to $3.20 and then to $3.40.

A note of caution is that the rally has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought zone. That increases the risk of a minor correction or consolidation in the short term. However, the bulls remain in charge as long as the price sustains above $2.65.

BNB (BNB) rose above the $698 resistance on Monday, but the long wick on the candlestick shows selling at higher levels.

The upsloping 20-day EMA ($669) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate that buyers are in command. If the price sustains above $698, the BNB/USDT pair could rally to $732 and then to $761. 

The 20-day EMA is the vital support to watch out for on the downside. If the support cracks, the pair could slump to the 50-day SMA ($658) and later to $640. That suggests the break above $698 may have been a bull trap.

Solana (SOL) completed a bullish inverse H&S pattern on a close above $159 on Thursday, and the bulls successfully defended the retest of the breakout level on Saturday.

There is minor resistance at $168, but if the level is crossed, the SOL/USDT pair could reach $185. Sellers are expected to defend the $185 level with all their might because if they fail in their endeavor, the pair could surge toward $210 and then to $220.

The 20-day EMA ($155) is the crucial support to watch out for on the downside. Sellers will have to pull and maintain the price below the 20-day EMA to indicate a comeback.

Dogecoin (DOGE) is facing resistance at $0.21, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not ceded ground to the bears.

The upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.18) and the RSI near the overbought zone indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside. If buyers drive the price above $0.21, the DOGE/USDT pair could climb to $0.26. Sellers are expected to mount a vigorous defense at $0.26, but the pair could surge to $0.35 if the bulls prevail.

Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to defend the overhead resistance and keep the pair inside the $0.26 to $0.14 range for some more time.

Sellers tried to halt Cardano's (ADA) up move at the downtrend line, but the buyers bulldozed their way through.

The close above the downtrend line on Sunday invalidates the bearish descending triangle pattern. The ADA/USDT pair could rise to $0.86, which is likely to act as a resistance. However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.64) and the RSI in the overbought zone indicate that buyers have the edge. A close above $0.86 could propel the price to $1.

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. That suggests the break above the downtrend line may have been a bull trap.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) surged above the $45.80 overhead resistance on Friday, signaling the resumption of the uptrend.

The HYPE/USDT pair has reached the psychologically critical level of $50, where the sellers are expected to mount a strong defense. If the price turns down from $50, but rebounds off $45.80, it suggests the bullish momentum remains intact. That increases the likelihood of a rally to $60.

The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below $45.80. The pair could then descend to the 20-day EMA ($41.98), which is likely to attract buyers.

Funds offering exposure to Ethereum have been growing at a faster rate than Bitcoin counterparts, underscoring newfound demand for the asset, according to CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill.

Over the past 12 weeks, Ethereum-linked funds' assets under management have grown 19.5% to $19.6 billion, he wrote in a report on Monday. The AUM of Bitcoin-linked funds' has meanwhile increased 9.8% to $176 billion over the same period, he added.

“People are preferring Ethereum over Bitcoin,” Butterfill told Decrypt. “Although the number is lower [for Ethereum] than Bitcoin, proportionally, it's much more significant.”

Renewed interest in Ethereum comes amid the asset's climb above the $3,000 mark for the first time in five months. Although the asset's price has yet to eclipse its pandemic-era high of $4,900, Ethereum's price has surged 85% over the past three months.

At the same time, Bitcoin's price has soared to new heights, hitting $122,800 early Monday before retreating, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko.

Bitcoin had a blockbuster debut on Wall Street last year through exchanged-traded funds that now manage more than $148 billion in assets, according to crypto data provider CoinGlass. The introduction of Ethereum ETFs in the U.S. was more muted, partly due to Ethereum's narratives being less established, analysts say. Those funds have $12.7 billion in AUM. 

As chair of Ethereum treasury firm BitMine, however, Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee is among the new faces pitching Ethereum as an investment.

Last week, Ethereum-linked funds generated $990 million in inflows, while Bitcoin-linked funds pulled in $2.7 billion. Butterfill described it as “record-breaking momentum,” representing the second best week for crypto funds, overall, on record. 

Still, Bitcoin and Ethereum were relative outliers.

Solana-linked funds generated $92 million worth of inflows last week, pushing year-to-date- inflows to $206 million. Its price has risen 10% to 168% over the past week.

Although XRP's price has jumped over 31% to $3 in the past week, representing a fresh, seven-year high, investors pulled $104 million from funds for the Ripple-linked asset. That dropped year-to-date inflows to $231 million.

Butterfill highlighted the WisdomTree Physical XRP exchange-traded note, which had  $115 million in outflows last week. Because the activity was limited to one fund, he suggested that it's not a trend or “something particularly ominous.”

Still, crypto asset manager 3iQ Digital touted the adoption of its XRP-linked ETF in Canada on Monday. The firm's XRP ETF, which debuted less than a month ago, has so far taken in $50 million worth of assets, a "significant milestone,” President and CEO Pascal St-Jean said on X.

On July 7, 2025, the UK Information Commissioner's Office (the “ICO”) announced it had launched two new consultations: (1) a consultation on its approach to enforcement of the regulation 6 consent requirements of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (“PECR”); and (2) a consultation on a new chapter within its draft guidance on storage and access technologies (the “Cookie Guidance”).

PECR Consultation

The consultation into enforcement of the regulation 6 consent requirements under PECR is focused on online advertising.  Specifically, the ICO is assessing whether a risk-based approach to enforcement could enable publishers to deliver online advertising to users who have not provided their consent, where there is a low risk to the user's privacy. The ICO believes that a new approach may “create opportunities to unlock business growth through innovation” and “enable commercially viable ways to deliver online advertising.”  The ICO notes that any such methods must still be performed in accordance with data protection and privacy principles, and be methods that individuals would likely consider “acceptable” without consent.

The ICO is exploring framing guidance around the following categories of online advertising capabilities:

The ICO confirmed that the review will not impact the enforcement of compliance requirements and practices under the UK General Data Protection Regulation, clarifying that there will be certain circumstances where online advertising will always require consent, such as where extensive profiling across different services is involved.

The deadline for the consultation is August 29, 2025.

Cookie Guidance Consultation

The consultation into the new chapter of the Cookie Guidance follows the passage of the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (the “DUAA”). The chapter reflect changes to PECR introduced by the DUAA, such as the ability to use certain non-essential cookies without consent for specific low-risk functions, such as statistical analysis.

In a bid to align its Guidance with public opinion, the ICO also announced its intentions to commission further research to improve its understanding of public attitudes to online tracking and consent.

The deadline for the consultation is September 26, 2025.

(LILAMAX)- Congress is on the verge of reshaping American finance as lawmakers prepare to tackle three major cryptocurrency bills during what's being called “Crypto Week.” The legislation will address stablecoins, the development of a government-backed digital currency, and new rules for crypto trading—marking a pivotal moment in the country's approach to digital assets.

Meanwhile, the tech world is racing ahead with innovations that feel both retro and futuristic. “Call of Duty's” latest crossover brings back '90s icons Beavis and Butt-Head, but the real breakthrough is holographic gameplay. Deep tech company VividQ has unveiled display technology that projects real 3D visuals, allowing gamers to stay immersed in holographic environments for extended periods.

Artificial intelligence is also rapidly changing the business landscape. A new report from data firm Tredence predicts that by 2028, one-third of AI agents will make 15% of business decisions without any human input. The rise of “agentic AI” could flatten corporate hierarchies, empowering small teams with big responsibilities, while leadership shifts from giving orders to orchestrating intelligent, self-correcting systems.

And on Roblox, the online gaming platform now nearing 100 million daily users, teen developers are turning their passion into profit. According to Bloomberg, the 19-year-old creator of the anime-style soccer game Blue Lock: Rivals sold the title for $3 million to DO Big Studios, a major player in the Roblox ecosystem.

Oops, something went wrong

Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rallied to a record high above $121,000 early Monday as Congress opens "Crypto Week" in Washington, D.C., that will see the House of Representatives weigh three key pieces of crypto-related legislation.

The rally in bitcoin has been accompanied by a surge in stocks with crypto ties, notably Coinbase (COIN), Robinhood (HOOD), and newly public stablecoin issuer Circle (CRCL). Coinbase and Robinhood shares are trading at record highs. Circle stock has gained over 500% since its IPO in June.

The first bill up, the GENIUS Act, would implement the nation's first federal framework for stablecoins — cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to the dollar. Among the bill's central provisions, the GENIUS Act limits stablecoin issuance only to regulated issuers and requires that issuers hold reserves of dollars or another similarly liquid asset on a one-to-one basis backing the stablecoins. The legislation was passed in the Senate on June 17.

The act is now set to come up for a vote on the House floor on Tuesday, with House Republican leadership looking to send the bill to President Trump as early as the same day.

Harder to pass will be the biggest ticket item on the docket this week: The CLARITY Act, a major legislative package, will assign oversight over all digital assets except stablecoins to either the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), depending on the asset.

The act defines "digital commodities" as digital assets whose value is tied to the use of blockchain. These assets will fall under the CFTC. Digital assets sold to investors as securities — with investment contracts — will largely be regulated by the SEC.

While 71 Democrats joined Republicans in voting on a similar provision last year that died in the Senate, Republicans may face an uphill battle in getting over the 60-vote threshold from Democrats who are highly skeptical of the Trump family's deep involvement in the crypto market and want to see ethics provisions added to the bill, according to Politico.

The third bill scheduled for a floor vote this week is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which would prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a "central bank digital currency" (CBDC) and block the Fed Board of Governors from using a CBDC to enact monetary policy.

If the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC acts pass in the House, they will then go to the upper chamber for consideration before reaching President Trump's desk if the Senate pushes them through.

Company's current total of approximately $500 million of ETH exceeds the initial $250 million PIPE proceeds by over 100% 

BitMine's ETH holdings exceed 163,000

Company's Ethereum treasury strategy to strengthen broader Ethereum ecosystem 

LAS VEGAS, July 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) ("BitMine" or the "Company") today announced holdings of ETH exceeding $500 million. The Company closed on its initial private placement of $250 million on July 9th in furtherance of its asset light treasury strategy. As of July 14th at 7:45am ET, the company's ETH holdings total 163,142 at $3,072.67 per ETH (Bloomberg).


"Since closing on the $250 million private placement, we have surpassed $500 million in Ethereum holdings, which validates our mission to increase our stake in the Ethereum network," said Thomas "Tom" Lee of Fundstrat, the newly appointed Chairman of BitMine's Board of Directors.


"Since closing on the $250 million private placement, we have surpassed $500 million in Ethereum holdings, which validates our mission to increase our stake in the Ethereum network," said Thomas "Tom" Lee of Fundstrat, the newly appointed Chairman of BitMine's Board of Directors.

"We are pleased that we added significantly to our ETH treasury just 3 days after closing our private placement," said Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine. "Clearly Wall Street is getting 'ETH-pilled.'"

The Company previously stated its performance metric goal of increasing ETH held per share through a combination of reinvestment of the Company's cash flows, capital markets activities (including using volatility to lower cost of capital), and staking yield and the value of ETH is impacted by the change in value of ETH.

Thomas Lee further states: "Among Bitcoin treasury companies, we have witnessed the reflexive benefit of acquiring large holdings. Microstrategy (NASDAQ-MSTR), the leader, has accumulated more than 597,000 Bitcoin (per Microstrategy.com website). Such sizable holdings has created a 'sovereign put' for the company, meaning a nation-state views MSTR holdings as attractive if a nation ever wanted to acquire 5% of the Bitcoin network. Similarly, ETH Treasuries, which accumulate 5% of ETH supply, can benefit from a similar 'Wall Street put.' And even Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, recently said 'tokenization is the greatest capital markets innovation since the central limit order book' showing how Wall Street is converging onto crypto. And Ethereum is the layer 1 blockchain with the greatest share."

The long-anticipated CLARITY Act may prove to be a game changer for digital asset markets, potentially ushering in a wave of institutional adoption, according to a note from Benchmark analyst Mark Palmer.

The CLARITY Act aims to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S., distinguishing cryptocurrencies as either commodities or securities.

In a report published on Monday, Palmer said the legislation could provide long-sought regulatory clarity for traditional financial institutions, including asset managers, hedge funds, and banks, many of which have remained on the sidelines due to legal and compliance uncertainty.

While the current Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), under the leadership of Chairman Paul Atkins, has a "constructive stance toward crypto, the absence of a codified regulatory framework means that the possibility still exists that a future, anti-crypto administration could quickly undo any pro-crypto rules the agency put in place," the analyst wrote.

That vulnerability has made long-term planning difficult for institutional players looking to build out digital asset offerings, the report said. The act, if passed, could eliminate much of that uncertainty, providing a stable foundation for broader industry participation.

Buy-rated Galaxy Digital and Coinbase are "exceptionally well positioned" to benefit from the increased institutional adoption of crypto that would likely happen once the act is passed, the report added.

A stream of major altcoins rose on Monday morning, as leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin set a new all-time high of $122,838.

The biggest gainer of the past 24 hours among the top 100 cryptocurrencies is Algorand, which has jumped by over 15%. It's closely followed by Sui, which has risen by 14.1% to a $13.7 billion market cap, according to CoinGecko. Larger altcoins have also seen gains, albeit slightly smaller, like XRP, which has climbed 7% on the day and over 30% on the week.

Other tokens like Solana, Dogecoin, and Cardano have all advanced 2.7%, 4.2%, and 2.4% respectively. In fact, out of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, according to CoinGecko, no asset has dropped more than 0.3%.

The green day comes as Bitcoin surged past $122,000 on Monday morning. Bitcoin's price has remained strong since, falling just 0.8% below its all-time high in the hours following.

“Market sentiment in crypto remains bullish,” an analyst at derivatives exchange Bitunix said in a note shared with Decrypt. “BTC surged explosively to [$122,838], breaking out of a consolidation range and liquidating a large volume of short positions over the past 24 hours. The next potential liquidation pressure zone lies between $125,200 and $127,000.”

As for the crypto industry's second-largest asset, Ethereum has climbed 3.4% in a weekly 19.9% rise above $3,068. On Sunday, SharpLink Gaming acquired 16,374 ETH, worth approximately $48.85 million, according to Arkham Intelligence, bringing its total holdings above $652 million.

It comes amid a growing trend of public companies creating crypto treasuries, a strategy popularized by Michael Saylor's firm, uh, Strategy. Canadian company Cannabis Sativia, for example, rebranded to Dogecoin Cash this summer and has amassed $3.5 million worth of DOGE.

 Bitcoin became the world's fifth-largest asset by market capitalization on Monday, driven by a seven-day buying streak from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. 

Update July 14, 9:33 a.m. UTC: This article has been updated to include quotes from Brickken's market analyst.

Bitcoin has become the world's fifth-largest asset, overtaking Amazon by market capitalization.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rose to a new all-time high of $122,600 on Monday and has soared nearly 13% over the past week, as Cointelegraph reported.

These gains allowed Bitcoin to surpass a $2.4 trillion market capitalization, overtaking Amazon's $2.3 trillion, Silver's $2.2 trillion and Alphabet's (Google) $2.19 trillion, Companiesmarketcap data shows.

This means Bitcoin's market cap was only $730 million shy of tech giant Apple, at the time of writing.

The development signals Bitcoin's growing presence in the global financial system, according to Enmanuel Cardozo, market analyst at real-world asset tokenization platform Brickken. He told Cointelegraph:

Continued institutional accumulation and the “supportive macro environment may also help Bitcoin surpass Apple's valuation, which would imply a Bitcoin price of over $142,000, Cardozo said.

Investors aren't just setting their sights on Apple; exceeding Microsoft's market cap is also in the crosshairs. This would imply a $167,000 Bitcoin price, which “isn't outside the realm of possibility, considering the massive demand coming from spot Bitcoin ETFs,” he added.

Bitcoin's new record high comes amid a period of growing institutional adoption, which has seen corporate Bitcoin holding companies double since June 5. Over 265 companies are now holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, up from 124 just weeks ago.

A total of 3.5 million Bitcoin is held in company treasuries, with 853,000 BTC, or 4% of the total supply, in public company treasuries, and over 1.4 million BTC, or 6.6% of the supply, through spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

US spot Bitcoin ETFs ended last week's trading session with a seven-day buying streak, adding significant liquidity for Bitcoin's price momentum.

Spot Bitcoin ETFs amassed over $1 billion worth of net positive inflows on Friday, marking a seventh consecutive day of investments, Farside Investors data shows.

The inflows from the spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a significant catalyst for Bitcoin's rise to new highs.

In February 2024, the ETFs accounted for 75% of new investments into Bitcoin over a two-week period. This activity helped propel BTC price above $50,000.

Bitcoin's price may also be benefiting from heightened interest due to an event dubbed by the US government as “Crypto Week.” Lawmakers are seeking to pass three key cryptocurrency bills that are expected to bolster the national crypto industry: the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins, or GENIUS Act, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (CLARITY Act) and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which seeks to prevent the creation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC).

Three high-profile pieces of digital assets legislation are in line to be discussed by the House of Representatives during what US lawmakers have dubbed ‘Crypto Week' in Washington DC – kicking off today (14 July) – with developments set to be closely watched globally. 

The Digital Asset Market Clarity Act (Clarity Act) aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets and cryptocurrencies; the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) aims to create the first federal comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins; and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act aims to block the issuance of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) – a digital dollar.

The lower house of Congress ‘looks forward to considering' the Clarity Act, GENIUS Act and Anti-CBDC Act ‘as part of Congress's efforts to make America the crypto capital of the world,' the financial services committee said in a press notice.

Committee chairman French Hill, alongside agriculture committee chairman GT Thompson and the House leadership, awarded the moniker ‘Crypto Week' to 14-18 July in the announcement (made on 3 July). On the cusp of Crypto Week, the price of the world's best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, hit an all-time high on 11 July, trading at more than $118,000 (more than £87,000).

President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled ‘Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology' three days into his second term as president. As part of an ambition to make the US the ‘crypto capital of the world' – an unlikely scenario to have foreseen during his first presidency, when he was anti-crypto – he has since undertaken numerous ‘pro-crypto' actions, including hosting a ‘Digital Assets Summit' (also referred to as ‘Crypto Summit') at the White House.

STABLECOINS: EXPLAINED Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value by having their market value pegged to an external reference, typically fiat currency. The world's two biggest stablecoins (by market capitalisation) are Tether and USD Coin – both are, like most stablecoins, pegged to the US dollar.

“We are taking historic steps to ensure the United States remains the world's leader in innovation and I look forward to ‘Crypto Week' in the House,” Hill said in the press notice. “After years of dedicated work in Congress on digital assets, we are advancing landmark legislation to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets that safeguards consumers and investors, provides rules for the issuance and operation of dollar-backed payment stablecoins, and permanently blocks the creation of a CBDC to safeguard Americans' financial privacy.” 

“I thank my colleagues in Congress and the Trump Administration for their partnership and leadership and stand ready to work alongside the Senate [upper house] as they work to advance standalone market structure legislation by the end of September,” he added.

“Digital asset market structure legislation is long overdue,” said Thompson. “During many hearings, roundtables and other events, we have heard from countless innovators, creators, professors, lawyers and constituents. Time and again, we have heard the calls for regulatory clarity and certainty in this ecosystem. The House agriculture and financial services committees worked together to deliver Clarity, and it will soon be time for the House to deliver for the American people and send Clarity to the Senate. I thank House leadership for recognising the urgent need for Clarity to cement American leadership in the digital asset space.”

The press notice includes a reaction from Cynthia Lummis, one of two senators for the state of Wyoming, which is aiming to issue the first fiat-backed, fully-reserved stablecoin issued by a public entity in the US (the ‘Wyoming Stable Token') – a groundbreaking digital money programme for the public sector

“For the first time in US history, we have a president who sees the value in embracing digital assets, and already we are working to capitalise on that,” Lummis said.“In Wyoming, we have worked for nearly a decade to embrace digital assets, and it is exciting to see the federal government beginning to follow in the Cowboy State's footsteps. As we celebrate Crypto Week, I am thrilled to partner with chairman Hill and chairman Thompson to pass comprehensive stablecoin legislation, establish clear market structure rules, and ensure that any central bank digital currency respects Americans' privacy and financial freedom. Together, we are going to maintain America's competitive edge and ensure the United States remains the global leader in financial technology while preserving the principles that make our economy the strongest in the world.”

RELATED ARTICLE ‘Chaotic? No way…': US government's digital finance focus hailed at London event – a news story (2 May 2025) based on views of different jurisdictions digital assets-related policymaking – see below

The trajectory and momentum of US policymaking in favour of cryptocurrencies and tokenised finance under Trump's presidency is being closely followed across the world.

In the UK, for example, Trump-championed developments were repeatedly referenced during different sessions of the Innovate Finance Global Summit (‘IFGS 2025'), an annual event that convenes the private sector and policymakers, on 29 April. 

UK chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the publication of draft regulation for regulating cryptoassets in the UK on the same day as the London event. The UK has lagged the EU – which the country left in January 2020 – in regulating crypto. The 27-member bloc's landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation (also abbreviated to MiCAR) came into full force in December 2024.

“Sometimes, looking from this side [UK] of the Atlantic, it looks as if some of the things the US are doing a bit chaotic,” said Tom Duff Gordon, London-based vice-president for international policy at US-headquartered cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, during one of the event's panel discussions. “On this particular topic [digital assets], there is nothing chaotic about what the US administration is doing, right from the White House through to all the different agencies and through the chairs of the relevant committees in Congress – there's a real determination to move forward and to do something really cutting edge with regard to cryptoassets and tokenisation.”

Lord Ed Vaizey, speaking on a later panel, was asked whether the US administration's pro-crypto actions would have a knock-on effect in other nations, particularly the UK. “Yes, I'm sure it will,” he responded. “We can all speculate as to why there has been a volte-face [reference to Trump's previous stance] but I think the administration has got itself into the right place, in theory – we'll see what happens in practice – which is that crypto needs to be regulated.”

“There's no doubt at all that when the US administration decides to change its mind and take the lead in an area like this, it will make the weather,” Vaizey said.

Bitcoin traded above $120,000 to set a new record high on Monday as U.S. lawmakers gear up to potentially pass regulatory changes that could bolster institutional demand.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization traded at $119,840 at 12:02 p.m. ET, according to data from Coin Metrics. Earlier in the day, it topped $123,000.

The rally has seen bitcoin reach new highs amid more inflows into bitcoin ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs had logged their biggest day of inflows in 2025 at $1.18 billion.

"We believe that Bitcoin's surge is driven by longer-term institutional buyers and this will propel it to $125k in the next month or two," Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchange BTSE, said in a statement sent to CNBC. 

"Trump's trade disputes with the likes of the EU, Mexico, and other trading partners could cause dips in the week ahead, but it's likely that Bitcoin's institutional buyers are discounting this risk and maintaining their positions that Bitcoin will still appreciate in the long run," he added.

Investors have been anticipating bitcoin to hit fresh records this year as corporate treasuries accelerate their bitcoin buying sprees and the U.S. Congress nears the passing of new crypto legislation.

The U.S. House of Representatives will begin deliberations on a series of crypto bills on Monday in what has been dubbed "Crypto Week." The potential laws are aimed at providing a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. 

The policy had been long sought by the industry, and is supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, who has branded himself as a pro-crypto president and is involved in several crypto ventures.

One of the most significant bills under consideration is the Genius Act, which could establish federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and create a pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars.

"Long-term holders are locking up supply, while global policy clarity — especially around stablecoins and crypto legislation — has boosted investor confidence and capital inflows," Xu Han, director of the Liquid Fund at HashKey Capital, said in a statement to CNBC.

Speaking on CNBC's "Access Middle East," Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, noted that corporate and institutional investors have purchased $15 billion in bitcoin ETFs over the last six to eight weeks. In contrast, retail investors appear to have been on the sidelines during the latest rally, he added.

10x Research has a year-end bitcoin target range of $140,000 to $160,000, Thielen revealed, but the most significant risk facing this remains the U.S. Federal Reserve continuing its hawkish policy and further interest rate hikes due to tariffs.

 Bitcoin would need to spike at least 208% and hit $370,000 per token for Satoshi Nakamoto to become richer than the top billionaire on the Forbes billionaires list. 

Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, became the 11th richest person in the world after Bitcoin tapped $120,000 on Sunday. 

Nakamoto is believed to hold 1.096 million Bitcoin (BTC) across thousands of wallets, which is worth over $131 billion at current prices, according to blockchain analytics company Arkham. 

This would, in theory, place Nakamoto at number 11 on Forbes' richest billionaires list, overtaking Michael Dell, CEO of tech giant Dell Technologies, with a net worth of $125.1 billion.

However, Forbes' billionaires list doesn't consider crypto wallet holdings when evaluating billionaires; instead, it tracks individuals' publicly verifiable holdings, such as stocks. 

Bitcoin crossed just over $120,000 on Monday, reaching a new all-time high, Nansen data shows; however, it still isn't quite high enough for Nakamoto to take the top spot on the Forbes billionaire list.

Elon Musk, the tech entrepreneur and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, is ranked as the richest billionaire in the world on Forbes' list, with a net worth of over $404 billion.

Larry Ellison, co-founder of software company Oracle, is second on the list with a fortune estimated to be $274 billion. Meta CEO Zuckerberg rounds out the top three with $274 billion to his name.

Bitcoin would need to spike another 208% to hit $370,000 for Nakamoto to take the top spot, but only if the other billionaires' net worths are unchanged. 

In a June 2 post on X, Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas predicted that Nakamoto could become at least the second-richest billionaire by the end of 2026.

He said that if Bitcoin does its “normal 50%/ann,” then Nakamoto will likely climb to number two “sometime next year-ish.”

“It's fascinating to ponder that the founder of something so successful never cashed in. It echoes Jack Bogle in that regard,” Balchunas added.

John “Jack” Bogle, the founder and chief executive of The Vanguard Group, died in 2019 with a reported net worth of $80 million, when most of his peers were billionaires.

On Thursday, 10x Research head Markus Thielen told Cointelegraph there's a 60% chance for Bitcoin to register a 20% gain in the next two months and hit $133,000 in September. 

In May, Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan told Cointelegraph that he thinks Bitcoin could hit $200,000 by the end of 2025, driven by a supply shock from surging institutional demand.

Meanwhile, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted Bitcoin would hit $250,000 by the end of the year.

Nakamoto holds more Bitcoin than anyone else by a significant margin. Corporations and custodians hold 847,000 total, or 4% of Bitcoin's capped supply, according to BiTBO.

A small group of individuals also has an ample supply of Bitcoin. The Winklevoss twins, the founders of crypto exchange Gemini, are estimated to hold about 70,000.

Tim Draper, a venture capitalist and early Bitcoin backer, holds around 30,000, which he bought at a 2014 US Marshals auction. Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor also has a private stash outside his company's holdings of around 17,732.

Social inequality and weak democratic institutions are linked to faster ageing, as are other environmental features such as high levels of air pollution, finds a study spanning four continents1. Education was one of the top factors that protected against faster ageing.

The study also showed that ageing is accelerated by less-surprising factors such as high blood pressure and heart disease. But the link to social and political influences could help to explain why rates of ageing vary from country to country, the authors say.

“It's a very important study”, says Claudia Kimie Suemoto, a geriatrician at the University of São Paulo in Brazil who was not involved in the work. “It gives us the global perspective of how these dependent factors shape ageing in different regions of the world.”

Political polarization and uncertainty mean that “we are living in a world of despair”, and that ages people, says lead author Agustín Ibañez, who directs the Latin American Brain Health Institute in Santiago. “We don't think about the health impacts that this is going to have in the long run.”

The study was published today in Nature Medicine.

The study included 161,981 participants from 40 countries: 7 in Latin America, 27 in Europe, 4 in Asia and 2 in Africa. Just the process of harmonizing these data sets — such as checking that variables were measured in similar ways in different countries — took about 3 years, says Ibañez.

The researchers examined previous research to identify possible factors that hasten or slow ageing and that could be compared across countries. They fed data of these factors into a machine-learning model that predicts a person's chronological age. That allowed them to calculate each person's ‘biobehavioural age gap': the difference between their true chronological age and their age as predicted by the model.

For example, if you are 50 years old but the model predicts that you are 60 years old, you have a biobehavioural age gap of 10 years.

The top medical risk factors for faster ageing were high blood pressure, hearing impairment and heart disease. Other risk factors included unhealthy weight, alcohol consumption, sleep problems, diabetes and impaired vision.

The factors that provide the best protection against speedy ageing were education, ability to perform activities of daily living and sound cognitive abilities. Other protective factors included physical activity, good memory and the ability to walk well.

A new study reveals that ingestions of nicotine pouches by young children have surged in recent years. Researchers at the Center for Injury Research and Policy of the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital and the Central Ohio Poison Center analyzed calls to U.S. poison centers and found an alarming 763% increase in the rate of reported nicotine pouch ingestions among children younger than 6 years old from 2020 to 2023. Nicotine pouches were also more likely to be associated with serious medical outcomes or hospital admissions than other nicotine products like gum/lozenges, e-liquids, powder/granules, and tablets/capsules/caplets.

Nicotine pouches, which contain nicotine powder and are placed in the mouth, were not tracked in national poison center data until 2020. However, between 2020 and 2023 (the most recent year of data from the study), the rate of unintentional ingestion of nicotine pouches by young children increased at a fast rate -- even as ingestion rates for other formulations of nicotine declined.

"Nicotine pouches are a serious and growing toxic ingestion hazard among young children," said Hannah Hays, MD, co-author of the study and medical director of the Central Ohio Poison Center.

"The rapid increase in the number and comparative severity of nicotine pouch ingestions is a reminder of the public health challenges of the changing nicotine product market. This is why we need to continue ongoing surveillance and increase our efforts to prevent nicotine ingestions among young children."

The study, published in Pediatrics, also investigated other nicotine products and formulations. Researchers examined nearly 135,000 cases of nicotine ingestions among children younger than 6 years old that were reported to U.S. poison centers from 2010 through 2023. Most ingestions occurred at home and involved children under the age of 2 years. While most exposures resulted in minor or no effects, there were 39 cases with major medical outcomes and two deaths.

The overall rate of all nicotine ingestions increased 59% from 2010-2015 before decreasing 34% from 2015-2023. This rate was primarily driven by the ingestion rate for liquid nicotine and nicotine solid formulations such as tablets, capsules, and caplets. The ingestion rate for liquid nicotine increased by 450% from 2010-2015 and then decreased by 45% from 2015-2023.

"This abrupt change in the rate trend for liquid nicotine ingestions corresponded with the passage of both state and federal legislation, including the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act of 2015, which required child-resistant packaging of liquid nicotine," said Gary Smith, MD, DrPH, senior author of the study and director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's. "This suggests that legislation can make a difference. However, despite this improvement, the ingestion rate for liquid nicotine remained higher than the rates for any other nicotine product, which clearly indicates that there are opportunities for further improvement.

"Many nicotine products are flavored and sold in colorful packaging that may be attractive to a young child," said Dr. Smith. "Banning flavors in all nicotine products helps reduce unintentional ingestions by young children as well as discourage use among teens."

Researchers also shared a few safety tips for parents and caregivers of young children. The safest choice is to keep all nicotine products out of the home. If you choose to have them in your home, you can lower the risk by following these steps:

Data for this study were obtained from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), which is maintained by America's Poison Centers. Poison centers receive phone calls through the national Poison Help Line (1-800-222-1222) and document information about the exposure, which is reported to the NPDS.

Gut microbiota influence the antitumour efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade1,2,3,4,5,6, but the mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. Here, we show that a new strain of the bacterial genus Hominenteromicrobium (designated YB328) isolated from the faeces of patients who responded to programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade augmented antitumour responses in mice. YB328 activated tumour-specific CD8+ T cells through the stimulation of CD103+CD11b− conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which, following exposure in the gut, migrated to the tumour microenvironment. Mice showed improved antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade when treated with faecal transplants from non-responder patients supplemented with YB238. This result suggests that YB328 could function in a dominant manner. YB328-activated CD103+CD11b− cDCs showed prolonged engagement with tumour-specific CD8+ T cells and promoted PD-1 expression in these cells. Moreover, YB238-augmented antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade treatment was observed in multiple mouse models of cancer. Patients with elevated YB328 abundance had increased infiltration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs in tumours and had a favourable response to PD-1 blockade therapy in various cancer types. We propose that gut microbiota enhance antitumour immunity by accelerating the maturation and migration of CD103+CD11b− cDCs to increase the number of CD8+ T cells that respond to diverse tumour antigens.

Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies, including monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 and PD-1 ligand (PD-L1), are used in many cancer types7. PD-1 blockade therapies have led to significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. However, the complete response rate remains low8,9,10,11. Therefore, predictive biomarkers for clinical efficacy and new approaches to overcome resistance mechanisms are needed. Notably, high ratios of PD-1+CD8+ T cells to PD-1+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in the tumour microenvironment (TME) correspond to the responsiveness to PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors12. Moreover, PD-1 expression by CD8+ T cells is induced by T cell activation signalling, especiallyNFATC1, through the stimulation of fully matured dendritic cells (DCs)13,14.

In gut microbiota, the abundance of certain bacteria (for example, Ruminococcus spp. and Prevotellaceae spp.) is associated with the clinical efficacy of ICB therapies1,2,3,4,5,6. Several mechanisms of microbiome-mediated antitumour immunity have been proposed, including stimulation of macrophages and monocytes15, antigenic mimics between microbiota and tumour antigens16,17,18 or direct activation of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells by microbiota-derived metabolites19,20,21,22. Moreover, a consortium of bacteria isolated from healthy individuals reportedly stimulated CD103+ DCs, which led to the activation of effector CD8+ T cells23. However, the detailed mechanisms that underlie the connection between DC maturation by gut microbiota and the activation of tumour antigen-specific PD-1+CD8+ T cells in the distant TME have not been fully elucidated.

Here, we identified a new bacterial strain, designated YB328, that was significantly enriched in faeces of patients who responded to PD-1 blockade therapies. YB328 accelerated the differentiation of CD103+CD11b− cDCs, which is an essential DC subset for antigen cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells24,25. YB328 mediated cDC differentiation through the phosphorylation of S6K and STAT3 and the induction of IRF8 through the stimulation of multiple Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the gut. YB328-stimulated CD103+CD11b− cDCs were further activated by other bacteria and migrated to tumour-draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and the TME. Once in these locations, the cDCs primed and activated CD8+ T cells and induced PD-1+CD8+ T cells specific for a broad range of tumour antigens. Overall, we describe in detail the mechanism of the activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the distant TME by gut microbiota.

We prospectively collected stool samples from 50 Japanese patients with cancer (15 patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 35 patients with gastric cancer (GC)) who received PD-1 blockade therapy. These patients were classified as responders or non-responders (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Clinicopathological features that are reportedly associated with a favourable clinical response to PD-1 blockade (listed in Supplementary Tables 3–5) were not significantly different in our cohort, except for PD-L1 expression by tumour cells in patients with GC. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples showed that the Shannon diversity of gut microbiota was significantly higher in responders than in non-responders (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b,f). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis further showed that the Shannon diversity was a significant predictive biomarker for identifying responders (Fig. 1b and Extended Data Fig. 1c, left, g, left). Moreover, patients with high diversity of gut microbiota exhibited significantly prolonged PFS, regardless of the cancer type (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table 6 and Extended Data Fig. 1c, right, g, right). Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) based on unweighted unique fraction metric (UniFrac) distances revealed a significant difference in gut microbiota between responders and non-responders (Fig. 1d and Extended Data Fig. 1a,d,h). Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) showed that members of several families, namely, Ruminococcaceae, Propionibacteriaceae, Dehalobacteriaceae and Turicibacteraceae, were enriched in responders (Fig. 1e,f and Extended Data Fig. 1e,i,j). Among them, Ruminococcaceae abundance was significantly correlated with prolonged PFS after PD-1 blockade therapy and showed the highest AUC score (Fig. 1g and Extended Data Fig. 1k). In contrast to previous reports1,2,3,4,18, the abundance of the genera Faecalibacterium, Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia did not differ significantly between responders and non-responders (Extended Data Fig. 1l). Notably, members of the families Bacteroidaceae and Veillonellaceae, which were enriched in non-responders, were associated with a significantly shorter PFS (Fig. 1e,f,h and Extended Data Fig. 1e,i–k). We also confirmed that patients with high Shannon diversity values, a high abundance of Ruminococcaceae and a low abundance of Bacteroidaceae, when stratified by the median cut-off, had prolonged PFS (Extended Data Fig. 1m).

Significance was assessed using two-sided Mann–Whitney U-test, with data presented as the median (a,k,n); two-sided log-rank test (c, g, right, h, right); ANOSIM with one-tailed significance computed using 999 permutations) (d); or two-sided Pearson's correlation (i,l,o).

Among the multiple parameters associated with antitumour immunity, the abundance of PD-1+CD8+ T cells in the TME, which is correlated with the response to PD-1 blockade therapy12,26,27,28, was significantly correlated with the abundance of Ruminococcaceae (Fig. 1i–l and Extended Data Fig. 1n). By contrast, the abundance of Bacteroidaceae was associated with a decrease in PD-1+CD8+ T cells and an increase in Treg cell infiltration in the TME (Fig. 1i,m–o). These findings indicate a clear correlation between specific gut microbiota compositions and immune responses.

Germ-free (GF) mice colonized with faeces from responders, but not from non-responders, exhibited strong antitumour effects against MC38 tumours after anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (anti-PD-1) treatment (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) and showed increased Shannon diversity in the faeces (Extended Data Fig. 2c). Moreover, Ruminococcaceae was enriched in mice who received faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) derived from responders (R-FMT), whereas Bacteroidaceae was enriched in mice who received FMT derived from non-responders (NR-FMT) (Extended Data Fig. 2d–g). To exclude the influence of congenital immunodeficiency in GF mice, we performed the same experiments in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice preconditioned with antibiotics (ATB-SPF mice). Consistent with GF mice, anti-PD-1 treatment significantly inhibited the growth of MC38 and EMT6 tumours in ATB-SPF mice that received R-FMT (Extended Data Fig. 3a–c). Analyses of the TME demonstrated that activated CD8+ T cells (PD-1+CD8+ T cells and CD62L−CD44+ effector memory CD8+ T cells) and cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells (IFNγ+TNF+) were significantly higher in mice treated with R-FMT and anti-PD-1 than in mice treated with NR-FMT and anti-PD-1 or in control mice (Extended Data Fig. 3d–f). Moreover, tumour-infiltrating PD-1+CD8+ T cells from mice treated with R-FMT and anti-PD-1 exhibited a broader T cell receptor (TCR) Vβ repertoire diversity than mice treated with NR-FMT and anti-PD-1 (Extended Data Fig. 3g–i).

As PD-1 expression by T cells correlates with the strength of T cell activation signalling13,29, we examined the maturation of DCs in the TME, a process that has a crucial role in T cell activation. The expression levels of DC maturation markers (CD86, CD40 and CD80) were significantly higher in R-FMT-treated mice than in NR-FMT-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 3j–l). Therefore, gut microbiota augment PD-1 blockade efficacy by promoting mature DC infiltration and PD-1+CD8+ T cell accumulation in the TME.

Given the strong antitumour efficacy of R-FMT, we aimed to isolate bacterial strains from the faeces of responders. A previously undescribed strain, designated YB328, was isolated, and its characteristics were investigated (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Tables 7–9). Taxonomic assignment based on its full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence and the Greengenes database (v.13 8) indicated that strain YB328 belongs to the family Ruminococcaceae. Based on its whole-genome sequence and the Genome Taxonomy Database (GTDB; v.220), strain YB328 was assigned to the recently described species Hominenteromicrobium mulieris30 (Extended Data Fig. 4a), sharing an average 97.3% nucleotide identity to the GTDB species-representative genome. Notably, the family-level name depended on the taxonomic framework, namely, Ruminococcaceae (Greengenes), Oscillospiraceae (NCBI taxonomy) or Acutalibacteraceae (GTDB taxonomy). Moreover, YB328 was detected not only in the Japanese population but also in individuals worldwide (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

We further evaluated the abundance of YB328 in the gut microbiome through metagenome sequencing and species-level quantification using Kraken2 and Bracken against a custom version of the GTDB (v.220). This analysis showed that the abundance of YB328 was significantly higher in the faeces of responders than in non-responders (Fig. 2b). Patients with abundant YB328, defined by a ROC-based cut-off value, had a significantly longer PFS (Fig. 2c), even after excluding patients with high microsatellite instability (Extended Data Fig. 4c). By contrast, Phocaeicola vulgatus (represented by strain AE61, a newly isolated strain from this study belonging to the family Bacteriodeceae and enriched in non-responders), showed an increased abundance in non-responders. Moreover, patients with abundant P. vulgatus had a shorter PFS (Fig. 2d,e). Similar data were obtained using the median cut-off value (Extended Data Fig. 4d). As P. vulgatus is a well-known commensal bacterium31, we used the patient-isolated P. vulgatus strain AE61 to represent gut microbiota of non-responders and evaluated its effects on immunotherapy responses in animal models together with YB328. Although YB328 administration alone did not inhibit tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 4e), YB328 augmented the antitumour effect of anti-PD-1 treatment more than P. vulgatus in ATB-SPF mice. This effect was observed in both poorly immunogenic B16F10 and immunogenic MC38 tumour models, with colonization beyond the gavage period (Fig. 2f,g and Extended Data Fig. 4f). Other bacterial strains enriched and isolated from the faeces of responders exhibited few or no antitumour effects compared with YB328 and PD-1 blockade therapy (Extended Data Fig. 4g).

Mice treated with YB328 and anti-PD-1 had higher abundances of activated CD8+ T cells and cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells in the TME than mice treated with P. vulgatus and anti-PD-1 or control mice (Fig. 2h–j and Extended Data Fig. 5a–c). However, the frequencies of Treg cells and PD-1+ Treg cells were comparable across groups (Extended Data Fig. 5d,e). Nevertheless, DCs in the TME of YB328-colonized mice exhibited significantly increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules (Fig. 2k,l and Extended Data Fig. 5f) and recapitulated the phenotypes of DCs in mice that received R-FMT. Moreover, major histocompatibility class I (MHCI) expression was significantly upregulated in these DCs (Fig. 2m). Taken together, these results suggest that YB328 colonization induces DC maturation with high efficiency antigen presentation to activate tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, the administration of YB328, but not P. vulgatus, favourably changed the Shannon diversity of gut microbiota (Extended Data Fig. 5g).

ATB-SPF mice treated with NR-FMT and colonized with YB328, but not P. vulgatus, showed increased sensitivity to anti-PD-1 therapy (Fig. 2n and Extended Data Fig. 5h,i). Moreover, YB328 administration increased the diversity of the TCR Vβ repertoire of tumour-infiltrating PD-1+CD8+ T cells among skewed TCRs in these mice (Fig. 2o,p and Extended Data Fig. 5j). The administration of YB328, but not P. vulgatus, favourably altered the Shannon diversity of gut microbiota (Extended Data Fig. 5k). Consistently, in our GC and NSCLC cohort of patients, increased levels of YB328 were positively correlated with the Shannon diversity of gut microbiota (Extended Data Fig. 5l).

However, the co-administration of YB328 and P. vulgatus abolished the antitumour immunity induced by YB328 (Extended Data Fig. 5m). This effect was in contrast to YB328 single administration in mice treated with NR-FMT, which showed effective induction of antitumour immunity in combination with anti-PD-1 treatment. The co-administration of P. vulgatus prevented the colonization of YB328 in ABT-SPF mice. However, YB328 sufficiently colonized the gut of mice treated with NR-FMT at a similar level to that observed with YB328 administration alone. This finding indicated that YB328 colonization is not significantly influenced by the microbial environment shaped by NR-FMT (Extended Data Fig. 5n). Indeed, P. vulgatus administration led to significantly greater engraftment of P. vulgatus than NR-FMT (Extended Data Fig. 5o). These observations underscore the impact of competitive dominance on the efficacy of microbiome-based therapies.

To understand the mechanisms of DC maturation, we analysed bone-marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) treated with P. vulgatus or YB328. Compared with P. vulgatus-treated BMDCs, YB328-treated BMDCs were larger and presented multiple pseudopodia. Moreover, they had increased expression of CD86, CD80 and MHCI and increased levels of IL-12p70 and the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10 and CCL5 (Fig. 3a–d and Extended Data Fig. 6a–c). When ovalbumin (OVA)-specific (OT-I) TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells were cultured with bacteria-treated DCs pulsed with OVA peptides, YB328-treated BMDCs were more strongly attracted and were in contact with CD8+ T cells for a longer time than P. vulgatus-treated BMDCs (Fig. 3e,f and Supplementary Videos 1–3). No difference was observed in CCL22 production, which recruits Treg cells, among YB328-treated, P. vulgatus-treated and unstimulated BMDCs (Extended Data Fig. 6c). This result is consistent with the comparable Treg cell infiltration levels observed in the TME across treatments.

a–d, BMDCs were stimulated with YB328 or P. vulgatus. MFI summaries of the maturation markers CD86 (a, n = 6 wells per group) and H-2Kb (b, n = 5 wells per group), IL-12p70 production (c, n = 5 wells per group) and chemokine (CXCL9 and CXCL10) expression (d, n = 8 wells per group) in BMDCs are shown. e,f, Dynamic imaging of CD8+ T cells and BMDCs stimulated with YB328 or P. vulgatus. e, Contact events were evaluated at 10-min intervals (right), and a representative trajectory of the indicated cell (left) was extracted from Supplementary Video 1. f, Images showing the interaction between DCs and CD8+ T cells.

Significance was assessed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (a–d) or two-sided unpaired t-test (e–m).

Source Data

OT-I CD8+ T cells were cultured with DCs and then pulsed with different OVA peptides capable of delivering titrated levels of TCR signalling32. YB328-treated and P. vulgatus-treated BMDCs pulsed with higher doses (100 nM to 1 μM) of high-affinity OVA peptide (N4) presented comparable levels of phosphorylated ZAP70. When BMDCs were pulsed with lower doses (0.01 nM to 10 nM) of N4, YB328-treated BMDCs, but not P. vulgatus-treated BMDCs, exhibited ZAP70 phosphorylation. YB328-treated BMDCs also stimulated strong phosphorylation of co-stimulatory signals (pJNK, pERK1 and pERK2 (pERK1/2), pAKT and pS6K) in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3g and Extended Data Fig. 7a). YB328-treated BMDCs pulsed with a low dose (10 nM) of the N4 peptide induced extensive NFATC1 nuclear translocation in CD8+ T cells, whereas P. vulgatus-treated BMDCs induced only limited translocation (Fig. 3h). YB328-treated BMDCs pulsed with N4 peptides, regardless of the dose, were correlated with the successful activation of and increased cytokine production by CD8+ T cells, whereas P. vulgatus-treated BMDCs induced PD-1 expression only when pulsed with high N4 doses (Fig. 3j,k and Extended Data Fig. 7b–d). Moreover, when supplied with low-affinity OVA peptide (Q4H7), YB328-treated BMDCs induced ZAP70 phosphorylation and co-stimulatory signalling (Fig. 3i and Extended Data Fig. 7e) at relatively high doses and promoted the nuclear translocation of NFATC1 in CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3h). YB328-treated BMDCs consistently induced increased PD-1 expression, which correlated with the activation of and cytokine production by CD8+ T cells, regardless of the dose (Fig. 3l,m and Extended Data Fig. 7f–h).

Analysis of the transcriptional profile revealed higher expression of Irf8 and Batf3 in YB328-treated DCs than in P. vulgatus-treated DCs and untreated DCs (Fig. 4a–c). BATF3 maintains IRF8 autoactivation to commit to the terminal differentiation of CD103+CD11b− cDCs, which have a crucial role in antitumour immunity by effectively activating CD8+ T cells33,34. Accordingly, the number of CD103+CD11b− cDC progenies increased in response to YB328 treatment (Fig. 4d and Extended Data Fig. 8a). By contrast, IRF4, which is a key transcription factor of CD103−CD11b+ cDCs35, was highly expressed by P. vulgatus-treated DCs (Fig. 4e). To further understand the mechanisms of CD103+CD11b− cDC differentiation induced by YB328 treatment, common DC progenitors (CDPs) were cultured with YB328 or P. vulgatus and with FLT3 ligand (FLT3L), a factor essential for the differentiation of CDPs into CD103+CD11b− cDCs36,37. IRF8 expression was significantly upregulated in CDPs stimulated with YB328 at low concentrations of FLT3L, although IRF8 expression was comparable between the groups treated with high concentrations of FLT3L (Fig. 4f). This result suggests that YB328 activates an alternative signalling pathway in CDPs that compensates for FLT3L signalling. FLT3L treatment promotes both PI3K–mTOR and STAT3 signalling for the development of CD103+CD11b− cDCs38,39, and these two pathways regulate Batf3 expression40,41. YB328 stimulation increased levels of S6K and STAT3 phosphorylation compared with P. vulgatus stimulation (Fig. 4g,h). YB328-induced Irf8 expression was reduced by an S6K inhibitor (rapamycin) or a STAT3 inhibitor (HJC0152) and was more significantly inhibited by the administration of both inhibitors (Fig. 4i). Consequently, the number of CD103+CD11b− cDCs induced by YB328 stimulation was decreased by rapamycin and/or HJC0152 treatment (Fig. 4j). The antitumour effects induced by combination treatment with YB328 and anti-PD-1 were completely abrogated in Batf3−/− mice, which lack a subset of CD103+CD11b− cDCs42 (Fig. 4k and Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). By contrast, the depletion of macrophages with an anti-CSF1R monoclonal antibody did not affect the antitumour efficacy induced by YB328 and anti-PD-1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 8e,f). Moreover, YB328-stimulated macrophages were less effective in activating CD8+ T cells than YB328-stimulated DCs (Extended Data Fig. 8g). These data provide further support for the importance of CD103+CD11b− cDCs in YB328-driven antitumour activity.

a–e, DCs were treated with P. vulgatus, YB328 or vehicle. Comprehensive gene expression was examined (a), as was the expression of Batf3 (b, n = 6), IRF8 (c, n = 5), IRF4 (e, n = 3) and changes in the progeny of the CD103+CD11b− cDCs (d, n = 3). f, IRF8 expression by CDPs treated with bacteria and Flt3L as indicated, n = 3–4. g–j, BMDCs were treated with the indicated stimuli, and expression of pS6K (g), pSTAT3 (h) and IRF8 (i) and changes in the progeny of CD103+CD11b− cDCs (j) were examined (n = 4–6). k, Tumour growth curves of wild-type (WT) and Batf3−/− mice (n = 6–9) treated as indicated. l, Gene expression signatures of BMDCs stimulated with YB328 were extracted.

We next investigated how YB328 stimulates multiple signalling pathways in DCs. The expression of TLR family members, particularly TLR5 and TLR7–TLR9, was markedly upregulated in YB328-treated BMDCs compared with P. vulgatus-treated or untreated BMDCs (Fig. 4l). Similarly, YB328 administration increased the diversity of TLR expression by DCs in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs) of mice treated with NR-FMT (Extended Data Fig. 9a).

The adaptor protein MYD88 mediates the downstream signalling pathways of TLR5 and TLR7–TLR9 (ref. 43). Myd88−/− BMDCs treated with YB328 did not lead to increases in the number of CD103+CD11b− cDC progeny (Fig. 4m). Moreover, the increase in antitumour efficacy induced by YB328 and anti-PD-1 treatment was abrogated in Myd88−/− mice (Fig. 4n and Extended Data Fig. 9b). The frequency of CD103+CD11b− cDCs was significantly lower in the lamina propria and Peyer's patch, but not in the spleen, of Myd88−/− mice than in wild-type mice (Extended Data Fig. 9c). This result suggests that YB328-triggered CD103+CD11b− cDC generation requires the activation of MYD88 signalling.

As YB328 is not flagellated (Fig. 2a), the ability of YB328 to stimulate endosomal TLRs (TLR7–TLR9) to promote the differentiation of CD103+CD11b− cDCs was examined. YB328 was phagocytosed by BMDCs (Fig. 4o and Supplementary Video 4). The stimulation of THP-1-based TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 reporter cells revealed that YB328 activated both the IRF and NF-ĸB signalling pathways (Extended Data Fig. 9d). As mouse TLR8 is nonfunctional44, the roles of TLR7 and TLR9 in YB328-mediated antitumour immunity were investigated. BMDCs derived from Tlr7−/− or Tlr9−/− mice partially reduced the upregulation of MHCI expression (Fig. 4p) and abrogated the differentiation of CD103+CD11b− cDCs induced by YB328 (Fig. 4q). Furthermore, BMDCs derived from Tlr7–/–Tlr9−/− mice did not respond to YB328. Therefore increased MHCI expression, differentiation into CD103+CD11b− cDCs and induction of the production of PD-1-expressing CD8+ T cells were not observed in these cells (Fig. 4p–r). YB328 administration to Tlr7–/–Tlr9−/− mice did not augment the antitumour efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment (Fig. 4s and Extended Data Fig. 9e). These data suggest that endosomal TLR7–TLR9 are key mediators of YB328-induced antitumour immunity.

YB328 induced TLR5 expression in DCs. However, YB328 probably does not have genes encoding components of flagellum, based on whole-genome sequence annotation, and flagella were not detected by electron microscopy (Fig. 2a). Therefore, we examined whether TLR ligands such as flagellin derived from the gut microbiome could further augment the antitumour immunity induced by YB328-stimulated DCs. PD-1 expression by CD8+ T cells stimulated with YB328-treated DCs, but not those stimulated with P. vulgatus, was significantly increased after flagellin treatment (Extended Data Fig. 9f). Although treatment with YB328 and anti-PD-1 inhibited tumour growth, combined treatment with NR-FMT, which contained a pool of TLR ligands, led to enhanced antitumour efficacy (Fig. 4t and Extended Data Fig. 9g). Therefore, YB328 sensitizes DCs to multiple TLR ligands derived from not only YB328 but also from other gut microbes to augment antitumour immunity.

As YB328 upregulated multiple TLRs in DCs, we explored whether the combined activation of TLR signalling recapitulated the phenotype of YB328-treated DCs. BMDCs treated with the TLR agonist R848 or ODN-1826 exhibited increased S6K and STAT3 phosphorylation, and combination treatment further increased the phosphorylation of both these proteins. The triple combination of flagellin, R848 and ODN-1826 led to the most effective induction of S6K and STAT3 phosphorylation, which in turn resulted in the highest levels of IRF8 expression and the strongest induction of CD103+CD11b− cDCs out of all the treatment combinations (Fig. 4u and Extended Data Fig. 9h). Moreover, combination treatment with an anti-PD-1 and a TLR agonist cocktail—at doses in which each agonist alone was insufficient to completely control tumour growth (Extended Data Fig. 9i)—significantly inhibited tumour growth (Fig. 4v and Extended Data Fig. 9j).

We next examined whether the immunomodulatory functions of YB328 are specific to this strain. Five representative bacterial strains were chosen for analysis: one strain isolated from the faeces of responders (Ruminococcus torques AE30) and four strains from species phylogenetically close to YB328 (the type strains of the species Ruminococcus albus, Clostridium leptum, Acutalibacter muris and Neglectibacter timonensis) (Extended Data Fig. 4a). Among these, YB328 treatment led to the most significant induction of PD-1 expression in CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10a) and specifically augmented antitumour effects of anti-PD-1 compared with the other selected bacteria (Extended Data Fig. 10b). We then compared the whole-genome sequences of YB328, the five bacterial strains that lacked antitumour efficacy and P. vulgatus (Extended Data Fig. 10c–f, Supplementary Table 10 and Supplementary Discussion). Different cellular fractions of YB328 were also prepared to determine which components of YB328 were responsible for its antitumour activity (Extended Data Fig. 10g and Supplementary Discussion).

We also analysed whether the bacteria Akkermansia muciniphila1,15 and Bifidobacterium longum3,4, which reportedly improve responses to cancer immunotherapy, possessed properties similar to those of YB328. A. muciniphila, but not B. longum, exhibited a significant antitumour effect when combined with anti-PD-1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 10h). A. muciniphila-treated BMDCs promoted CD103+CD11b− cDC differentiation, which in turn induced PD-1 expression by CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 10i,j). However, A. muciniphila induced the expression of IRF8 but not S6K or STAT3 phosphorylation in DCs (Extended Data Fig. 10k–m). Together, these results demonstrate the uniqueness of YB328.

We next investigated the location of CD103+CD11b− cDC differentiation and CD8+ T cell activation. The abundance of CD103+CD11b− cDCs, but not CD103−CD11b+ DCs, in the lamina propria and Peyer's patch was significantly higher after YB328 treatment than after P. vulgatus treatment (Fig. 5a,b). The frequencies of migratory CD103+CD11b− cDCs were also significantly increased in the dLNs (inguinal LNs) and the TME of mice treated with YB328 and anti-PD-1 (Fig. 5c,d). Moreover, the frequency of CD103+CD11b− cDCs was comparable to that observed after P. vulgatus treatment in tumour nondraining LNs (NdLNs: inguinal LNs on the opposite flank of the tumour) and the spleen (Extended Data Fig. 11a,b). CD103+CD11b− cDCs in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of mice treated with YB328 exhibited significantly increased expression of CCR7, a crucial chemokine receptor for migration45,46 (Fig. 5e). PD-1+CD8+ T cells co-expressing TCF-1 significantly proliferated in the tumour dLNs, but not in the MLNs, of YB328-treated mice, and this phenotype was not observed in P. vulgatus-treated mice (Fig. 5f and Extended Data Fig. 11c).

We next used mice expressing photoconvertible Kikume green-red (KikGR) to trace intestinal immune cells (Fig. 5g). In contrast to those in P. vulgatus-treated mice, intestinal immune cells (KikR+ cells) showed substantial infiltration in the tumour dLNs of YB328-treated mice (Fig. 5h). The intestinal infiltration of KikR+CD103+CD11b− cDCs into the dLNs and MLNs was higher in YB328-treated mice than in P. vulgatus-treated mice but was not higher in NdLNs, spleens or cervical lymph nodes (Fig. 5i and Extended Data Fig. 11d). Moreover, treatment with YB328, but not P. vulgatus, increased the abundance of KikR+CD103+ DCs and the number of KikR−PD-1+CD8+ T cells in the TME (Fig. 5j,k). Although the frequency of KikR+PD-1+CD8+ T cells was slightly increased in the MLNs of YB328-treated mice, the TCR Vβ repertoire of tumour-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was significantly different from that of CD8+ T cells in MLNs (Fig. 5l and Extended Data Fig. 11e), which indicated that there was local activation of tumour-antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. By contrast, the frequencies of KikR+PD-1+CD8+ T cells and KikR+CD11b+ cells were comparable in the dLNs, NdLNs, spleens and cervical lymph nodes after YB328 or P. vulgatus administration. However, KikR+FOXP3+ T cells were slightly increased in the dLNs of YB328-treated mice (Extended Data Fig. 11e–g). Moreover, YB328 itself was not detected in the tumour (Extended Data Fig. 11h). These data support the notion that YB328 promotes the migration of intestinal CD103+CD11b− cDCs into tumour dLNs and the TME and primes and activates CD8+ T cells in situ, which augments the antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade treatment.

YB328 abundance was significantly associated with the infiltration of PD-1+CD8+ T cells and IRF8+CLEC9A+ DCs, which correspond to mouse CD103+CD11b− cDCs25, in the TME of patients treated with PD-1 blockade therapies (Fig. 5m–o and Extended Data Fig. 12a,b). The abundance of PD-1+CD8+ T cells was significantly correlated with that of IRF8+CLEC9A+ DCs but not with that of CD206+ or CD14+ cells (Fig. 5p,q and Extended Data Fig. 12c).

We confirmed these findings in our validation cohort (GC, n = 14; NSCLC, n = 7; collected from January 2018 to September 2018; see Methods) (Supplementary Tables 1–5). In accordance with our discovery cohort (GC, n = 35; NSCLC, n = 15; collected from March 2017 to December 2017; see Methods), the presence of YB328 in gut microbiota showed a clear correlation with a favourable clinical outcome, and patients with abundant YB328 exhibited a significantly longer PFS (Extended Data Fig. 12d,e). In a prospective cohort of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (Supplementary Table 11), the YB328 phylotype was more abundant in the faeces of the responder group than in the non-responder group (Extended Data Fig. 12f). We also analysed datasets from the Japanese nationwide MONSTAR project (MONSTAR cohort)47 (Supplementary Table 12). Patients with malignant melanoma (MM) in the MONSTAR cohort had a higher abundance of Akkermansia in the responder group than in the non-responder group, as previously observed1. Moreover, YB328 was more abundant in the responder group of not only patients with MM and in patients with renal cell carcinoma, both of which are known to be immunotherapy-favourable cancer types, but also in patients with GC (thereby validating our results) and in patients with oesophageal cancer (Extended Data Fig. 12g). Furthermore, in a public dataset48 from patients with MM treated with anti-PD-1, responders exhibited significantly higher YB328 colonization than non-responders 3 months after FMT and anti-PD-1 treatment (Extended Data Fig. 12h). Thus, a high abundance of YB328 in faeces correlates with responsiveness to anti-PD-1 treatment in multiple types of cancer. Similarly, YB328 treatment also significantly increased the antitumour efficacy of the adoptive cell transfer of tumour antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (Extended Data Fig. 12i). Overall, patients with a high abundance of YB328 in gut microbiota have a substantial number of CD103+CD11b− cDCs, which enable CD8+ T cells to respond to diverse tumour antigens and consequently improving the clinical efficacy of immunotherapies (Extended Data Fig. 12j).

One of the difficulties in elucidating the detailed mechanisms by which gut microbiota induce antitumour immunity stems from the complex composition of the microbiota. Restoring and cultivating anaerobic gut microbiota from faecal preservation is technically challenging. Currently, most studies use commercially available bacterial strains, which may limit the clinical relevance of these studies. Here, we successfully isolated a previously undescribed bacterial strain, YB328, from the faeces of patients who responded to PD-1 blockade therapy and revealed the mechanism by which YB328 improves responsiveness to immunotherapy. On the basis of publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequence data, YB328 was estimated to be in the gastrointestinal tract of approximately one-fourth of Japanese individuals. As YB328 abundance ranges from 0.01% to 1%, which indicates that YB328 constitutes a relatively small fraction of microbiota, intervention with YB328 provides a large window to increase its abundance and to improve antitumour immunity (Extended Data Fig. 4b).

The occupation of immunodominant antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the TME rapidly exhausts CD8+ T cells, which hampers the antitumour efficacy of ICB therapies in patients49. YB328 optimizes the range of tumour antigens that contribute to the antitumour efficacy of PD-1 blockade therapy. YB328-stimulated cDCs provided enhanced T cell stimulation signalling to reduce the threshold required for CD8+ T cell antigen recognition. Consequently, PD-1+CD8+ T cell clones with diverse TCRs against both immunodominant and subdominant tumour antigens were primed and activated, which resulted in a favourable PD-1 blockade treatment outcome (Extended Data Fig. 12j and Supplementary Discussion).

Our findings, together with previous reports2,50,51,52, suggest that gut microbiota diversity can serve as a pan-ethnic predictive biomarker for response to PD-1 blockade therapy across different cancer types. One can then envision a plausible explanation for the association between high diversity of the gut microbiota and clinical responses to ICB53. That is, bacteria that are beneficial for antitumour immunity, such as YB328, first induce CD103+CD11b− cDC differentiation and activation and further sensitize these cDCs to TLR ligands. We propose a two-step activation system that involves YB328 for CD103+CD11b− cDC progenies in the gut to activate CD8+ T cells in the TME, namely, primary direct activation and secondary activation induced by other bacteria (Extended Data Fig. 12j,k).

In summary, we demonstrated that a new bacterial strain, YB328, stimulates DCs in GALTs to augment antitumour immunity in the TME. We also presented the mechanism of spatiotemporal regulation of DCs by the microbiome from GALTs to the distant TME for the priming and activation of tumour antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.

Patients with advanced NSCLC (n = 22) and patients with GC (n = 49) who received PD-1 blockade monotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) from March 2017 to September 2018 were enrolled in this study. Patients were separated into two independent cohorts in this study: the discovery cohort, in which patients with NSCLC or GC received PD-1 blockade monotherapy from March 2017 to December 2017 (n = 50; NSCLC, n = 15; GC, n = 35), and the validation cohort, in which patients with NSCLC or GC received PD-1 blockade monotherapy from January 2018 to September 2018 (n = 21; NSCLC, n = 7; GC, n = 14). Patients with HNSCC (n = 16) who received PD-1 blockade monotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) from June 2022 to October 2023 were also enrolled in this study. Patients with HNSCC who tested positive for human papillomavirus were excluded. In the MONSTAR cohort47, patients who received PD-1 blockade monotherapy (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) were enrolled from July 2019 to February 2022. Cancer types with n > 15 patients (advanced MM (n = 16), renal cell carcinoma (n = 44), GC (n = 32) and oesophageal cancer (n = 29)) were analysed in this study. Patients who were treated with antibiotics or microbiome intervention therapy within 1 month (the NSCLC and GC cohort and the HNSCC cohort) or 3 months (MONSTAR cohort) before the initiation of treatment were excluded from this study. Patients who achieved a complete or partial response or stable disease lasting >6 months were classified as responders and those who progressed on therapy or had stable disease <6 months were classified as non-responders per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST; v.1.1). Forty-seven patients (discovery cohort: NSCLC, n = 4 and GC, n = 22; validation cohort: NSCLC, n = 7 and GC, n = 14) had an available quantity of TIL isolated; these samples were subjected to multiple immunological analyses. Stool samples were collected within 1 week before initial treatment with a DNA stabilizer (FS-0009, TechnoSuruga Laboratory) according to the manufacturer's instructions and then stored at −80 °C. Fresh tumour samples were obtained from primary or metastatic tumours by needle or endoscopic biopsy within 2 weeks before initial administration and subjected to immunological analyses. Clinical information of patients was obtained from their medical records.

Anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (22C3, Dako; SP142 or SP263, Roche) was used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an automatic staining instrument (BenchMark ULTRA, Roche) as previously described54. PD-L1 positivity was defined as staining in 1% or more of the tumour cells.

Anti-mutL homologue 1 (MLH1; ES05) monoclonal antibody, anti-mutS homologue 2 monoclonal antibody (MSH2; FE11), anti-postmeiotic segregation increased 2 monoclonal antibody (PMS2; EP51) and anti-mutS homologue 6 monoclonal antibody (MSH6; EP49) (all from Dako) were used for IHC. Tumours were considered negative for MLH1, MSH2, PMS2 or MSH6 expression if there was a complete absence of nuclear staining in tumour cells. Normal epithelial cells and lymphocytes were used as internal controls. Tumours lacking MLH1, MSH2, PMS2 or MSH6 expression were considered deficient in mismatch repair, whereas tumours that expressed all these markers were considered proficient in mismatch repair.

Chromogenic in situ hybridization for RNA encoding Epstein–Barr virus was performed with fluorescein-labelled oligonucleotide probes (INFORM EBER probe) with enzymatic digestion (ISH protease 3, Roche) and an iViewBlue detection kit (Roche) with the BenchMark ULTRA staining system.

Tumour tissues were minced and treated within 72 h after surgery according to a TIL preparation protocol using an optimized tissue preservation reagent (Tumor & Tissue Preservation Reagent (TTPR)) and a TIL isolation reagent (Tumor & Tissue Dissociation Reagent (TTDR)), which were codeveloped by BD Biosciences55. Alternatively, tumour tissues were treated immediately with a gentleMACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) as previously described56. These samples were analysed using a BD LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences) or a FACSymphony system (BD Biosciences).

Cells were washed with PBS containing 2% FCS and stained with the indicated antibodies and fixable viability dye. After staining for cell surface markers, the cells were intracellularly stained with antibodies with a FOXP3 staining buffer set (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After washing, cells were analysed with a BD LSRFortessa X-20 (BD Biosciences) or a FACSymphony system (BD Biosciences). The data were analysed with FlowJo software (v.10.8.1; BD Biosciences). The staining antibodies were diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. To analyse the similarity of the CD8+ TCR Vβ repertoires, the expression of TCR Vβ was evaluated and presented as an ordination plot by uniform manifold approximation and projection. To analyse the diversity of TLR expression on DCs, the Shannon index of TLR expression was calculated based on the expression of TLR1–TLR9.

Total DNA extraction was conducted using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To increase the recovery of bacterial DNA, particularly from Gram-positive bacteria, pretreatment with lytic enzymes was performed before extraction using a stool kit. In brief, 100 mg faecal sample was suspended in 10 ml Tris-EDTA buffer (pH 7.5), and then 50 μl of 100 mg ml–1 lysozyme type VI purified from chicken egg white (MP Biomedicals) and 50 μl of 1 mg ml–1 purified achromopeptidase (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical) were added. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with mixing. Next, 0.12 g SDS (final concentration of 1%) was added, and the suspension was mixed until it became clear. Next, 100 μl of 20 mg ml–1 proteinase K (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical) was added, followed by incubation at 55 °C for 1 h with mixing. The cell lysate was then subjected to ethanol precipitation. The precipitate was dissolved in 1.6 ml ASL buffer from the stool kit and subsequently purified using a QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit (Qiagen). For the HNSCC cohort, DNA was extracted using an ISOSPIN Fecal DNA kit (Nippon Gene) following protocol N as previously described57.

Each library was prepared according to the ‘Illumina 16S Metagenomic Sequencing Library Preparation Guide' with a primer set (27Fmod: 5′-AGR GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC AG-3′ and 338R: 5′-TGC TGC CTC CCG TAG GAG T-3′) targeting the V1–V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Next, 251-bp paired-end sequencing of the amplicon was performed using MiSeq (Illumina) with a MiSeq v.2 500 cycle kit. The raw sequences were demultiplexed and quality-trimmed with a FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html, v.0.0.14) and BBtrim (http://bbmap.sourceforge.net, v.33.21). A total of 20,000 reads per sample were randomly selected using seqtk (v.1.3-r106) for further analyses. The processed sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) defined at a 97% similarity cut-off using UCLUST (v.1.2.22q). Representative sequences for each OTU were then classified taxonomically by using RDP Classifier (v.2.2) with the Greengenes (v.13 8) database. The bioinformatics pipeline QIIME (v.1.9.1) was used as the informatics environment for all relevant processing of raw sequencing data and the determination of relative bacterial abundances. For the HNSCC cohort, sequencing libraries of the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene were prepared as previously described58 and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument with V2 chemistry (2 × 251 bp reads).

Alpha diversity was estimated using the Shannon index, which captures both microbiota richness and evenness, after subsampling to an even depth (10,000 reads per sample). Beta diversity was assessed by unweighted UniFrac distance matrices and visualized by PCoA. The PCoA of unweighted UniFrac distances was performed with QIIME, and the results were plotted using R (v.4.02). ANOSIM was used to evaluate the significant differences between groups.

Kruskal–Wallis and pairwise Wilcoxon tests were performed, followed by LDA to assess the effect size of each differentially abundant taxon59. Bacteria with markedly increased abundance were defined as those with a log10[LDA score] > 3.

Phylotype analysis, as delineated on the basis of the YB328 amplicon sequence variant (ASV) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing data, was performed for the following datasets: (1) prospective cohort of patients with HNSCC (V4 region, sequencing performed in this study); (2) MONSTAR cohort (V3V4 region, sequencing data obtained with permission from the MONSTAR alliance); and (3) two publicly available sequencing datasets48,60 (both V3V4 region). For ref. 60, data captured two healthy Japanese cohorts, namely the MORINAGA cohort (n = 704 for study accession DRP005906) and the NIBIOHN cohort (n = 1,280 for study accessions DRP007219, DRP007221, DRP007218, DRP007222 and DRP007220); the data were downloaded from the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) in fastq format. For ref. 48, sequence data were obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under BioProject PRJNA928744. In all cases, sequencing reads were denoised to obtain ASVs using DADA2 (v.1.26.0)61. For this purpose, primers in the reads were trimmed using Cutadapt (v.4.2)62, and read pairs without identifiable primers and undetermined bases (Ns) were discarded. Reads were then further trimmed by length (truncLen option) and filtered on the basis of their expected error (maxEE option) using the filterAndTrim function of DADA2. For the publicly available sequencing data, forward and reverse reads were denoised on a per-sample basis using the dada function in DADA2 with the options err = NULL and selfConsist = TRUE. For the data generated in this study (that is, the prospective cohort of patients with HNSCC) and the MONSTAR cohort data, error models for the forward and reverse reads were generated using the learnErrors function in DADA2 on a per-sequencing run basis. After denoising using the dada function with the run-specific error models, ASV tables were merged using mergeSequenceTables function in DADA2 and chimeras were removed using the removeBimeraDenovo function with method = “consensus”. For all datasets, a single ASV that perfectly matched the 16S rRNA gene sequence of YB328 was retained and used to calculate the relative abundance of YB328 (phylotype). To verify the specificity of detection of YB328, the V4 and V3V4 ASVs of YB328, as extracted from its whole-genome sequence, were compared against the Greengenes2 database (release 2024.09; Supplementary Data 1).

The shotgun sequencing library for each microbial sample was constructed using Illumina DNA Prep (Illumina). The Illumina library was converted to a library for DNBSEQ using an MGIEasy Universal Library Conversion kit (App-A, MGI). Sequencing was performed on a DNBSEQ-G400RS (MGI) in 150-bp paired-end mode. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The genomic DNA of YB328 and P. vulgatus AE61 was extracted using an enzymatic lysis method with Qiagen Genomic-tip 100/G columns according to the manufacturer's protocol. The complete genome sequence of strain YB328 and a high-quality draft genome of P. vulgatus AE61 were determined using PacBio HiFi (high-fidelity) reads (Supplementary Table 7). PacBio sequencing, including library preparation and library quality control, were performed by Bioengineering Lab. In brief, short DNA fragments were removed using a Short Read Eliminator kit (PacBio) and retained DNA was sheared using a Covaris instrument to a size of 10–20 kbp. Sequencing libraries were then prepared using a PacBio SMRTbell Prep kit 3.0 and a SMRTbell gDNA Sample Amplification kit and quantified using a QuantiFluor dsDNA system (Promega) and an Agilent HS Genomic DNA 50 kb kit (Agilent Technologies) for quantification and size distribution, respectively. The library was then treated with a Revio Polymerase kit (PacBio) and sequenced on a Revio instrument. HiFi reads (Q20) were generated using SMRT Link (v.13.0.0.207600) to remove overhang adapter sequences and to create consensus sequences based on the resultant subreads. Lima (v.2.9.0) and pbmarkdup (v.1.0.3) were used for removing ultra-low PCR adapter sequences and PCR duplex reads, respectively. The resulting reads were assembled using Flye (v.2.9.5) and specifying the parameters --genome-size 3 m --asm-coverage 40. A phylogenetic tree showing the phylogenetic placement of YB328 and related taxa was constructed based on 120 single-copy marker genes using GTDB-Tk (v.2.4.0) with GTDB release 220 reference data. Protein sequences of identified marker genes (using the identify function of GTDBTk) were aligned using the align function of GTDBTk with the option skip_trimming. Aligned protein sequences were then loaded into an ARB (v.7.0) database, representative genomes were selected and the data were exported with custom masks for uninformative sites. Approximate maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using FastTree (v.2.1.1053), and the trees were visualized in ARB. The average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were then calculated using fastANI63 through comparisons of YB328 and closely related species. Genome gene identification was performed with Prodigal (v.2.6.3) with the default settings64. The predicted protein sequences were further analysed by matching against the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) database (release 3.10 in the Conserved Domain Database)65 using RPS-Blast (BLAST v.2.9.0+; E value cut-off of 0.01), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (release 2019-11-18)66 and the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB; release 2022.04)67 and by protein alignment using DIAMOND (v.2.0.13)68. Coding sequences unique to strain YB328 (see Extended Data Fig. 4a for genome accessions) were identified using CompareM (v.0.1.2; https://github.com/dparks1134/CompareM) with default settings.

Taxonomic profiling using metagenome sequencing data was performed through read-level taxonomic assignment with Kraken2 (v.2.1.3)69, followed by estimation of relative abundances using Bracken (v.2.9)70. For this purpose, paired-end reads were processed using fastp (v.0.23.2 or v.0.24.0)71 with the following settings: --trim_tail1 1 --trim_tail2 1 --cut_right --cut_right_window_size 4 --cut_right_mean_quality 15 --qualified_quality_phred 15 --unqualified_percent_limit 40 --trim_poly_x --poly_x_min_len 10 --n_base_limit 0 --length_required 75. Reads were then filtered using NCBI's BMTagger (v.3.101) to remove reads derived from the human genomic DNA. Taxonomic assignment of the reads was performed using Kraken2 against a customized version of the GTDB (v.220), with options --confidence 0.30 --use-names --paired. Species abundances were then estimated based on the Kraken2 output using Bracken, with options -r 150 -t 10.

To construct the custom GTDB-based database, we built Kraken2 and Bracken databases using all species-representative genomes in the GTDB (v.220; n = 113,104 total bacterial and archaeal genomes), after replacing the corresponding genomes of the species P. vulgatus (representative: GCF_000012825.1) and H. mulieris (representative: GCF_020687165.1) by the two genome sequences generated in this study. Furthermore, to reduce the potential of false-positive assignments, a representative human genome sequence (GRCh38) was also included in the database. Construction of the Kraken2 and Bracken databases largely followed the scheme implemented in Struo2 (ref. 72), with a default k-mer length of 35 and specifying a read length of 150 for the bracken-build command.

To investigate the abundance of YB328 on a global scale, we analysed 1,188 human faecal metagenomic datasets from NCBI's SRA. In this study, we focused on samples from healthy individuals; these were identified on the basis of the metadata available in GMrepo2 (ref. 73) and HumGut74 by retaining entries marked as ‘D006262' and ‘Healthy' for GMrepo2 and HumGut, respectively. Data were retrieved in FASTQ format using the SRA Toolkit's prefetch and fasterq-dump commands, and then uniformly processed and analysed using fastp and Kraken2 as described above for the in-house generated sequencing data.

All bacterial strains were isolated from fresh human faecal samples. The collected faecal samples were transported under 100% CO2 using a deoxygenating agent (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical) to a vinyl anaerobic chamber (COY) with an atmosphere composed of N2, H2 and CO2 (8:1:1). The faecal samples were diluted with pre-reduced dilution buffer to 1.0 × 10−8 g ml–1 in a tenfold dilution series. Fifty microlitres of 1.0 × 10−6 g ml–1, 1.0 × 10−7 g ml–1 and 1.0 × 10−8 g ml–1 diluted faecal fluid was inoculated on Eggerth–Gagnon (EG) agar plates75 supplemented with 5% (v/v) horse blood and M98-5 agar plates76. After incubation for 48 h at 37 °C, every colony grown on the plates was picked and subcultured on new plates for purification and growth. The obtained strains were preserved in pre-reduced nutrient broth (BD Biosciences) supplemented with 10% glycerol at −80 °C, and a portion of the colony was used for bacterial taxon identification. For bacterial taxon identification, the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strains was amplified using the universal primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3′) and 1492R (5′-GGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3′), and almost-full-length 16S rRNA genes were sequenced with the universal primers using a previously described procedure77. The species of the strains were determined by NCBI BLAST searches if the similarity between the query and the results exceeded 99%. Bacteroides vulgatus AE61 (renamed P. vulgatus), Sellimonas intestinalis AE3, Clostridium colicanis AE66, Eggerthella lenta AE7, Ruminococcus torques AE30 and YB328 were isolated from EG agar plates. Erysipelatoclostridium ramosum AM28 was isolated using M98-5 agar plates. Ruminococcus albus JCM 14654T was obtained from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM) (RIKEN). Acutalibacter muris DSM 26090T, Neglectibacter timonensis DSM 102082T and Clostridium leptum DSM 753T were obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures. A. muciniphila BAA-835T and B. longum BAA-999 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The culture method for the commercial bacteria was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For inoculation of these bacterial strains into mice, the cells were collected using degassed GAM broth (Nissui) in an anaerobic chamber and were then suspended at a concentration of approximately 1.0 × 109 cells per ml in pre-reduced PBS containing 0.05% (w/v) l-cysteine·HCl·H2O or 15% (w/v) glycerol solution for storage. Until inoculation, the suspended bacterial strains were kept at −80 °C.

The mouse colon cancer cell line MC38 (ENH204, Kerafast) and the mammary carcinoma cell line EMT6 (CRL-2755, ATCC) were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biosera) and 2 mM l-glutamine. Mouse B16F10 (CRL-6475, ATCC) and B16F10-OVA (stable transfectant derived from B16F10 cells, which were generated in house) melanoma cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical) supplemented with 10% FBS (Biosera) and 2 mM l-glutamine. All cell lines are confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination. For the induction of BMDCs from bone marrow (BM), 4 × 106 BM cells were cultured in tissue-culture-treated 6-well plates in 4 ml complete medium (RPMI-1640 (Fujifilm Wako Pure Chemical) supplemented with 2 mM l-glutamine and 10% FBS) containing 20 ng ml–1 GM-CSF (Peprotech) as previously described78. Half of the medium was removed on day 2, and fresh complete medium containing 40 ng ml–1 GM-CSF was added. The culture medium was entirely discarded on day 3 and replaced with complete medium containing 20 ng ml–1 GM-CSF. For the bacterial stimulation experiments, the multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of bacteria used to infect BMDCs was 100 or indicated in each figure legend. For the TLR stimulation experiment, flagellin (25 ng ml–1, InvivoGen), R848 (25 ng ml–1, Selleck Chemicals) and/or ODN-1826 (250 ng ml–1, InvivoGen) were administered for 24 h in complete medium containing 20 ng ml–1 GM-CSF. CDPs were isolated from BM cells by cell sorting and cultured with FLT3L (100 ng ml–1, Peprotech) and IMDM (Merck) supplemented with 2 mM GlutaMax (Merck), 55 μM 2-mercaptoethanol (Merck), 25 mM HEPES (Merck), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Merck) and 10% FBS. CDPs were identified as LIN−CD117intCD135+CD115+CD11c−MHCII− BM cells, which lacked the markers of other cell lineages, including CD19, B220, CD3, NK1.1 and TER-119 (refs. 79,80,81). Bone marrow-derived macrophages were induced from BM cells as previously described82 and cultured in DMEM containing 10 ng ml–1 M-CSF (Peprotech). THP-1-derived reporter cell lines expressing human TLRs (hTLR7, hTLR8 and hTLR9) were cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions (InvivoGen). Cells were stimulated with YB328 for 24 h, and supernatants were collected for downstream analyses. For YB328 fractionation, YB328 was cultured with GAM broth (Nissui) at 37 °C for 16 h. Using the collected cells, the cell membrane fraction and cytoplasm fraction were prepared using the bead-beating method as previously described83,84. Using the culture supernatant, the membrane vesicle fraction and supernatant fraction (without membrane vesicles) were prepared by ultracentrifugation previously as described85,86. For the stimulation of fractions of YB328, each fraction was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 10% (v/v). The MC38, EMT6 and B16F10 cell lines were pre-authenticated by ATCC using short tandem repeat sequencing. OVA expression in B16F10-OVA cells was confirmed by flow cytometry. THP1-Dual™ hTLR7, THP1-Dual™ hTLR8 and THP1-Dual™ hTLR9 cells were not authenticated but were functionally validated for responsiveness to their respective TLR agonists, serving as positive controls.

C57BL/6 mice and BALB/cJ mice (6–10 weeks old) were purchased from CLEA Japan. OT-I TCR transgenic mice87 (provided by W. R. Heath, University of Melbourne), Myd88−/− mice88, Tlr7−/−, Tlr9−/− and Tlr7–/–Tlr9−/− mice (Oriental Bio Service, provided by S. Akira, WPI Immunology Frontier Research Center, Osaka University), Batf3−/− mice89 (The Jackson Laboratory, provided by K. Murphy, Washington University School of Medicine) and Kikume Green—Red (KikGR) mice90 (RIKEN BioResource Research Center, provided by M. Tomura, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine) were used. GF mice were bred and maintained in the gnotobiotic facilities of the Central Institute for Experimental Animals or purchased from CLEA Japa or Sankyo Labo and maintained within the gnotobiotic facilities of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. Other mice were housed in cages under SPF conditions, provided with standard food, given free access to hypochlorous weak-acid water and housed with a 12–12-h light–dark cycle with lights on at 8:00. The temperature was maintained at 22 °C (20–26 °C), and the humidity was 45% (40–60%). In tumour challenge experiments, syngeneic mice were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 × 106 MC38 colon cancer cells, 1 × 106 EMT6 mammary carcinoma cells, 5 × 105 B16F10 melanoma cells or 5 × 105 B16F10-OVA melanoma cells in a total of 100 μl of PBS. The mice were randomized into different groups, ensuring that the tumour size was similar across all groups before the initiation of treatment. Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (200 μg per mouse; clone: RMP1-14; BioLegend), anti-CSF1R monoclonal antibody (100 μg per mouse; clone: AFS98; Bio X Cell) or isotype control antibody (clone RTK2758; BioLegend) was intraperitoneally administered 3 times at 3-day intervals. Tumour length and width were measured on the indicated days, and tumour size was calculated as V = ½ (tumour length ×  tumour width2). The immunological profile of the TME was analysed on days 13 or 15 after tumour inoculation. For TLR agonist injection, TLR agonists (0.5 μg flagellin, 5 μg R848 and/or 5 μg per ODN-1826 per mouse) were intraperitoneally administered. Mice were monitored twice a week and euthanized when the subcutaneous tumour diameter exceeded 20 mm. In some FMT and bacterial administration experiments, mice were preconditioned with antibiotics (ampicillin 500 mg l–1 (Merck), neomycin 500 mg l–1 (Merck), metronidazole 1 g l–1 (Merck) and vancomycin 500 mg l–1 (Merck)) dissolved in sterile drinking water. Mice received bacterial or faecal transplantation by oral gavage using feeding needles. For FMT, we were able to collect faecal samples sufficient for in vivo animal models after examining gut microbiota from a total of 6 patients—3 responders and 3 non-responders—and used the faecal samples from these patients for each independent experiment. Faecal samples (0.1 g) were dissolved in 10 ml PBS and administered to mice by oral gavage (100 μl per mouse). For the bacterial administration experiments, we prepared the bacterial stock at 108 cells per ml and administered it to mice by oral gavage (100 μl per mouse). Intestinal-cell-labelling experiments were performed as previously described90. In brief, the small intestine was drawn from the abdominal cavity and photoconverted by exposure to violet light (435 nm, 40–50 mW cm–2) for 90 s by laparotomy. Nontargeted regions were protected from light using aluminium foil. For adoptive transfer experiments, splenocytes were collected from OT-I TCR transgenic mice, and CD8+ T cells were purified with CD8a microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). SPF mice pretreated with antibiotics were subcutaneously injected with B16F10-OVA cells, and the sorted CD8+ T cells (1 × 106 cells per mouse) were transferred by intravenous injection. No blinding was performed. Sample sizes for animal experiments were chosen according to preliminary pilot studies12,91,92, and are in line with standards in the field.

To isolate TILs and lymphocytes from the lymph nodes, tissue samples were collected and minced into small pieces, followed by digestion with BD Horizon Dri TTDR reagent at room temperature for 20 min. After dissociation, the cell suspension was filtered through a 70-μm strainer and washed with PBS supplemented with 1% BSA. For intestinal tissues, small intestines (duodenum, jejunum and ilium) were excised. The intestinal contents were removed by washing with HBSS. Fat tissue was also removed. Peyer's patches and mesenteric tissues were carefully removed and digested in BD Horizon Dri TTDR according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intestines were further opened longitudinally and cut into 5-mm long segments. Tissues were digested using a Lamina Propria Dissociation kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

BMDCs were stimulated with the indicated bacteria for 12 h, and chemokines and cytokines were measured using ELISA kits according to the manufacturer's instructions (CXCL9, Abcam; CXCL10, Thermo Fisher Scientific; Proteome Profiler Mouse Chemokine Array kit, R&D Systems; and IL12p70, Thermo Fisher Scientific). For profiling chemokine expression with a Proteome Profiler Mouse Chemokine Array kit, the membrane was visualized using an LAS-4000 instrument (GE Healthcare), and the raw imaging data were processed and analysed with ImageJ software (Fiji, v.2.0.0).

The cell structure of YB328 was observed by scanning electron microscopy (S-4500; Hitachi) and transmission electron microscopy (H-7600; Hitachi) as previously described93,94. In brief, for scanning electron microscopy observation, YB328 cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde, post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide and dehydrated through a graded ethanol series followed by 3-methylbutyl acetate. For transmission electron microscopy observation, the cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and then post-fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide. The fixed cells were suspended in 1% aqueous uranyl acetate. The biochemical properties of YB328 were evaluated using an API ZYM system (bioMérieux) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

CD8+ T cells from OT-I TCR transgenic mice were prestained with 1 mg ml–1 Hoechst 33342 (Dōjindo Laboratories) at 37 °C for 10 min, washed and then cultured with the indicated bacteria-stimulated DCs pulsed with OVA peptides. After 4 h of culture, the cells were collected. Bacteria were prestained with SYTO Green Fluorescent Nucleic Acid stains (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and cultured with BMDCs prestained with CellTracker Deep Red dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All staining procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 15 min of culture, the cells were collected. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde solution for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked with PBS supplemented with 10% BSA for 1 h. The fixed cells were stained with an anti-NFATC1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) monoclonal antibody overnight and then with a DyLight 488 secondary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All the antibodies were diluted in 10% BSA in PBS. Coverslips were mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade mountant (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Images were captured by fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss LSM-880, Zeiss) and analysed using ZEN software (Zeiss).

The DCs and T cells were prestained with 0.5 μM CellTracker Green CMFDA dye, 0.5 μM CellTracker Red CMTPX dye, 0.5 μM CellTracker Deep Red dye (Thermo Fisher Scientific) or 1 mg ml–1 Hoechst 33342 at 37 °C for 10 min. Bacteria were prestained with SYTO Green Fluorescent Nucleic Acid stains (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Prestained DCs (2 × 105) were mixed with prestained CD8+ T cells from OT-I TCR transgenic mice (1 × 105) or bacteria (m.o.i. = 100) and seeded into a culture dish. The videos were recorded using an A1R MP+ multiphoton microscope system (Nikon) or a fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM-880, Zeiss). The raw imaging data were processed and analysed with ImageJ software (Fiji, v.2.0.0).

Mice were depilated by hair removal cream 1 week before observation using an IVIS spectrum imaging system (IVIS kinetics, PerkinElmer), and the iVid-neo diet (Oriental Bio) was applied 2 weeks before observation to reduce autofluorescence from the diet. After 4 days of photoconversion, in vivo fluorescence images were obtained (for KikG, excitation filter = 465 nm, emission filter = GFP; for KikR, excitation filter = 570 nm, emission filter = Cy5.5). Analysis was conducted using Living Image software (v.4.7.3, PerkinElmer).

Total RNA was extracted from BMDCs using a RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen) and further processed with a SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA kit (Takara Bio). cDNA library preparation was conducted with a Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit (Illumina). The prepared RNA sequencing libraries were subjected to next-generation sequencing with a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina) using 150-bp read lengths in paired-end mode. The reads generated for each RNA sample were analysed and compared using the Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform. Sequencing reads were aligned and annotated to the UCSC mouse reference genome (GRCm38.p6) from Gencode. The number of transcripts per kilobase million was calculated and used for downstream analyses. Expression levels across samples were normalized by z score transformation.

To determine the gene expression of BMDCs, total RNA was extracted from BMDCs using a RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed with SuperScript IV VILO master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The TaqMan gene assay probe was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (assay ID: Batf3/Mm01318273_m1; 18S rRNA/Hs03003631_g1). TaqMan Fast Advanced master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to perform PCR, and the results were examined with a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The PCR conditions were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 20 s, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s. Gene expression was normalized to that of the endogenous control gene 18S rRNA. Relative gene expression between groups was determined using the comparative threshold cycle method. YB328 and P. vulgatus were quantified in faeces and tumour tissues by real-time PCR with a primer set targeting the recA gene of YB328 (forward primer: 5′-CCTCTTGGACCTTGCCGAAA-3′; reverse primer: 5′-ATACGCGTGCCGTTATACGA-3′) and the 16S rRNA gene of P. vulgatus (5′-forward primer: CGGGCTTAAATTGCAGATGA; reverse primer: 5′-CATGCAGCACCTTCACAGAT-3′) as previously described95 using a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time PCR instrument. The reactions (20 µl) contained 1 × Power SYBR Green PCR master mix and 500 nM each of the forward and reverse primers, and the thermal cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 15 s. A standard curve was prepared using purified genomic DNA of YB328 and P. vulgatus.

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded blocks of tumour specimens were sliced into 4-μm-thick sections on adhesion microscope slides (Matsunami). The tissue slides were deparaffinized and rehydrated for multiplex IHC staining. Antigen retrieval and subsequent staining were performed using an Opal 7-Colour IHC kit (Akoya Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical analyses were performed with Prism software (v.8; GraphPad), SPSS (v.21.0; IBM) and R (v.4.02; R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Patient characteristics were compared between the two groups using Pearson's chi-square test and Fisher's exact test. ROC curves for continuous variables were created by plotting the true-positive rate against the false-positive rate at each threshold. The AUC shown in each plot summarizes the performance of continuous variables. The cut-off values of continuous variables were determined as the maximum sum of the sensitivity and specificity in ROC analyses. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Data were analysed for a normal distribution using the Shapiro-Wilk test before comparisons. The relationships between two groups were compared using a two-sided Student's t-test for normally distributed data or the nonparametric Mann–Whitney U-test. For multiple testing, significance was determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's correction. Tumour volume curves were compared using two-way ANOVA with the Tukey–Kramer method. The correlation coefficient was evaluated by Pearson's correlation. Univariate or multivariate analyses were performed with the Cox regression model. All graphs of animal and in vitro experiments show representative data from at least two independent experiments. P < 0.05 was considered to indicate significance. NS, not significant.

Protective and risk factors can drive healthy or accelerated aging, with distinct environments modulating their effects. The impact of the exposome—the combined physical and social exposures experienced throughout life—on accelerated aging remains unknown. We assessed delayed and accelerated aging in 161,981 participants from 40 countries (45.09% female; mean age, 67.06; s.d., 9.85) by measuring biobehavioral age gaps (BBAGs), defined as the difference between estimated age from protective and risk factors and chronological age, in cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. BBAGs predicted chronological age, followed by regional and exposomal factor analyses, linked to accelerated aging. Europe led in healthy aging, while Egypt and South Africa showed the greatest acceleration; Asia and Latin America fell in between (Cliff's delta (δd) = 0.15–0.52; all P < 0.0001). Accelerated aging was more evident in eastern and southern Europe; globally, it was also associated with lower income (δd = 0.48–0.56, P < 1 × 10−15). Exposomal factors of accelerated aging include physical (air quality), social (socioeconomic and gender inequality, migration) and sociopolitical (representation, party freedom, suffrage, elections and democracy) determinants (all Cohen's d (d) > 0.37, P < 0.0001). BBAGs predicted future functional (r (Pearson correlation) = −0.33, P < 1 × 10−15, d = 0.70) and cognitive declines (r = −0.22, P < 1 × 10−15, d = 0.44), and larger BBAGs (P < 0.0001, d = 1.55). Healthy and accelerated aging are influenced by physical, social and sociopolitical exposomes, with considerable disparities across nations.

The figure illustrates the age distribution across countries for three different datasets. a) Age distribution for the cross-sectional dataset, which includes a total of 161,981 participants. b) Age distribution for the cross-sectional subsample consisting of 102,725 participants, with additional predictors available for analysis. c) Age distribution for the longitudinal dataset, where the same group of 21,631 participants is observed across two waves (Wave 1 and Wave 2), highlighting the distribution of age by country in each wave.

(a) Feature importance, assessed via mean decrease in impurity (MDI), enabled the prediction of chronological age using biobehavioral factors. The sample size for the analyses reported in this figure included 102,725 individuals. Goodness-of-fit and feature importance metrics are provided. (b) MDI facilitated the characterization of groups with more delayed (left panel) and more accelerated (right panel) aging. Goodness-of-fit and feature importance metrics are provided. (c) Average BBAGs distribution by continent. The color bar indicates younger (blue) and older (red) BBAGs. (d) BBAGs comparisons by continent (left panel) and by European regions (right panel). (e) BBAGs comparisons between low- and high-income countries, based on gross national income (GNI) and gross domestic product (GDP) indicators. (f) Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between BBAGs and all exposomes, as well as combined social, physical, and sociopolitical exposomes. (g) Linear regression models were also used to assess the associations between BBAGs and individual social (gender equality, migration, and structural equality) and physical exposomes (air quality). (h) Linear regression models were used to examine the association between BBAGs and individual sociopolitical exposomes (democracy indicators). All P-values reported in Panels f, g, and h were < 1e-15. The maps were created in Python using the Plotly library (https://plotly.com/python/maps/). All other illustrations and icons were designed using GIMP (https://www.gimp.org).

The 3D plots display the density of exposomes and BBAGs. The sample size for the analyses reported in this figure included 161,981 individuals. (a) Linear regression models tracked the relationship between BBAGs and combined social exposomes, controlling for physical and sociopolitical exposomes. (b) Linear regression models assessed the role of individual social exposomes (gender equality, migration, and structural equality) and physical exposomes (air quality) on BBAGs, controlling for sociopolitical exposomes. (c) Linear regression models examined the association between BBAGs and individual sociopolitical exposomes (democracy indicators), controlling for social and physical exposomes. We used a one-sided F-test to evaluate the statistical significance of the linear regression model, testing whether the model explains a substantially greater proportion of variance than expected by chance. (d) Linear fit between BBAGs and all exposomes, excluding zones with sparse exposome density, and combined social, physical, and sociopolitical exposomes. (e) Linear regression models assessing the relationship between BAGs and individual social (gender equality, migration, and structural equality) and physical exposomes (air quality), excluding zones with sparse exposome density. (f) Linear regression models examining the association between BBAGs and individual sociopolitical exposomes (democracy indicators), excluding zones with sparse exposome density. All P-values reported in Panels (a) to (f) were < 1e-15.

The sample size for the analyses reported in this figure included 21,631 individuals. (a) Linear regression models tracked the relationships between recalculated BBAGs in wave 1 (excluding the specific healthy aging factor used as the outcome) and healthy aging factors (cognition, functional ability, and well-being) in wave 2. Recalculated BBAGs in wave 1 significantly predicted poorer cognition, functional ability, and well-being in wave 2. All P-values reported were < 1e-15.

The sample size for the analyses reported in this figure included 5,431 individuals. (a) Linear regression models were used to assess the relationships between BBAGs in wave 1 and healthy aging factors (walking and memory) in wave 2. BBAGs in wave 1 significantly predicted poorer cognition, functional ability, and well-being in wave 2. (b) Linear regression models tracked the relationships between BBAGs in wave 1 as significant predictors of BBAGs in wave 2. All P-values reported were < 1e-15.

(a) Odds ratios and attributable risk for the cross-sectional subsample. Results showed that BBAGs are significantly associated with poorer functional ability and cognition. Analyses reported in this panel included 101,870 individuals for cognition, 99,588 for functional ability, and 101,618 individuals for well-being. (b) Relative risk and Attributable risk for the South African dataset. BBAGs in wave 1 were significantly associated with declines in walking and memory, despite the effects on walking ability showing an uncertain confidence interval. Analyses reported in this panel included 3,868 individuals. (c) Meta-analysis on cross-sectional subsample for cognition, functional ability, and wellbeing using common-effects and random-effects models. Larger BBAGs are linked to poorer outcomes in all domains, with high heterogeneity across countries. All P-values reported in this panel were < 0.01. We used Cochran's Q test to assess heterogeneity across studies, reporting the associated p-value, degrees of freedom, and I2 statistic. (d) Summary of cross-sectional results, showing the average of common- and random-effects models by income level (low or high) based on gross national income (GNI) and gross domestic product (GDP) classifications. Color bar indicates effect sizes (small: blue and large: red). Accelerated aging is more strongly linked to poorer healthy aging outcomes—cognition, functional ability, and well-being—in low-income countries compared to high-income countries for both classifications (GNI: p = 4.05e-9, r = 0.82 and GDP: p = 8.35e-4, r = 0.47). The maps were created in Python using the Plotly library (https://plotly.com/python/maps/). All other illustrations and icons were designed using GIMP (https://www.gimp.org).

(a) Feature importance analyses enabled the prediction of chronological age using biobehavioral factors. The sample size for the analyses reported in this figure included 148,188 individuals. Goodness-of-fit and feature importance metrics are provided. (b) Mean decrease in impurity (MDI) facilitated the characterization of groups with more delayed (left panel) and more accelerated (right panel) aging. Goodness-of-fit and feature importance metrics are provided.

The sample size for the analyses reported in this figure was 148,188 individuals. Panels (a) and (c): Feature importance analyses enabled the prediction of chronological age using biobehavioral factors in females and males, respectively. Goodness-of-fit and feature importance metrics are provided. Panels (b) and (d): Feature importance analyses characterized groups with more delayed (left panel) and more accelerated (right panel) aging in females and males, respectively. Goodness-of-fit and feature importance metrics are provided. Panels (e), (f), and (g): Linear regression models tracked the relationship between BBAGs and various social exposomes across sex: Panel (e): Combined social exposomes. Panel (f): Social and physical exposomes. Panel (g): Sociopolitical exposomes. All P-values reported were < 1e-15.

Astronomers have detected a giant exoplanet - between three and ten times the size of Jupiter - hiding in the swirling disc of gas and dust surrounding a young star.

Earlier observations of this star, called MP Mus, suggested that it was all alone without any planets in orbit around it, surrounded by a featureless cloud of gas and dust.

However, a second look at MP Mus, using a combination of results from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the European Space Agency's Gaia mission, suggest that the star is not alone after all.

The international team of astronomers, led by the University of Cambridge, detected a large gas giant in the star's protoplanetary disc: the pancake-like cloud of gases, dust and ice where the process of planet formation begins. This is the first time that Gaia has detected an exoplanet within a protoplanetary disc. The results, reported in the journal Nature Astronomy, suggest that similar methods could be useful in the hunt for young planets around other stars.

By studying how planets form in the protoplanetary discs around young stars, researchers can learn more about how our own Solar System evolved. Through a process known as core accretion, gravity causes particles in the disc to stick to each other, eventually forming larger solid bodies like asteroids or planets. As young planets form, they start to carve gaps in the disc, like grooves on a vinyl record.

However, observing these young planets is extremely challenging, due to the interference from the gas and dust in the disc. To date, only three robust detections of young planets in a protoplanetary disc have been made.

Dr Álvaro Ribas from Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, who led the research, specialises in studying protoplanetary discs. "We first observed this star at the time when we learned that most discs have rings and gaps, and I was hoping to find features around MP Mus that could hint at the presence of a planet or planets," he said.

Using ALMA, Ribas observed the protoplanetary disc around MP Mus (PDS 66) in 2023. The results showed a young star seemingly all alone in the universe. Its surrounding disc showed none of the gaps where planets might be forming, and was completely flat and featureless.

"Our earlier observations showed a boring, flat disc," said Ribas. "But this seemed odd to us, since the disc is between seven and ten million years old. In a disc of that age, we would expect to see some evidence of planet formation."

Now, Ribas and his colleagues from Germany, Chile, and France have given MP Mus another chance. Once again using ALMA, they observed the star at the 3mm range, a longer wavelength than the earlier observations, allowing them to probe deeper into the disc.

The new observations turned up a cavity close to the star and two gaps further out, which were obscured in the earlier observations, suggesting that MP Mus may not be alone after all.

At the same time, Miguel Vioque, a researcher at the European Southern Observatory, was uncovering another piece of the puzzle. Using data from Gaia, he found MP Mus was 'wobbling'.

"My first reaction was that I must have made a mistake in my calculations, because MP Mus was known to have a featureless disc," said Vioque. "I was revising my calculations when I saw Álvaro give a talk presenting preliminary results of a newly-discovered inner cavity in the disc, which meant the wobbling I was detecting was real and had a good chance of being caused by a forming planet."

Using a combination of the Gaia and ALMA observations, along with some computer modelling, the researchers say the wobbling is likely caused by a gas giant - less than ten times the mass of Jupiter - orbiting the star at a distance between one and three times the distance of the Earth to the Sun.

"Our modelling work showed that if you put a giant planet inside the new-found cavity, you can also explain the Gaia signal," said Ribas. "And using the longer ALMA wavelengths allowed us to see structures we couldn't see before."

This is the first time an exoplanet embedded in a protoplanetary disc has been indirectly discovered in this way - by combining precise star movement data from the Gaia with deep observations of the disc. It also means that many more hidden planets might exist in other discs, just waiting to be found.

"We think this might be one of the reasons why it's hard to detect young planets in protoplanetary discs, because in this case, we needed the ALMA and Gaia data together," said Ribas. "The longer ALMA wavelength is incredibly useful, but to observe at this wavelength requires more time on the telescope."

Ribas says that upcoming upgrades to ALMA, as well as future telescopes such as the next generation Very Large Array (ngVLA), may be used to look deeper into more discs and better understand the hidden population of young planets, which could in turn help us learn how our own planet may have formed.

The research was supported in part by the European Union's Horizon Programme, the European Research Council, and the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

You'll have a really, really bad time if you don't take notice of “jack mode.”

Here's what you'll learn reading this story.

For better or worse, car ownership will always require some amount of maintenance that may sometimes require you to jack your car up into the air. And if you're lucky enough to own a vehicle with air suspension, you'll want to make sure you've engaged its “jack mode” before getting the car off the ground. This is especially important for Tesla vehicles, as forgetting to engage the maintenance setting could cause significant damage to your vehicle—and your eardrums.

Tesla's vehicles with air suspension—the Model X, Model S, and Cybertruck—will have a “jack mode” that needs to be engaged before lifting the car. Air suspension is a remarkably sophisticated system, capable of self-leveling the vehicle while you're driving, but the system stays active even when the car is off. This means that if you were to jack one side up into the air, the airbags on the other side (that inflate to control the ride height) could overinflate and explode in their attempt to to counteract the difference in height.

You'll likely know if your Tesla is equipped with air suspension, but if you're unsure, it's easy to check. If you can adjust your ride height from the center screen, your vehicle is equipped with air springs. Unfortunately—or, perhaps, fortunately—those of you who own Model 3s and Model Ys won't have air springs. (Both vehicles were designed to accommodate air suspension, but the idea was scrapped before they went into production.)

As it turns out, there's more reason to jack up your Tesla than merely fixing a flat tire. There's actually a surprising amount of aftermarket support from a number of brands. Unplugged Performance has rapidly become the gold standard for go-fast Tesla bits, manufacturing and selling components for the Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and even the Cybertruck.

At the more basic end, Unplugged Performance makes aftermarket wheels and tires. However, they also offer much more advanced components like bigger brakes, more complicated springs and dampers, racing equipment installations, and even a full race prep program (if you're looking to go racing). For the Cybertruck, Unplugged offers more off-road focused components like lift kits, racks, bumpers, and even rock sliders, among many other accessories.

It would be easy to dismiss the potential damages that would result from not engaging jack mode, as the majority of motorists don't actually wrench on their cars. However, if you were stranded on the side of the road with a flat tire and opted to change the wheel yourself, you could potentially experience these serious issues.

That said, the do-it-yourself option may not be on the table for many drivers, as the majority of modern vehicles don't actually carry a spare tire. Most cars in Tesla's range come with a tire repair kit and an air pump instead of a spare tire. (The Cybertruck is the company's only vehicle that's available with a spare tire as an optional extra.) Though that may come as a surprise to some, many automakers have done their research, and believe that the improvement in efficiency cause by not hauling around an extra tire outweighs the risk of leaving their customers stranded. 

Whether or not you agree is up to you.

Our redistribution of mass on the surface has gone a bridge—or a dam—too far.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Dams have long been one of humanity's greatest tools for controlling the world's water. The very first dams, constructed in ancient Mesopotamia, were used for many of the same purposes as they are today: water irrigation and flood control (though, a few centuries later, we now also use them to generate hydropower). But as the era of big dams truly got underway in the 19th and 20th centuries, we've also begun to learn about the unintended consequences of these dams.  They drastically disturb natural ecosystems, negatively impact water quality, and exacerbate soil erosion—oh, and they've also altered the location of the Earth's poles. 

In a new study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, a team of scientists at Harvard University details their discovery that the rampant construction of dams from 1835 to 2011 has locked up so much water that the Earth's poles have moved slightly from their axial rotation. Because Earth's outermost layer rests upon another layer of liquid rock, a redistribution of mass on the surface—whether accomplished by glaciers during an ice age or by locking up water behind dams—it can influence the orientation of the Earth's poles. The authors describe the phenomenon like slapping a lump of clay on a basketball and spinning it. In an effort to maintain momentum, the ball adorned with clay will shift slightly toward the equator, which eventually impacts the poles in a process known as “true polar wander.” 

Thankfully, Earth is not destined to end up like the planet Uranus, forever spinning on its side. Two centuries of frantic dam-building (about 7,000 of them in total) has only nudged the poles about three feet and caused a 0.83-inch drop in global sea levels. 

“As we trap water behind dams, not only does it remove water from the oceans, thus leading to a global sea level fall, it also distributes mass in a different way around the world,” Harvard University graduate student Natasha Valencic, the lead author of the study, said in a press statement. “We're not going to drop into a new ice age, because the pole moved by about a meter [or about three feet] in total, but it does have implications for sea level.”

Interestingly, the movement of the poles also matches the history of industrialization. Between 1835 and 1954, a majority of dams were constructed in North America and Europe, moving the North Pole 8 inches to the 103rd meridian east. Once East Africa and Asia began constructing dams in the latter half of the 20th century, the poles moved once again—this time 22 inches toward the 117th meridian west, according to the authors. 

The most eye-popping example of dams' astronomical impact can be seen by analyzing the effects of China's Three Gorges Dam, the largest dam in the world. In 2005, NASA scientist Benjamin Fong Chao showed that when full, this mega-dam alone slowed the rotation of the Earth by 0.06 microseconds, or 60 billionths of a second. 

Dams aren't the only anthropomorphic force at work impacting the orientation of the Earth's poles, however. A 2023 study analyzed the impact of pumping groundwater from reservoirs, and estimated that between 1993 and 2010, net water loss amounted to roughly 2 trillion tons and caused a 4.36 centimeter shift every year.

Humanity continues to impact our planet in a myriad of complex ways. Hopefully, the more we learn about these impacts, the more we can mitigate any negative impacts they may bring along with them.

Researchers have demonstrated a new technique that allows "self-driving laboratories" to collect at least 10 times more data than previous techniques at record speed. The advance - which is published in Nature Chemical Engineering - dramatically expedites materials discovery research, while slashing costs and environmental impact.

Self-driving laboratories are robotic platforms that combine machine learning and automation with chemical and materials sciences to discover materials more quickly. The automated process allows machine-learning algorithms to make use of data from each experiment when predicting which experiment to conduct next to achieve whatever goal was programmed into the system.

"Imagine if scientists could discover breakthrough materials for clean energy, new electronics, or sustainable chemicals in days instead of years, using just a fraction of the materials and generating far less waste than the status quo," says Milad Abolhasani, corresponding author of a paper on the work and ALCOA Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at North Carolina State University. "This work brings that future one step closer."

Until now, self-driving labs utilizing continuous flow reactors have relied on steady-state flow experiments. In these experiments, different precursors are mixed together and chemical reactions take place, while continuously flowing in a microchannel. The resulting product is then characterized by a suite of sensors once the reaction is complete.

"This established approach to self-driving labs has had a dramatic impact on materials discovery," Abolhasani says. "It allows us to identify promising material candidates for specific applications in a few months or weeks, rather than years, while reducing both costs and the environmental impact of the work. However, there was still room for improvement."

Steady-state flow experiments require the self-driving lab to wait for the chemical reaction to take place before characterizing the resulting material. That means the system sits idle while the reactions take place, which can take up to an hour per experiment.

"We've now created a self-driving lab that makes use of dynamic flow experiments, where chemical mixtures are continuously varied through the system and are monitored in real time," Abolhasani says. "In other words, rather than running separate samples through the system and testing them one at a time after reaching steady-state, we've created a system that essentially never stops running. The sample is moving continuously through the system and, because the system never stops characterizing the sample, we can capture data on what is taking place in the sample every half second.

"For example, instead of having one data point about what the experiment produces after 10 seconds of reaction time, we have 20 data points - one after 0.5 seconds of reaction time, one after 1 second of reaction time, and so on. It's like switching from a single snapshot to a full movie of the reaction as it happens. Instead of waiting around for each experiment to finish, our system is always running, always learning."

Collecting this much additional data has a big impact on the performance of the self-driving lab.

"The most important part of any self-driving lab is the machine-learning algorithm the system uses to predict which experiment it should conduct next," Abolhasani says. "This streaming-data approach allows the self-driving lab's machine-learning brain to make smarter, faster decisions, honing in on optimal materials and processes in a fraction of the time. That's because the more high-quality experimental data the algorithm receives, the more accurate its predictions become, and the faster it can solve a problem. This has the added benefit of reducing the amount of chemicals needed to arrive at a solution."

In this work, the researchers found the self-driving lab that incorporated a dynamic flow system generated at least 10 times more data than self-driving labs that used steady-state flow experiments over the same period of time, and was able to identify the best material candidates on the very first try after training.

"This breakthrough isn't just about speed," Abolhasani says. "By reducing the number of experiments needed, the system dramatically cuts down on chemical use and waste, advancing more sustainable research practices.

"The future of materials discovery is not just about how fast we can go, it's also about how responsibly we get there," Abolhasani says. "Our approach means fewer chemicals, less waste, and faster solutions for society's toughest challenges."

The paper, "Flow-Driven Data Intensification to Accelerate Autonomous Materials Discovery," will be published July 14 in the journal Nature Chemical Engineering. Co-lead authors of the paper are Fernando Delgado-Licona, a Ph.D. student at NC State; Abdulrahman Alsaiari, a master's student at NC State; and Hannah Dickerson, a former undergraduate at NC State. The paper was co-authored by Philip Klem, an undergraduate at NC State; Arup Ghorai, a former postdoctoral researcher at NC State; Richard Canty and Jeffrey Bennett, current postdoctoral researchers at NC State; Pragyan Jha, Nikolai Mukhin, Junbin Li and Sina Sadeghi, Ph.D. students at NC State; Fazel Bateni, a former Ph.D. student at NC State; and Enrique A. López-Guajardo of Tecnologico de Monterrey.

The world's deepest and largest underground laboratory is 2,400 metres below the Jinping Mountains in southwest China.

In the past two decades, China has made big advances in scientific research, and its rise to the top of the 2025 Nature Index tables highlights this shift (see go.nature.com/45vf99n). According to these metrics, which track and fairly compare each country's contributions to research articles in top journals, China has surpassed the United States in producing high-quality natural-sciences research (see ‘High-impact research').

Even so, Chinese research faces big challenges. For example, the country still struggles to deliver groundbreaking discoveries and convert its research into commercial successes. The commercialization rate of Chinese university patents has remained below 5%. In the United States, the average annual patent transfer ratio is greater than 54%1. Several Chinese companies also continue to rely on imported technologies, particularly from the United States.

This innovation bottleneck is compounded by global trends: the COVID-19 pandemic, rising protectionism in trade and escalating US–China technological tensions, which have disrupted international cooperation and deepened the need for domestic technological independence. As global dynamics shift and the push to ‘decouple' the United States from China intensifies2, the country now faces the urgent task of building greater scientific self-reliance.



China can build on advances it has made since 2022, when it shifted its science policy towards an ‘organized research' model — emphasizing mission-driven science, nationwide resource mobilization and cross-institutional collaboration. By forming task-focused teams and tackling urgent challenges at the frontiers of science and economic needs, the policy seeks to drive scientific breakthroughs in areas that are crucial to the country's strategic priorities, such as artificial intelligence (AI), renewable energy, biomedicine and fundamental science.

Here, we outline the shifts in policy, explore the challenges and suggest ways to find a balance between pursuing collective national goals and fostering individual scientific creativity.

Modern science is deeply influenced by social, political and institutional factors. Changes under way in China include the following.

How science is organized. In 2023, China established the Central Science and Technology Commission to reinforce the Communist Party's leadership over the country's scientific and technological agenda. The commission is tasked with coordinating the development of ‘strategic science' — research aligned with national priorities and long-term goals.

At the national level, more than 300 state key laboratories (SKLs) — the country's top research centres — have been restructured since 2022 to promote cross-institutional collaboration. For example, the SKL for Photovoltaic Science and Technology was restructured around a partnership between photovoltaics company Trina Solar in Changzhou and Fudan University in Shanghai. This collaboration aims to harness the complementary strengths of academia and industry to drive innovation in solar technology.

At the institutional level, universities are building new research platforms. For example, last year, China Pharmaceutical University in Nanjing launched its Intelligent Pharmacy Institute, bringing together AI and drug discovery under a unified, centralized framework. By consolidating funding, personnel and interdisciplinary expertise, the institute seeks to streamline AI-driven pharmaceutical research. It also collaborates closely with leading pharmaceutical companies through initiatives such as the Intelligent Pharmacy Education–Industry Alliance to address real-world industrial challenges.

How resources are mobilized. Big science projects, which need massive resources, go beyond the capacity of a single institution or small research team. In 2024, to better channel resources and align research with pressing national priorities, China shifted the responsibility for key research and development programmes from the Ministry of Science and Technology to sector-specific government agencies, such as the Ministry of Water Resources. To boost China's participation in international big-science initiatives, the latest key project for Intergovernmental International Cooperation on Science and Technology Innovation was launched in May. It aims to fund around 169 collaborative projects with a total budget of approximately 304 million yuan (US$42.4 million).

By contrast, individual researchers are facing tighter competition and fewer resources. The General Programs of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) — a major funding source for individual scientists — saw average grant sizes decline by 8.1% between 2022 and 2024, while applications surged by 53%, signalling increasingly limited funding opportunities for independent research3,4.

How scientists are evaluated. Appraisal and evaluation systems are being reshaped. Technology transfer and real-world impact are gaining more influence in how science and scientists are assessed. For instance, the updated Interim Measures for the Administration of the National Key R&D Program, issued last year, places greater emphasis on research outcomes than it does on academic publications, with a particular focus on how breakthroughs can translate into practical applications.

Researchers in China are now encouraged to embody the ideal of Ding Tian Li Di scientists. Ding Tian — ‘reaching the sky' — represents the pursuit of cutting-edge research, and Li Di — ‘standing on the ground' — emphasizes serving national priorities and delivering tangible societal impact. This slogan encapsulates China's broader shift in research evaluation: scientists are expected to excel not only in academic prestige but also in addressing real-world challenges and contributing to national competitiveness.

Although success will surely follow, we identify three challenges faced by the organized-research policy that might prevent China from achieving all its desired goals.

First, Chinese universities remain organized mainly around conventional academic disciplines, with government resources allocated to specific departments. However, this structure is often ill-suited to addressing complex national priorities — such as achieving carbon neutrality — that demand coordinated efforts across disciplines, such as energy systems, chemistry, environmental science and management.

In response, research units and interdisciplinary platforms have begun to emerge. Yet, these often remain entangled with existing discipline-based structures. For example, the Institute of Carbon Neutrality at Peking University in Beijing, established in 2023, significantly overlaps with conventional departments: 113 of its researchers hold dual appointments with their original academic institutions. This dual affiliation creates competition for faculty members' time and research funding, limiting the institute's ability to function as an independent driver of interdisciplinary research.

Furthermore, structural barriers persist. Faculty members must still declare a disciplinary affiliation when applying for grants and promotions, and their work is typically evaluated by their peers from the same field. As a result, there is little institutional incentive to engage in cross-disciplinary or cross-unit collaboration.

Second, the way in which the Chinese government is organizing research and allocating resources might draw scientists into a narrow set of fields, which could discourage grassroots innovation and limit academic freedom. One indicator of this is the shrinking share of General Programs in the NSFC budget — these programmes, known for their broad scope and investigator-driven nature, accounted for only 31.5% of total funding in 2023, down from 51.0% in 2013. This trend suggests growing challenges for researchers seeking support for self-directed, curiosity-driven research.

Although the mission-oriented model can mobilize national capacity for targeted goals, it risks producing scientific uniformity and undermining small-scale research efforts, which some studies suggest are more productive5 and more likely to yield original or disruptive discoveries6.

Another risk lies in the volatility of government priorities. When state support is withdrawn, entire research areas can stagnate. A historical example is the termination of the US Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project in 1993 owing to budget overruns, management challenges and waning political support. The SSC had aimed to discover the Higgs boson — an achievement ultimately realized by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, Europe's particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, in 2012. The SSC's cancellation serves as a cautionary tale of how shifts in political will can derail long-term scientific efforts, regardless of their potential.

Third, large-team, heavily funded ‘big science' tends to concentrate decision-making and resources to a small group of leading scientists. Marginalized or less established researchers might have limited opportunities to contribute meaningfully to big projects. And even if they do participate, problems might arise with sharing awards, honours and resources equitably.

Here, we propose a few suggestions to mitigate these challenges.

A Longevity Expert Breaks Down the Science and Hype of Biological Aging Tests

Super Agers author Eric Topol unpacks the rise of biological age tests—from organ clocks to immune system clocks—and how they might revolutionize early diagnosis of disease

By Lauren J. Young edited by Dean Visser

How old are you really? Counting birthdays may be a common tally, but your “age” isn't determined by time alone. New research increasingly shows the importance of considering chronological age as something very different from biological age—in which the body and its cells, tissues and organs all have separate “clocks” that can tick at different speeds.

“Calculating biological age, I think, is core to the advances we've made in the science of aging,” says Eric Topol, a cardiologist and genomics professor at Scripps Research in California. “It's a way you can tell if a person, organ, or any biological unit is at pace of aging—if it's normal, abnormal or supernormal.”

In his new book Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity, Topol delves into the recent surge in public interest in biological aging and the accelerating quest to refine ways to measure it—giving a more precise picture of a person's longevity prospects and of potential ailments that can be prevented or treated early. Scientific American spoke with Topol about the latest research in biological aging, factors that might speed it up or slow it down and what it can tell us about our health.

[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]

How is biological age determined and how has the research evolved?

The real beginning of this research started more than a decade ago by geneticist Steven Horvath with his “clock” [test], with which, basically using saliva, you could look at specific genetic markers in a genome and predict a person's biological age. His clock is really known as an epigenetic clock, or methylation clock. As people age, DNA changes and gets methylated—this is when a methyl group [molecule] attaches to specific nucleotides of DNA. I kind of liken it to the body rusting out. Basically, you're getting marks at specific parts of the genome that track with aging in humans and every other species of mammal.

In Horvath's initial test, there clearly was a detection of both alignment with the person's real age, or chronological age—and when it wasn't matching up. In other words, if a person's biological age was off by a few years from their real age, you'd wonder why that is.

Then what's proliferated in the more than 10 years since has been all these other clocks: protein clocks, RNA clocks, immune system clocks—you name it. Using plasma proteins from a blood sample, we can also clock organs—whether it's the heart, brain, liver or kidney. So we have seen just enormous advances in these clocks, and they keep getting refined with added features. There's a race to get the best clocks to predict survival.

What can biological age tests tell us clinically?

We can detect in an individual if something's not right at different levels. For example, if your biological age is five years older than your real age, is there an organ that might be linked with that? Then you can use these clocks to see if lifestyle, prevention or treatment can slow down the pace of aging and get it into alignment with your actual age.

The question is: When will doctors actually start using them? The medical community is very hard to change. So it hasn't happened yet, but I believe it will eventually. Tests are also made available by commercial companies, but they can be very expensive. You can run an epigenetic test in a very simple way for $10 or $20, while some of these companies are charging $200.

I haven't seen their publications to be able to say with confidence that they are doing things right, and the lack of standards from one company to the next is disconcerting. They don't want to shock [customers by telling them] that they're 10 years older than their real chronological age. Eventually, I believe, we're going to have high-fidelity epigenetic clocks with no motivation for a provider to hold things back if a person's data are really bad.

Why might someone biologically age “faster” or “slower” than their actual age?

If you had to pick one mechanism behind why biological age and chronological age are misaligned, it would most likely be because there are some genes that are either protective or linked with accelerated aging—but that's such a small part of the story. Another root cause appears to be that our immune system gets weaker and less functional as we get older. In the average person, this starts around age 55 to 60. It drops its level of protection, or it gets dysregulated—off track—and it can have an untoward, hyperactive response. Now when you have that happen, you start to see inflammation in the organs, such as in the arteries of the heart or the brain—it's what I call “inflammaging.”

Obviously our lifestyle also has a big impact—eating a really healthy diet that's not proinflammatory and doesn't have a lot of ultraprocessed foods or red meat. Good sleep health helps reduce inflammation. There's only one thing that's been definitively shown to slow the epigenetic aging process, and that's exercise. I think these clocks ultimately are going to be very good incentives for people to adopt a healthy lifestyle. We can't get everybody to do all these things that we know help them, but if they get their own data and they see something's off track, the hope is that they'd [change their lifestyle]. That's, of course, just one of the ways to prevent diseases. There are also drugs and other treatments.

What environmental factors are also important to consider?

We have all kinds of food deserts in the U.S. We have air pollution and unmitigated accumulation in the air and water of microplastics and nanoplastics, which get into every part of our body and induce inflammation. And we have forever chemicals as well that are pervasive. These all play a factor in lifestyle, health and aging.

Let's talk more about “inflammaging.” We know some inflammation can be good for the body to fight infections, for instance, but a lot can be bad. How does chronic inflammation potentially accelerate aging?

Inflammation and aging are so tightly intertwined. The immune system is really the driver for good [when it attacks pathogens] and for bad when it promotes too much inflammation in walls of arteries or the brain. That's heart disease and neurodegenerative disease, respectively. But what's so exciting is we can dial up or down the immune system now. For example, [there have been] natural, amazing experiments with the shingles vaccines, which reduce dementia and Alzheimer's disease 20 to 25 percent. So how does that work? Well, [the vaccine] amps up the immune system in people and older adults. That's going to be the critical thing in using these metrics: zooming in on the immune system and inflammation to keep people's immune system intact and stop it when it starts to go haywire. That's the future. In the last chapter of the book, I presented the first cut of my “immunome”—an assay of every virus and pathogen I've been exposed to, every antibody I have. But that's just scratching the surface.

The immune system clock could turn out to be the most useful of all; if I could pick one, that's the one I would want. But the immune system is very complex. Maybe we don't have to do a systematic, comprehensive assessment of our immunome [that would include checking antibody titers and] sequencing B cells, T cells and interferons. If we can use just a group of plasma proteins, that would be terrific. That remains to be seen. There's a human immunome project just getting started to try to compare things such as the proteins with the much more sophisticated and expensive ways to get at the health of an immune system.

What are the downsides of slowing down biological aging, or extending lifespan?

We feel really great if we get to age 85. “Super agers” who don't get one of the big four age-related diseases [type 2 diabetes, cancer, or heart or neurodegenerative disease] say “Well, I did it.” Of course, if you get up to age 98, you're really doing well. I think we're going to have a whole lot more super agers. But that's not going to get around the fact that eventually they're going to develop some problems—one of the big four or other conditions. It could be you get an infection because your immune system is just too weak. Or it could be you break your hip because your bone density is so low and you wind up with a pulmonary embolus [a clot that blocks blood flow to the lungs].

Eventually you die, and you may have a chronic illness between that point of extended health span and when you die. I don't want to put a sense out there that super agers won't see problems in the latter stages of their lives. But the point is, let's extend the health span—high-quality life without these big age-related diseases—as much as we can before getting into the downturn of a health arc.

A Book of Noises



Caspar Henderson Univ. Chicago Press (2023)

I know I'm reading a great book when the sounds around me recede into the background. Yet, A Book of Noises by journalist Caspar Henderson reminded me that a great book can also do the opposite. This lyrical exploration of the science of sounds rendered every noise more vivid and worthy of attention.

Henderson traverses vast scales of time and space, demonstrating how all of history is infused with noise — from the ‘groaning' of some moons as meteors crash into them to the throbbing of veins and cracking of icebergs. The northern lights, we learn, are both visual spectacles and auditory wonders, emitting crackling and sizzling sounds. Even plants can respond to the sound vibrations that nearby animals produce. The buzz of a bee's wings, for example, can induce nearby suncup flowers to make nectar that has a higher concentration of sugar, to attract pollinators.

In its scope and passion, this book appeals to readers' most romantic instincts — reminding us of our entanglement with the cosmos and the organisms that live in it. It is the perfect summer read. Absorb it in one curious inhalation or in a series of meditative moments by a sunny window; amid the noise, it will feel like a quiet revelation. — Leor Zmigrod

The AI Con



Alex Hanna & Emily Bender Harper Collins (2025)

“Do you believe in hope after hype?” ask linguist Emily Bender and sociologist Alex Hanna in their sharp, witty book, The AI Con, after taking us through the hellscape that is artificial intelligence (AI) hype. With a humorous but critical eye, they run through some of the largest AI claims made in the past few years — and how some collapsed on closer inspection. AI models to predict sepsis, for example, have shown low performance and high false-positive rates.

Imparting too much trust in machine-learning models has harmed the health, education and law sectors. Bender and Hanna offer tools to assess hype. Simple questions can reveal flaws in the tools' promises: who benefits from AI adoption? Who is harmed? What nuance is lost when perusing AI-compiled summaries instead of whole texts?

Bender and Hanna warn against anthropomorphizing AI, and show how many seemingly magical AI behaviours, such as creating art, come from copying humans, which has led to lawsuits from artists and film makers. Yet, AI technologies can be powerful for their intended purposes. With careful measurement, evaluation and a focus on capabilities over profit, they can automate mundane, repetitive tasks. Do I believe in hope after hype? A resounding yes. — Nyalleng Moorosi

Sultana's Dream



Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain The Indian Ladies' Magazine (1905)

Long before today's global discussions on climate change or gender equity, educator and political activist Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain envisioned a future in which science served justice and sustainability. In Sultana's Dream (1905), writing from the colonial Bengal Presidency, she evokes ‘Ladyland' — a feminist utopia in which men take on domestic work while women run society, centring innovation around care, community and ecological balance.

Her provocative vision is remarkable considering the structural exclusions she faced. That a Muslim woman in a colonized country conceived of green innovation, universal education and social equity as forms of justice more than a century ago is deeply inspiring. The solar kitchens, electric transport, geoengineering balloons (to harvest water, as a resource and to control rain) and zero-emission agriculture she describes seem fantastical — but they are part of a long-overlooked lineage of feminist techno-visions.

As a Bangladeshi scholar and feminist scientist, I find this manifesto against the extractivist science and capitalist consumption that are ruining the planet discerning. Sultana's Dream deserves renewed attention as a creative, radically prescient blueprint from the margins. It shows the futures we might build, if only we choose them. — Farhana Sultana

Unreliable



Csaba Szabo Columbia Univ. Press (2025)

Pharmacologist Csaba Szabo is alarmed by the reproducibility crisis in biomedical science. According to reports, attempts to replicate biomedical work succeed in only 10–40% of cases — a dismal statistic. In Unreliable, Szabo guides readers through the issues that have led to this, including methodological flaws, structural problems in science and the hyper-competitive environment for grants. His engaging book is stuffed with facts and evidence.

The author pays special attention to scientific fraud, both by individuals and in the form of mass-produced fraudulent research churned out by paper mills. Dodgy papers are too often included in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which could lead to people receiving ineffective treatments. Pharmaceutical companies, publishers and universities are failing to effectively promote and enforce integrity in science.

But there are ways to overcome the crisis. Szabo advocates fresh approaches to scientific training that centre collaborative work and emphasize robust and freely available data. He argues for replacing the for-profit publishing industry with data repositories and online information-storage systems, and for transforming systematic reviews, which need post-publication review to ensure lasting quality. His call to arms could not come soon enough. — Anna Abalkina

10 to 25



David Yeager Avid Reader Press/Simon & Schuster (2024)

Renowned psychologist and former teacher David Yeager has spent more than a decade identifying adults who excel at helping young people to exceed expectations. These mentors share a common approach, he observes in 10 to 25. Whether they are training surgeons, perfecting elite athletes' basketball shots or teaching calculus to secondary-school students, they do not just tell young people what to do. Instead, they ensure that young people have the emotional and logistical scaffolding that they need to meet high standards.

Yeager points out that these exceptional adults stand apart from many of us, who, despite our best intentions, get it wrong. There is often a mismatch between adolescents' need, partly neurobiological, for status and respect and the way in which adults view and treat them. ‘Just say no' campaigns are a classic example, often backfiring because of failed assumptions about youth and an over-reliance on authority.

Through a skilful synthesis of the science, Yeager frames adolescence not as a problem to be solved, but as something to invest in. This book offers a refreshing take on a transformative stage of life and is a must-read for parents, teachers and anyone who wants to better understand and support young people. — Candice L. Odgers

Fire Weather



John Vaillant Hachette (2023)

With a frightening account of a devastating wildfire that ravaged Fort McMurray, an oil town in Canada, in 2016, writer John Vaillant gives us a glimpse of what fire events will be like in our warming planet.

This gripping tale is reminiscent of a disaster movie in which scientists' warnings are ignored until it's too late. Fiction has become reality. The irony at the heart of the Fort McMurray blaze makes the story a powerful one: the same industry that contributed to global warming was brought to a halt by its consequences.

Vaillant's depiction of the fire, which forced more than 90,000 people to evacuate and destroyed thousands of homes, seems apocalyptic — but every detail is true. In the years since, other wildfires just as devastating have unfolded around the world.

Vaillant guides readers through fire and climate science. His focus on geology, meteorology and ecology highlights a warning: fire, once a natural part of the Earth system, has become something new. We have reshaped it. Fire Weather isn't just about one fire. It's about what the future could look like if we fail to act. Vaillant urges us to ask how this has happened but also what we're willing to change to prevent it from happening again. — Renata Libonati

All Things are Full of Gods



David Bentley Hart Yale Univ. Press (2024)

Four Greek deities meet in a blooming garden to debate the nature of reality. Hephaistos, the god of artisans, argues that everything that exists is material, and so consciousness is an anomaly that the brain must miraculously produce. Psyche, Eros and Hermes — respectively personifying the principles of life, love and language — counter Hephaistos' world-view by positing that life, language and the mind cannot be reduced to mechanical material causes.

This is the premise of All Things are Full of Gods, by philosopher and theologian David Bentley Hart, whose own views align with those of Psyche, Eros and Hermes. By presenting these ideas in the form of a 500-page Platonic dialogue, Hart can examine objections to his thesis through the voice of Hephaistos.

Hart even succeeds at enhancing science with theology. An alliance between materialists and atheists has long held sway in science — but the author refutes such doctrines and advocates for a concept of a god as the absolute and transcendent source of human and physical nature.

All Things are Full of Gods is an intellectual blessing in an age in which it can feel like algorithms threaten our souls. It's hard going, but worth the effort. The foundations of existence and the mystery of consciousness are at stake. — Àlex Gómez-Marín

The Pregnancy Police



Grace E. Howard Univ. California Press (2024)

For far too long, conversations about reproductive health, rights and justice have been reduced to sound bites and clichés. But decision-making in this field is much more complex. Political scientist Grace Howard's gripping book, The Pregnancy Police, is a must-read for anyone attempting to make sense of our current environment — one in which Adriana Smith, a Black mother who was legally dead, was kept alive for four months to gestate a nine-week-old fetus to comply with Georgia's anti-abortion law, without her family being consulted.

The detection of planets in protoplanetary disks has proven to be extremely challenging. By contrast, rings and gaps, usually attributed to planet–disk interactions, have been found in virtually every large protoplanetary (Class II) disk observed at 0.9–1.3 mm with sufficient spatial resolution (5 au). The nearby disk around MP Mus (PDS 66) stands as an exception to this rule, and its advanced age (7–10 Myr) is particularly difficult to reconcile with its apparent lack of substructures. Despite the disk's smooth appearance, Gaia data of MP Mus show a significant proper motion anomaly, signalling the presence of a companion. Here we present ALMA 3-mm observations of the system with high spatial resolution comparable to previous 1.3-mm data. The new observations pierce deeper into the disk midplane and reveal an inner cavity (<3 au) and a ring at 10 au. The disk structure inferred from ALMA observations narrows down the properties of the companion to a gas giant orbiting at 1–3 au, and hydrodynamic simulations further confirm that such a planet can produce the observed cavity. These independent pieces of evidence constitute an indirect but compelling detection of an exoplanet within a protoplanetary disk using Gaia astrometry. The detection of dust substructures in MP Mus, thanks to the lower optical depths at longer wavelengths, suggests that rings and gaps are even more abundant than previously thought.

Despite extensive efforts to find protoplanets in protoplanetary disks, they have been robustly detected in only two systems so far (PDS 70 and IRAS 04125+2902)1,2,3. Accessing the population of young planets would be truly valuable for planet formation studies as this would provide direct benchmarks to our models, but common detection methods such as transits, radial velocity or direct imaging are extremely challenging or simply unfeasible for embedded companions owing to the high dust extinction in the disk and the increased stellar activity of young stars (for example, refs. 4,5). Instead, the presence of planets in disks is typically inferred by planet–disk interaction footprints such as disk substructures and velocity perturbations. In fact, arguably the most important discovery of the past decade for the field of planet formation is the ubiquity of substructures in protoplanetary disks. Rings, gaps, spiral arms or azimuthal asymmetries are found in virtually every large disk observed with sufficient angular resolution6,7,8.

Disk substructures offer a natural solution to the problem of dust radial drift: the interaction of millimetre-to-centimetre-sized grains with the gas in the disk causes large grains to drift towards the central star. This process is much faster than typical timescales for planet formation and can quickly deplete the population of large grains in disks, presenting a theoretical barrier to build rocky planets and the cores of gas giants9,10. Local gas pressure maxima (induced by planets or other processes) have been proposed as a mechanism to trap large grains and allow them to grow to larger sizes11,12,13, but this solution remained hypothetical until the high resolution and sensitivity of observatories such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch instrument (SPHERE) uncovered the plethora of disk substructures (for example, refs. 6,14,15).

As of today, MP Mus is the only large Class II protoplanetary disk that appears structureless when observed at millimetre wavelengths with high spatial resolution16 (<5 au). This K1V star is located 97.9 ± 0.1 pc away from Earth17 and has an estimated age of 7–10 Myr (ref. 16). Its dust disk extends up to Rdust,90% = 45 au at 1.3 mm (that is, the radius encompassing 90% of the 1.3-mm continuum emission), while the gaseous disk traced by the 12CO(J=2-1) reaches RCO,90% = 110 au. This ratio of gas to dust radii is similar to that of structured disks, in which dust traps are probably acting18. However, the disk appears structureless at 1.3 mm down to 4 au scales except for a tentative narrow dust ring in the outer regions16, recently confirmed by ref. 19 in high-resolution ALMA 0.89 mm observations. By contrast, scattered light observations of this system show an apparent gap between 40 au and 80 au (refs. 20,21). Nevertheless, the fact that the millimetre disk extends up to ~55 au, the clearly Keplerian rotation of the disk as traced by ALMA and its flat appearance strongly suggest that the drop in scattered light intensity between 40 au and 80 au is due to a shadowing effect and not an actual gap in the disk16. The smooth 1.3-mm radial profile is yet more puzzling when we compare the characteristic lifetime of disks22,23,24 (~3 Myr) with the age of MP Mus. To explain the survival of large dust grains in such an old and seemingly structureless disk, ref. 16 proposed a number of possible solutions: (1) substructures may be present in the disk but the 1.3-mm continuum is optically thick, effectively hiding them; (2) substructures smaller than 4 au exist and remain unresolved with current observations; or (3) the disk is really featureless and a different (unknown) mechanism is retaining millimetre-emitting grains in it. None of these scenarios could be tested with the existing observations at the time, and MP Mus remained an outlier among disks.

The 1.3-mm continuum emission of MP Mus shows no obvious signs of planets in the system but, by contrast, its astrometry deviates from a single star solution. By measuring the proper motion vector of the photocentre at different times, we can identify changes (proper motion anomalies, PMas) that signal the presence of companions25,26,27. PMas have already been used to identify exoplanets around main-sequence stars (later confirmed with high-resolution imaging, for example, refs. 28,29,30,31), but this method has not been applied to sources with protoplanetary disks yet. Compared with main-sequence stars, protostars exhibit additional phenomena (for example, variability, strong disk asymmetries, differential extinction and stellar obscuration by accretion columns) that could potentially induce a PMa. However, the analysis of well-known protoplanetary disks shows that only edge-on, highly asymmetric or massive disks can induce PMas (Vioque et al., in prep), and MP Mus has a very low accretion rate32 (~10−10 M⊙ yr−1). Therefore, none of these potential issues applies to the MP Mus system16.

We determined the PMa of MP Mus by comparing the proper motion vectors of Gaia DR2 and Gaia DR3 (for details on the technique, see refs. 33,34). The resulting PMa has a significance of 4.5σ (where σ is the uncertainty of the PMa) and implies a change in the proper motion of ∣Δμ∣ = 0.21 ± 0.05 mas yr−1. We used the scanning law of Gaia DR2 (ref. 35) and Gaia DR3 (ref. 36) to retrieve the epochs and scan angles in which Gaia observed this source. We then used these epochs and angles, together with realistic Gaia uncertainties, to simulate the Gaia DR2 and DR3 observations of MP Mus assuming a two-body system with different mass ratios and periods [using the astromet package developed by ref. 33). We assumed no eccentricity and a relation between the mass (q = Mcomp/Mprimary) and light (l = Lcomp/Lprimary) ratio of the components of l = q3.5, a heuristic commonly used for main-sequence stars. We ran 500,000 simulations randomly sampling the log-uniform space of mass ratios (from 0.0001 to 1) and periods (from 0.016 to 1,585 years). The mass of the primary source, the viewing angles and the orbital phase were sampled at random every time following the measured values and uncertainties of stellar mass (1.30 ± 0.08 M⊙), inclination (32 ± 1°) and position angle (10 ± 1°, disk geometries from ref. 16). We then selected only those simulations that resulted in astrometric properties compatible with what is observed in MP Mus (0.26 > ∣Δμ∣ > 0.16 mas yr−1, ∣Δμ∣/σ∣Δμ∣ > 4). In addition, MP Mus has a renormalized unit weight error (RUWE) very close to 1 in both Gaia DR2 and DR3 (of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively). We hence imposed a conservative threshold to the simulations of UWEDR3 <1.1 (see section 4.1 of ref. 33).

Figure 1 shows the orbital separations and masses for a companion to induce the observed PMa and RUWE. We note that we model only a two-body interaction, and the interpretation of the PMa becomes more complex for multibody systems. In this work, we assume that, although there may be other planets in MP Mus, its PMa is dominated by a single companion. From the Gaia data, we conclude that the PMa of MP Mus is most likely to be due to a companion at orbital separations <30 au, with the required mass increasing with orbital distance (Fig. 1). The non-detection of astrometric noise (that is, RUWE ~1) also rules out massive bodies with short periods (that is, a < 1 au). The strong statistical significance of the Gaia PMa detection makes for a good companion candidate in MP Mus, but a second, independent signature is needed to further constrain its location and mass.

Left: the individual Gaia simulations that produce an astrometric signal compatible with the observations (0.26 > ∣Δμ∣ > 0.16 mas yr−1, ∣Δμ∣/σ∣Δμ∣ > 4 and UWEDR3 <1.1). Right: the same simulations but smoothed over a two-dimensional histogram (contours correspond to 0.05%, 0.15% and 0.2%). When considering the disk structure traced in the millimetre (shaded area), the most likely companion is a gas giant at 1–2 au. Crosses indicate the parameters used for the hydrodynamical simulations in the ‘Confronting observations with simulations' section. The simulations that best reproduce both Gaia and ALMA observations are shown in red (Discussion).

To better understand MP Mus, we obtained new ALMA observations at 3 mm and with a spatial resolution (4 au) similar to that of the 1.3-mm data presented by ref. 16 (see the Methods for details about the observations and data processing). Longer wavelengths offer two main advantages to search for substructures in disks. First, the dust opacity (and therefore the optical depth) decreases with wavelength, and the observations probe emission closer to the disk midplane where planets are expected to form. This is most important in the disk inner regions where the emission is likely to be optically thick, as indicated by the low (α < 2) local millimetre spectral index of MP Mus between 1.3 mm and 2.2 mm (ref. 16). A second benefit of observations at longer wavelengths is that they trace larger grains, which experience a stronger gas drag and are more strongly trapped in pressure maxima. Therefore, if present, substructures may show an enhanced contrast at longer wavelengths (for example, ref. 37).

The ALMA 3-mm observations are shown in Fig. 2 alongside previous 1.3-mm data. The disk appears smooth at 1.3 mm (ref. 16), but the new 3-mm data reveal a ring at 10.5 au and two gaps at 7.5 and 15 au that are undetected at shorter wavelengths. The 3-mm image also has flatter central emission, with hints of two peaks suggesting the presence of a barely resolved cavity (this is seen more clearly in Supplementary Fig. 1). To better characterize the structure of the system, we calculated and compared the intensity radial profiles of the disk at both wavelengths. We do this in visibility space with the code FRANK38, which achieves higher angular resolution and recovers smaller structures than working with synthesized images. The profiles are shown in Fig. 3 and more clearly reveal the aforementioned structures in the 3-mm image: an inner cavity with a radius of ~3 au, as well as a ring and two gaps. The FRANK residuals are provided in Supplementary Fig. 2. Although not as clear, radial profiles calculated directly from synthesized images also show these substructures (Methods and Supplementary Fig. 3).

The solid and dashed white arcs in the 3-mm image mark the ring and two gaps. The beam of each observation is indicated as a white ellipse in the bottom left corners.

The 3-mm profile shows structures undetected at shorter wavelengths, including an inner cavity, a ring and two gaps. These features are indicated in the figure.

The 3-mm data prove that MP Mus is indeed structured, which could explain both the disk longevity and the similar ratio of gas/dust radii to other structured disks. A naive interpretation of the disk architecture, in which the inner cavity and two gaps are each being carved by a different planet, would imply that MP Mus hosts a multiplanetary system. Nevertheless, we caution that mechanisms other than planets can open cavities and gaps39,40,41 and that such interpretation may be too simplistic. Moreover, simulations have shown that a single planet may carve multiple gaps in low-viscosity disks42,43, although this is no longer the case for models including radiative effects44.

We can, however, attempt to link the new-found structures to the Gaia PMa to search for possible explanations for both phenomena. First, previous observing campaigns to detect planets and substellar objects in MP Mus have ruled out sources more massive than 2–3 MJup at separations >40–50 au (for example, refs. 20,45). If instead we assume that a putative companion in either of the gaps (that is, at 7.5 au or at 15 au) is responsible for the PMa, it would require masses above 10 MJup to account for the observed signal (Fig. 1). Such a massive object would open much wider gaps and strongly alter the disk structure, in stark contrast to its narrow gaps and overall smooth appearance (by comparison, the vast majority of planetary masses determined from gap properties are well below 3 MJup)8,46. For these reasons, even if planets may be carving those gaps, they are unlikely to be the cause of the PMa. Meanwhile, the inner ~3-au cavity appears as an optimal location for possible companions. We can further restrict the location of the companion if we assume that it is responsible for carving the cavity: even in the most favourable scenario (that is, an equal mass binary), a non-eccentric binary system can open a cavity only as large as two to three times the orbital separation47,48. Put together, the Gaia and ALMA data strongly suggest that MP Mus harbours a giant protoplanet in the inner 1–3 au of the system.

To explore if a protoplanet within the mass range and orbital separations suggested by the Gaia PMa could explain the inner cavity seen at 3 mm, we ran hydrodynamical simulations of a star + planet system using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code PHANTOM49. We ran a grid of 25 models with different orbital radii and masses that would fit inside the 3-au cavity, namely at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 au (corresponding to orbital periods of 0.3, 0.9, 1.6, 2.5 and 3.5 years, respectively), and with companion masses of 3, 5, 7, 10 and 15 MJup. Details on the modelling set-up are provided in the Methods. We then performed radiative transfer with the MCFOST code50,51 to produce continuum images at 1.3 and 3 mm and convolved the results with the corresponding ALMA beams. Figure 4 shows the radial profiles of the simulations at 1.3 and 3 mm for three representative cases as calculated directly from the images with the code GoFish52. The results for the full grid are provided in Supplementary Information section 1.2 and Supplementary Fig. 4.

The simulation (sim) profiles are shown as solid lines at 1.3 mm (orange) and 3 mm (blue), after convolution with the beams of the ALMA observations. The observed (obs) profiles are also shown as dashed lines. The panels show a 5 MJup planet at 0.5 au (left), 1 au (middle) and 2 au (right). In the first case, the cavity opened by the planet is too small to be resolved in the observations. Planets with separations ≥2 au produce cavities that are too large to be compatible with the data.

The SPH simulations provide additional information about the properties of the companion. First, none of the models with an orbital separation of 0.5 au carve an inner cavity large enough to be discernible with the current spatial resolution, regardless of their mass. On the other extreme, planets at ≥2 au produce cavities that are too large to be compatible with the observations. The mass of the companion does not have a strong effect on the cavity size, but more massive objects result in deeper cavities. We also note that some simulations create a cavity of the right size at 3 mm while no cavity is visible at 1.3 mm, just as observed with ALMA (although this is more sensitive to the adopted disk and dust properties). Overall, the simulations show that the observed cavity can be successfully explained by a gas giant orbiting at 1–2 au, lending further indirect but independent support to the presence of such a planet in MP Mus.

The combination of two independent but consistent pieces of evidence (the Gaia PMa and the finding of a small inner cavity) create a very compelling case for the existence of MP Mus b, a gas giant planet orbiting between approximately 1 au and 3 au. The case is strengthened even further when we consider the SPH simulations of the system, which show that planets between 1 au and 2 au carve a cavity with the correct size and in some cases even reproduce the peculiar feature of the inner cavity being visible at 3 mm but not at 1.3 mm. The presence of a companion in the inner regions of MP Mus would also account for its low accretion rate compared with other disks with similar masses32 (~10−10 M⊙ yr−1). It is unlikely that such a planet would form at its current location: planet formation is thought to be more efficient at radii near and outside the snowline (the location at which water ice sublimates) owing to the change in dust properties and enhanced dust-to-gas ratios (for example, ref. 53), and the gas giants found with 1–2 au orbits are believed to have undergone planetary migration (for example, ref. 54). Interestingly, at 1–2 au, it is possible that MP Mus b resides in the habitable zone of its 1.3 M⊙ star. Detecting such a planet with radial velocity would be a formidable challenge, as the expected signal of a ~5 MJup between 1 au and 3 au (that is, a radial velocity semi-amplitude of 40–70 m s−1) is below the typical level of stellar activity in young stars (~100 m s−1, for example, ref. 55), and even detections of very massive protoplanets much closer to their host stars are very difficult to disentangle from other sources of radial velocity signal (see the case of CI Tau5,56,57,58,59). This highlights the unique potential of the PMa technique to uncover the population of young planets in close (a few astronomical units) orbits embedded in protoplanetary disks, a region of the parameter space that remains beyond the reach of other current detection methods. This becomes especially promising when combined with additional information about the possible presence of the protoplanet such as in the case of MP Mus, where the disk structure traced by ALMA allows one to pinpoint the location of the companion; the narrow width of the two gaps rules them out as possible sites for the body inducing the PMa, leaving the inner cavity as the only suitable location.

In addition to the inner cavity revealed by the new 3-mm data, the different morphology of the disk at 1.3 and 3 mm can be attributed solely to the difference in wavelength (given that both observations have the same spatial resolution). As mentioned in the ‘Hidden substructures at 3 mm' section, this arises from a combination of the enhanced contrast of substructures (due to more efficient trapping of larger grains) and the lower optical depth with increasing wavelength. Previous studies have already shown that disk substructures often appear sharper and with a higher contrast at longer wavelengths (for example, refs. 60,61,62). MP Mus represents an extreme example of this as it is the first source in which new substructures are uncovered at longer wavelengths, but it is unlikely to be the only system in which this occurs. The new 3-mm observations also confirm that 1-mm emission from the inner regions of protoplanetary disk can remain optically thick and, more importantly, indicate that our current census of disk substructures (see ref. 8 and references therein) is potentially very incomplete. Protoplanetary disks may be more structured than currently believed, on the one hand providing even more dust trapping of large grains and on the other hand clearly necessitating high-resolution, high-sensitivity surveys at longer wavelengths to understand the frequency and properties of a potential population of hidden substructures.

The MP Mus ALMA Band 3 (3 mm) data correspond to the ALMA project 2022.1.01758.S (principal investigator (PI): Á. Ribas) and were taken with two different configurations. The compact configuration was observed once on 21 May 2022 and contains baselines from 27 m to 3.6 km. The extended configuration was observed three times on 27–28 July 2022 with baselines ranging from 230 m to 16.2 km. The correlator was set up to maximize the continuum sensitivity, containing four spectral windows centred at 90.521, 92.416, 102.521 and 104.479 GHz, each with a bandwidth of 1.875 GHz and 128 channels. All the observations were first calibrated using the pipeline script and CASA v.6.4.1.12, and further processing was performed with CASA v.6.5.6.22. In particular, we first performed phase-only self-calibration on the extended and compact configurations separately. We then placed the phase centre on the disk for each observation, set the coordinates of each phase centre to a common value and rescaled the flux of the three extended executions to match the flux of the compact one. Finally, one additional round of phase-only self-calibration was applied after combining the four execution blocks.

The Band 6 data (1.3 mm) are part of ALMA project 2017.1.01167.S (PI: S. Pérez) and were already presented in ref. 16. That work16 combined these observations with those of ALMA project 2017.1.01419.S (PI: C. Cáceres), which had lower spatial resolution but were useful to study gas emission in the system. We chose not to include those data in this work because here we focus on the continuum only. The data consist of a compact configuration observed on 15 January 2018 with baselines between 15 m and 2.4 km and an extended one taken on 16 November 2017 with baselines between 90 m and 8.2 km. The observations were calibrated with the pipeline and CASA v.5.1.1-5, and we then used CASA v.6.5.6.22 for the rest of the analysis. The correlator set-up in this case contained four spectral windows, three for continuum centred at 232.483, 244.983 and 246.983 GHz (bandwidth of 1.875 GHz and 128 channels each) and the fourth one centred at 230.525 GHz targeting the 12CO (2–1) line (bandwidth of 1.875 GHz and 960 channels). We flagged channels containing CO emission and then performed self-calibration with a similar process as for the Band 3 data: we first self-calibrated the compact and extended configurations individually, placed the phase centre at the centre of the disk in each case and changed its coordinates to a common value, and then rescaled the compact configuration to have the same flux as the extended one (in this case, the observatory calibrator appeared more stable around the time of the extended observations, although this has no impact on any of our results). We then ran one final round of phase-only self-calibration in which both the compact and extended configurations were combined.

We imaged the data using the tclean routine in CASA using different weighting to achieve the best compromise between spatial resolution and sensitivity. For the purpose of analysing the disk structures (Fig. 2), we used the mtmfs option with nterms = 1 and scales of 0, 1, 3 and 5 beams. We adopted a robust parameter of 0 for both wavelengths, resulting in a beam of 0.06″ × 0.04″ in both cases, and a position angle (PA) of −13° at 1.3 mm and −27° at 3 mm. The corresponding image root mean square (RMS) values are 37 μJy per beam and 7.7 μJy per beam at 1.3 mm and 3 mm, respectively. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of these images is 105 at 1.3 mm and 90 at 3 mm. The disk flux, radius and mass measured at 3 mm are provided in Supplementary Information section 1.

The radial profiles in Fig. 3 were created using the FRANK code38. Under the assumption that the the disk is axisymmetric, this software calculates the radial profile of the disk directly from the observed visibilities using a Hankel transform. For both the 1.3- and 3-mm data, we first fit the geometry of the system with the non-parametric option and using the measured disk inclination (i)  and position angles as initial guesses16 (i = 32°, PA 10°). The values of i and PA determined by FRANK are compatible with the 1° uncertainty of these quantities. We then explored the effect of changing the α and wsmooth hyperparameters: the results were largely insensitive to the choice of these in the case of the 1.3-mm data, yielding a profile similar to the one presented in ref. 16 (unless extreme values of α and wsmooth were used, which induced artificial wiggles), and we adopted α = 1.2 and wsmooth = 5 × 10−3. In the case of 3 mm, we found that going below α = 1.3 or wsmooth = 10−2 produced clearly artificial ripples in the profile, and we thus used these values. We then imaged the residuals (subtracting the FRANK visibilities from the observed ones), which appear largely signal-free (Supplementary Fig. 2): the residuals are below three times the image noise (RMS) in the case of the 3-mm observations, and the 1.3 mm show only two localized blobs around the 5 RMS level.

We performed two sanity checks to ensure that the observed structures are not an artefact from FRANK. First, we also calculated the radial profiles directly from the synthesised images using the GoFish code52. These profiles have less spatial resolution (image synthesis incurs some information loss during the binning and weighting of visibilities) but serve to confirm that substructures are present in the 3-mm image and are not an artefact of FRANK. For this purpose, we produced images with robust = −0.5 to improve the angular resolution. The ring and two gaps are also visible in the image profile. The cavity is only tentatively detected in the profile as a flattening of the intensity in the inner regions.

In addition, we also used the non-parametric GPUVMEM image reconstruction code63 to create a maximum-entropy version of the image. The maximum-entropy method implemented in GPUVMEM belongs to the family of regularized maximum likelihood methods, which have gained notable traction in recent years (for example, refs. 64,65,66). The self-calibrated continuum data were super-resolved using GPUVMEM with no entropy term in the objective function63; image positivity alone provided sufficient regularization67. This approach yielded an image with slightly higher angular resolution and sensitivity compared with an equivalent tclean image. The GPUVMEM image reproduces the same substructures identified in the tclean image while also revealing a small central cavity.

These tests confirm that the inner cavity, ring and gaps recovered by FRANK are real features. The 3-mm robust = −0.5 and the GPUVMEM images, as well as the corresponding radial profiles, are provided in Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3.

We ran three-dimensional global hydrodynamical simulations using the SPH code PHANTOM49, widely used to study gas and dust dynamics in planet-forming environments68,69,70. To model the inner cavity of MP Mus, we ran a grid of 25 simulations varying the semi-major axis and the mass of the companion within ranges compatible with the Gaia PMa. In all the simulations, the mass of the star is M⋆ = 1.3 M⊙ and the disk mass is Mdisk = 0.01 M⊙ (informed by the dust mass calculated from the 3-mm emission and adopting a standard gas-to-dust ratio of 100; Supplementary Information section 1.1). The disk is locally isothermal with a mid-plane temperature profile T ∝ R−0.5, and the initial surface density profile follows Σ ∝ R−1. We adopted a typical disk aspect ratio H/R to 0.1 (where H is the gas scale height) at a reference radius of 100 au (refs. 71,72). The resolution is set by the number of particles (N = 106). The outer radius is initialized to 50 au as traced by the 1.3-mm continuum observations, and the inner radius is chosen according to the semi-major axis of the inner companion ap, namely Rin = 1.5ap. The central star and the companion were modelled as sink particles, with accretion radii Racc,⋆ = 0.75ap for the central star and Racc,p = 0.25Rh for the secondary, where Rh is the companion Hill radius. The choice of the primary sink radius is safe because it is always smaller than the semi-major axis of the companion, and the radius of cavity we observe is always three to four times bigger, meaning that it is carved by the tidal interaction rather than being a numerical artefact. We used SPH shock capturing viscosity to model the mechanisms transporting the angular momentum through the disk, prescribing shock capturing viscosity coefficients αAV = 0.2 and βAV = 2 that resulted in a viscosity parameter of αss = 5 × 10−3.

The dust component is set by adopting an initial gas-to-dust ratio of 100 uniformly across the entire disk. We simulated five dust grains sizes ranging from 1 μm to 0.5 cm and with intrinsic density 3 g cm−3. The dust is treated with the mixture algorithm, also known as one fluid algorithm (Laibe Price), suitable for coupled dust grains. The mass of the five different grain size populations is calculated according to n(s) ∝ s−3.5, where s is the grain size.

The mass and semi-major axis of the companion are Mp ∈ (3, 5, 7, 10, 15) Mjup and ap ∈ (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5) au, as discussed in the ‘The Gaia proper motion anomaly of MP Mus' section. We let the simulations evolve for 1,000 planet orbits, enough time to ensure that the inner cavity reaches a steady state48.

The thermal structure and the 1.3-mm and 3-mm continuum emission images were computed using the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST50,51. The code takes as input the distribution of gas and dust grains from the hydrodynamical simulation to create a Voronoi mesh where each cell corresponds to an SPH particle. The disk receives passive heating from the central star, modelled as a black body with temperature of 5,000 K, radius R⋆ = 1.25 R⊙ and mass M⋆ = 1.3 M⊙. We adopted a DIANA standard dust composition73,74, that is, 60% silicates, 15% amorphous carbon (optical constants from refs. 75,76, respectively) and 25% porosity. The code assumes that submicrometre grains follow the gas, while the spatial distribution of dust grains between micrometres and centimetres is obtained by interpolation. We discretize the radiation field using Nγ = 108 photons to compute the temperature structure of the disk assuming local thermal equilibrium. Images are then computed via ray tracing again with Nγ = 108 photons.

Global surface warming has accelerated since around 2010, relative to the preceding half century1,2,3. This has coincided with East Asian efforts to reduce air pollution through restricted atmospheric aerosol and precursor emissions4,5. A direct link between the two has, however, not yet been established. Here we show, using a large set of simulations from eight Earth System Models, how a time-evolving 75% reduction in East Asian sulfate emissions partially unmasks greenhouse gas-driven warming and influences the spatial pattern of surface temperature change. We find a rapidly evolving global, annual mean warming of 0.07 ± 0.05 °C, sufficient to be a main driver of the uptick in global warming rate since 2010. We also find North-Pacific warming and a top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance that are qualitatively consistent with recent observations. East Asian aerosol cleanup is thus likely a key contributor to recent global warming acceleration and to Pacific warming trends.

Over the industrial era, anthropogenic emissions of atmospheric aerosols, and their gaseous precursors, have strongly influenced the Earth's climate and energy balance6. Aerosols have recently been assessed to have cooled the global surface by 0.4 °C (the year 2019, relative to pre-industrial conditions), partially masking greenhouse gas-driven warming, predominantly through aerosol–cloud interactions affecting the albedo and coverage of clouds, alongside direct aerosol shortwave effects7. The geographical distribution of this forcing has, however, shifted after 1980, with China and India having replaced the US and Europe as the major emitters8. It has shifted again since the early 2010s, following China's strong effort to reduce air pollution, which has led to strong (~20 Tg/year, or around 75%) sustained reductions in the emission rate of SO24,9, the precursor gas of sulfate aerosols, which in turn is the dominating aerosol species currently cooling the Earth7.

Concurrently, the rate of global mean surface warming, which has overall been constant at around 0.18 °C/decade since around 1970, has increased1,2. Recent studies find an acceleration in the rate of surface warming and ocean heat uptake after 1990, and the most recent decade (2013–2022) had a warming rate of 0.25 °C/decade, even after reducing the influence of internal variability1,3. 2023 and 2024 were both record-setting in terms of surface temperature anomaly, dominated by strong positive sea-surface temperature anomalies in most ocean basins10.

Recent improvements in satellite-based constraints on the Earth's Radiative Imbalance at top-of-atmosphere (TOA) have also revealed increased energy absorption into the global Earth system11. A range of studies have suggested that aerosol emissions changes may have been contributing factors. These include recent overall trends in global aerosol loading12, and the regulations by the International Maritime Organization that caused a strong drop in SO2 emissions from the global shipping fleet from 2020 and onwards13,14. Low planetary albedo due to reduced cloud amounts, or cloud albedo, in the North Pacific was also recently implicated as a related process leading to increased surface warming, albeit for a single year (2023)15.

However, few studies have to date quantified the influence of the recent emissions reductions in East Asia on global and regional climate evolution, despite their being larger in magnitude than the shipping emission changes, and sustained for longer (~9 Tg/year since 202013). Such analysis requires dedicated simulations with Earth System Models that have not been readily available, partly due to a lack of updated emissions inventories that capture the decrease in, primarily, emissions from mainland China. Zheng et al.5 estimated a mean Northern Hemisphere warming of 0.12 ± 0.01 °C, but using a single CMIP5 era model (CESM 1.2.2) and idealized equilibrium simulations. The regional nature of the emissions change also means that internal variability is a major limiting factor in quantifying a climate response, necessitating multiple ensemble realizations of these simulations. Recent global modeling exercises such as CMIP6 used global emissions changes16, where the influence of East Asian SO2 emissions cannot be separated from other, concurrent changes. Further, the emissions dataset used in CMIP6 did not accurately represent the recent reduction in East Asian aerosol precursors17, with marked consequences for regional climate evolution as reported by Wang et al.18. Yet other studies have investigated teleconnections from East Asian emissions onto sea-surface warming patterns in the North Pacific, but did not connect these to global surface temperature evolution19,20.

Here, we present results from the Regional Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (RAMIP), where aerosol emissions were systematically perturbed in individual source regions, in eight CMIP6 era Earth System Models21. We show results from a transient emissions reduction experiment in an East Asia region, consisting primarily, but not solely, of mainland China, that are closely analogous to recent emissions changes. RAMIP simulations span 2015–2049, and for the latter 15-year period (2035–2049) they have an East Asian SO2 emission reduction of 20 Tg/year, i.e., comparable to that which occurred in the real world since around 2010. Thus, we can use the RAMIP simulations for this period to quantify the real-world climate impacts of recent efforts by China to improve air quality, including surface temperatures, precipitation, and the global energy imbalance. By comparing observations of regional temperature changes and the TOA radiation imbalance, we argue that the recent aerosol emissions changes in East Asia are a key contributing factor, among others, to the recent uptick in the rate of global mean surface warming, through an unmasking of greenhouse gas-driven climate change.

We first document the emissions perturbation applied in the RAMIP baseline and East Asia simulations21 (see “Methods”), and compare them to the actual emissions reductions from the same region since around 2010. Briefly, RAMIP isolates the climate effects of aerosol emissions in one region by comparing two sets of transient emission simulations; one following a global, high emissions pathway (SSP3-7.0, which assumes weak air quality policies), and one where aerosol emissions in one region (East Asia, consisting mainly of mainland China emissions) have been replaced by those from a strong air quality policy trajectory (SSP1-2.6). See “Methods,” or21, for a full description. In the present analysis, we use simulations from 8 global models, each with 10 ensemble members, for a total of 80 ensemble members. This simulation set effectively samples both model uncertainty and internal climate variability.

Figure 1a shows changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by MODIS Terra and Aqua between the two previous decades. Consistent with previous literature, we find a dipole pattern consisting of an increase over India and a strong decrease over China following their air quality improvement initiatives. For comparison, Fig. 1b shows the pattern of AOD change between the RAMIP East Asia and baseline simulations, for the simulated period 2035–2049. Here, and elsewhere, this time period is chosen for RAMIP to sample the climate response after most of the emission reductions have occurred, while maximizing the number of years (RAMIP simulations end in 2050, so 2049 is the last year we can use while also letting the last DJF season run into the following year.) Fig. 1c, d shows the corresponding SO2 emissions and AOD change, for observations and simulations, within the box labeled East Asia in Fig. 1a (a geographical box that covers the main emission regions).

The Inset box shows the East Asia domain used throughout this paper. b Spatial distribution of AOD change in RAMIP. Multi-model (80 ensemble member) mean, difference between the East Asia and Baseline simulations. Hatching indicates statistical significance (see “Methods”). c Annual SO2 emissions difference, relative to 2010, in CEDSv2024 (red), and between the two scenarios used by RAMIP (black). Mean over the East Asia domain. d AOD change, mean over the East Asia domain, from MODIS (red) and in RAMIP (black). The range is ±1 standard deviation of the RAMIP multi-model response.

For observations, relative to the 2005–2010 period, we find an AOD change of −0.13 units for the period 2014–2023, resulting primarily from emissions reductions of around 20 Tg SO2/year (Supplementary Fig. 1b). The emissions data are from the December 2024 release of the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS)22, which includes updated estimates of recent East Asian SO2 emission changes. Concurrent changes in black carbon aerosol emissions are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1; they are smaller, in absolute terms and in particle number, and are not expected to contribute strongly to the AOD change, though they may influence climate features through their strong atmospheric shortwave absorption23.

RAMIP transient simulations start in 2015 but use CMIP6 emissions based on a CEDS version that projected a delayed reduction in East Asia emissions compared to the actual, realized changes. The RAMIP East Asia and baseline simulations, however, still have an emissions difference trajectory that broadly corresponds to recent observations (20 Tg SO2/year), for the last 15 years of the RAMIP simulations (2035–2049). In the following, we use this period to quantify RAMIP climate responses (see “Methods”). We also find a multi-model mean AOD change trajectory and magnitude that broadly tracks MODIS observations (∆AOD of −0.11 ± 0.05 units for the RAMIP period 2035–2049). We do note, however, that even though all models used the same emissions, the RAMIP 2035–2049 mean East Asia AOD change ranges from −0.08 to −0.28, and the local magnitudes do differ from MODIS observations (see Fig. S1). This is due to a combination of factors including the optical properties of the simulated aerosols, the cloud fields, wind and precipitation climatologies, and aerosol removal rates. See further discussion on model diversity below.

Physically, AOD decreases are associated with less scattering of incoming solar radiation and hence increases in downwelling surface solar radiation. Supplementary Fig. 1 shows the corresponding changes in downwelling shortwave radiation at the surface, in response to aerosol emissions reductions. Here, we find a multi-model mean change of 7.7 ± 2.5 Wm−2, over the East Asia domain, with inter-model variation and spatial pattern that broadly follow that of AOD.

Based on Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1, we conclude that the RAMIP East Asia results for the 2035–2049 period can be used as a proxy for the response to the emission rate change that has occurred in the real world over the 2010–2023 period (i.e., a 20 Tg/year sustained reduction in SO2 emissions). We note that neither the overall conclusions nor the absolute numbers cited below are sensitive to changing the endpoints of these time periods by up to 2 years.

In the RAMIP simulations, we find robust changes in both temperature and precipitation in response to East Asian aerosol emission reductions, with a mean change that extends beyond the interannual variability in the multi-model, multi-ensemble-member mean. In Fig. 2, we show the global, annual mean temperature responses to a 20 Tg/year reduction in SO2 emissions from East Asia. For 2035–2049, we find a multi-model mean global warming of 0.07 ± 0.05 °C, where the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the eight individual model results. The signal evolves in overall correspondence with the emission reductions, indicating a rapid climate response to SO2 emissions reductions, in line with previous studies24. The overall rate of change for the full 2015–2049 period is 0.02 °C/decade. Note also the strong inter-model variability (Fig. 2b), with one model (NorESM2-LM) showing an ensemble mean warming of 0.15 °C, while another outlier (GISS-E2-1-G) even shows a slight cooling (−0.02 °C). We link these model differences, in particular the outlier models, primarily to aerosol–cloud interactions in the North Pacific, and to Arctic amplification that is known to be strong both for Asian aerosol emissions, and for our warmest model (NorESM2-LM)25. See also Supplementary Fig. 2, and further discussion on the radiative responses of the models below.

Vertical lines show ±1 standard deviation. Y axis is as for (a). c Multi-model spatial response, for June-July-August. d As (c), for December–January–February.

There is also a strong contribution from internal variability, with marked diversity between ensemble members (Fig. 2b). This is partly due to our compromise usage of a 15-year time period to quantify a climate response, where internal variability will contribute strongly, and partly due to the overall forcing strength, again relative to internal variability. This illustrates the difficulties of quantifying the climate impacts of the recent East Asian aerosol emission reductions, and other notable emissions changes like those resulting from the recent IMO shipping regulations26 and the importance of conducting large ensemble simulations when investigating climate forcings that are strong regionally but weaker on a global scale21.

Geographically, the seasonal temperature change is strongest (~1 °C) near the source (East Asia, notably Eastern and Northern China) both in boreal summer (JJA, Fig. 2c) and winter (DJF, Fig. 2d). However, we also find significant warming (>0.2 °C; paired Student's t-test, p < 0.05) over much of the North Pacific, in both seasons. For DJF, we also find a significant warming of North America, and throughout the Arctic. This is in line with previous studies that have found a strong long-range contribution to arctic amplification from Asian aerosol emissions27,28. A wintertime cooling patch in Central Europe that has been reported by previous studies29,30 is however not visible in our dataset. For annual and seasonal mean responses, including for individual models and ensemble members, see Supplementary Figs. 2–4.

Supplementary Fig. 5 shows the corresponding precipitation response, which broadly tracks that of surface temperature. We find an overall global wettening of 0.009 ± 0.004 mm/day (0.3 ± 0.1%), yielding an overall hydrological sensitivity of 4 ± 2%/°C, which is broadly consistent with previous estimates of the climate impacts of aerosol emissions changes31. Geographically, we find a strong summertime (JJA) precipitation increase in East China, and along the East Asian coastline, as well as a wettening along the North Pacific storm tracks extending well into North America. We also find a northward shift of the ITCZ, consistent with expectations from preferential warming of the Northern Hemisphere relative to the Southern Hemisphere32 The regions with statistical significance are smaller than for temperature, as expected due to the higher internal variability and greater model diversity in precipitation simulations.

We now put the RAMIP results in the context of recent trends in global warming, in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, we show the global mean surface temperature anomaly (GSTA) relative to 1850–1900 since 1980, as the average of four observational reconstructions (HadCRUT5, NOAA, GISTEMP and Berkeley Earth; see “Methods”). For the 30-year period of 1980–2009, used for consistency with previous literature on the multi-decadal rate of surface warming3, the average observed warming rate is 0.18 ± 0.02 °C/decade. For illustration, we also show the time series from ref. 10, where internal variability from Pacific ENSO and other ocean modes of variability has been filtered out (our conclusions do not rely on the usage of this dataset). For the subsequent period of 2010–2023, we find an elevated observed warming rate of 0.33 ± 0.17 °C/decade, and 0.25 ± 0.06 °C/decade when interannual variability is filtered, consistent with previous studies2,3. Note that uncertainties in this section are 95% confidence intervals on the linear regressions.

Mean of the four data series. d RAMIP spatial annual mean surface temperature response to East Asian aerosol emission reductions. e AOD change from MODIS, as Fig. 1a.

In the main panel (Fig. 3b), we zoom in on the latter period. Most post-2010 GSTA values fall above the continuation of the 1980–2009 trend (dotted black line), in the reconstructions (dots) and in the reduced variability time series (solid black line), indicating a recent increase in the global warming rate. To estimate the contribution of East Asian aerosol emissions changes to this increase, we take the RAMIP quantified global warming of 0.07 ± 0.05 °C, and convert it to a warming rate over the 2010–2023 period (0.05 ± 0.04 °C/decade). See the box-and-whisker on the right of Fig. 3b, which shows how we've added this aerosol cleanup-induced warming rate (red line and range) to the continuation of the 1980–2009 trend.

Assuming, for now, no change in the underlying greenhouse gas-induced global warming rate, this suggests a combined post-2010 warming rate, from greenhouse gas increases and East Asian aerosol cleanup, of 0.18 °C/decade + 0.05 °C/decade = 0.23 °C/decade, approaching the 0.25 °C/decade found after filtering the effects of internal variability. Note that prior to 2010, increases in East and South Asian aerosol emissions were broadly compensated for by reductions in Europe and the US, leading to an overall geographical shift in aerosol loadings33. For further context, see the discussion below of other sources of recent warming.

Note also that we assume here that the full warming due to the observed recent East Asian emissions reduction has already been realized, so that it is justifiable to compare warming in observations during the 2010–2023 period to warming in the RAMIP simulations during the 2035–2049 period. This is supported by recent modeling exercises using sustained step changes in SO2 emissions24, finding that the majority of subsequent global mean surface temperature change has been realized within the first 24 months, while the rest develops slowly at a multi-decadal timescale. The transient RAMIP simulations also do not show any appreciable delay in the climate response to SO2 reductions. However, our estimate should still be taken as an upper limit, to take this limitation into account.

Since aerosol changes have regionally heterogeneous climate influences, as shown above, we next investigate the correspondence of simulated changes to observed regional warming rate. In Fig. 3c, we show the observed difference between the 2010–2023 and 1980–2009 warming rates in the four reconstructions. See Supplementary Fig. 6 for individual time series and the two trend periods in isolation. In Fig. 3d, we show the annual mean surface warming pattern from East Asian aerosol emission reductions in RAMIP. In both cases, we find a pattern of observed warming in the North Pacific, with two distinct maxima: one along the East Asian coastline, and the other following the west coast of North America, extending west to the center of the Pacific. This shows that the simulated increased global mean warming rate comes from a geographical region where observations also find an elevated warming rate since 2010, relative to previous decades. See Supplementary Fig. 10 for the transient evolution of regional means (Western and Eastern North Pacific) for individual models. An important caveat, however, is that for the observations, a 13-year trend will be strongly influenced by decadal scale variability, notably the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), which has changed markedly over the time period studied here34.

While the influence of oceanic modes of variability is beyond the scope of the present study, we can relate our results to recent discussions of aerosol influences on the change in TOA energy imbalance. In Fig. 4, we investigate the TOA all-sky change in radiative imbalance (shortwave plus longwave) in response to East Asian aerosol emissions reductions in RAMIP, and compare them to observations (CERES) and reanalysis (ERA5). Figure 4a, b shows the time series and 2035–2049 means of the TOA all-sky radiative imbalance, which has a mean of 0.06 ± 0.04 Wm−2. While there is substantial inter-model and ensemble member variability, the overall evolution is very similar between the eight RAMIP models. Using the same logic as above, this corresponds to an evolving increase in the TOA imbalance since 2010 of 0.05 ± 0.03 Wm−2/decade.

Multi-model mean (MMM) and ±1 standard deviation range. b Ensemble member, model mean, and multi-model mean TOA imbalance response for 2035–2049.

Figure 4c, d shows the geographical distributions of clear sky and all-sky radiative imbalances. Again, for all-sky conditions, we find a geographical pattern displaying two clear maxima, near the source region, and in the western North Pacific, with peak values exceeding 2 Wm−2. There is little influence on other regions. For clear sky conditions, only the East Asian and eastern North Pacific influence remains, indicating it has a major contribution from the direct interaction of aerosols with incoming sunlight. The maximum west of North America, however, is likely primarily a result of aerosol–cloud interactions, seen in a region with a high prevalence of low clouds (stratocumulus decks). Supplementary Fig. 7 shows individual models, while Supplementary Fig. 10 shows a further breakdown into shortwave and longwave components.

This result also explains part of the inter-model diversity in RAMIP responses. See Supplementary Fig. 9, which shows the annual mean cloud climatologies of the models. The models that have low overall temperature response to East Asian aerosol changes, notably CNRM-ESM2-1 and GISS-E2-1-G, have relatively low cloud fractions in this region, and also very weak radiative responses. The opposite is true for strongly responding models, including CESM2, NorESM2, EC-Earth3-AerChem, and UKESM1-0-LL. The correspondence is not exact, but still indicative that aerosol–cloud interactions in the eastern North Pacific stratocumulus region are a key lever for climate responses to East Asian aerosol emissions. Supplementary Fig. 10 also shows the transient evolution of Western and Eastern North Pacific means of temperature and surface shortwave fluxes. We further note that for clear sky conditions, there is a strong positive anomaly over Eastern China in most models. This indicates the presence of compensating aerosol–cloud effects, and perhaps other aerosol processes such as wet removal by precipitation, over this region in the RAMIP models.

Finally, in Fig. 4e, f, we show recent all-sky TOA imbalance trends from observations (CERES), and its difference from a reanalysis product (ERA5). While the CERES observations (Fig. 4e) have a strong influence on internal variability and will also be influenced by other recent changes in the climate system, we do find a positive anomaly in the North Pacific. The ERA5 reanalysis itself shows a very similar pattern (Supplementary Fig. 5).

ERA5 does include treatment of aerosols, but it uses a CMIP5 era combination of historical emissions up to 2009 and subsequently the RCP emissions35. These pathways do not include the recent reductions in East Asian emissions. Hence, the difference between CERES and ERA5 may be indicative of regions where the recent aerosol changes are important for the reconstruction, and have an influence on observed rates of change of TOA radiative fluxes. To see whether we can see any indication of this, we show the difference between CERES and ERA5 in Fig. 4f. Among the many features that stand out here, we find a positive anomaly in the low cloud region of the eastern North Pacific, as well as a negative anomaly over Eastern China. We note that these are regions where downwind effects of East Asian aerosol emissions would be expected to contribute and that this is indeed where RAMIP simulations indicate an influence from aerosol–cloud interactions. Recall, however, the previous caveat that PDO also changes in the time periods studied here and that trends in sea-surface temperatures will also influence ERA5 reconstructions. This means that we cannot make a clear attribution of the observed changes to aerosol emissions changes with this method, but rather point this out as an area for further, more in-depth studies.

We have shown how recent aerosol emissions reductions in East Asia likely had a strong influence on post-2010 elevated rates of surface warming, both globally and in the North Pacific. To put these results in context, we here discuss some other, concurrent changes that we cannot consider in the same framework.

One anthropogenic factor is the accelerated increase in atmospheric CH4 concentrations over the same period. As an estimate, using recent global near-surface concentrations from NOAA36 and the IPCC AR637, combined with the forcing estimation methods from ref. 38, we find a global mean CH4 radiative forcing (RF) of 0.06 Wm−2 for the 2010–2023 period, corresponding to a rate of 0.047 Wm−2/decade. This is a marked increase over the previous decade (2000–2010), where we find 0.01 Wm−2/decade. However, for the full 30-year period of 1980–2010, we estimate a forcing of 0.043 Wm−2/decade. This means that while changes in CH4 atmospheric concentration growth rates may have contributed to decadal variability, and clearly can enhance the overall rate of global warming, the recent decade has not seen a markedly strong influence from CH4 increases compared to recent history. We also note that the above numbers are for RF, while the Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF), and the temperature influences of methane, may be muted due to rapid adjustments39.

Another, more recent, anthropogenic factor is the post-2020 reduction in SO2 emissions from the shipping sector, following the recent regulations of the International Maritime Organization. Here, a range of studies have concluded that the global mean ERF from the 80% reduction in emissions, corresponding to around 9 Tg SO2/year, is in the range of 0.05–0.10 Wm−226,40,41. While studies using ensembles of simulations from fully coupled models do find a surface temperature response to these emissions change over time, the magnitude and detectability relative to internal variability for the years 2020–2023 is still disputed26,40. Coming in at the end of the time period studied here, the IMO regulations are unlikely to have had a major influence on the above conclusions regarding the influence of Chinese aerosol emission changes.

ERF estimates are unfortunately not available from all RAMIP models. For those that have delivered the required simulations (see “Methods”), we find an ERF from the emissions changes in East Asia discussed above ranging from 0.06 to 0.21 Wm−2 21.

Recently, in the context of the 2023 record global mean surface temperatures, Goessling et al.15 identified a record-low planetary albedo as a contributing cause. Using the same datasets as here (CERES and ERA5), they highlight low cloud cover over the North Pacific as a key component of this and note that the role of aerosols in this change is still unclear. Their results are well in line with the present study, both geographically and in terms of physical processes; however, their main focus is on reduced cloud fraction in selected years, while our results concern a reduced climate cooling through weaker aerosol impacts on clouds on a decadal scale. The regional similarity, however, opens the possibility that the results of Goessling et al. are, at least in part, interpretable as a sustained reduction in climate cooling through aerosol–cloud interactions.

Using a set of 10-ensemble-member simulations from eight CMIP6 era Earth System Models, we have quantified the transient climate response to gradually reduce aerosol emissions from East Asia. We find a global, annual mean warming of 0.07 ± 0.05 °C, and a corresponding wettening of around 4 ± 2%/°C.

The emission reductions in our simulations correspond closely to the emissions reductions realized in East Asia over the period 2010–2023, in magnitude and geographical location. This allows us to put our results in the context of the recent uptick in the observed rate of global mean surface warming. Here, we find that emissions reductions in East Asia have contributed up to 0.05 °C/decade since 2010, explaining a large fraction of the observed increase of 0.06 °C/decade over the same period, after filtering out the effects of interannual variability.

We also find that the geographical location of the temperature influence of a reduction in East Asian SO2 emissions corresponds to where observations show a recent surge in warming, and also where satellite observations find an increase in TOA radiative imbalance. This lends support to the conclusion that the recent intensive effort to tackle air pollution in China has driven, as an unintended side effect, an unmasking of greenhouse gas-driven global warming and a marked contribution to the recently observed warming trend.

Looking ahead, emissions from East Asia are projected to keep going down. However, the rate of change has slowed markedly, and the CEDS inventory estimates that there is less than 10 Tg SO2/year (~25% of the 2010 value) left to reduce. This means that for the coming years and decades, the influence on global warming rates from East Asian emissions reductions is likely to be less prominent, although this depends crucially on the still unresolved question of the linearity of aerosol-climate responses, in particular through aerosol–cloud interactions.

This study uses Earth System Model simulations performed for the RAMIP21. RAMIP is part of the extended phase of the 6th Coordinated Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6Plus), and builds on and extends historical (1850–2014) simulations delivered to CMIP6. The RAMIP baseline simulation is a Shared Socioeconomic Pathway with a weak air quality policy and consequently continued strong aerosol emissions (SSP3-7.0). In RAMIP perturbations, these emissions are exchanged for a strong air quality policy case (SSP1-2.6), for individual emission regions.

In this study, we use the RAMIP East Asia simulation (SSP370-eas126aer), where all anthropogenic aerosol emissions from a geographical box consisting mainly of China are perturbed. All participating models ran the baseline and signal simulations for the period 2015–2049 and delivered 10 ensemble members for each simulation. See Supplementary Table 1 for an overview of the simulations.

A subset of the models also delivered simulations with fixed sea-surface temperatures, which can be used to quantify the ERF. See ref. 21 for details.

As part of Fig. 1, we also show the aerosol emissions trajectories of the signal and baseline simulations. All non-aerosol emissions are identical in signal and baseline, and they each branch off from the same ensemble members from the historical simulation in 2014. Land use change is also identical in signal and baseline (SSP3-7.0).

Supplementary Table 2 lists the eight models used for the present study, together with the spatial resolutions, aerosol representation, and main references.

Climate responses are defined as the difference between SSP370 and SSP370-eas126aer, for the period 2035–2049. For statistical significance, we require that the multi-model, multi-ensemble member sets (consisting of 80 global or regional means, or grid point values) are significantly different according to a paired t-test with p < 0.05. Map figures are hatched for all grid points that show statistically significant changes.

ERF is quantified as the difference in net TOA (shortwave + longwave) radiation between 30-year fSST simulations, following Forster et al.42.

All uncertainties quoted in this paper are ±1 standard deviation, generally of the set of ensemble mean results from each model.

East Asia is here defined as a geographical box covering 20N-35N, 95E-133E.

Additionally, we use gridded aerosol emissions data from CEDS (2024 Gridded Data Release: December 3, 2024; v_2024_11_25), observations of aerosol optical depths from the MODIS instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellites (Combined Dark Target and Deep Blue AOD at 0.55 micron; MYD08_M3 v6.1 and MOD08_M3 v6.1), TOA energy imbalance observations from the CERES instrument (EBAF-TOA_v4.2.1), and TOA energy imbalance estimates from the ERA5 reanalysis35.

Caltech scientists have found a fast and efficient way to add up large numbers of Feynman diagrams, the simple drawings physicists use to represent particle interactions. The new method has already enabled the researchers to solve a longstanding problem in the materials science and physics worlds known as the polaron problem, giving scientists and engineers a way to predict how electrons will flow in certain materials, both conventional and quantum.

In the 1940s, physicist Richard Feynman first proposed a way to represent the various interactions that take place between electrons, photons, and other fundamental particles using 2D drawings that involve straight and wavy lines intersecting at vertices. Though they look simple, these Feynman diagrams allow scientists to calculate the probability that a particular collision, or scattering, will take place between particles.

Since particles can interact in many ways, many different diagrams are needed to depict every possible interaction. And each diagram represents a mathematical expression. Therefore, by summing all the possible diagrams, scientists can arrive at quantitative values related to particular interactions and scattering probabilities.

"Summing all Feynman diagrams with quantitative accuracy is a holy grail in theoretical physics," says Marco Bernardi, professor of applied physics, physics, and materials science at Caltech. "We have attacked the polaron problem by adding up all the diagrams for the so-called electron-phonon interaction, essentially up to an infinite order."

In a paper published in Nature Physics, the Caltech team uses its new method to precisely compute the strength of electron-phonon interactions and to predict associated effects quantitatively. The lead author of the paper is graduate student Yao Luo, a member of Bernardi's group.

For some materials, such as simple metals, the electrons moving inside the crystal structure will interact only weakly with its atomic vibrations. For such materials, scientists can use a method called perturbation theory to describe the interactions that occur between electrons and phonons, which can be thought of as "units" of atomic vibration. Perturbation theory is a good approximation in these systems because each successive order or interaction becomes decreasingly important. That means that computing only one or a few Feynman diagrams - a calculation that can be done routinely - is sufficient to obtain accurate electron-phonon interactions in these materials.

Introducing Polarons

But for many other materials, electrons interact much more strongly with the atomic lattice, forming entangled electron-phonon states known as polarons. Polarons are electrons accompanied by the lattice distortion they induce. They form in a wide range of materials including insulators, semiconductors, materials used in electronics or energy devices, as well as many quantum materials. For example, an electron placed in a material with ionic bonds will distort the surrounding lattice and form a localized polaron state, resulting in decreased mobility due to the strong electron-phonon interaction. Scientists can study these polaron states by measuring how conductive the electrons are or how they distort the atomic lattice around them.

Perturbation theory does not work for these materials because each successive order is more important than the last. "It's basically a nightmare in terms of scaling," says Bernardi. "If you can calculate the lowest order, it's very likely that you cannot do the second order, and the third order will just be impossible. The computational cost typically scales prohibitively with interaction order. There are too many diagrams to compute, and the higher-order diagrams are too computationally expensive."

Summing Feynman Diagrams

Scientists have searched for a way to add up all the Feynman diagrams that describe the many, many ways that the electrons in such a material can interact with atomic vibrations. Thus far such calculations have been dominated by methods where scientists can tune certain parameters to match an experiment. "But when you do that, you don't know whether you've actually understood the mechanism or not," says Bernardi. Instead, his group focuses on solving problems from "first principles," meaning beginning with nothing more than the positions of atoms within a material and using the equations of quantum mechanics.

When thinking about the scope of this problem, Luo says to imagine trying to predict how the stock market might behave tomorrow. To attempt this, one would need to consider every interaction between every trader over some period to get precise predictions of the market's dynamics. Luo wants to understand all the interactions between electrons and phonons in a material where the phonons interact strongly with the atoms in the material. But as with predicting the stock market, the number of possible interactions is prohibitively large. "It is actually impossible to calculate directly," he says. "The only thing we can do is use a smart way of sampling all these scattering processes."

Betting on Monte Carlo

Caltech researchers are addressing this problem by applying a technique called diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DMC), in which an algorithm randomly samples spots within the space of all Feynman diagrams for a system, but with some guidance in terms of the most important places to sample. "We set up some rules to move effectively, with high agility, within the space of Feynman diagrams," explains Bernardi.

The Caltech team overcame the enormous amount of computing that would have normally been required to use DMC to study real materials with first principle methods by relying on a technique they reported last year that compresses the matrices that represent electron-phonon interactions. Another major advance is nearly removing the so-called "sign problem" in electron-phonon DMC using a clever technique that views diagrams as products of tensors, mathematical objects expressed as multi-dimensional matrices.

"The clever diagram sampling, sign-problem removal, and electron-phonon matrix compression are the three key pieces of the puzzle that have enabled this paradigm shift in the polaron problem," says Bernardi.

In the new paper, the researchers have applied DMC calculations in diverse systems that contain polarons, including lithium fluoride, titanium dioxide, and strontium titanate. The scientists say their work opens up a wide range of predictions that are relevant to experiments that people are conducting on both conventional and quantum materials -- including electrical transport, spectroscopy, superconductivity, and other properties in materials that have strong electron-phonon coupling.

"We have successfully described polarons in materials using DMC, but the method we developed could also help study strong interactions between light and matter, or even provide the blueprint to efficiently add up Feynman diagrams in entirely different physical theories," says Bernardi.

The paper is titled, "First principles diagrammatic Monte Carlo for electron-phonon interactions and polaron." Along with Bernardi and Luo, Jinsoo Park (MS '20, PhD '22), now a visiting associate in applied physics and materials science at Caltech and a postdoctoral research scholar at the University of Chicago, is also an author. The work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing program, the National Science Foundation, and the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center, a U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility. Luo was partially funded by an Eddleman Graduate Fellowship. Calculations of transport and polarons in oxides were supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and Clarkson Aerospace Corp.

Meta announced on Monday that it will take additional measures to crack down on accounts sharing “unoriginal” content to Facebook, meaning those that repeatedly reuse someone else's text, photos, or videos. This year, Meta has already taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators, it said.

Plus, it has taken action against 500,000 accounts that were engaged in “spammy behavior or fake engagement.” Those actions have included things like demoting the accounts' comments and reducing the distribution of their content to prevent the accounts from monetizing.

The update from Meta follows only days after YouTube said it was also clarifying its policy around unoriginal content, including mass-produced and repetitive videos — things that have become easier to generate with the help of AI technology.

Like YouTube, Meta says it won't penalize users who are engaging with other people's content, doing things like making reaction videos, joining a trend, or adding their own takes. Instead, Meta's focus is on the reposting of others' content, either on spam accounts or those that pretend to belong to the original creator. 

Accounts that abuse the system by repeatedly reusing someone else's content will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a period of time and see reduced distribution of their posts, the company said. When Facebook detects duplicate videos, it will also reduce the distribution of the copies to ensure the original creator gets the views and credit.

In addition, the company said it's testing a system that adds links on duplicate videos that point viewers to the original content. 

The update arrives as Meta weathers criticism from users across its platforms, including Instagram, about erroneous, over-enforcement of its policies through automated means. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures asks Meta to fix the issue with wrongfully disabled accounts and its lack of human support, which has users feeling abandoned and has hurt many small businesses. Meta has not yet publicly addressed the issue, despite attention from press and other high-profile creators.

While Meta's newest crackdown is focused more on accounts that steal others' content for profit, issues around unoriginal content are growing.

With the rise of AI technology, platforms have become flooded with AI slop, a term referencing low-quality media content made using generative AI. On YouTube, for instance, it's easy to find an AI voice overlaid on photos, video clips, or other repurposed content, thanks to text-to-video AI tools.

Meta's update seemingly only focuses on reused content, but its post suggests that it may be taking AI slop into consideration, too. In a section where the company offers “tips” for making original content, Meta notes that creators shouldn't just be “stitching together clips” or adding their watermark when using content from other sources, and they should focus on “authentic storytelling,” not short videos offering little value.

Without directly saying so, these types of unoriginal videos are also things that AI tools have made it easier to produce, as low-quality videos will often feature a series of just images or clips (either real or AI), with added AI narration. 

In the post, Meta also warns creators not to reuse content from other apps or sources, which has been a longstanding rule. It also notes that video captions should be high quality, which could mean cutting down on the use of automated AI captions that aren't edited by the creator.

Meta says these changes will roll out gradually over the months ahead, so Facebook creators have time to adjust. If creators think their content isn't being distributed, they can view the new post-level insights in Facebook's Professional Dashboard to see why.

Creators will also be able to see if they're at risk of content recommendation or monetization penalties in the Support home screen from their Page or professional profile's main menu.

Meta typically shares information about its content takedowns in its quarterly Transparency Reports. In the last quarter, Meta said that 3% of its worldwide monthly active users on Facebook were fake accounts, and it had taken action on 1 billion fake accounts from January through March 2025. 

More recently, Meta has backed away from fact-checking content itself in favor of Community Notes in the U.S., similar to X, which allows users and contributors to determine if posts follow Meta's Community Standards and are accurate.

The U.S. Department of Defense announced new contracts with Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI on Monday that will give the federal agency access to the latest AI agents. The contract with each company has a ceiling of $200 million, and while it's not surprising that DoD is pushing hard into AI, the inclusion of Elon Musk's xAI will raise plenty of eyebrows after Grok's recent erratic behavior.

The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) announced the new contracts in a press release Monday, which notes DoD is “implementing a commercial-first approach to accelerating DoD adoption of AI.”

“Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities U.S. industry has to offer,” the press release explains.

But xAI has been generating lots of attention lately that may give people both in and out of government some pause. Grok, xAI's chatbot, started randomly spouting right-wing conspiracy theories back in May about white farmers in South Africa being murdered for their race. And last week, Grok praised Adolf Hitler, spread anti-semitic phrases, and advocated for another Holocaust against Jews.

The Grok public relations account on X noted the new contract with DoD in a tweet Monday but also introduced a new suite of products called Grok for Government and said its products would be listed on the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule, a huge win for the company that makes Grok available to federal government employees even beyond the Pentagon. “This allows every federal government department, agency, or office, to purchase xAI products,” the company wrote.

“Under the umbrella of Grok For Government, we will be bringing all of our world-class AI tools to federal, local, state, and national security customers,” the company said in a press release. “These customers will be able to use the Grok family of products to accelerate America – from making everyday government services faster and more efficient to using AI to address unsolved problems in fundamental science and technology.”

Musk held a livestream demonstration about Grok 4 on Wednesday of last week, just a day after the AI chatbot went full Nazi.

“America is the world leader in AI, and this is in no small part due to a tradition of innovation and strong investments in engineering and science. We're excited to contribute back to the country that made xAI uniquely possible here,” xAI said in a continued.

Musk was recently a special government employee in the White House as the head of DOGE until he had a falling out with President Donald Trump. Musk accused Trump of being in the so-called “Epstein files,” in a tweet he later deleted, but the billionaire oligarch seems to have softened his criticism of the president lately, perhaps over fears about losing lucrative government contracts like the one announced today.

The Department of Defense under Secretary Pete Hegseth has been fixated on buzzwords like “warfighting” and “warfighters,” and adopting new AI tools is part of that mission, according to leaders at the agency. And Monday's press release was filled to the brim with similarly grandiose language.

“The adoption of AI is transforming the Department's ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,” said DoD Chief Digital and AI Officer Dr. Doug Matty. “Leveraging commercially available solutions into an integrated capabilities approach will accelerate the use of advanced AI as part of our Joint mission essential tasks in our warfighting domain as well as intelligence, business, and enterprise information systems.”

Maybe Grok can teach the folks at the Pentagon some new synonyms for warfighter.

The Trump administration, through the Department of Defense, plans to spend $1 billion over the next four years on what it calls “offensive cyber operations.” 

The provision in Trump's landmark One Big Beautiful Bill does not say what those “offensive cyber operations” are, nor what specific tools or software would qualify. The budget does note that the money will go towards enhancing and improving the capabilities of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, which operates in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, the U.S.' biggest geopolitical rival. 

The move to spend a billion on cyber comes as the newly passed law also slashed a billion from the U.S.' cyber defense budget, at a time when the U.S. faces ongoing cyber threats from China.

Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat and long-standing member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said that the provision also comes as the Trump administration cut funding for defensive cybersecurity programs, including gutting the U.S. cybersecurity agency CISA and its budget. The cuts have been only in part rolled back after a federal court ruled the firing of 130 employees unlawful.

“The Trump administration has slashed funding for cybersecurity and government technology and left our country wide open to attack by foreign hackers,” Wyden said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Vastly expanding U.S. government hacking is going to invite retaliation — not just against federal agencies, but also rural hospitals, local governments and private companies who don't stand a chance against nation-state hackers.”

Offensive cyber operations can describe a wide range of targeted hacks against U.S. adversaries, which include the use of zero-day exploits — unknown flaws in software that give their operators the ability to hack into a target's device — or the deployment of spyware, which can be used to steal data from a person.

But these operations can also include more everyday components needed to support those operations, such as setting up the infrastructure needed to carry out cyberattacks, intelligence gathering, such as collecting or buying internet traffic (known as “netflow”), and more.

Spokespeople from the White House and the Department of Defense acknowledged receipt, but did not respond to a request for comment.

General Motors has just announced its latest and likely final piece in what now appears to be a three-pronged cell-chemistry strategy to power GM's lineup of a dozen EVs through the end of the decade and beyond.

GM has stated today it will build low-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells in Spring Hill, Tennessee, starting in late 2027. Conversion of cell lines to produce that chemistry will begin later this year. The cell plant at the Spring Hill complex is owned and operated by Ultium Cells, GM's joint-venture battery company with LG Energy Solution. A GM assembly plant in the same complex builds the Cadillac Lyriq and Acura ZDX electric SUVs.

Under Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, the company has diversified from its previous strategy of “one cell for all EVs.” Kelty was hired in February 2024 after stints at Tesla and Panasonic, and is widely respected in the industry.

The LFP cells made by Ultium are expected to be used in the updated 2026 Chevrolet Bolt EV, which GM should reveal within two to three months. It will go into production in a Kansas plant before the end this year. For its first two years, it will have to use LFP cells imported from another LG plant—potentially one in South Korea. Those imports let GM get inexpensive iron-phosphate batteries onto US roads a full three years before its next cell chemistry, called LMR, which it says costs no more than LFP, but has higher energy density.

Still, converting a plant—at an unspecified cost—to build LFP cells suggests they will be used in the lineup for a while.

Thus far, all GM EVs after the 2017-2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV have used nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum (NMCA) cells. Those hold the most energy in a given volume, but are also priciest due to their nickel and cobalt content. Delays in production of the Ultium modules holding those cells pushed out deliveries of GM's EV lineup by 12 to 18 months, from late 2022 to early 2024. (GM EV sales have risen steadily for three quarters, suggesting those troubles might be in the past.)

This May, Ultium announced a second cell chemistry, which it calls “lithium manganese-rich” or LMR. It claims the LMR chemistry provides one-third greater energy density than the same volume of lithium iron-phosphate (LFP) cells—at a comparable cell cost—and will cut the cost of its largest EV trucks and SUVs. Those vehicles from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC use gargantuan battery packs of 109 to 205 kilowatt-hours.

The first LMR cells will come off a pilot line in 2027; full volume production is slated for 2028 at a plant Ultium hasn't disclosed. With Spring Hill now set to produce LFP cells, it seems likely LMR cells will come from the other Ultium Cells plant now in production—in Warren, Ohio.

Adding lithium-iron-phosphate rounds out the suite of chemistries GM is likely to use in its EVs from this year through the early 2030s. That applies, at least, to those produced outside China; the various models it builds in China have long included LFP chemistries, the dominant chemistry in that country.

Much of the intellectual property around LFP chemistries is owned by Chinese firms, which has caused trouble for Ford as it tries to add LFP cells for future EV models. A GM spokesperson told WIRED that no intellectual property for the LFP cells it will produce with partner LG Energy Solution is owned by any Chinese entity.

While GM's existing NMCA cells were in the pouch format, its LMR chemistry is to be in larger prismatic cells housed in a new and larger module. GM would not specify the cell format of its imminent LFP cells, nor would it comment on the module that will hold them. However, the modules are likely to be smaller than the new, very large ones developed for the larger LMR cells—which may be better suited to a huge truck pack than one in a compact economy car like the updated Bolt EV.

Kelty has said using different chemistries and module formats for different applications lets the company fine-tune its battery strategy. It also cuts costs where the company sees it as appropriate. The battery pack of an EV is by far its most expensive component, and the only hope to get EVs to price parity on the showroom floor is to slash that cost substantially.

While North American car shoppers will experience the new LFP cells in future EVs from General Motors' Chevrolet brand, and possibly others, US production also benefits the other partner in Ultium. The new lines will “further [accelerate] our efforts to deliver new chemistries and form factors that effectively capture the unmet needs in the EV market,” said Wonjoon Suh, executive VP and head of the Advanced Automotive Battery division at LG Energy Solution.

GM's cross-town rival Ford is also working toward getting its own LFP plant built and into production in Marshall, Michigan, through its Blue Oval battery unit. That plant, however, has faced opposition both from area residents and state and national politicians due to Ford's deal to license the intellectual property for the cells from the world's highest-volume EV cell maker, China's Contemporary Amperex Technology, or CATL.

Ford too has said it would use LMR cells in future EVs “within this decade,” in a late April LinkedIn post from Charles Poon, its global director of electrified propulsion engineering, published. GM, however, has specified production in 2028.

The root issue here is that the government is no longer able or willing to control and bind their own law enforcement agencies.  Agreed that this program was a bad idea, but the wider issue that law enforcement agencies can and do wantonly disregard direct orders from the state.  There's the direct issue of impact on people as a result, and the more intangible idea of the questionable legitimacy of a government that is not able to control its own enforcement agencies.This needs to be met with swift repercussions for both the individuals that participated, as well as the agencies that allowed it.  Lacking that, it seems a reasonable inference that enforcement agencies are no longer bound by the will of the people and are in fact the ruling government.

With "the left" you mean the SF DA?



Crime has been on a downward trend for a generation, outside of a few areas. In San Francisco specifically, crime also increased due to police officers quietly going on strike against policies they disagreed with. Now that police officers are actually doing their jobs again, shockingly, crime is rapidly falling.What has actually increased is sensationalist coverage in the media, which you're right, has created a significant political backlash.

SFPD hadn't been doing their jobs for far, far longer than Chesa's tenure. I moved here in 2013 and their non-enforcement practices were already legendary. Blaming Chesa for being in office for like 10 months in 2019-2020 is a hell of a cop out (pun intended).Even if it were true, it wouldn't in any way excuse the police for choosing not to do the job they're paid to do.

Yes, this is an argument for not giving them more authority than necessary, but it's also an argument for holding them accountable when they do act out of bounds.To this point, any law that gives power to government officials also needs to have explicit and painful consequences for abuse of those powers. Civilians who break the law face punishment and penalties, but government employees are almost never held to account. That needs to change.

But, in the autumn of 1941, key Nazi figures contributed to mounting pressure on Hitler to deport the German Jews. This pressure culminated in Hitler ordering the deportation of all Jews still in the Greater German Reich and Protectorate between 15-17 September 1941.

My local police department just recently got a grant for these and is in the process of setting them up, and I'm working with a number of local technologists and activists to shut it down. We are showing up at every police commission meeting and every city council meeting and keeping actively engaged with local press. I spent almost three hours yesterday having coffee with a police commissioner and I have meeting requests from a number of other local officials.

The type of crime common here is nearly impossible to address without technological assistance. People steal cars, drive into neighborhoods, then break into other cars and houses. They're gone sometimes before a 911 call can even be made, and far before the police arrive. The criminals know this and are just incredibly brazen about it. They'll finish the job with people watching and recording because they know there's no way for them to be caught. People get followed home and held up in their driveway. The criminals are often armed, and people have been shot and killed for even the mildest of resistance. One guy was killed a block from where I was standing for knocking on the window of a getaway car of some guys stealing another car in broad daylight.Leaving aside broader and more fundamental fixes for crime, which are much longer term projects, the only near-term thing that actually reduces this kind of crime is arrest and conviction rates. In SF, drones have helped reduced car break-ins, because they've actually caught some crews. Oakland doesn't have drones that I know of, but Flock cameras have enabled enough tracking for police to sometimes actually find these people quickly, even several miles away, and make an arrest.Those are just the plain facts of the situation. It's understandable that people want some kind of solution here. Without at least starting from that understanding, it'll be very difficult to convince people that a solution that is having a positive impact already is not worth the other costs and risks.And to me, this is the core conflict at a really high level: the economic and societal fixes for crime are usually opposed by the same people who abuse these kind of surveillance systems for authoritarian purposes. To me it's no coincidence that their preferred solution to crime just happens to help them keep an eye on the whole population.

This is not the case when you consider the relationship between the states and the federal government, though. While the states obviously aren't fully sovereign, the federated structure of our country explicitly grants them limited sovereignty that is innate and not in any way derived or subject to the federal authority. Thus the ability of the federal government to commandeer state governments to its own ends is rather limited and needs to be explicitly spelled out (e.g. National Guard can be federalized, but State Defense Forces cannot). And last I checked, there are no clauses in the Constitution that give the feds the power to commandeer state law enforcement to enforce federal laws; nor did the courts find such power implicit in other clauses.

Windows 7 can run natively on the Steam Deck, according to operating systems enthusiast Bob Pony on Twitter/X. Why this is something that needed to be done is another question. The answer, which many readers may sympathize with, is likely just because it can be done. We note that Pony has a particular penchant for Windows Vista, so perhaps we should prepare for that Steam Deck + unlikely OS announcement next.

Windows 7 (2009) and the Steam Deck (2022) are divided by an approximate 13-year gulf, so it isn't surprising that they aren't the most comfortable bedfellows. Immediate evidence of technical difficulties in this marriage is evident in Pony's screenshot – the Windows 7 display is stuck in an inappropriate portrait mode.

Pony reveals some more details about the Windows 7-on-Steam Deck feat in the ensuing discussion. Apparently, there are few, if any, issues running this OS on the CPU portion of AMD's Van Gogh APU. However, “the drivers won't install under Windows 7 as its integrated graphics is basically custom-made and drivers for it only work under 10/11,” the equine OS enthusiast explains.

Other replies in the thread ask for Windows XP and even the peculiar by any metric Temple OS to be tested out next. But we think any further steps down the Windows OS ladder will take some time. It is hardly satisfactory if Windows 7 can't even be tweaked into landscape mode yet…

Pony shared a video demonstrating Windows 8.1 on the Steam Deck two years ago. The Metro-skinned OS ran pretty well, with full touch functionality. If this cadence is to be maintained, any Vista on Steam Deck achievement won't be shared until 2027.

Both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 are firmly in the retro computing niche in 2025, and are soon to be joined by Windows 10 – bar a few stalwarts who feel compelled to pay an Extended Security Updates (ESU) fee instead of just shifting up to Windows 11 or finally contribute to making 2025 the breakthrough year for Linux on desktop.

Hopefully, SteamOS will officially come to desktops at the same time as Windows 10 says its farewells. It would be a canny move by Valve to introduce it a little earlier.

Windows 7 can run natively on the Steam Deck, according to operating systems enthusiast Bob Pony on Twitter/X. Why this is something that needed to be done is another question. The answer, which many readers may sympathize with, is likely just because it can be done. We note that Pony has a particular penchant for Windows Vista, so perhaps we should prepare for that Steam Deck + unlikely OS announcement next.

Last year marked the 70th anniversary of the first Godzilla, and Toho has spent much of that 70th year going all-in to celebrate the King of the Monsters. From more movies, to theme park rides, to plenty of crazy merch, it's been a great time to be a Godzilla fan, and it's about to be even better.

Ahead of its release this week, io9 has an exclusive look inside Godzilla: The First 70 Years, a titanic celebration of the last seven decades of kaiju moviemaking. Published by Abrams and written by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski, The First 70 Years charts a visual and narrative history of Godzilla's creation and his titanic rise in Japanese cinema.

See at Amazon

From the very first movie back in 1954 all the way to the international success of Godzilla Minus One, The First 70 Years is a treasure trove of Godzilla's history in Japan, featuring insights from across every era of Godzilla filmmaking, as well as tons of rare behind-the-scenes photography, production materials, and marketing to gawp over.

To celebrate the book's release, io9 has a look at just some of that rare visual history from within the book, including chilling concept art of Hedorah's acid attack in Godzilla vs. Hedorah, sales copy from the first scrapped attempt to bring Godzilla stateside, and behind-the-scenes photos from production on the 1954 classic. Check them out below in our exclusive gallery from Godzilla: The First 70 Years!

Godzilla: The First 70 Years releases tomorrow, July 15, and is available to preorder now.

Rivian founder and CEO RJ Scaringe has transferred a portion of his ownership stake and voting power as part of a newly settled divorce proceeding, according to a regulatory filing. 

Scaringe moved about 4 million in shares and 6 million in options to his ex-wife, Meagan Scaringe, on July 9 as part of the settlement, the filing shows. At Rivian's current stock price, those shares and options could be worth roughly $130 million, though they have varying strike prices that would affect the total return if sold. The change in stock ownership comes at the end of a two-year-long divorce proceeding, court documents show.

Scaringe owned more than 15 million shares of Class A stock and nearly 8 million Class B shares when the company submitted its annual proxy report April 29. As a result of the transfer, Scaringe's voting power has slipped from 7.6% earlier this year to around 4%, the lowest since Rivian's 2021 IPO.

The shift in stock ownership doesn't have an impact on Rivian's business or operations, according to the company.  

In an official statement emailed to TechCrunch, a spokesperson said “RJ and Meagan finalized their divorce. They will continue to prioritize co-parenting their children.”

The settlement comes at a pivotal time for Rivian. Rivian has redesigned its R1S SUV and R1T truck in a bid to lower manufacturing costs, while improving performance of its flagship vehicles. However, the company is banking on the next addition to its lineup — the highly anticipated R2 SUV that has a $45,000 base price — to grow sales. That vehicle won't go on sale until the first half of 2026. 

The ownership structure of Rivian has shifted since its IPO in 2021. At that time, Amazon and Ford were among the largest stakeholders. Today, Ford is essentially out and Volkswagen Group has emerged as a major player.

In late 2024, Rivian entered into a joint venture valued at $5.8 billion with Volkswagen focused on software and electrical architecture. Rivian has provided technology and employees to the joint venture, while Volkswagen has largely contributed money in the form of share purchases and convertible debt.

As a result, the German automotive giant now owns 12.3% of Rivian, according to a recent filing. That puts it slightly behind Amazon, which owned 14.2% of Rivian as of the April 2025 proxy filing. That's enough to give Amazon the most voting power of any single shareholder: 13.3%. (Ford and T. Rowe Price also used to be major shareholders after the IPO, but have since sold down their stakes.) 

Scaringe's ownership stake in Rivian was 2% prior to the divorce settlement, according to the proxy filing. But he had a 7.6% share of the voting power, thanks in part to the Class B stock, which comes with 10 votes per share. (Rivian's Class A stock only comes with 1 vote per share.) The transfer of shares and options in the settlement cuts his voting power to around 4%. 

Unlike many high-profile tech founders, Scaringe never had a tremendous amount of voting power post-IPO. The most he wielded was 9.2% in 2022. That figure remained unchanged in 2023, fell to 8.7% in 2024, and again to 7.6% in 2025 following the Volkswagen investment.

The Class B stock included in the settlement was automatically converted into Class A stock, meaning Scaringe's ex-wife will not likely have much voting power relative to other shareholders if she maintains the holding. A lawyer representing her did not respond to a request for comment sent over the weekend. 

The CEO and founder still controls a mix of around 50 million shares, options, and Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs. As those fully vest, his ownership stake and voting power could go back up. 

Scaringe founded Rivian in 2009, and he was married in 2014. He took Rivian public in 2021. 

Records obtained from Orange County Superior Court show that he filed for divorce in October 2023, with his ex-wife agreeing to separate in another filing one month later.

Despite various rumors and even an alleged leak, there was no “one more thing” teasing a tri-folding phone at Samsung's Unpacked event last week, where the tech company announced the impressively thin Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7 with an edge-to-edge cover screen, and two stylish Galaxy Watch 8 smartwatches. But the tri-fold phone is real and it's coming soon.

Speaking to the Korea Times, Roh-Tae-moon aka TM Roh, Samsung's acting head of its Device Experience Division, said the company is “working hard on a tri-fold smartphone with the goal of launching it at the end of the year.” There's no name for the tri-fold—rumors claim it'll be called the Galaxy Fold G—but it's nearly finished, said Roh. “We are now focusing on perfecting the product and its usability, but we have not decided its name.”

Android Authority shared the below video and several images and animations, mined from the latest version of Samsung's One UI 8 software, showing off what it believes is Samsung's tri-fold phone.

I'll have a review for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 on Gizmodo this week, but it's safe to say that Samsung has finally created the book-style foldable it set out to make in 2019. The Z Fold 7 is basically as thin and light as a Galaxy S25 Ultra and has the top-notch performance and cameras you'd expect from a flagship phone—features you can't cheap out on when you're asking $2,000 for the device. With the Z Fold now virtually perfect, it's the right time for Samsung to look at even bolder phone form factors.

A tri-fold phone with two folds instead of one, which allows for an even larger tablet-sized screen when unfolded, would be a first for Samsung and play catch up to Huawei's Mate XT Ultimate. Like all of Huawei's phones, the Mate XT Ultimate is not available in the U.S. because of Chinese restrictions, which is a problem that Samsung wouldn't have. While tri-fold phones are eye-catching and would put Samsung back at the top as a tech innovator, the company's first such device will almost certainly cost even more than the Z Fold 7. Huawei's Mate XT Ultimate carries a 3,499 euros starting price (roughly $4,000 at today's exchange rate). That's not surprising since you're getting a phone that functions as a regular glass slab when folded up, a tablet when one fold is unfolded, and then a really big tablet (or laptop-sized screen) when fully unfurled.

Releasing a tri-fold phone won't be without its own challenges. More folds gets you the biggest screen you can fold up into your pocket, but it also requires bigger and heavier batteries and thickness balloons with all the folds. Durability might be a concern, too—there's more display area to get damaged, especially on the sides where the creases fold over. Still, it's good to see Samsung hasn't lost all of its fight after giving in and making all of its bar-style phones essentially look like iPhone bricks. I'd love to see Samsung come back and wallop its competitors instead of phoning things in year in and year out.

One bit flip is all it takes.

A group of researchers has discovered a new attack called GPUHammer that can flip bits in the memory of NVIDIA GPUs, quietly corrupting AI models and causing serious damage, without ever touching the actual code or data input. Fortunately, Nvidia is already ahead of the bad actors and has put out guidelines on how to mitigate the risk involved in this situation. Regardless, if you're using a card with GDDR6 memory, this is worth paying attention to

The team behind the discovery, from the University of Toronto, showed how the attack could drop an AI model's accuracy from 80% to under 1%—just by flipping a single bit in memory. It's not just theoretical either, as they ran it on a real NVIDIA RTX A6000, using a technique that repeatedly hammers memory cells until one nearby flips, messing with whatever's stored there.

GPUHammer is a GPU-focused version of a known hardware issue called Rowhammer. It's been around for a while in the world of CPUs and RAM. Basically, modern memory chips are so tightly packed that repeatedly reading or writing one row can cause electrical interference that flips bits in nearby rows. That flipped bit could be anything—a number, a command, or part of a neural network's weight—and that's where things go wrong.

Until now, this was mostly a concern for DDR4 system memory, but GPUHammer proves it can happen on GDDR6 VRAM too, which is what powers many modern NVIDIA cards, especially in AI and workstation workloads. This is a serious cause for concern, at least in specific situations. The researchers showed that even with some safeguards in place, they could cause multiple bit flips across several memory banks. In one case, this completely broke a trained AI model, making it essentially useless. The scary part is that it doesn't require access to your data. The attacker just needs to share the same GPU in a cloud environment or server, and they could potentially interfere with your workload however they want.

As mentioned, the attack was tested on an RTX A6000, but the risk applies to a wide range of Ampere, Ada, Hopper, and Turing GPUs, especially those used in workstations and servers. NVIDIA has published a full list of affected models and recommends ECC for most of them. That said, newer GPUs like the RTX 5090 and H100 have built-in ECC directly on the chip, which handles this automatically—no user setup required.



However, if you're someone just sitting at home worried about their personal setup, this isn't the kind of attack you'd see targeting individual gamers or home PCs. It's more relevant to shared GPU environments like cloud gaming servers, AI training clusters, or VDI setups where multiple users run workloads on the same hardware. That being said, the core idea that memory on a GPU can be tampered with silently is something the entire industry needs to take seriously, especially as more games, apps, and services start leaning on AI.

NVIDIA has responded with a simple but important recommendation: turn on ECC (Error Correction Code) if your GPU supports it. ECC is a feature that adds redundancy to memory so it can detect and fix errors like these bit flips. Keep in mind, enabling ECC does come with a small trade-off—around 10% slower performance for machine learning tasks, and about 6–6.5% less usable VRAM. But for serious AI work with peace of mind, that's worth it.

Attacks like GPUHammer don't just crash systems or cause glitches. They tamper with the integrity of AI itself, affecting how models behave or make decisions. And because it all happens at the hardware level, these changes are nearly invisible unless you know exactly what to look for. In regulated industries like healthcare, finance, or autonomous driving, that could cause serious problems—wrong decisions, security failures, even legal consequences. Even though the average user isn't directly at risk, GPUHammer is a wake-up call. As GPUs continue to evolve beyond gaming into AI, creative work, and productivity, so do the risks. Memory safety, even on a GPU, is no longer optional.

After a pre-game chat, Gemini swung from being confident to admitting it would ‘struggle immensely' against the ancient console.

Google Gemini decided to call off a chess match against the ancient 1.19 MHz Atari 2600 console after a friendly pre-game reminder about what happened to ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot. Citrix Architecture and Delivery specialist Robert Jr. Caruso, now well known for his AI vs Atari Chess challenges, revealed Gemini chickened out, in a chat with The Register.

As was the case with the ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot chess challenges, Caruso reveals that Gemini was initially brimming with confidence regarding its Chess prowess. It was comfortable, if not eager, to throw down the gauntlet against the Atari 2600. At the beginning of Caruso's chat with Gemini, the chatbot boasted of being able to “think millions of moves ahead and evaluate endless positions.” That sounds familiar in a proverbial ‘pride goeth before destruction' kind of way.

Caruso then kindly reminded Gemini that he had previously organized Atari Chess bouts with ChatGPT and Microsoft's Copilot. The Citrix expert went on to explicitly explain to Gemini that other LLMs had displayed outstanding levels of “misplaced confidence,” ahead of their chess matches against the ancient console.

Gemini must have then thought a bit deeper about what exactly would be involved in the chess challenge, and admitted to Caruso that it had been hallucinating regarding the magnitude of its abilities. It added that it now felt that it would “struggle immensely” in a match against the Atari 2600. “Canceling the match is likely the most time-efficient and sensible decision,” concluded Gemini.

So, now we have more confirmation, if needed, that today's LLMs aren't designed to be chess champs, and a little machine introspection is all that is required for them to think better of participating in such a challenge. This is even advisable when challenged by the incredibly constrained Atari 2600 with its puny MOS Technology 6507 9-bit processor, accompanied by just 128 bytes of RAM.

Due to the way these AIs, or LLMs, are created from linguistic theory and machine learning models, they are much more adept at talking about than playing the game of kings.

Bitcoin's historic rally continues with no signs of slowing down.

The world's most famous cryptocurrency hit an all-time high overnight from Sunday to Monday, briefly surpassing the symbolic threshold of $123,000 before pulling back slightly. By 6:00 a.m. ET, it was hovering around $122,013, according to data from CoinGecko.

This staggering surge marks a more than 30% increase in Bitcoin's price since January, outpacing even gold and fueling the narrative that Bitcoin is the new “digital gold.”

Analysts attribute much of the momentum to growing institutional interest, driven in large part by Bitcoin ETFs, new investment products that allow everyday investors and financial institutions to buy shares that track the price of Bitcoin, without having to own the cryptocurrency directly.

Charts circulating on social media show that spot Bitcoin ETF inflows have reached all-time highs, reflecting sustained demand from large investors. Coinbase has forecast a massive second wave of capital entering the market once U.S. financial advisors are legally allowed to recommend Bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This opens the door to billions in retirement savings, pension funds, and other traditional investment flows being funneled into Bitcoin.

The timing of Bitcoin's climb isn't coincidental. It comes as Crypto Week begins in Washington, D.C. It's a high-stakes political moment for the crypto industry. Lawmakers are considering several bills that could reshape how digital assets are regulated in the United States. These include:

Bitcoin's rise has put it ahead of nearly every other major asset in 2025.

“Gold (+28%) and Bitcoin (+26%) are now the top-performing major assets so far in 2025,” noted Charlie Bilello, chief market strategist at Creative Planning. “We've never seen these two in the #1/#2 spots for any calendar year.”

That dynamic has strengthened Bitcoin's brand as “digital gold” and added to its appeal during a year marked by inflation concerns, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical uncertainty.

Still, some market watchers are sounding alarms about the pace and nature of the rally. The team behind The Kobeissi Letter, a widely followed financial newsletter, points to a troubling paradox: Bitcoin is soaring while interest rates remain high, a combination that defies traditional economic models. They fear Bitcoin has entered a dangerous new phase.

“This is not a ‘normal,'” they wrote. “We have reached a point where Bitcoin is moving in a literal STRAIGHT-LINE higher. Rates are rising, the USD is down -11% in 6 months, and crypto is up +$1 TRILLION in 3 months. What's happening? Bitcoin has entered ‘crisis mode.'”

This is not a "normal."

They connect this crisis mode directly to massive government spending, pointing out the rally's acceleration after the passage of President Trump's recent spending package.

“Bitcoin has reached a point where it is quite literally making new all time highs multiple times a day. Since the U.S. House passed President Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' on July 3rd, Bitcoin is up +$15,000.”

Their conclusion is a stark warning for anyone watching the markets.

“If the surge in gold prices didn't alert you, Bitcoin should.”

At first glance, this mess of wires, onboard components, and manually soldered circuits may seem like some sort of cyberpunk sculpture, but it's actually a project that can only be described as absurdly brilliant. A passionate enthusiast has just built an entire processor—yes, not a development board, not a microcontroller, but a full-on, instruction-capable, memory-addressing CPU using nothing but old memory chips and logic components from the 8-bit era. It wasn't designed to replace a modern CPU, but rather a "fun" DIY project, dubbed the EPROMINT.

The creator behind this astonishing project, Majsterkowanie i nie tylko (or MINT for short, "DIY and more" in English), spent three months designing, wiring, programming, and documenting every last detail of the processor's architecture. The idea was born from a simple experiment using obsolete memory chips called EPROMs, originally configured to control small external systems, like a PWM dimmer or a message display. The simplicity of that setup lit a spark. If memory could be used to simulate basic logic, then perhaps the building blocks of a complete processor weren't so far off.

Not long after, the hobbyist found himself knee-deep in schematics, replicating the structure of classic CPUs from the 8-bit era, specifically those like the Z80, which helped ignite the personal computer revolution. The result is a machine that may not look sleek or polished, but functions according to real instruction sets, executes its own assembler code, and reacts to hardware interrupts just like a commercial processor would.

The project started with the most basic component of any processor: the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The first prototype, built to handle simple addition, was unreliable and had to be scrapped. Its replacement was fully socketed for easier debugging. From there, the build expanded to include a memory interface, an address bus controller—driven by a secondary ALU—and eventually the control logic, which decodes opcodes and coordinates the entire data flow.

The software was also written entirely from scratch. Nearly 2,000 lines of code were developed to define how the processor handles instructions, streamline how data moves through the system, and create testing procedures—all built using a custom set of development tools made for earlier circuit boards. The instruction set went well beyond what old-school CPUs could do, including operations like multiplication, division, trigonometric calculations, and even handling sequences of bits. As the creator put it, the processor was “dosed with steroids.”



With all the modules connected, the CPU was powered on for the first time, drawing 250mA of current. The same development setup previously used for other memory chip experiments was adapted to generate a complete set of instructions for the new processor. As you can see above, a blinking LED acted as the first test program while the second LED was connected to light up when an interrupt was detected, demonstrating that the CPU could handle external events even while executing instructions. It would temporarily halt its current operation, process the interrupt, and then pick up exactly where it left off, just like a real processor.

In the end, the newly birthed CPU spanned four full-sized perfboards, weighed over 500g, and contained more than a kilometer of wire if laid out. Every logic operation was implemented using pre-programmed memory. So instead of using physical NAND gates made in silicon, the system sends an 8-bit input to an EPROM, which returns the result from a stored lookup table. Functions like data routing and instruction decoding all rely on this method. To demonstrate that the system worked, he connected it to a VFD screen and wrote code to play The Matrix... or at least, low-res fragments of it.

Unlike silicon buried inside a modern SoC, this processor's execution path is completely exposed. Every clock cycle, every opcode, and all register changes are visible and traceable. That's part of the beauty. This is DIY in the truest, most punk-rock sense of the word. Watching this video makes you realize how the CPUs inside our own computers are like magic—billions of transistors dancing across the finest grains of sand, puppeteered by glass and sheer human will. If building a basic processor is this difficult, just imagine the scale of manufacturing ambition companies like TSMC have achieved.

AI infrastructure company TensorWave has revealed the deployment of a massive 8,192-GPU cluster powered by AMD's latest Instinct MI325X accelerators, claiming to be the largest AMD-based AI training installation in North America to date. The system also features direct liquid cooling, making it the first public deployment of its kind at this scale. Announced on X, the company showcased photos of the cluster's high-density racks with bright orange cooling loops, confirming the system is now fully operational.

The AMD Instinct MI325X, officially launched late last year, was the company's most aggressive attempt to challenge NVIDIA in the AI accelerator space—up until it was succeeded by MI350X and MI355X last month. Regardless, each MI325X unit features 256GB of HBM3e memory, enabling 6TB/s of bandwidth, along with 2.6 PFLOPS of FP8 compute, thanks to its chiplet design with 19,456 stream processors clocked up to 2.10GHz.

The GPU confidently stands its ground against Nvidia's H200 while being a lot cheaper, but you pay that cost elsewhere in the form of an 8-GPU cluster limitation compared to the Green Team's 72. That's one of the primary reasons it didn't quite take off and precisely what makes TensorWave's approach so interesting. Instead of trying to compete with scale per node, TensorWave focused on thermal headroom and density per rack. The entire cluster is built around a proprietary direct-to-chip liquid cooling loop, using bright orange (sometimes yellow?) tubing to circulate coolant through cold plates mounted directly on each MI325X.

At 1,000 watts per GPU, running even a fraction of this hardware takes serious engineering. Thankfully, there are no 16-pin power connectors in sight. Anyhow, a total of 8,192 GPUs will produce over 2 petabytes/s of aggregate memory bandwidth and an estimated 21 exaFLOPS of FP8 throughput, though, as always, sustained performance depends heavily on model parallelism (splitting the AI model across GPUs) and interconnect design. TensorWave's business model is cloud capacity for rent, so the real challenge of scaling models falls to the tenants themselves.



This installation follows TensorWave's $100 million Series A round from May, led by AMD Ventures and Magnetar. Unlike most cloud vendors that build primarily around NVIDIA hardware, TensorWave is going all-in on AMD, not just for pricing flexibility, but because they believe ROCm has matured enough for full-scale model training. Of course, NVIDIA still dominates the landscape. Its B100 and H200 accelerators are everywhere, from AWS to CoreWeave, and the entire AI boom seems to be held up by them, but this development shows positive signs for AMD's foothold in the AI sector.

As such, TensorWave's deployment isn't a one-off. According to the team, this is phase one of a much larger rollout, with plans to integrate AMD's MI350X later this year. That chip, based on CDNA 4, introduces FP4 and FP6 precision support, higher bandwidth ceilings, and more power-hungry designs that could push TDPs up to 1,400W per chip—something that couldn't be tamed by air alone, so TensorWave already seems to be on the right track. The ROCm stack still has work to do, but with 8,192 MI325X GPUs already humming away under liquid cooling, AMD finally has the scale to prove it belongs in the same conversation.

AWS is in prime position to power the AI revolution, rather than win it.

Rumors indicate Amazon is reportedly considering an additional investment in AI firm Anthropic, which would bring its total stake to over $8 billion, according to Reuters. This would cement Amazon as the company's largest investor and signal that it remains more interested in profiting from the explosive growth of the AI industry than directly competing within it.

Since the launch of several highly capable large language AI models in 2022, Amazon has been positioning itself as the prime resource to power the AI gold rush. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business is one of its most profitable components, earning close to $30 billion in Q1 2025 alone, providing data center hardware and software solutions all over the world.

That's exactly what AI developers need - compute power, storage, and the ability to scale (not to mention lots of power) - and Amazon is in a prime position to supply it. A larger stake in Anthropic would make it clear that Amazon wants to support and monetize AI's growth, not necessarily lead it from the front.

Meta is a clear example of what can happen to even deep-pocketed tech giants if they don't quite manage to keep up in this rapidly evolving space. It's trying to find a commercial avenue for its mix of customer-facing chatbots and open-source development tools, and not really nailing any of it.

OpenAI is taking on Google head-on with its consumer chatbots, alternative search engine functions, and browser ventures. In comparison, Amazon's approach is more measured.

It's building out infrastructure and laying the groundwork to expand into other portions of the burgeoning AI industry in the years to come. Its data centers already power a huge proportion of the world's cloud computing infrastructure, and those same servers will be able to power new AI models, too. It already has a whole pitch for those looking to invest.

This positions Amazon as more of a seller of shovels in this AI gold rush than a firm looking to dig in the dirt itself. It's closer to some of the companies Nvidia has been partnering with on its big "AI Factory" venture, where some of its contemporary tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Meta, and X (via xAI), are hoping to come out ahead as the best, if not the definitive choice, for consumer and professional AI solutions. While those companies want to create AI products, it appears that Amazon wishes to power them.

But that doesn't mean that Amazon has not been dipping its toes into the world of AI LLM development. Amazon's Nova-Experimental-Chat-05-14 AI model is placed at position 30 on Huggingface's LLM arena leaderboard, being beaten out by Google Gemini-2.0-Flash-Lite, DeepSeek-V3, and Anthropic's own Claude Sonnet 4 (20250514).

It's a far cry from the apex of the leaderboard, where titans such as Google Gemini-2.5-Pro, OpenAI's O3, and DeepSeek-R1 currently sit. But that doesn't mean it'll stay that way forever.

Although Amazon is rumored to be one of Nvidia's biggest GPU customers (alongside Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet/Google, and Tesla), it has been working on its own custom AI hardware for some time. It launched a pair of new processors to power portions of its AWS infrastructure in 2023, and made a veiled announcement of a super-powered version of its Trainium AI chips in mid-2024, with suggestions of future development plans beyond that.

Although it seems unlikely that even a giant like Amazon could supplant Nvidia's entrenched position in AI training, where its hardware GPUs and CUDA software stack make it a near-monopoly, there is decidedly more competition to be had in the inference space.

Although training takes huge superclusters of graphics cards and an enormously expensive investment in time and power, inference is far simpler, whilst still requiring lean, efficient hardware. Most importantly, inference requires scalability. That's something Amazon can offer in spades with its expansive AWS infrastructure.

As a smaller venture, Groq announced its new datacenter investment in Europe with custom ASIC hardware; there is plenty of space for new, leaner, faster, bespoke hardware in AI inference, especially when combined with fast and responsive deployment. Amazon could drive its hardware endeavours in that direction in the years to come.

It may even provide some of the base capabilities of next-generation AI agents and chatbots. It offers its own Nova foundational model to partners looking to further develop bespoke AI models. That allows Amazon to continue to develop the core capabilities of AI, without trying to craft the killer product that will survive in the hotly competitive world of consumer-facing applications.

It's not hard to imagine a near future where Amazon sells everything a company needs to develop AI tools: the hardware, the datacenter infrastructure, and the foundational models and APIs. Like a model kit for AI development.

That's not necessarily competition for Nvidia, but it's closer to that all-in-one AI platform vision its tech rivals are racing toward.

The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators.

California's statewide power grid operator is poised to become the first in North America to deploy artificial intelligence to manage outages, MIT Technology Review has learned. 

“We wanted to modernize our grid operations. This fits in perfectly with that,” says Gopakumar Gopinathan, a senior advisor on power system technologies at the California Independent System Operator—known as the CAISO and pronounced KAI-so. “AI is already transforming different industries. But we haven't seen many examples of it being used in our industry.” 

At the DTECH Midwest utility industry summit in Minneapolis on July 15, CAISO is set to announce a deal to run a pilot program using new AI software called Genie, from the energy-services giant OATI. The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators and comes with the potential to autonomously make decisions about key functions on the grid, a switch that might resemble going from uniformed traffic officers to sensor-equipped stoplights. 

But while CAISO may deliver electrons to cutting-edge Silicon Valley companies and laboratories, the actual task of managing the state's electrical system is surprisingly analog. 

Today, CAISO engineers scan outage reports for keywords about maintenance that's planned or in the works, read through the notes, and then load each item into the grid software system to run calculations on how a downed line or transformer might affect power supply.

“Even if it takes you less than a minute to scan one on average, when you amplify that over 200 or 300 outages, it adds up,” says Abhimanyu Thakur, OATI's vice president of platforms, visualization, and analytics. “Then different departments are doing it for their own respective keywords. Now we consolidate all of that into a single dictionary of keywords and AI can do this scan and generate a report proactively.” 

If CAISO finds that Genie produces reliable, more efficient data analyses for managing outages, Gopinathan says, the operator may consider automating more functions on the grid. “After a few rounds of testing, I think we'll have an idea about what is the right time to call it successful or not,” he says. 

In Nebraska, a publicly owned utility deftly tackles the challenges of delivering on reliability, affordability, and sustainability.

Regardless of the outcome, the experiment marks a significant shift. Most grid operators are using the same systems that utilities have used “for decades,” says Richard Doying, who spent more than 20 years as a top executive at the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, the grid operator for an area encompassing 15 states from the upper Midwest down to Louisiana. 

“These organizations are carved up for people working on very specific, specialized tasks and using their own proprietary tools that they've developed over time,” says Doying, now a vice president at the consultancy Grid Strategies. “To the extent that some of these new AI tools are able to draw from data across different areas of an organization and conduct more sophisticated analysis, that's only helpful for grid operators.”

Last year, a Department of Energy report found that AI had potential to speed up studies on grid capacity and transmission, improve weather forecasting to help predict how much energy wind and solar plants would produce at a given time, and optimize planning for electric-vehicle charging networks. Another report by the energy department's Loan Programs Office concluded that adding more “advanced” technology such as sensors to various pieces of equipment will generate data that can enable AI to do much more over time. 

In April, the PJM Interconnection—the nation's largest grid system, spanning 13 states along the densely populated mid-Atlantic and Eastern Seaboard—took a big step toward embracing AI by inking a deal with Google to use its Tapestry software to improve regional planning and speed up grid connections for new power generators. 

ERCOT, the Texas grid system, is considering adopting technology similar to what CAISO is now set to use, according to a source with knowledge of the plans who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. ERCOT did not respond to a request for comment. 

Australia offers an example of what the future may look like. In New South Wales, where grid sensors and smart technology are more widely deployed, AI software rolled out in February is now predicting the production and flow of electricity from rooftop solar units across the state and automatically adjusting how much power from those panels can enter the grid. 

Until now, much of the discussion around AI and energy has focused on the electricity demands of AI data centers (check out MIT Technology Review's Power Hungry series for more on this).

“We've been talking a lot about what the grid can do for AI and not nearly as much about what AI can do for the grid,” says Charles Hua, a coauthor of one of last year's Energy Department reports who now serves executive director of PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for improving the affordability and reliability of US grids. “In general, there's a huge opportunity for grid operators, regulators, and other stakeholders in the utility regulatory system to use AI effectively and harness it for a more resilient, modernized, and strengthened grid.” 

For now, Gopinathan says, he's remaining cautiously optimistic. 

“I don't want to overhype it,” he says. 

Still, he adds, “it's a first step for bigger automation.”

“Right now, this is more limited to our outage management system. Genie isn't talking to our other parts yet,” he says. “But I see a world where AI agents are able to do a lot more.” 

The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next.

The AI race is transforming northwestern Nevada into one of the world's largest data-center markets—and sparking fears of water strains in the nation's driest state.

The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Meanwhile, company emissions are up 50% since 2019.

Tech giants are looking for more energy, but building new reactors takes time.

Ice is a key component in the universe. There are frozen water molecules on comets, moons, exoplanets, and in your drink as you cool off from the summer heat. However, under the microscope, not all ice is the same, even though it is made of the same components.

The internal structure of Earth's ice is a cosmological oddity. Its molecules are arranged in geometric structures, usually hexagons that repeat each other. Ice on Earth forms this way due to the temperature and pressure of the our planet: water here freezes slowly, and this allows its molecules to arrange themselves into crystals.

But ice that forms in space is different because of the conditions—the water exists in a vacuum and is subject to extreme temperatures. Space ice, as a result, is believed to be amorphous, lacking a distinct organizational structure like on Earth.

An illustration of the ordered molecular structure of water ice on Earth.

This presents a challenge for scientists trying to understand the formation of planets and the generation of life. Not fully understanding the dynamics of amorphous ice in space has knock-on effects. For instance, not knowing exactly how space water freezes makes it difficult to estimate the proportion of water in other solar systems.

Researchers are therefore studying space ice to gain a better understanding of how frozen water behaves away from Earth. Ice samples from comets, asteroids, and other solar system debris would be helpful, but until these can be captured, scientists are trying to understand space ice with computer models and simulations of ice on Earth. The more they study it, the more surprises it reveals.

A recent report, published in the journal Physical Review B, posits that the amorphous ice that abounds in the universe does have some kind of order. The paper theorizes it is likely made up of structured fragments—crystallized regions, as on Earth, but only about 3 nanometers wide—surrounded by chaos.

A simulation of space ice. The white fragments are ordered molecules in crystalline structures while the blue parts are disordered molecules.

To reach this conclusion, the team first ran computer models of water molecules subjected to temperature changes at different rates, simulating the creation of ice in space. They then compared this with the results of lab experiments to produce actual amorphous ice. Water vapor was passed over an extremely cold slab to become ice, with no liquid state occurring in between, a process similar to what happens in a planetary system at birth. A partially amorphous material was produced, whose structure most closely matched a simulation from the models that comprised 20 percent crystalline material and 80 percent amorphous ice.

“We now have a good idea of what the most common form of ice in the universe looks like at the atomic level,” said Michael B. Davies, part of the ICE Group at the University of Cambridge and a coauthor of the study, in a statement.

Knowing the structure of space ice is important for interrogating the speculative idea of panspermia, a hypothesis that life on Earth originated through compounds or “seeds” of life arriving on our planet from space. If space ice is amorphous and of low density, then building blocks for life could potentially have been carried inside. If, instead, there are lots of crystalline parts, then there is less likelihood (because of less space) of this having occurred.

Researchers at Karolinska Institutet have identified over 250 proteins that are strongly affected by malaria, which could help predict the severity of the disease and thus enable faster treatment for the most critical patients.

The study, published in the journal Immunity, was conducted on 72 adult travellers diagnosed with malaria at Karolinska University Hospital after returning from tropical regions.

By analysing blood samples from these individuals, who were followed for a year, the researchers were able to identify around 700 proteins that changed during the infection, of which over 250 were strongly affected. In this way, the researchers were able to map proteins in the blood, which made it possible, among other things, to group patients according to the severity of the disease.

"Malaria can quickly become life-threatening, but it is difficult to predict at an early stage which patients are at risk of deterioration. Our results show how a set of proteins can help identify high-risk patients more quickly and enable more effective treatment," says Anna Färnert, professor at the Department of Medicine, Solna, Karolinska Institutet, and senior physician at Karolinska University Hospital, who led the study together with Christopher Sundling at the same institution.

Through data-driven analysis, the researchers were able to link the proteins to specific immune cells and identify the organs from which the proteins originate.

In this study, we have been able to measure such a large number of proteins with high precision in the blood of malaria patients for the first time. This provides completely new and detailed insights into the immune system's response to the infection."

The researchers emphasize that further studies are needed to validate these findings in larger patient groups and to explore the potential clinical applications of the protein signatures.

COMMENTARY

Maurie Markman, MD

DISCLOSURES |  July 14, 2025  



This transcript has been edited for clarity. 

Hello. I'm Dr Maurie Markman, from City of Hope. I'd like to discuss what I consider to be an absolutely fascinating paper, and one that I will say has very interesting results but raises many more questions than it answers. I think that was the intent of the authors.

The paper is entitled, “Addition of metastasis-directed therapy to systemic therapy for oligometastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (EXTEND): a multicenter, randomized phase 2 trial,” published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. 

You might ask what metastasis-directed therapy in pancreatic cancer means. Have we really made much of an impact on pancreatic cancer? In fact, in my earlier years of training, if somebody came up with the idea, or suggested as part of a trial or treatment of an individual patient, that they would focus on metastases in pancreas cancer, you might say they're crazy, or you might say: “Yeah, but they probably don't know anything about the disease and its natural history.” 

Now, fast forward several decades. Even with the recognized, modest advances in systemic therapy, what we see are tremendous, really remarkable advances in innovations in radiation therapy. Of course, this includes not only the use of radiation itself but also the imaging technology that is used to direct the radiation therapy. These advances have permitted asking the questions that are addressed in the current study. 

Again, this study is fascinating. They randomized a very small number. Again, it's a randomized phase 2 study. It's really more of a proof of principle here. They randomized 41 patients with five or fewer metastatic lesions — with oligometastatic disease, they could have numerous lesions — to undergo what they've described as comprehensive metastases-directed therapy. 

Most of this was external beam radiation therapy and stereotactic radiation therapy, but there were some localized radiation implants as well, plus chemotherapy. This was comprehensive metastases-directed therapy to each of these sites plus chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone. 

What was shown in this trial? The progression-free survival (PFS) in the metastases-directed therapy group was 10.3 months vs 2.5 months in the group of patients who received chemotherapy only, with a hazard ratio of 0.43 and statistical significance.

Remember, this was a very small study, but we see more than a tripling in the PFS. There was no difference in overall survival, which is not at all surprising because it was a very small sample size. 

Very importantly — and essential to doing this trial ethically — a crossover was permitted at the time of progression, meaning that if a patient received chemotherapy only and progressed, they could potentially get stereotactic radiation to sites of metastatic disease. They might have also benefited from that kind of strategy to the metastasis-[therapy] so that overall survival in the small population may not be different. Again, there was a tripling of the time to disease progression.

Clearly, a larger study will be required to be more definitive. We would need more centers involved and maybe some modification in the study design in this trial because of any issues that the investigators may have identified. Of course, overall survival would be a fair endpoint to look at, but again, crossover would be essential, and that might influence an ultimate outcome.PFS is a very valid endpoint. 

The only other point to mention is, with these results — and as I mentioned, advances in radiation and imaging — is it reasonable to potentially consider this type of approach for individual patients as a component of aggressive standard of care? Of course, this would be with very adequate informed consent from patients, because we don't know what the impact will be. 

With the limited morbidity associated with the radiation, for an individual patient with pancreatic cancer who has an adequate performance status and limited metastases, if we give them chemotherapy and also directed radiation, is it reasonable to consider that as an appropriate treatment option outside the setting of a clinical trial?

I think this is a very valid question that needs to be addressed. In my opinion, the answer in some settings should be yes, but that needs to be discussed much more widely than simply in this randomized phase 2 trial. 

Thank you for your attention.

Did the COVID-19 pandemic affect obesity rates in Canada? A new study in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal) https://www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.241421 found obesity rates based on body mass index (BMI) increased faster in the 4 years after the start of the pandemic than in the previous 11 years, especially in younger adults.

"Compared with the average increase during the 11 years before the pandemic, the prevalence of obesity [as measured by BMI] increased at a greater rate during the 4 years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2023), suggesting that the COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health restrictions may have adversely affected obesity prevalence in Canada," writes Dr. Laura Anderson, associate professor, Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact and co-director of the Centre for Health Economics and Policy Analysis (CHEPA), McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, with coauthors.

Obesity is a risk factor for a range of diseases and can negatively affect a person's health and well-being as well as increase the burden on the health care system. Rates in Canada were increasing before the pandemic, with higher rates of more severe obesity.

The large study, which included data on 746 250 adults aged 18 and older, looked at trends in BMI over 15 years, from January 2009 to March 2020 and from April 2020 to December 2023. Researchers found that BMI-defined obesity rates increased from 25% in 2009 to 33% in 2022, an absolute increase of about 8%. After the pandemic started, obesity increased by just over 1 percentage point a year, about twice the pre-pandemic rate of increase. As well, obesity rates in males and females narrowed, with a 9% increase in obesity in females compared with a 7% increase in males. Obesity rates were highest in people who were White or Black.

"We observed important subgroup differences, with several groups that had a lower historical prevalence of obesity showing a substantial increase during the pandemic, including females and young adults. This raises concerns about potential adverse long-term consequences," write the authors.

The authors observed a small increase in underweight adults during the study period and note that being underweight can have negative health effects. They caution that efforts to address rising rates of obesity should consider unintended effects of weight control messaging on people with eating disorders.

Investment in research and approaches to obesity prevention and treatment are needed and should be a priority for funders and policy-makers.

The research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

A new AI tool reads lung cancer biopsy slides in under an hour, accurately predicting mutations and saving patients delays, costs and tissue loss, marking a turning point in precision cancer care.

A recent Nature Medicine study compiled a large international clinical dataset of digital lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) slides to facilitate the development of a computational epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) biomarker.

LUAD is the most prevalent form of lung cancer, with EGFR being the most common somatic mutation in kinase genes. Accurate EGFR testing is crucial to ensure patients receive the correct first-line therapy. EGFR testing is done for patients with advanced-stage LUAD; otherwise, molecular testing in lung cancer is the standard line of investigation. EGFR testing is significantly below the level determined by clearly published guidelines. There could be many reasons, including technical hurdles in obtaining and processing samples for testing and insufficient material from diagnostic biopsies.

Computational methods to detect EGFR mutations can significantly improve the clinical workflow for lung cancer diagnostic biopsies. Only the digitized pathology slides from the diagnostic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) biopsy would be used as a substrate, enabling the result to be reported with no physical processing and little cost. The immediate production of results should also allow for informing all other downstream decisions.

This study developed the EAGLE (EGFR AI Genomic Lung Evaluation) and showcased its clinical usefulness as an H&E-based computational biomarker. The goal was to enhance the standard molecular workflow by using the diagnostic biopsies of LUAD patients to predict the EGFR mutational status. Unlike the traditional workflow, AI-assisted screening often precludes rapid testing. This was done while maintaining overall high screening performance. Next-generation sequencing (NGS)- based testing was still required for samples that were screened positive.

A large international clinical dataset of digital lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) slides was compiled to train the algorithm in line with the broad biological and technical variability expected from real clinical deployment. A total of 5,174 slides from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) were used to fine-tune a state-of-the-art pathology foundation model. Model validation was done using 1,742 internal slides from MSKCC and on external test cohorts to ensure robustness.

These included institutions in the United States and Europe and spanned multiple slide scanners, demonstrating the model's generalizability across institutions and multiple scanners. A silent trial was conducted by deploying EAGLE in real time to simulate its performance in a real-world setting.

EAGLE performed at the expected level on novel cases and was deemed suitable for clinical implementation. The results of the EGFR rapid test were compared with the results of the Idylla test. Idylla showed a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.988, sensitivity of 0.918, specificity of 0.993, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.954 in the period analyzed. The model achieved an area under the curve value (AUC) of 0.847. The performance was less accurate in metastatic specimens (AUC 0.75) compared to primary samples (AUC 0.90).

Using tissue amount as a proxy for tumor amount, the surface area was calculated based on the tiles used for model inference. A general trend was noted, whereby the model performance was enhanced as the area of the analyzed tissue increased. Further tests revealed that the model was able to detect all of the clinically relevant EGFR mutations, thereby highlighting the robustness of EAGLE across variants. The model's performance on external cohorts was also in line with the internal validation and showed an AUC of 0.870.

A silent trial was run at MSKCC to test real-world applicability. As in the previous case, the model performance was lower in metastatic specimens (AUC 0.760), compared to primary samples (AUC 0.896). Lymph nodes (AUC 0.74) and bones (AUC 0.71) performed particularly poorly. The overall AUC was comparable to previous results at 0.853. These results further supported the deployment of EAGLE for primary samples. The artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted workflow could lead to a lower number of samples being rapidly tested, based on the output of EAGLE.

Three threshold strategies were explored in the trial to determine how many rapid tests could be spared while maintaining performance comparable to traditional workflows. Depending on the chosen threshold, the AI-assisted workflow reduced rapid tests by 18% to 43% while preserving high NPV and PPV values.
The turnaround time for EAGLE was also a key advantage, delivering results in a median of just 44 minutes, significantly faster than the minimum 48 hours needed for rapid testing and several weeks for NGS.

The real-world setting silent trial was important as it helped researchers understand how the newly devised protocol performed, including possible sources of false negative and false positive results. By examining attention heatmaps overlaid on tissue slides, the team identified that false positives often involved biologically related mutations like ERBB2 insertions or MET exon 14 skipping events. False negatives tended to occur in samples with minimal tumor architecture, such as cytology specimens or blood-heavy biopsies.

It was hypothesized that the error rate could be lowered significantly if pathologists manually interpreted the results. The EAGLE is not intended to replace NGS sequencing but is only a screening test. EAGLE is meant to identify likely positive cases and efficiently rule out EGFR mutations. Because EAGLE does not distinguish between EGFR subtypes that require different targeted therapies, NGS confirmation is still necessary before treatment selection.

This study presented a validated computational pathology model for detecting EGFR mutation in LUAD. The model can reduce tissue consumption, improve diagnostic efficiency, and accelerate AI adoption in clinical practice. EAGLE achieved its performance by fine-tuning a vision transformer-based foundation model, highlighting a shift toward more generalizable AI tools in pathology. Future research should consider additional biomarkers and study them in a prospective clinical trial.

A recent review by researchers at Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine (PCOM) shows Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) and SARS-CoV-2 infections may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

Published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, the review highlights that both infections increase levels of substances in the brain called cytokines, especially IL-6 and CCL2, which cause inflammation. This ongoing inflammation can harm brain cells and may help speed up the buildup of harmful proteins linked to Alzheimer's.

The review shows that Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 can invade the central nervous system through both the blood brain barrier and potentially more importantly the olfactory route, which is responsible for our sense of smell. The olfactory system is lined with a specialized neuroepithelium that can serve as an entry point for pathogens to the brain. After initial infection, these microbes can travel along the olfactory nerves, ultimately reaching the brain's olfactory bulbs, which are linked to areas of the brain for memory and cognition. This pathway is particularly relevant given that loss of smell is an early symptom in both COVID-19 and Alzheimer's disease.

The research examined peer-reviewed studies on the associations of Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 with Alzheimer's, coupled with a special consideration for genetic risk factors such as APOEε4, biomarkers (IL-6, CCL2, NRP1), and the structural and functional aspects of infection and neuroinflammation. PCOM researchers documented that individuals carrying this gene variant appear to be more susceptible to both Cpn and SARS-CoV-2 infections, potentially amplifying their risk for developing the disease.

“These findings bring us one step closer to understanding the complex interactions between infections and Alzheimer's disease,” said PCOM's Brian J. Balin, PhD, a professor of Neuroscience and Neuropathology and director of the Center for Chronic Disorders of Aging (CCDA), who co-authored the report. “As we continue to learn more about the role infectious agents play in the development of this disease, we hope to create new avenues for prevention and treatment.”

Balin and his team have dedicated over two decades working under the hypothesis that infectious agents could be a trigger for the process that causes the accumulation of amyloid and tau build-up, which are key indicators of Alzheimer's disease. Most recently, he helped establish PCOM's Pathobiome Research Center to further examine the connections between infectious processes and other chronic disorders in addition to Alzheimer's disease.

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals in early life, including during gestation and infancy, results in a higher preference for sugary and fatty foods later in life, according to an animal study being presented Sunday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are substances in the environment (air, soil or water supply), food sources, personal care products and manufactured products that interfere with the normal function of the body's endocrine system. To determine if early-life exposure to these chemicals affects eating behaviors and preferences, researchers from the University of Texas at Austin conducted a study of 15 male and 15 female rats exposed to a common mixture of these chemicals during gestation or infancy.

Our research indicates that endocrine-disrupting chemicals can physically alter the brain's pathways that control reward preference and eating behavior. These results may partially explain increasing rates of obesity around the world. Understanding the harmful health impact that exposure to these types of chemicals can have on eating patterns may help inform public health recommendations and personal efforts to improve diet-related health complications."

Emily N. Hilz, Ph.D., postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Texas at Austin in Austin, Texas

Researchers administered behavioral studies throughout the rats' lifespans, including into adulthood, to observe preferences for high-fat foods and a sucrose solution. Findings showed that male rats with early-life exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals had a temporary preference for the sucrose solution, while female rats showed a strong preference for high-fat food that resulted in weight gain. In addition, testosterone was reduced in exposed males, while estradiol in females remained unchanged.

During the study, areas of the brain were sequenced to determine if early-life exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals resulted in physical changes to the regions important to controlling food intake and responding to reward. Researchers observed changes to gene expression throughout all areas sequenced in male rat brains, and varying changes to gene expression in the region of female rat brains associated with reward. These physical changes were predictive of changes to eating behavior and food preferences.

"It's important that people understand that there are negative impacts associated with consuming or being near endocrine-disrupting chemicals early in life. With this knowledge in hand, consumers may want to consider reducing personal interaction with environments, food and other types of products containing these chemicals during pregnancy and early childhood to reduce the risk of developing obesity later in life," Hilz added.

This research was supported by the National Institute of Health's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

A novel artificial intelligence (AI) application capable of diagnosing endocrine cancers with speed and accuracy is being presented Sunday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

The research, presented by Jansi Rani Sethuraj, B.S.N., R.N., C.C.R.N., from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, introduces a universally accessible and computationally efficient AI application. This AI application aims to democratize expert-level cancer diagnostics, making them available on basic internet-connected devices, including smartphones.

Endocrine cancers, affecting organs such as the thyroid, ovary, pancreas, pituitary, and adrenal glands, pose unique challenges due to their complex hormonal effects and difficult diagnostic profiles. With an estimated 10 million cancer-related deaths each year, the need for innovative, scalable diagnostic solutions is imminent. This new AI-powered tool leverages advanced deep learning architectures, such as EfficientNet and ResNet, to analyze diverse medical data, including computerized tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasonography (USG), and histopathology images, enabling comprehensive and accurate cancer detection.

According to Sethuraj, the AI models demonstrated exceptional diagnostic accuracy, reportedly exceeding 99% in certain validation datasets across multiple endocrine cancer types. These results align with recent studies showing AI can achieve high accuracy in endocrine tumor classification, though real-world performance may vary.

Two researchers, Ramya Elangovan and Kavin Elangovan of AIM Doctor in Houston, Texas, curated anonymized endocrine cancer image datasets representing diverse populations spanning six continents. These images were used to train and validate deep learning models capable of detecting and staging multiple endocrine cancers with very high accuracy. The application's reliability and usability were independently evaluated by healthcare professionals from multiple international institutions, highlighting its potential for global applicability. The application's streamlined design enables rapid image analysis, processing each image in under one second, even on devices with limited computational resources.

By enabling clinicians and primary care providers to access expert-level diagnostic support anywhere, this technology has the potential to reduce diagnostic errors, accelerate treatment decisions, and improve patient outcomes globally, especially in resource-limited settings.

"By democratizing access to advanced diagnostics, this AI innovation marks a paradigm shift in cancer care, offering hope for earlier detection, more precise treatment, and better survival for patients facing endocrine malignancies," said the chief mentor of this project, Elangovan Krishnan, M.B., B.S., P.G.D.H.M., M.Tech., M.S., Ph.D., of AIM Doctor. "This AI-powered application can deliver fast, reliable, and affordable endocrine cancer diagnostics to anyone, anywhere, thereby helping to close gaps in cancer care and advance health equity worldwide."

Cancer deaths linked to obesity have tripled in the United States over the past two decades, according to a study being presented Sunday at ENDO 2025, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in San Francisco, Calif.

The study, which examined more than 33,000 deaths from obesity-associated cancers, revealed sharp increases in cancer deaths, especially among women, older adults, Native Americans and Black Americans.

Obesity is a significant risk factor for multiple cancers, contributing to significant mortality. This research underscores the need for targeted public health strategies such as early screening and improved access to care, especially in high-risk rural and underserved areas."

Faizan Ahmed, M.D., lead researcher of Hackensack Meridian Jersey Shore University Medical Center in Neptune City, N.J.

Obesity is a common condition. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 40.3% of adults have obesity. Obesity is a complex disease resulting from multiple genetic, physiological, hormonal, environmental and developmental factors.

In addition to certain types of cancer, obesity raises the risk of developing serious chronic conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and chronic and end-stage kidney disease.

Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing 13 types of cancer, according to the CDC. These cancers make up 40% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States each year.

They are:

Faizan used mortality data from the CDC to analyze 33,572 U.S. deaths from obesity-associated cancers between 1999 and 2020. He found age-adjusted mortality rates increased from 3.73 to 13.52 per million over two decades, with steep increases among women, older adults, Black people, Native Americans and rural populations.

Regionally, the Midwest had the highest rate of obesity-related cancer deaths, while the Northeast had the lowest. State-level analysis revealed that Vermont, Minnesota and Oklahoma had the highest rates, while Utah, Alabama and Virginia had the lowest.

Tiny plastic fragments are turning up in milk and cheese, raising urgent questions about how our favorite dairy products travel from farm to fridge, and what we're really eating.

Study: Assessing microplastic contamination in milk and dairy products. Image Credit: JGLmarket / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal npj Science of Food, a group of researchers quantified and characterized microplastic (MP) contamination in milk, fresh cheese, and ripened cheese sold in Italian supermarkets.

What if your morning latte came sprinkled with tiny plastic flakes that slip past the tongue? Scientists estimate that people ingest tens of thousands of such fragments yearly, according to recent reviews, yet dairy, a staple for millions, remains understudied.

Plastics line feed bags, milking tubes, cheese molds, and retail wraps, offering countless entry points for debris smaller than 5 millimeters. While seafood and bottled water dominate MP headlines, dairy products also travel equipment-dense routes before reaching consumers.

Identifying when and where fragments accumulate could help redesign processing lines, select safer polymers, and guide smarter packaging policy. Larger, long-term investigations are still needed to pinpoint the riskiest steps and craft effective industry standards.

Twenty distinct plastic types infiltrated dairy products, including unexpected polymers like polyacrylate (found in paints/adhesives) and silicone (common in seals and gaskets), revealing contamination from diverse industrial sources.

Investigators bought 28 commercial dairy items, such as 4 cartons of ultra-high-temperature (UHT) milk, 10 fresh cheeses aged less than 1 month, and 14 ripened cheeses matured for more than 4 months, from major northern-Italian retailers.

Products arrived on ice at the European Center for the Sustainable Impact of Nanotechnology (ECSIN) and were stored at –20°C until analysis. After thawing, 100 mL of milk or 10 g of quartered cheese underwent sequential enzymatic and alkaline digestion to dissolve organic matter.

Samples received trypsin solution, potassium hydroxide, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in a temperature-controlled shaker, then were vacuum-filtered through 3 μm silver membranes.

Dense particles were separated by triple flotation in saturated sodium chloride (NaCl), refiltered, and oven-dried. Each membrane was scanned with micro Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (μ-FTIR-ATR); spectra matching at least 80% confirmed polymer identity.

All work took place inside an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) class 7 cleanroom equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration. Procedural blanks never exceeded 10 fragments, and spiked-water recoveries averaged 84%, supporting analytical reliability.

Particles as small as 24 micrometers – thinner than a human hair – slipped into samples, highlighting the challenge of detecting the tiniest plastic fragments lurking in food.

MP appeared in 26 of 28 samples, demonstrating that dairy consumers ingest plastic before food even leaves the refrigerator. Across all items, scientists counted 266 particles spanning 20 polymer types. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) led detections, present in 19 samples, followed by polyethylene in 15 and polypropylene in 12.

Concentrations mirrored processing intensity: ripened cheese averaged 1,857 MP/kg, fresh cheese 1,280 MP/kg, and milk 350 MP/kg, with least-square means differing significantly at P < 0.05. These values echo earlier reports that high-fat, highly processed dairy products such as butter and milk powder harbor the greatest MP loads.

Fragments dominated particle shape, accounting for 77% of observations, whereas fibers comprised 22% and beads less than 1%. Such irregular shards likely arise from friction inside pumps and shredders or abrasion of plastic films.

Size skewed small: one-third measured 51-100 μm, and 20% fell below 50 μm. Smaller dimensions matter because tiny plastics can traverse intestinal barriers more readily than visible debris, which raises toxicological concerns but was not specifically addressed in this study.

Images and Fourier-transformed infrared micro-spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode analysis (μ-FTIR-ATR) spectra of three identified MP with different shapes and colors: A polypropylene, B poly(ethylene terephthalate), and C polyethylene (black line for MP spectra from dairy products, red line for MP spectra from reference libraries).

Color analysis offered origin clues: gray particles (68%) were common in polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride, polymers widely used in gaskets, conveyor belts, and stretch wrap. Transparent fragments, limited to poly(ethylene terephthalate), pointed to bottle-grade plastics, while blue and red flecks suggested food-contact gloves or line markings.

Beyond common plastics, unusual suspects like polyvinylidene fluoride (a specialty plastic) and polyoxymethylene (used in gears) popped up occasionally, suggesting potential contamination from very specific equipment parts.

Statistical dispersion, expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV), differed by polymer. Silicone showed the widest spread (CV ≈ 127%), hinting at sporadic equipment failures, whereas polyacrylate and polyvinyl chloride were more uniformly present (CV ≈ 35-38%). The consistent detection of polyacrylate underscores the need to examine recurring process aids such as cheese-coating resins.

Comparing matrices highlighted cheese-making's concentrating effect. During curd formation, whey removal reduces mass yet traps solids, including MP. Extended aging intensifies this by evaporating moisture, explaining why ripened cheese contained five times more particles than milk.

The pattern matches studies showing that purified powders and shelf-stable spreads are MP-dense; lengthy contact with plastic molds, aging racks, and barrier wraps appears to be a critical pathway. Together, the data reveal a progressive accumulation of MP along the dairy chain, from farm tubing to supermarket shelf.

Cheese preparation itself could be a contamination risk point: The study meticulously described "quartering" cheese samples (repeatedly cutting and recombining) to get a representative piece, acknowledging this handling step requires extreme care to avoid adding plastic bits during analysis.

To summarize, MP contamination is embedded in everyday dairy products and escalates with each processing and packaging step. Ripened cheeses, celebrated for complex flavor, also concentrate the highest MP loads, many small enough to bypass gastrointestinal defenses.

Findings highlight the urgency of auditing every link in the dairy supply chain, replacing abrasion-prone polymers, bolstering clean-room standards, and developing and testing biodegradable alternatives.

Until such interventions mature, informed consumers, vigilant regulators, and proactive manufacturers share responsibility for reducing invisible plastics that journey from production line to breakfast table, safeguarding both public health and the integrity of a global food staple.

A major review finds that diets high in ultra-processed foods may rewire the developing brain, amplifying risks for ADHD, depression, and even dementia, spotlighting the urgent need to rethink what children and expectant mothers eat.

Review: The consequences of ultra-processed foods on brain development during prenatal, adolescent and adult stages. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock

In a recent review article published in the journal Frontiers in Public Health, researchers in Switzerland examined the impacts of consuming ultra-processed foods (UPFs) on brain function and development during the critical periods of childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy.

Their conclusions raise concerns that exposure to UPFs during early life could impair cognitive development and increase risks to long-term mental health, including neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and ASD, and later-life risks such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. The review also describes habitual overconsumption and reward dysfunction related to UPF-driven changes in brain reward circuitry, though it does not explicitly characterize these as “addiction-like eating behaviours.” This highlights the urgent need for public health strategies targeting maternal and child nutrition.

The soft textures of UPFs actually trick the brain: They're designed to be eaten quickly, reducing exposure to oral sensors that signal fullness. This hidden feature directly promotes overeating before your body registers satisfaction.

UPFs, which are energy-dense products high in unhealthy fats, salt, and sugar, have become a major part of modern diets and are increasingly being linked to mental disorders, metabolic disease, and obesity.

While effects on adults are well-documented, the impact of UPFs on brain development during vulnerable life stages, such as early childhood, adolescence, and pregnancy, is less understood.

The development and spread of convenience foods began in the mid-20th century, with products like frozen dinners and the introduction of microwaves boosting their popularity.

By the 1980s, concerns over health impacts began to grow, and in 2009, the NOVA classification system formally defined UPFs, distinguishing them from minimally processed and whole foods.

UPFs are designed for palatability, affordability, and long shelf life, but are nutritionally poor and often contain additives and harmful byproducts from processing and packaging. The NOVA system groups foods into four categories based on processing levels, with UPFs being the most altered and least nutritious.

UPFs now account for more than half of dietary energy intake in many developed nations, with consumption also rising in middle-income countries.

Of particular concern is the increasing intake among children and adolescents, a population highly susceptible to nutritional deficiencies. This trend could have profound effects on brain development and mental health, as well as exacerbate sensory-driven selective eating behaviours (such as those seen in ARFID), a selective eating disorder that the review discusses in the context of UPFs' uniform texture and sensory properties but does not causally link to UPF consumption. Such effects may reinforce a cycle of poor health outcomes across generations.

Given the complexity of brain maturation and the role of nutrition in shaping outcomes throughout one's life, understanding the impacts of UPFs on neurodevelopment is crucial.

The lifelong and intergenerational impact of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) on health and neurodevelopment. This figure illustrates the profound and cumulative effects of UPF consumption across different life stages, prenatal period, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age, highlighting their role in a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and cognitive disorders. The interconnected arrows emphasize how exposure to UPFs in one stage can amplify health risks in later stages, creating a continuous and reinforcing cycle of adverse health outcomes.

Tiny invaders from your snack pack? Certain nanoparticles (like titanium dioxide, common in processed foods) sneak past the brain's defenses, piling up inside neurons and glial cells where they can disrupt learning and memory pathways.

Large-scale studies consistently tie UPFs to weight gain and obesity across age groups. Diets rich in UPFs also elevate risks of certain cancers, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

During pregnancy, high UPF intake predicts pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and poorer neonatal outcomes such as congenital heart defects and pre-term births.

Beyond these disorders, UPFs displace nutrient-dense foods, producing micronutrient deficits that are especially harmful during rapid growth and neural maturation. Emerging evidence further links heavy UPF consumption to hyperactivity, inattention, depression, and anxiety, with potential for cumulative, lifelong neurocognitive harm.

The review notes that deficiencies in specific nutrients, such as iron and zinc, associated with high UPF intake, may impair neurodevelopmental processes and cognitive functions in offspring. Animal evidence is also discussed, such as findings that trans-fat intake during pregnancy can induce hippocampal inflammation and memory deficits in offspring.

UPFs thrive where food skills, budgets, and time are limited. Lower-income, single-parent or dual-working households lean on cheap, ready-to-eat products, while school meal programmes often reinforce these habits, as UPFs provide 65% or more of lunchtime calories in many UK schools.

Urbanization, frequent snacking, dining out, poor sleep, and persuasive marketing magnify exposure. Adolescents are the heaviest consumers, although intake falls with age. Cultural context matters, with Japan's education-focused school lunches showing that policy can curb reliance on UPFs.

Eating is regulated by intertwined homeostatic (energy need) and hedonic (reward seeking) systems. Dopaminergic pathways from the ventral tegmental area to the striatum and prefrontal cortex drive the powerful reward response evoked by palatable UPFs, often overriding satiety signals. The review discusses how repeated UPF exposure can hypersensitize reward circuits and reinforce habitual or compulsive consumption, using terms such as "reward dysfunction" and "habitual overconsumption" rather than "addiction-like behaviours."

Key hubs include the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, and insular cortex, all integrating metabolic cues, memories, and emotions to shape food choice. Disruption of these circuits is implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and binge eating behaviours.

The third trimester and early childhood are highly plastic phases; inadequate maternal or infant nutrition can permanently alter synaptogenesis and myelination. Adolescence represents a second vulnerable window: the prefrontal cortex and mesolimbic dopamine system are still maturing, heightening sensitivity to rewarding foods and emotional stress.

Repeated UPF exposure during these periods strengthens hedonic pathways and weakens inhibitory control.

Bisphenols aren't just about bottles: Found leaching from UPF packaging, these chemicals cross the placenta and meddle with genes crucial for setting up a baby's dopamine and serotonin systems, potentially wiring the brain for future anxiety or hyperactivity.

UPF availability, aggressive advertising, and screen time create an obesogenic environment that cements taste preferences for energy-dense, sweet, and salty foods. Early life UPF consumption predicts chronic inflammation, persistent obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and a greater risk of mental health disorders into adulthood. The review also notes that the prevalence of ARFID and other eating disorders may be exacerbated by UPFs' sensory properties, but does not present a direct causal link.

Curbing UPF intake in mothers, children, and adolescents is therefore vital to break the intergenerational cycle of diet-related disease.

Maternal consumption of UPFs during pregnancy can negatively affect fetal brain development during the critical gestational window of 24–42 weeks. UPFs may disrupt key neurodevelopmental processes like synapse formation, myelination, and neurotransmitter signaling, primarily through inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic changes, and gut microbiome alterations.

Deficiencies in nutrients like long-chain fatty acids, zinc, iron, and protein due to high UPF intake may impair emotional regulation, memory, and cognition in children. These impacts can be long-lasting and may also increase the risk for neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD and ASD. Some UPF components, including nanoparticles and additives, may further harm the developing brain. For example, nanoparticles such as titanium dioxide and certain additives can cross the blood–brain barrier, potentially impairing memory and learning, while exposure to bisphenols may disrupt dopamine and serotonin signaling in the developing brain.

The review further emphasizes the role of the gut–brain axis as a mechanistic link between UPF intake and brain health, highlighting how UPF-induced alterations in the gut microbiome may impair the synthesis of neurotransmitters like serotonin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), both critical for cognitive development and mood regulation.

Teen brains are primed for UPF hijacking: During adolescence, the brain's reward center (striatum) fires up faster than the frontal control regions. This natural imbalance makes teens extra vulnerable to UPFs' hyper-rewarding signals, cementing hard-to-break eating habits.

Cumulative exposure to UPFs from fetal life through adulthood is now clearly associated with a wide range of neurocognitive consequences, from early executive dysfunction to increased dementia risk later in life.

The mechanisms include altered brain reward signaling, gut–brain axis disruption, and inflammation-driven neural changes. Because these effects begin early and build over time, preventive action during pregnancy and childhood offers the greatest potential benefit.

The authors call for public health policy levers—such as reducing UPF availability, mandating unambiguous front-of-pack food labelling, and stimulating product reformulation—as well as prioritizing longitudinal neuroimaging research to confirm causality and pinpoint sensitive developmental windows.

Policy efforts should aim to reduce UPF availability, improve food labelling, and promote reformulation. Clinicians should also encourage diets rich in fiber and minimally processed foods to support brain development and long-term cognitive health.

US president was given trophy earlier this year

Chelsea won newly expanded tournament on Sunday

US president Donald Trump has claimed that the Club World Cup trophy that has featured prominently in the Oval Office will stay there, and that Fifa made a copy of the trophy that was awarded to Chelsea after their win in the tournament's final on Sunday.

Trump attended the final along with numerous members of his cabinet and Fifa president Gianni Infantino. The pair of presidents jointly presented the trophy to Chelsea captain Reece James, with Trump staying front-and-center despite the apparent confusion of Chelsea players and the pleading of Infantino.

The incident is just the latest in a long series of intersections between the US president and the world of Fifa, which began in earnest this year soon after Trump started his second term in office. Infantino unveiled the Club World Cup trophy for the first time in an event at the Oval Office in March, and the trophy has stayed there for all subsequent events in the historic space since.

“I said, When are you going to pick up the trophy? [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one,'” Trump said in an interview with official Club World Cup broadcaster Dazn on Sunday. “And they actually made a new one. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.”

The exact differences between the trophies are unknown, if there are any. Fifa has been approached for clarification.

At other points in the interview, Trump suggested he could put forth an executive order decreeing that soccer be called football in the United States, and said leaders of other countries have called the US “the hottest country in the world,” in reference to economic activity and political positioning.

“It's about unity,” Trump said of Fifa's bringing of the Club World Cup and the men's World Cup to the United States. “It's about everybody getting together and a lot of love between countries. I guess this is probably the most international sport, so it can really bring the world together.”

Planning for next year's World Cup has faced a few hurdles presented by the second Trump administration, including travel bans on countries that would impact fans hoping to travel to the United States to see the games (though there are exceptions for athletes and staff), threats of Ice raids at games, and long wait times for visas to get into the country.

Donald Trump's awkward interaction with one team at the close of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in New Jersey on Sunday confounded both players and fans alike.

The president, who has a friendly relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, was invited to present the trophy to the winning team at the final. But when he handed it over to Chelsea Captain Reece James after the team's 3-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germain, Trump oddly continued to hover — even as Infantino appeared to try to direct the president away from the team as players seemed unsure whether to begin celebrating.

The Athletic reported:

James turned to Trump and, in front of a packed crowd at MetLife Stadium, as well as a sizeable global television audience, appeared to ask the President of the United States whether he was planning to leave him to it, as convention usually dictates. But Trump kept grinning happily, so James, the victorious Chelsea captain, decided he might as well just hoist that giant gold-plated trophy skywards.

“They told me that [Trump] was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage,” James told The Athletic after the match. “I thought he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay. And that probably highlights how big the tournament is.”

Chelsea soccer star Cole Palmer, who was named the tournament's top player, told reporters later Sunday that he was baffled by Trump's lingering presence.

“I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused,” Palmer said.

You can watch a clip of the trophy presentation here.

Trump attended the game with first lady Melania Trump and reportedly hosted several high-profile guests in his suite, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, NFL icon Tom Brady and conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch.

The Associated Press reported that Trump received cheers from the crowd at MetLife Stadium when he arrived ahead of the match but was met with a “smattering of boos” later on. Jeering from the crowd can be heard at several points during the event.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to hold its final matches next July at MetLife Stadium. As The Washington Post's Matt Viser reported, Sunday's uncomfortable Trump moments could be a “preview of what could happen on the same field one year from now.” 

Perhaps by that time, we'll be calling soccer “football” like the rest of the world.

President Trump has revealed that the champions of the Club World Cup won't be getting the original trophy, because he's keeping it.

English club Chelsea easily dispatched France's Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the tournament in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on Sunday, with Trump joining the players for the trophy lift—much to their confusion.

It has since been revealed that the intricate prize hoisted aloft by the London club's captain, Reece James, was a replica because the president of football's governing body, FIFA, has let Trump use the original as an ornament in the Oval Office. The trophy, crafted in collaboration with Tiffany & Co, features a central disc with three rotating outer rings. It has a 24-carat gold-plated finish and is thought to have cost around $230,000 to make. If FIFA lets Trump keep the orbital award for good, it is likely to end up in the National Archives. 

“They [FIFA] said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [FIFA President Gianni Infantino] said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office,'” Trump explained in a mid-game chat with the broadcaster, DAZN. 

He then revealed to reporter Emily Austin that the victor, Chelsea, actually received a replica of the original for winning the tournament. 

“And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now [the original] is in the Oval,” he said. 

And it's not just the trophy that Trump got his hands on, according to reports. The Athletic was among several outlets to report that Infantino kept a medal aside for his friend, handing it to him after the trophy-lifting ceremony. It is unclear if the president kept the gold medallion, but his penchant for the color is well-known. 

The FIFA boss has been in Washington, D.C., 10 times since Donald Trump returned to office in January, in an attempt to woo the president. He has previously argued that proximity to the president is “absolutely crucial” to the success of the 2026 World Cup, which will be partly hosted in the U.S.

It comes as FIFA last week inadvertently confirmed the cosy Infantino-Trump relationship by moving its New York employees to a new office in Trump Tower, Manhattan.

Trump also set about making the Club World Cup, a club soccer tournament designed to bring the world's best teams into one premier competition, all about himself. This is despite being booed before kick-off.

Trump watched the game alongside his new best friend, Infantino, and his wife, Melania. After Chelsea stunned the European champions PSG by banging in three goals without reply, he presented the trophy to the club's captain.

But as Reece James readied to celebrate with his teammates, Trump lurked on the stage—something the players, including star man Cole Palmer, didn't miss.

Palmer—who scored two goals and was named the tournament's best player—said after the game that he was “confused” by Trump's continued presence on the platform. “I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused, yeah,“ he said post-game. 

Chelsea's captain also explained that Trump had ditched the protocol to stay in the spotlight. “They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay,” James added, according to PA Media.

Trump also mused about the possibility of signing an executive order to have soccer officially recognized as ‘football' in the U.S.

President Trump has revealed that the champions of the Club World Cup won't be getting the original trophy, because he's keeping it.

English club Chelsea easily dispatched France's Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the tournament in New Jersey's MetLife Stadium on Sunday, with Trump joining the players for the trophy lift—much to their confusion.

It has since been revealed that the intricate prize hoisted aloft by the London club's captain, Reece James, was a replica because the president of football's governing body, FIFA, has let Trump use the original as an ornament in the Oval Office. The trophy, crafted in collaboration with Tiffany & Co, features a central disc with three rotating outer rings. It has a 24-carat gold-plated finish and is thought to have cost around $230,000 to make. If FIFA lets Trump keep the orbital award for good, it is likely to end up in the National Archives. 

“They [FIFA] said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [FIFA President Gianni Infantino] said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office,'” Trump explained in a mid-game chat with the broadcaster, DAZN. 

He then revealed to reporter Emily Austin that the victor, Chelsea, actually received a replica of the original for winning the tournament. 

“And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now [the original] is in the Oval,” he said. 

And it's not just the trophy that Trump got his hands on, according to reports. The Athletic was among several outlets to report that Infantino kept a medal aside for his friend, handing it to him after the trophy-lifting ceremony. It is unclear if the president kept the gold medallion, but his penchant for the color is well-known. 

The FIFA boss has been in Washington, D.C., 10 times since Donald Trump returned to office in January, in an attempt to woo the president. He has previously argued that proximity to the president is “absolutely crucial” to the success of the 2026 World Cup, which will be partly hosted in the U.S.

It comes as FIFA last week inadvertently confirmed the cosy Infantino-Trump relationship by moving its New York employees to a new office in Trump Tower, Manhattan.

Trump also set about making the Club World Cup, a club soccer tournament designed to bring the world's best teams into one premier competition, all about himself. This is despite being booed before kick-off.

Trump watched the game alongside his new best friend, Infantino, and his wife, Melania. After Chelsea stunned the European champions PSG by banging in three goals without reply, he presented the trophy to the club's captain.

But as Reece James readied to celebrate with his teammates, Trump lurked on the stage—something the players, including star man Cole Palmer, didn't miss.

Palmer—who scored two goals and was named the tournament's best player—said after the game that he was “confused” by Trump's continued presence on the platform. “I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused, yeah,“ he said post-game. 

Chelsea's captain also explained that Trump had ditched the protocol to stay in the spotlight. “They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay,” James added, according to PA Media.

Trump also mused about the possibility of signing an executive order to have soccer officially recognized as ‘football' in the U.S.

Having failed to make it to the final, Real Madrid's time at the FIFA Club World Cup did not go as the fans would have liked. The Club World Cup was the first opportunity for Xabi Alonso to get to know his new squad and start instilling some of his ideas into the players.

There was one major positive to come from the tournament in the USA, though, and that was the emergence of Gonzalo Garcia as an option for the first team.

The 21-year-old stepped up when Kylian Mbappe suffered an illness before the first game of the tournament. Garcia scored the opening goal for Los Blancos against Al-Hilal and continued to deputize for the Frenchman. When Mbappe returned, he kept his place due to his form, eventually partnering with him in the game against PSG.

The Spaniard scored four goals across four different matches, and that has seen FIFA name him in the Team of the Tournament. He is the only Real Madrid player to feature. He was also awarded the Golden Boot, edging three others on four goals with an assist.

The 21-year-old will continue trying to impress Xabi Alonso, whilst the club must decide if he is good enough to be the backup striker to Kylian Mbappe next season.

A high-speed rail line hopes to connect Los Angeles to New York City in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

A proposal — dubbed “The Transcontinental Chief” and pitched to Amtrak as well as President Trump and his secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy — would shoot riders between the country's two biggest cities in just 72 hours.

Delaware-based Ameristar Rail said it would use existing infrastructure owned by Amtrak and other regional rail lines passing through major cities like Kansas City, Chicago and Philadelphia rather than launch a massive and costly new public project.

It would be funded by private investors — not taxpayers — and would carry vehicles as well as passengers, modeled after Europe's truck transport trains, Ameristar said.

“The Transcontinental Chief will be a great opportunity for Amtrak to team up with the private sector to confront the challenges of its money-losing long-distance trains and create opportunities to usher in a profitable Golden Age of rail travel for passengers and truckers, with the ingenuity of free enterprise, as we celebrate our great nation's 250th birthday next year,” Scott Spencer, AmeriStarRail's chief operating officer, wrote in a letter to Amtrak, according to Newsweek.

AmeriStarRail hopes to have it running by May 10, 2026 — in time for the FIFA World Cup, which is being hosted across North America, with the finals at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The plan has been pitched to President Trump and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, the paper reported.

Ameristar leaders said taxpayers will not foot the project, which would be funded by private investors.

“Subject to operating agreements with the host railroads (BNSF, Norfolk Southern and New Jersey Transit) the Transcontinental Chief can start operations on National Train Day, Sunday, May 10, 2026 to begin serving tourists for America 250 celebrations and the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” a spokesperson said.

“The Transcontinental Chief can be privately operated and funded, without new congressional legislation or additional federal spending.”

Amtrak has not yet responded to the proposal, according to Newsweek.

Marcus Rashford, Alejandro Garnacho, Jadon Sancho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia have been deemed surplus to Amorim's needs ahead of the 2025-26 campaign and are free to leave the club this summer.

Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. (0:52)

So, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is over, with Chelsea crowned champions after thumping Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in Sunday's showpiece final. What did we think of the competition overall after an exhausting month of heat, travel and matches? Did the atmosphere (good at times, underwhelming at others) come close to meeting expectations, or does FIFA president Gianni Infantino have work to do if this tournament's going to be a long-term success?

As the confetti is cleared from MetLife Stadium, our reporters who covered the competition chime in with their final thoughts on the good, bad and ugly.

Mark Ogden: Let's be positive. The football has been good, the noise and color from the Brazil and Argentina supporters has really brought the tournament to life and eventually, the crowd numbers were at levels that FIFA would have wanted. Also, and this is important, the best team in the world (PSG) brought its A-game and really showcased the game and the club's quality to the audience in the U.S.

On the downside, 32 teams in the competition is too many, and that isn't a dig at sides such as Auckland City, Urawa Red Diamonds or Ulsan HD, who earned one point between them -- it's also about the likes of FC Salzburg, who really had no right to be at the tournament. But overall, weather issues aside, it has been a positive first attempt at the competition. RATING: 6/10

Lizzy Becherano: The Club World Cup somewhat exceeded my expectations after watching teams take the competition seriously and dedicated fans filling most stadiums. Like many, I worried that the top teams would treat the competition like a series of preseason friendlies, playing lackluster football inside empty stadiums. Now, I am glad to look back at the tournament and be proved wrong to a certain extent. The tournament gave us moments of great football, with the excitement of watching underdogs take on the European greats.

There are still too many aspects of the Club World Cup to improve, however, in order for this tournament to truly be seen as successful rather than just an opportunity for more games. RATING: 6/10

Rob Dawson: It wasn't perfect, but it was a largely positive first edition of the expanded Club World Cup. There were some good games, shock results, drama and talking points. Most importantly, the fans showed up. The majority of the matches were well-attended. The big European teams took it seriously, but -- crucially -- they didn't have it all their own way. Fluminense and Al Hilal showed exactly why the idea of a Club World Cup is valid.

As long as lessons are learned in terms of ticket pricing, travel and the timing of the tournament, there's every chance it could thrive going forward. RATING: 7/10

Gab Marcotti: It has been said time and again, but it's the first of its kind, it came about for self-serving reasons, staging a tournament in the U.S. in the summer isn't straightforward and we really had no clue what success would look like. Now at least we know the rest of the world can take on UEFA's big boys without embarrassing themselves.

We know there's genuine passion and interest, at least from fans of teams participating. That's a step forward, though there's a lot yet to be done. RATING: 7/10

James Olley: Somewhere in the middle of this bloated, ego-driven tournament is a good idea trying to emerge. FIFA's attempt to force this on the world at an accelerated pace rather than growing the competition more steadily over time -- it would have been a 24-team format in 2021 had the COVID pandemic not disrupted the calendar -- led to a version that was often difficult to like. The summer environment in the U.S. -- most obviously the weather but also the saturated domestic sports market -- made it tough for the competition to find a natural home. That said, there were positive elements that give it a platform on which to build.

The Brazilian teams added real flair and an edge to matches given their desire to challenge Europe's dominance. The support those teams enjoyed, along with the Argentine sides and Wydad AC of Tunisia, brought color and vibrancy to games. And nobody who saw the angry scenes after Chelsea's victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the final can say the players didn't care. But no matter how many times FIFA president Gianni Infantino says it is "already the most successful club competition in the world," it doesn't actually make it so. Any competition has to earn that right, and the Club World Cup still has some way to go. RATING: 5/10

Alex Kirkland: We got some entertaining games, some great goals, some big crowds, and enough memorable moments that made you feel like this tournament was delivering on its premise: a truly global competition, bringing the best of world football -- Europe's elite teams, South America's passionate fans, giants being humbled, and underdogs being celebrated -- together in one place.

But there were really significant problems with the match-going experience for supporters, and concerns over player welfare, both largely due to the heat and the scheduling. It's also a tournament that was greeted with complete indifference by many football fans around the world. Despite those issues, it went as well as could have been expected and, as a journalist covering the event, it was really quite fun. RATING: 6/10

Ogden: Fluminense are the obvious one when you consider how much they struggled in the Brazilian league last season. To reach the semifinal was an achievement, even though they were easily beaten by Chelsea thanks to two goals from João Pedro.

Al Hilal also made an impact, striking a blow for the Saudi Pro League by reaching the quarterfinals after eliminating Manchester City in the round of 16. That was probably the shock of the tournament and, from FIFA's perspective, the kind of result that offered them complete vindication for opening it up to more teams from across the world.

And let's give some love to Inter Miami too, even though their place in the competition was controversially awarded by FIFA president Infantino. They reached the knockout stage and gave us a couple of magic moments from Lionel Messi, so they rose to the occasion.

Frank Leboeuf assesses PSG's season after their 3-0 loss to Chelsea in the Club World Cup final.

Becherano: FC Porto entered the Club World Cup as the favorites to top Group A and likely triumph over Inter Miami, Palmeiras and Al Ahly to advance to the round of 16 with three victories. Instead, the team struggled tremendously, going from favorites to failures quickly.

I expected a tough match between Porto and Palmeiras, even some difficulty for the European team to beat Inter Miami, but I never could have imagined the club letting in four goals from Al Ahly to conclude the competition with a 4-4 draw.

Dawson: Manchester City. The win over Juventus in their final group game felt like a big statement, as Pep Guardiola picked a strong team and City played really well against a good side.

At that point, the bracket had opened up and they could plot a manageable path to New York and the semifinals. But that was until they ran into Al Hilal, with the second half bringing back memories of everything that was wrong last season. It was chaotic and ragged and, in the end, City got what they deserved. It was a big surprise they didn't get further.

Marcotti: Maybe it's that I watched them twice in person, or maybe it's that their fans raised the roof everywhere they went. But Flamengo stood out -- not just for the passion of their supporters, but for what they showed on the pitch, starting from their 3-1 victory over future world champions, Chelsea.

Boasting plenty of experience, tactical nous and tons of confidence, they honored the jersey once worn by Zico.

The ESPN FC crew react to the scenes between Luis Enrique and the Chelsea squad after the Club World Cup final.

Olley: It has to be Chelsea. They arrived at the tournament having quieted (but not silenced) doubts over manager Enzo Maresca, with some supporters questioning his style of play despite qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Conference League. They depart with a second trophy, validation of his approach, a promising start made by several new signings and a prize-money pot worth at least £97m.

The indifference many have shown towards the Club World Cup may mean the afterglow from victory may not last as long as more conventional successes, but Maresca starts next season from a renewed position of strength. Moreover, this young group should now possess genuine belief they can go and challenge for the honors that matter most, having put PSG to the sword in such an impressive way.

Alex Kirkland: It ended up being Chelsea, given how incredibly and unexpectedly well they performed in the final on Sunday, but before that: Atletico Madrid. Going into the tournament I genuinely thought they had a chance of progressing to the latter stages, given some key players -- like Julián Álvarez and Alexander Sorloth -- had been in really good form toward the end of the domestic season. In a short-form competition, I backed them to go on a run. And then they lost 4-0 to PSG in their opening game.

Even two subsequent wins against Seattle Sounders and Botafogo weren't enough to see them go through to the round of 16, and that was bad luck, but it was a disappointing and premature departure, nonetheless.

Ogden: The best moment for me, by far, was the video of Cole Palmer riding around Times Square on an e-scooter on the Friday night before the Club World Cup final.

Chelsea have given their players room to breathe during their month in the U.S. because, at the same time as taking the competition seriously, they have also accepted that this tournament is taking place at a time when most players are on holiday or enjoying downtime ahead of the new season. Too often, clubs or international teams lock their players away in remote hotels or training bases and expect them to focus solely on football. But Chelsea have taken a grown-up approach during the Club World Cup and the image of Palmer riding through the crowds, while a huge image of him was on the digital screens in Times Square, was funny. It was also proof that footballers have a life away from the game.

Becherano: I was most impressed by the traveling fans throughout the first stage of the Club World Cup, with the Boca Juniors fans deserving a shoutout of their own. The entire group took over Miami, from the beaches to the stands inside Hard Rock Stadium, bringing Buenos Aires to the streets of South Florida.

One of the best moments of the tournament came after the goal Miguel Merentiel scored in the second half of the match against Bayern Munich, not because of the actual strike but the scenes that followed. The goal inspired the entire stadium to erupt in chaos, making the press box tremble as supporters jumped and chanted in unison. For a brief moment, Boca Juniors fans truly believed they would win against Bayern, and the atmosphere reflected it.

Steve Nicol believes there would be no complaints about the weather if it was the World Cup.

Dawson: Either Botafogo beating Paris Saint-Germain, or Flamengo beating Chelsea. It's nothing against PSG or Chelsea -- both deserved to reach the final -- but those results are exactly what a Club World Cup should be about. It would have been boring if the UEFA teams had blitzed everyone else.

The knockout rounds turning into a less-exciting version of the Champions League would not have suited anyone -- fans or FIFA. Botafogo and Flamengo scoring those early wins for South America against European heavyweights was proof that the premise of the tournament is sound. It just needs some tweaks and a viable place in the calendar.

Marcotti: Wessam Abou Ali's hat trick against Porto. It finished 4-4 and turned out to be irrelevant for both clubs given that both sides went home early, but the Danish-born, Palestinian striker stole the show. The forward is on his way to becoming a legend in Egypt at Al Ahly.

Olley: Messi's free kick against Porto. Again, you have to park the cynical construction that led to this moment, with Inter Miami crowbarred into the tournament just so Messi could help sell tickets. Yet watching the 38-year-old bend in a superb match-winning free kick was still a heartwarming moment of endurance and longevity from arguably the game's greatest-ever player.

FIFA got its viral moment for social media; the world got a reminder that Messi is still capable of getting you out of your seat.

Kirkland: Thibaut Courtois' 99th-minute save for Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund, clawing away Marcel Sabitzer's near-perfect shot to preserve Madrid's 3-2 lead in the quarterfinals. It was one of those saves that got better with every replay you watched, and every fresh angle you saw. The fact that it was the decisive, last touch of the game, after a frantic finale that had three goals and a red card in added time -- a bizarre ending to an otherwise serene Madrid performance -- made it even better.

This is what makes a truly great goalkeeper: doing absolutely nothing, all game, and then, when it really matters, producing that.

Ogden: This is not really a moment, but the overall negative from the Club World Cup has been the weather, with disruptions caused by storms and issues that players, and supporters, have had to overcome with the heat during games. Any tournament played in a northern hemisphere summer will have heat issues -- Germany was very hot during Euro 2024 -- but the conditions in the United States during June and July have been so difficult at times that it has opened up a big conversation about how the 2026 World Cup will be staged next year.

Infantino appeared to make a significant concession by saying that more daytime games will now be staged at stadiums with roofs at the World Cup, but kickoff times still to be finalized and with some games likely to be midday starts next year, we will only discover if lessons have truly been learned when those games are allocated venues and kickoff times.

Becherano: Hard Rock Stadium played host to several exciting moments of the Club World Cup, with Boca Juniors fans turning the venue into La Bombonera North, a great goal by Luis Suárez and celebrations from Mamelodi Sundowns fans. But as always, the problem with the stadium is not the action on the pitch, but the journey to that front gate. There were confusing instructions to find the entrance, miscommunication among staff on safety measures, and countless streets shut down to make the traffic into the media parking unbearable.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

FIFA once made public transportation a requirement for cities and venues in order to submit a bid to host an official match or a World Cup, but the principle seems like a lost idea here. There are no public options available to reach the stadium, forcing fans and outlets to use Ubers, private cars or chartered buses, making the experience a nightmare for all.

Marcotti: The weather delays that turned Chelsea vs. Benfica into a four-hour slog that felt interminable. I get it -- safety first -- but there are lessons to be learned here and if certain venues at certain times are at greater risk of this sort of thing, then we may need a rethink.

Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Donnarumma was at fault for Musiala's injury in the Club World Cup.

Olley: Jamal Musiala's injury, to the extent that you wonder what has to happen for the debate about player welfare to actually change anything. Musiala's awful broken leg vs. PSG was the consequence of the type of challenge that could have happened at any time -- fatigue didn't appear an obvious factor -- but asking players to keep going for 11 months of the year is putting an excessive strain on the game's elite. It is a relief that there weren't more serious injuries.

The ongoing enmity between FIFA and UEFA make compromises thin on the ground, but the game is heading, almost inexorably, towards becoming a yearround enterprise. That feels unsustainable but, once again, nobody in a position of power is listening.

Kirkland: Sunday's final offered several contenders -- from PSG's undignified reaction to defeat, to the awkwardly handled trophy presentation -- but for me, the worst moment came much earlier in the tournament: speaking to a fan and his excited young family, prematch at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena ahead of PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, and then hearing from them subsequently that the game had, in fact, turned into a quite unpleasant ordeal, with the midday heat forcing them to abandon their seats for much of the second half.

If you've paid hundreds of dollars for tickets, the least you should expect is to be able to enjoy the experience in relative comfort.

Dawson: This belongs in a separate category to "worst moment," but it was extremely hard to watch Rúben Neves and João Cancelo break down during the tribute to Diogo Jota ahead of Al Hilal's quarterfinal against Fluminense. The Liverpool forward died in a car accident along with his brother, just days before the team was to regroup for preseason, and he was international teammates with the Al Hilal pair. Neves -- who was also his club teammate at Wolves -- counted Jota as one of his closest friends. The pair found out about Jota's passing on that Thursday, and played a match less than 24 hours later.

To watch Neves and Cancelo in tears as his picture, along with brother André Silva, flashed up on the big screens at Camping World Stadium was heartbreaking. It was a reminder of how unimportant football can be.

Ogden: I'd have a smaller tournament, maybe 24 teams, and ensure that those involved really are the best in their Confederation. This Club World Cup has taken place without the reigning champions of England (Liverpool), Spain (Barcelona) Italy (Napoli) and Argentina (Velez Sarsfield), at the same time as including Chelsea -- who qualified as 2021 Champions League winners -- and Salzburg who have, quite frankly, done nothing outside the Austrian Bundesliga and aren't even the current champions (hello, Sturm Graz.)

Balance it out and find a way to have teams from South America who aren't just from Brazil and Argentina. Ultimately, FIFA needs to come up with more convincing, and equitable, qualifying criteria.

Frank Leboeuf criticises Kylian Mbappé's work rate at Real Madrid following their 4-0 Club World Cup semifinal loss to PSG.

Becherano: Without a doubt, kickoff times for most matches need to be pushed back until after sunset. FIFA's decision to schedule a noon or 3 p.m. kickoff at Hard Rock Stadium in the middle of summer will continue to be shocking. I understand the need to make football accessible to those watching in Europe or Asia, but not enough to consider risking a player's well-being by ordering a match to be played under the scorching Florida sun and humidity. Unless the venue boasts a roof, no game can or should be played before 7:30 p.m. local time.

Beyond the obvious safety and health concerns, one could also argue that no one plays their best under such conditions in Miami. Players often must conserve energy and lower paces to prioritize consistency and durability throughout the 90-minute matches. Coaches complained that players asked to be substituted due to heat-induced exhaustion and cramps. How can officials expect the tournament to thrive if players are not given the proper conditions to play?

Dawson: Have a completely open draw. FIFA decided to go straight to 32 teams, so can't then row back and make it a 16-team competition (which it should have been in the first place.) An open draw should -- in theory -- increase the probability of bigger games in the group stages; the knockout games were good, but it felt like the tournament took a while to get going.

Pitching more of the heavyweights against each other early on would kick-start things. You could also have a couple of incredibly tough groups with some real jeopardy before the round of 16.

Catch the best bits of the footage captured on body cameras worn by referees at the Club World Cup.

Marcotti: Expectations. Let's face it: FIFA felt it needed to promise mega prize money to get some of the European heavyweights on board and because the competition was in its infancy, it became tough to sell. FIFA had no clue what size of stadiums to use, how to price (and sell) the tickets, and struggled to sell broadcast and sponsorship rights (hence why we ended up with DAZN and last-ditch commercial deals.)

Let this summer show you don't need to go big from day one. Let the competition grow and, if it attracts enough eyeballs, the big clubs will want to be there, and so will the sponsors.

Olley: Reduce it to 16 teams. It'll never happen now, obviously -- money dictates that. If anything, they'll try to expand it to 48 teams to mirror the new international format. But a tighter version would be an easier sell globally and fewer games would place less of a demand on players who are already overworked.

Related to this, reduce the travel required and limit logistical demands. There is always a balancing act in terms of taking teams around a country -- the sheer scale of the U.S. doesn't help in that regard -- but the balance wasn't right this time.

Kirkland: It might be a very Anglo-centric point, but I can't help but feel that for the tournament to have real widespread breakthrough appeal, FIFA must find a way to ensure that the biggest Premier League teams in terms of support and online engagement -- Manchester United, or Liverpool, or Arsenal -- are involved. It also hurt the competition's credibility that some of the best sides in the world on current form -- Liverpool again, or Barcelona, or Napoli -- were not included, even if the qualification criteria and logistics made that impossible.

It would be no surprise at all if FIFA somehow found a way to remedy both of those challenges in time for 2029.

Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. (0:52)

So, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is over, with Chelsea crowned champions after thumping Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in Sunday's showpiece final. What did we think of the competition overall after an exhausting month of heat, travel and matches? Did the atmosphere (good at times, underwhelming at others) come close to meeting expectations, or does FIFA president Gianni Infantino have work to do if this tournament's going to be a long-term success?

As the confetti is cleared from MetLife Stadium, our reporters who covered the competition chime in with their final thoughts on the good, bad and ugly.

Mark Ogden: Let's be positive. The football has been good, the noise and color from the Brazil and Argentina supporters has really brought the tournament to life and eventually, the crowd numbers were at levels that FIFA would have wanted. Also, and this is important, the best team in the world (PSG) brought its A-game and really showcased the game and the club's quality to the audience in the U.S.

On the downside, 32 teams in the competition is too many, and that isn't a dig at sides such as Auckland City, Urawa Red Diamonds or Ulsan HD, who earned one point between them -- it's also about the likes of FC Salzburg, who really had no right to be at the tournament. But overall, weather issues aside, it has been a positive first attempt at the competition. RATING: 6/10

Lizzy Becherano: The Club World Cup somewhat exceeded my expectations after watching teams take the competition seriously and dedicated fans filling most stadiums. Like many, I worried that the top teams would treat the competition like a series of preseason friendlies, playing lackluster football inside empty stadiums. Now, I am glad to look back at the tournament and be proved wrong to a certain extent. The tournament gave us moments of great football, with the excitement of watching underdogs take on the European greats.

There are still too many aspects of the Club World Cup to improve, however, in order for this tournament to truly be seen as successful rather than just an opportunity for more games. RATING: 6/10

Rob Dawson: It wasn't perfect, but it was a largely positive first edition of the expanded Club World Cup. There were some good games, shock results, drama and talking points. Most importantly, the fans showed up. The majority of the matches were well-attended. The big European teams took it seriously, but -- crucially -- they didn't have it all their own way. Fluminense and Al Hilal showed exactly why the idea of a Club World Cup is valid.

As long as lessons are learned in terms of ticket pricing, travel and the timing of the tournament, there's every chance it could thrive going forward. RATING: 7/10

Gab Marcotti: It has been said time and again, but it's the first of its kind, it came about for self-serving reasons, staging a tournament in the U.S. in the summer isn't straightforward and we really had no clue what success would look like. Now at least we know the rest of the world can take on UEFA's big boys without embarrassing themselves.

We know there's genuine passion and interest, at least from fans of teams participating. That's a step forward, though there's a lot yet to be done. RATING: 7/10

James Olley: Somewhere in the middle of this bloated, ego-driven tournament is a good idea trying to emerge. FIFA's attempt to force this on the world at an accelerated pace rather than growing the competition more steadily over time -- it would have been a 24-team format in 2021 had the COVID pandemic not disrupted the calendar -- led to a version that was often difficult to like. The summer environment in the U.S. -- most obviously the weather but also the saturated domestic sports market -- made it tough for the competition to find a natural home. That said, there were positive elements that give it a platform on which to build.

The Brazilian teams added real flair and an edge to matches given their desire to challenge Europe's dominance. The support those teams enjoyed, along with the Argentine sides and Wydad AC of Tunisia, brought color and vibrancy to games. And nobody who saw the angry scenes after Chelsea's victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the final can say the players didn't care. But no matter how many times FIFA president Gianni Infantino says it is "already the most successful club competition in the world," it doesn't actually make it so. Any competition has to earn that right, and the Club World Cup still has some way to go. RATING: 5/10

Alex Kirkland: We got some entertaining games, some great goals, some big crowds, and enough memorable moments that made you feel like this tournament was delivering on its premise: a truly global competition, bringing the best of world football -- Europe's elite teams, South America's passionate fans, giants being humbled, and underdogs being celebrated -- together in one place.

But there were really significant problems with the match-going experience for supporters, and concerns over player welfare, both largely due to the heat and the scheduling. It's also a tournament that was greeted with complete indifference by many football fans around the world. Despite those issues, it went as well as could have been expected and, as a journalist covering the event, it was really quite fun. RATING: 6/10

Ogden: Fluminense are the obvious one when you consider how much they struggled in the Brazilian league last season. To reach the semifinal was an achievement, even though they were easily beaten by Chelsea thanks to two goals from João Pedro.

Al Hilal also made an impact, striking a blow for the Saudi Pro League by reaching the quarterfinals after eliminating Manchester City in the round of 16. That was probably the shock of the tournament and, from FIFA's perspective, the kind of result that offered them complete vindication for opening it up to more teams from across the world.

And let's give some love to Inter Miami too, even though their place in the competition was controversially awarded by FIFA president Infantino. They reached the knockout stage and gave us a couple of magic moments from Lionel Messi, so they rose to the occasion.

Frank Leboeuf assesses PSG's season after their 3-0 loss to Chelsea in the Club World Cup final.

Becherano: FC Porto entered the Club World Cup as the favorites to top Group A and likely triumph over Inter Miami, Palmeiras and Al Ahly to advance to the round of 16 with three victories. Instead, the team struggled tremendously, going from favorites to failures quickly.

I expected a tough match between Porto and Palmeiras, even some difficulty for the European team to beat Inter Miami, but I never could have imagined the club letting in four goals from Al Ahly to conclude the competition with a 4-4 draw.

Dawson: Manchester City. The win over Juventus in their final group game felt like a big statement, as Pep Guardiola picked a strong team and City played really well against a good side.

At that point, the bracket had opened up and they could plot a manageable path to New York and the semifinals. But that was until they ran into Al Hilal, with the second half bringing back memories of everything that was wrong last season. It was chaotic and ragged and, in the end, City got what they deserved. It was a big surprise they didn't get further.

Marcotti: Maybe it's that I watched them twice in person, or maybe it's that their fans raised the roof everywhere they went. But Flamengo stood out -- not just for the passion of their supporters, but for what they showed on the pitch, starting from their 3-1 victory over future world champions, Chelsea.

Boasting plenty of experience, tactical nous and tons of confidence, they honored the jersey once worn by Zico.

The ESPN FC crew react to the scenes between Luis Enrique and the Chelsea squad after the Club World Cup final.

Olley: It has to be Chelsea. They arrived at the tournament having quieted (but not silenced) doubts over manager Enzo Maresca, with some supporters questioning his style of play despite qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Conference League. They depart with a second trophy, validation of his approach, a promising start made by several new signings and a prize-money pot worth at least £97m.

The indifference many have shown towards the Club World Cup may mean the afterglow from victory may not last as long as more conventional successes, but Maresca starts next season from a renewed position of strength. Moreover, this young group should now possess genuine belief they can go and challenge for the honors that matter most, having put PSG to the sword in such an impressive way.

Alex Kirkland: It ended up being Chelsea, given how incredibly and unexpectedly well they performed in the final on Sunday, but before that: Atletico Madrid. Going into the tournament I genuinely thought they had a chance of progressing to the latter stages, given some key players -- like Julián Álvarez and Alexander Sorloth -- had been in really good form toward the end of the domestic season.

Players often must conserve energy and lower paces to prioritize consistency and durability throughout the 90-minute matches. Coaches complained that players asked to be substituted due to heat-induced exhaustion and cramps. How can officials expect the tournament to thrive if players are not given the proper conditions to play?

Dawson: Have a completely open draw. FIFA decided to go straight to 32 teams, so can't then row back and make it a 16-team competition (which it should have been in the first place.) An open draw should -- in theory -- increase the probability of bigger games in the group stages; the knockout games were good, but it felt like the tournament took a while to get going.

Pitching more of the heavyweights against each other early on would kick-start things. You could also have a couple of incredibly tough groups with some real jeopardy before the round of 16.

Catch the best bits of the footage captured on body cameras worn by referees at the Club World Cup.

Marcotti: Expectations. Let's face it: FIFA felt it needed to promise mega prize money to get some of the European heavyweights on board and because the competition was in its infancy, it became tough to sell. FIFA had no clue what size of stadiums to use, how to price (and sell) the tickets, and struggled to sell broadcast and sponsorship rights (hence why we ended up with DAZN and last-ditch commercial deals.)

Let this summer show you don't need to go big from day one. Let the competition grow and, if it attracts enough eyeballs, the big clubs will want to be there, and so will the sponsors.

Olley: Reduce it to 16 teams. It'll never happen now, obviously -- money dictates that. If anything, they'll try to expand it to 48 teams to mirror the new international format. But a tighter version would be an easier sell globally and fewer games would place less of a demand on players who are already overworked.

Related to this, reduce the travel required and limit logistical demands. There is always a balancing act in terms of taking teams around a country -- the sheer scale of the U.S. doesn't help in that regard -- but the balance wasn't right this time.

Kirkland: It might be a very Anglo-centric point, but I can't help but feel that for the tournament to have real widespread breakthrough appeal, FIFA must find a way to ensure that the biggest Premier League teams in terms of support and online engagement -- Manchester United, or Liverpool, or Arsenal -- are involved. It also hurt the competition's credibility that some of the best sides in the world on current form -- Liverpool again, or Barcelona, or Napoli -- were not included, even if the qualification criteria and logistics made that impossible.

It would be no surprise at all if FIFA somehow found a way to remedy both of those challenges in time for 2029.

Enzo Maresca's men pulled off a sensational upset by routing heavy favourites Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final in New Jersey

Everyone tuned in or turned up to watch Sunday's Club World Cup final fully expecting to see Paris Saint-Germain formally crowned the best team on the planet right now. However, Chelsea crashed the coronation party, with the Blues beating the reigning European champions 3-0 at a packed MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

Cole Palmer was the undoubted star of the show, scoring two goals and creating another for Joao Pedro. The attacker's dynamic display resulted in him being presented with not only the man of the match award, but also the Golden Ball. 

Unsurprisingly, Palmer also makes GOAL's team of the tournament but who else has been included? Chelsea may account for half of our picks but there's also room in our all-star selection for players from beaten finalists Paris Saint-Germain, surprise packages Fluminense and Palmeiras, and even Real Madrid...

Arsenal are being warned, with a deal in the pipeline, that Viktor Gyokeres will face “two or three” steps up in the Premier League.

The Gunners appear to be bringing their search for a new No.9 to a close, amid reports that a transfer package worth up to €75 million (£65m/$88m) has been agreed with Sporting for Swedish sensation Gyokeres.

He has plundered 97 goals through 102 appearances for Portuguese employers, with that impressive strike rate bringing him to the attention of teams across Europe. Gyokeres has been pushing to make a Premier League switch happen.

The 27-year-old has previously graced English football at Brighton and Coventry, but remains something of an unknown quantity as a top-flight performer. Arsenal are prepared to take a calculated risk on him being ready to thrive at that level.

Ex-Gunners defender William Gallas does, however, have some concerns. The Frenchman has told Genting Casino: “He's not just making one step up. It's more like two or three steps, from Sporting to Arsenal right now. He'll be playing against defenders who are really strong, maybe the strongest.

“In the first season, he will need to adapt. He's tall, he's massive, so I may get attacked for saying this but in Portugal, he had a much bigger advantage on the defenders. He will need to adapt to the Premier League defenders quickly.

“There's a chance that his second year is much stronger than his first year at Arsenal. But Arsenal will not be wanting to wait for a major trophy any longer. And the signing of a striker is seen as that last piece of the puzzle to do exactly that.

“I hope that, if he comes in, he comes in and hits the ground running. We've all been waiting for Arsenal to sign a killer. Only time will tell if Gyokeres is an assassin in the Premier League.”

Arsenal, who have finished as runners-up in the Premier League across the last three campaigns, are looking to get a raid for Gyokeres wrapped up before opening their pre-season tour of Asia against Serie A giants AC Milan on July 23.

Hundreds of players turned out across 63 matches at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup but not all shone equally bright in the United States. 

There were some exceptional individual performances at the tournament, some of which came out of left field. Much like the international World Cup, an array of talents announced themselves to new audiences otherwise unaware of their abilities.

But some of the dazzling superstars we're more familiar with also rose to the occasion, underscoring their elite status with some breathtaking displays. 

Picking the Team of the Tournament is no simple feat but we've given it our best shot regardless. 

GK: Gianluigi Donnarumma—Donnarumma was integral to PSG's impressive collection of clean sheets in the United States, producing particularly staggering performances during the knockout stage that were befitting of his 2024–25 form. 

RB: Achraf Hakimi—Hakimi scored in the Champions League semifinal and final for PSG en route to the title and built on his stellar attacking output at the Club World Cup with a flurry of goals and assists. 

CB: Thiago Silva—Few expected the 40-year-old to produce such consistently exquisite displays at the tournament but class is permanent. Silva was essential to Fluminense's stern defense, helping them reach the semis. 

CB: Kalidou Koulibaly—Another former Chelsea defender who surprised a few at the tournament was Koulibaly of Al Hilal. He managed a goal and assist in the knockout stage to add to several highly impressive defensive performances in the group phase. 

LB: Nuno Mendes—PSG's full backs were usually unstoppable over the past year, with Mendes offering similar dynamism and attacking potential to Hakimi. A disappointing end to the tournament cannot take away from his impressive showings.

DM: Moisés Caicedo—The Ecuador international continues to provide some much-needed grit and defensive awareness in the heart of Chelsea's midfield and he conjured up some fantastic performances in the U.S.

DM: Vitinha—Vitinha is indispensable for PSG and continually proves the linchpin in the engine room. The Portuguese's energy levels, defensive cover and stellar distribution allowed João Neves and Fabián Ruiz to bomb forward and get amongst the goals. 

RW: Jhon Arias—The 27-year-old might not have scored or assisted a hatful at the tournament but he was relentless in the final third for Fluminense. He proved an almighty challenge for opposition defenses, who struggled to contain his trickery and intelligence. 

AM: Cole Palmer—Enzo Maresca has challenged Palmer to dominate big games, and that's exactly what he did in the final. Two goals and an assist against the best team on the planet spoke volumes of his talents.

LW: Pedro Neto—Neto's debut term with Chelsea was far from plain sailing but the Portuguese offered an extended glimpse of his potential this summer. Goals were easy to come by in North America and few were able to match his output. 

ST: Gonzalo García—García was one of the breakout stars of the tournament, bagging four for Real Madrid as he guided them to the semifinal. The 21-year-old forward scored against Al Hilal, Juventus and Borussia Dortmund at the tournament.

U.S. President Donald Trump joined family, friends and close advisers to witness Chelsea's FIFA Club World Cup final victory on Sunday, calling it “a great match.”

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Cole Palmer was jumping up and down behind Reece James as the Chelsea captain received the trophy for the Club World Cup, U.S. President Donald Trump to his left, standing between the midfielder and goalkeeper Robert Sánchez.

“I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused,” Palmer said.

Palmer received the Golden Ball as top player of the tournament after scoring the first two goals in Chelsea's 3-0 smothering of Paris Saint-Germain on Sunday night. Trump — wearing a bright red tie — appeared to leave the award stand with a medal of his own, handed to him by FIFA President Gianni Infantino right after the medallion presented to James.

At 23, Palmer was selected player of the match for Chelsea's second straight final. A rising English star, he assisted twice in a 4-1 win over Real Betis on May 28 that won the Europa Conference League. He also scored the Blues' first goal in the 2-1 quarterfinal Club World Cup win over Palmeiras and had England's goal in its 2024 European Championship final defeat to Spain.

He had his name up in the bright lights this weekend. He posed for a photo in front of a huge video board of his image in a Nike ad emblazoned with the words: “Scary Good.” It was part of a campaign that also features Kylian Mbappé, Erling Haaland and Vinícius Júnior.

“I've seen the billboards in Times Square and outside of Madison Square Garden,” Palmer said. “It's a nice feeling to be obviously alongside them type of players.”




Palmer had almost identical left-footed goals from just inside the penalty area in the 22nd and 30th minutes, then sent a through pass that enabled João Pedro to chip goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd for his third goal in two starts with the Blues.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, who wanted to exploit space on PSG's left flank, told his players he wanted them to attack from the opening whistle.

“I think we won the game in the first 10 minutes and the message before the game was let them understand that we are here to win the game,” Maresca said. “Probably set a little bit the tone of the game.”

Chelsea went ahead after Sánchez kicked the ball downfield and Nuno Mendes mis-hit his header 15 yards past the midfield stripe toward his own goal. Malo Gusto's shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo and rebounded to Palmer, who ended PSG's streak of 436 minutes without conceding.

“These are the games where we expect Cole to appear because they are big games, big moments,” Maresca said.

Palmer doubled the lead in the 30th when he ran onto a long ball from Levi Colwill and cut inside before shooting for his 18th goal of the season.

“It's a great feeling. Even better because obviously everyone doubted us before the game,” Palmer said. “The gaffer put a great gameplan out, and obviously, he knew where the space was going to be.”

Oops, something went wrong

President Donald Trump has suggested Chelsea will not receive the original Club World Cup trophy after winning the tournament in New Jersey on Sunday.

Enzo Maresca's side beat PSG in the final of the inaugural expanded Club World Cup at the MetLife Stadium.

Cole Palmer slotted home for a brace while new signing Joao Pedro added a third in a 3-0 win over the Champions League winners.

Fifa state that Chelsea will be able to call themselves world champions for four years, and emboss their kits with a specialist badge. The Blues racked up over £80m in prize money.

But the trophy – a gold structure that moves and twists after a key is inserted in its rear – is likely to stay Stateside, according to President Trump, who was in attendance on Sunday.

Speaking to Dazn, the White House resident joked how he could sign an executive order changing the name of the sport from soccer to football in the United States.

He then revealed that he has the original Club World Cup trophy, on the orders of Fifa president Gianni Infantino.

“[Fifa] is doing fantastically well for [football in America], it's a growing sport, it is a great sport,” President Trump told Dazn.

“They said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?'. We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [Infantino] said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office'”.

“And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now [the original] is in the Oval.”

The cosy relationship between Fifa and Trump intensified last week with football's governing body opening an office in New York's Trump Tower ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — President Donald Trump on Sunday marked the one-year anniversary of a failed attempt on his life, joining family, friends and close advisers to witness Chelsea's dominating FIFA Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain.

The president joined the players on the field after the match to congratulate the tournament's outstanding performers, present PSG players with their runner-up medals and hand Chelsea their championship trophy.

"It was an upset today I guess," Trump told reporters after flying back to Washington following Chelsea's victory. "But it was a great match."

Trump and first lady Melania Trump were greeted with cheers as they arrived at MetLife Stadium just ahead of the pre-match performance by musical artists Robbie Williams and Laura Pausini. And the president got a smattering of boos when he was briefly shown on the stadium's mega-screen.

The president waved to the crowd and pumped his fist as he and his entourage arrived at the stadium luxury box, where they took in the match with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his wife, Leena Al Ashqar.

Other guests spotted in the president's suite included Attorney General Pam Bondi, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, NFL great Tom Brady and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.

MetLife in a little over a year will host the 2026 World Cup final.

Chelsea, of the English Premier League, spoiled PSG's bid to win its fourth major title of the season, exactly 100 days after PSG clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. The Paris team added the Coupe de France by beating Reims 3-0 on May 24, then romped over Inter Milan seven days later in the Champions League Final.

Chelsea dominated throughout, racing out to a 3-0 lead in the first half behind a pair of goals from Cole Palmer and one from João Pedro.

Sunday's match fell on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt Trump survived in Butler, Pennsylvania, while campaigning for president.

"It remains my firm conviction that God alone saved me that day for a righteous purpose: to restore our beloved Republic to greatness and to rescue our Nation from those who seek its ruin," Trump said in a statement released Sunday night after he returned to Washington.

He also hailed doctors, first responders and rallygoers who helped guide other attendees to safety, saying, "These men and women arrived at the rally grounds as ordinary Americans, but left as heroes."

The international sporting match also offered an opportunity for Trump and aides to huddle with Qatari government officials.

Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of the match, said he remained "hopeful" about Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations.

Witkoff, who joined Trump for the tournament finale, appeared to nod affirmatively when asked by reporters if he planned on meeting with senior officials from the Gulf nation of Qatar, which is serving as an intermediary with Hamas in the talks, during the match.

"I'll be meeting them," Witkoff said.

The president, who has a warm relationship with Infantino, has said he plans to attend multiple matches of the World Cup tournament next year that will be held at stadiums in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Preparations for next year's big soccer moment for North America are well underway. But it comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and its neighbors over proposed tariffs, immigration and Trump repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st state.

Trump earlier this year said the tensions will only make the tournament more "exciting."

"Tension's a good thing, " Trump said.

Sporting events have made up the bulk of Trump's trips in the U.S. since taking office this year. In addition to his visit this weekend to the soccer tournament, he's attended the Super Bowl in New Orleans, the Daytona 500 in Florida, UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, and the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia.

Many are concerned next year's tournament hosted by North America will be marred by Trump's efforts to close the border.

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — President Donald Trump stood and saluted from a suite at midfield  Sunday, briefly the center of attention amid the final match of a global competition that has been a precursor for a much bigger event next year.

Sunday's FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium  featured Chelsea FC  defeating Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, culminating weeks of competition in U.S. stadiums. It was something of a test run for the World Cup, which will  include many of the same top names in the sport playing on behalf of their national teams.

That's why many world leaders and sports fans have been scrutinizing the club games for on- and off-field clues about America's ability to host. The skepticism is driven by concerns over whether a president who has taken actions to close America's borders and imposed wholesale bans on residents from some countries can host a quadrennial celebration of global camaraderie and athleticism.

In one indication of the mixed relationship the “America First” president has with the global game, some  on Sunday cheered his attendance, chanted “USA! USA!” and turned to take photos. But when he appeared on the jumbo screen during the national anthem, boos rose up before the  camera quickly turned elsewhere.

As Trump took the field with FIFA president Gianni Infantino after the match for the medal ceremony the crowd loudly booed Trump again as he pumped his fists and took the stage. Chelsea players gave one another confused looks as Trump continued to linger while they raised the trophy in celebration.

Next year's multiweek event has many logistical challenges as it stretches over three host countries, including 11 U.S. cities. If the 2026 event is to be a success, it may rely both on Trump's love of pageantry and his relationship with Infantino, who sat with him Sunday and who has spent more time with Trump during his second term than any president or prime minister.

Infantino — who needs a smooth relationship with Trump — has met with him at Mar-a-Lago and traveled with him to Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Last week, he opened a new FIFA office in Trump Tower in Manhattan.

In recent weeks, complaints have already been raised about quality of the grass on the fields, the heat for midday matches, and partially filled stadiums.

The World Cup is likely to bring a host of other organizational and political challenges, especially amid the Trump administration's harsh crackdown on immigration.

Will international fans and players be welcomed to stadiums in American cities that Trump has threatened over their more open immigration policies — and will the president be welcomed at an opening match played in Los Angeles, where he recently deployed National Guard troops?

What happens to the Iranian national team, which has already qualified for the World Cup, and the traveling fans who want to cheer their home country team but are  banned from entering the United States? Other countries whose citizens Trump could ban — such as Ghana, Cabo Verde, and Egypt —  might also qualify to be among the 48 nations competing.

And how will the United States coordinate with co-hosts Canada and Mexico  during trade and immigration threats?

While Trump administration officials have sought to assure the world that they are capable of staging what they are calling “the largest sporting event in history,” Trump has also relished the uncertainty over how it will play out.

“Oh I think it's going to make it more exciting,” Trump said in March during an appearance in the Oval Office with Infantino. “Tension's a good thing.”

Trump, more than many presidents, has embraced sports as a cultural touchstone and a way to expand his reach. He has attended the Daytona 500 and wants to host a UFC match at the White House. He pushed Major League Baseball to reinstate Pete Rose, bashed NFL players for protesting racial inequality during his first term, and this year became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl.

He has been less connected with soccer — although golf caddies reportedly nicknamed him Pelé after seeing him frequently kick his ball onto the fairway — but has taken pride in hosting the World Cup. The event will come next summer as America celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding, an event that Trump has also been heavily involved in planning, and two years before Los Angeles hosts the Olympics.

Trump in March appointed Andrew Giuliani, son of close Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, as executive director of a World Cup task force he created to oversee planning and coordinating. Trump's signature legislation — the One Big Beautiful Bill — included $625 million for security and other costs related to the World Cup, and some of his immigration policies have included carve-outs for soccer players and coaches, even as people from their country could be barred from attending.

“We want these games to be safe and secure,” Giuliani said in an interview. “While yes, we want to make sure we welcome the world in, we also want to make sure we're not sacrificing our national security posture.”

But there have been growing concerns that Trump's immigration policies will dampen enthusiasm for an event that is marked by its global flavor, one where an Iranian can sit next to an American and watch their teams compete or where Argentines and Brazilians chant on subway rides to a stadium.

“The World Cup? You mean the cup where the world is not invited? Because that's what this is,” said Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, which has sent letters to FIFA urging it to pressure Trump to change his policies.

“Trump wants the glory and the swanning around with leaders and soccer players,” Worden added. “But the World Cup is supposed to be an inclusive celebration of humanity. And that inclusive celebration of humanity part is not something Trump is celebrating.”

Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said Trump is committed “to promoting national pride, hospitality, and economic opportunity.”

“These games will be a historic opportunity to unite the nation, celebrate America, and reinforce our status as a premier global destination for major events,” he said.

Giuliani has asked his staff  to review what worked during the recent club games ahead of next year's broader event, which World Cup organizers expect to attract far more people.

Giuliani said about a quarter to a third of those accredited to attend the Club World Cup matches during the past few months needed visas, and he helped ensure that State Department and FIFA officials updated the frequency of their meetings to address any processing issues.

“The visa process is extremely important in making sure that we are vetting people properly but also making sure we welcome the world here,” he said.

There is also worry that soccer matches could be targets for immigration enforcement. Ahead of Club World Cup matches last month, Customs and Border Protection wrote on social media that it would be “suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games,” which triggered concerns about arrests at stadiums. The  post was deleted.

“Who wants to have to bring their passport to a Club World Cup game that's supposed to be fun with your friends and family?” Worden said, cautioning that FIFA needs to help assure that “the World Cup games aren't a magnet for ICE for agents to scoop up people who look Hispanic.”

Giuliani said immigration officials would not target stadiums where matches were being played.

“We've had 62 games at this point and that has not been an issue at all,” he said. “That was a narrative at the very beginning of this tournament that has been proven that this is not something we're targeting here.”

Trump in June signed an executive order that restricts foreign nationals from 12 countries from entering the United States. Iran, which has qualified for the World Cup, is among the targeted countries, a list that could grow if Trump decides to broaden the order.

The order provides exemptions specifically for players and coaches in the World Cup, as well as support staff and immediate family members. But it doesn't include fans. Human rights groups have also warned that fans from countries that are not officially banned from visiting might think twice, given Trump's  border policies.

Giuliani said that the U.S. is still working with FIFA and awaiting the results of  qualification matches to figure out which countries will be competing, and how to handle administration policies with countries  such as Iran.

“This is a dynamic situation right now,” Giuliani said. “This will have to be a conversation between some of the task force members and probably even the president himself in terms of what this looks like moving forward.”

Jannik Sinner was able to get revenge over Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon after his defeat in the Roland Garros final.

Sinner and Alcaraz have a good relationship, despite being the top two ranked players on the ATP Tour and direct rivals for the biggest titles.

They have now played their first two Grand Slam finals against one another, with Alcaraz saving three championship points to beat Sinner at Roland Garros.

In a more one-sided final at Wimbledon, Sinner changed his tactics to beat Alcaraz in four sets on Centre Court.

Sinner intentionally being more aggressive was noticed by former doubles world number one Rennae Stubbs, who pointed this out in a social media post.

While the match was still ongoing, Stubbs claimed that the serve was the biggest difference between Sinner and Alcaraz.

She wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), “Serving has been the difference so far. Big big big from Jannik and using way more aggressive and going for it. He knows he can't hope to win, he learned that in Paris. Has to go for it and be the more aggressive player. Fantastic match so far!”

After the conclusion of the match, which saw Alcaraz's 20-match winning streak at Wimbledon come to an end, Stubbs was full of praise for the new champion.

“What a great two weeks! What a great champion! After what he went through in losing the French Open final and the grace he showed in that defeat, to bounce back and win this title the way he did, absolutely extraordinary @janniksin and team.”

Sinner's more aggressive game style against Alcaraz in the Wimbledon final is noticeable in the match statistics.

The Italian hit both 40 winners and 40 unforced errors, showing that Sinner was not holding back in his shots against Alcaraz.

Stubbs pointed out the serve as a real differential between the two players, with Sinner producing a higher first serve percentage, as well as a higher second serve win percentage.

Sinner now holds three of the four Grand Slam titles, as he looks ahead to his US Open title defence.

Both players will take a couple of weeks away from the matchcourt before potentially reigniting their rivalry at the Canadian Open in Toronto.

Roger Federer's former coach, Ivan Ljubicic, has now made a bold prediction about his former student's future.

The Swiss superstar remains a leading figure in the tennis community, even if he is not quite as involved as he once was.

Having retired in 2022, the 43-year-old now only makes rare but spectacular appearances at the sport to which he gave so much. His recent arrival at Wimbledon was met with rapturous applause, as an eight-time record champion at the event.

It is snippets like this which have many fans craving for his increased involvement within tennis, in any capacity.

Whether it be punditry, exhibition matches, coaching or something else entirely, it's unlikely anyone would care. Just as long as Roger Federer was back on their screens.

The epitome of class and elegance, he was unsurprisingly the dominant topic when Ljubicic spoke to Swiss-German outlet Tages-Anzeiger late last week.

Asked if he felt like Federer might ever return to tennis in a coaching capacity, his answer was firm.

The question posed was: “Federer seems to be at peace with himself after his career. Do you share this impression?”

Ljubicic responded: “Absolutely. He's way too smart to be stressed. I didn't doubt for a second that he would enjoy his life after his career. He still travels a lot, which he loves, has some business obligations. He did a great job. 

“He has remained connected to tennis, with the Laver Cup alone. He still wants to be there, but without having a specific role or function. I don't think he'll ever take one [a coaching job] either.”

Jannik Sinner did surpass a Federer Grand Slam record in reaching the Wimbledon final, and is now on the warpath towards his magic eight titles.

Federer will have been watching Sunday's gentleman's Wimbledon final with interest, given how Carlos Alcaraz has started his career at the All-England Club.

After all, with back-to-back titles over the two previous years, the Spaniard had moved to within six more triumphs of equalling his record.

He stands alone with eight titles, with even the great Novak Djokovic currently falling short. The Serbian seems destined to be stuck on seven with the emergence of Alcaraz and Sinner.

And whilst that might offer some solace to Federer, the 22-year-old is arguably an even bigger threat given how it seems like only one man will challenge him at Wimbledon for the foreseeable future.

At least he will remain the only man to have won his first five Wimbledon finals; unless Sinner is now about to start his own reign of terror on the grass.

THE ALL ENGLAND CLUB, LONDON — Iga Świątek beat Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in the Wimbledon women's final Saturday.

Poland's No. 8 seed prevailed over the No. 13 seed from the United States in a one-sided clinic of a match, ultimately decided by Anisimova's nerves, Świątek's clear-headed tactics and the relentlessness that makes her one of the best players in the world.

This is Świątek's first Wimbledon title, and her sixth Grand Slam title. She is the only active WTA Tour player to hold Grand Slam titles on all three surfaces, is now 6-0 in major finals and is second behind Venus Williams (seven) among active WTA players with the most majors.

It was just the second double bagel in a Grand Slam final in the Open Era, and the first since 1988, when Steffi Graf won the French Open against Natasha Zvereva by the same scoreline. The match lasted only 57 minutes.

The Athletic's writers, Charlie Eccleshare and Matt Futterman, analyze the final, and what it means for tennis.

This was always a danger for a first-time Grand Slam finalist. Świątek had played five before today and never lost one; Anisimova had never been on this stage before.

The American could tell herself for two days since the semis that it was just tennis, the sport she had played her whole life. The court was the same dimensions. Just another match.

And then she walked onto Centre Court in the late afternoon sunshine. There's Princess Catherine of Wales, in the Royal Box with a cadre of luminaries. Well, that's fine. Wimbledon is a major. Famous people come to watch play every day.

And then, unlike her other six matches this fortnight, Anisimova stepped up to the line and… her serve just wouldn't go in. Then her fearsome, peerless backhand wouldn't go in. On the other side of the net, Świątek was returning everything and missing nothing.

Everything looked ready to crumble from there, and that was the story of the first set for Anisimova, a portrait of nerves in action.

She won just nine points to 27 for Świątek. She made 14 unforced errors. Her backhand kept tumbling into the net.

The worst of it was the serve, the shot where each player controls their own destiny. Anisimova kept catching her toss. She made just 33 percent of her first serves. She hit three double faults. It was as though her arms were not attached to the rest of her body.

There's no other explanation. A Grand Slam final. A Wimbledon final. The Princess of Wales. As Carlos Alcaraz said after his first match here this year, “Wimbledon is different.”

Especially the final.

Matt Futterman

Anisimova's biggest strength is her backhand, and so it might have seemed counterintuitive for Świątek to target it in the first set.

But in so doing, she opened up a world of possibilities for herself, while telling Anisimova that her best shot wasn't going to trouble her.

She was constantly moving Anisimova off balance and out of the court by breaking the sideline with her backhands, creating space to exploit on the other side. This was a particularly effective play because Świątek possesses probably the best inside-out backhand in the sport, and that's where the space was to hit into once the players had traded backhands.

When Anisimova got to the ball on the deuce side, her forehand was wayward. She started going for too much, aware of how well Świątek was retrieving, which contributed to the 14 unforced errors she hit in the first set alone, compared to just three winners.

Attacking her backhand also sent out a message that Świątek didn't fear her opponent's biggest strength. She's been criticized for not being as tactically astute as before over the past year, but this was a brutally clear-headed performance.

Charlie Eccleshare

For Świątek, winning Wimbledon may be the most stunning yet predictable moment of what was already a Hall of Fame career.

A month ago, she seemed rattled. The losses had been piling up and she had failed to defend three clay-court titles, including her favorite, the French Open. Her world ranking tumbled to No. 8.

But Świątek had also made the semifinals in both previous majors in 2025, and had been showing signs of embedding the controlled aggression that she and her coach Wim Fissette wanted to be the bread and butter of her game.

That has certainly happened.

In a matter of weeks, she has flipped the script and solved the puzzle — and on the grass of Wimbledon, the surface on which she was wrongly and too quickly written off.

In part, the loss of those three titles may have been a help. The weight of expectation went away. But most of all, Świątek has done what all the great players have done at this tournament. She has thrived where greatness thrives, playing tennis and thinking her way through her shots and her matches.

And in less than an hour today, she became Wimbledon champion, giving her six Grand Slam titles, including one on every tennis surface, just as Ash Barty achieved before she dropped the mic with her retirement at the top of the sport in 2022.

That decision made Świątek the world No. 1. This title makes her the greatest since Serena Williams.

Matt Futterman

When people advocate for making the latter stages of women's Grand Slams best of five sets like the men's events, it's matches like this one that they have in mind.

The best-of-three format means that even after half an hour or less, it can be blindingly obvious which way a final is heading. This only adds to the pressure for the losing player, who feels like there's no time to settle and that their childhood dream is turning into a nightmare.

Alcaraz lost the first five games of the 2023 men's final to Novak Djokovic, but at least he knew there was plenty of time to turn things around.

The format is not why Anisimova got hammered in this final, but it adds to the sympathy everyone felt watching knowing that the match was likely to be over within an hour, as well as to the angst and awkwardness on Centre Court, where everyone was shellshocked at how awfully it was going for the first-time Grand Slam finalist.

Any individual sport is brutally exposing, but tennis is particularly so. If this had been boxing, Anisimova would have been knocked out in the first couple of rounds. That's humiliating, but at least it's over. Here, it was clear where the match was headed after a nervy, error-strewn first couple of games, but Anisimova could do nothing but keep plugging away.

There's no option in tennis to run the clock down and go for damage limitation, and it's hard to say where this leaves Anisimova. Hopefully, with a bit of distance, she can focus on how much of a breakthrough this tournament was. She made her first major final, and earned a win against the world No. 1, Aryna Sabalenka, to get there.

Maybe she can write this off as just a dreadful day where everything went wrong, but there's also the psychological element of essentially having an anxiety dream play out in front of the watching world.

Her team will need to help the 23-year-old see the bigger picture in the next few weeks.

“I didn't even dream of this because it seemed so far away,” she said on court. “I feel like I am already an experienced player, having won Slams before, but I never expected to win this one. So I want to thank my team for believing in me more than I did. And my coach. We have had ups and downs but have shown everybody it is working.”

“I wish I could have put on a better performance for you today, but you guys have still been there for me and lifted me up, so thank you so much,” she said in her on-court interview.

“Without some of my family flying in, I definitely would not be standing here … My mom's put in more work than I have, honestly,” Anisimova added, through tears. “Thank you for being here and breaking the superstition of flying in. It's definitely not why I lost today.

“I'm going to keep putting in the work and I always believe in myself, so I hope I'm going to be back here one day.”

British tennis star Dan Evans has urged people to 'leave Emma Raducanu alone' following her encouraging Wimbledon campaign.

The shock U.S. Open champion reached the third round at SW19.

Raducanu encountered a stern challenge at the All England Club earlier this month when she went head-to-head with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka.

The 22 year old, who stunned the tennis world by claiming the U.S. Open in 2021 as a teenager, had already taken down the likes of former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova ahead of her third-round encounter. Raducanu fought courageously, falling in straight sets 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, and Evans has now made an appeal following this promising display with Flushing Meadows approaching.

"Emma should definitely take a lot from the Sabalenka match," Evans told Tennis365, when asked about the British No. 3's Wimbledon journey this year.



"It was great to see her out there fighting the way she did and I thought she was the better player for long periods of that match against Sabalenka, who is the world No. 1. I'm interested to see what comes next for Emma. She is already back on the court working hard, and I think the summer in America is going to be good for her.

"We always need to manage expectations a little around Emma, but let's leave her alone, let her enjoy playing tennis and she has a decent chance to do well heading into the U.S. Open."

New York served as the backdrop for Raducanu's triumph four years ago, where she overcame players like Belinda Bencic, Maria Sakkari and Leylah Fernandez to claim the US Open title, remaining undefeated in sets until the semifinals.

Following that victory, Raducanu has frequently switched coaches, terminating her partnership with Andrew Richardson merely two weeks after capturing the U.S. Open, a tournament she'll revisit in August despite failing to advance beyond the opening round since her championship.



Her current coaching situation remains unclear. She has collaborated with Mark Petchey intermittently since the Miami Open, and although he guided her to her remarkable SW19 showing, their future partnership remains undetermined.

Evans shared additional thoughts on handling Raducanu while revealing his potential coaching aspirations, though he hasn't retired from playing yet.

"Coaching is something I would look at," Evans acknowledged. "It depends on what opportunity came up and the idea of working with players and see that improvement might be interesting. When you are working on the other side of the fence as a coach, you might argue it gives you even more satisfaction to see a player improving."

Jannik Sinner clinched his first Wimbledon title in a gripping final against Carlos Alcaraz, marking a historic moment in his career. Joining fans in celebrating the victory, tennis legend Maria Sharapova shared a playful tribute by reposting a fun dance video of herself and Sinner.

Following Sinner's first Wimbledon title, Sharapova celebrated his victory with a little throwback video of their dance. In the clip, Sinner and Sharapova are dancing and singing to Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree. The couple filmed the video wearing their PJs and reindeer hats, as reported by ProFootballNetwork. 

Along with the reposted video, she wrote, “It is only appropriate to bring this back to the top of the feed.” Her earlier tweet read, “I knew that one day you'll regret this Congrats Champ!! patience, poise & class.” The video was originally posted during Christmas in 2019. 

Sharapova, at the time, shared the video after Sinner's Australian Open win in January 2024.

A user wrote on X, “Had to check my eyes 2 times to confirm this is Sinner.” A second user wrote, “Maria, you're the real MVP for hyping Sinner like this! Watching you dance and then him win made my day. Tennis magic in full effect!” A third user wrote, “The best congratulations post.” 

One user wrote, “At this rate, he'll never live it down lol,” while another wrote, “Two dopers lowkey. I love sinner tho.” The comment comes after Sinner was put under a ban for drug use.  The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) revealed that Sinner was inadvertently exposed to the banned substance clostebol during a massage by his physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, in March 2024. The contamination was deemed unintentional.

Sinner is now a four-time Grand Slam winner

Jannik Sinner says his and Iga Swiatek's singles title wins at Wimbledon were made "very special" following the doping cases involving them over the past year.

For the first time in Wimbledon history, both the men's and women's champions have served suspensions for banned substances, ensuring that their celebrations have been accompanied by controversy.

With the authorities accepting both players' insistence that the cases were caused by contamination of medication, many are clearly willing to look past the short bans.

But others are concerned about the impact it could have on the image of tennis.

"I don't think it's a good look for the sport," said Australian Nick Kyrgios, when previewing both Wimbledon finals.

Indeed, minutes after Sinner's victory on Sunday, the 2022 finalist posted a cryptic asterisk on social media, widely seen as a reflection of the mixed feelings some have about the men's world number one winning just over two months after completing a doping ban.

When asked by BBC Sport on Monday about those who may feel uneasy about him and Swiatek winning, Sinner said, "Well, me and Iga, we actually talked yesterday about this, and we've been celebrating in a way even more, because it was a very difficult time for her and also for me, and only me and my team and the people who are close to me know exactly how it went.

"There are always going to be some people who believe in you and [who] do not, but this is in everything. So yeah, in a way, it's very special, because it was very, very stressful the time on the last four or five months."

Speaking after her victory on Saturday, Swiatek also hinted at the scrutiny she had been under. 

"The past months, how the media sometimes described me, how they treated me and my team, it wasn't really pleasant", she said. "I hope they will just leave me alone and let me do my job."

So, what were the details of their cases? How did it all get resolved so they could return to action so soon? How do players and officials feel about it? Does it detract from their achievements? And what does it mean for Wimbledon, and the sport more widely?

Swiatek's previous best performance at Wimbledon was reaching the quarter-final in 2023

The six-time Grand Slam winner tested positive for heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample in August 2024, and served a one-month suspension, which ended in early December. 

Commonly used to treat problems such as angina, TMZ increases blood flow to the heart and stimulates the metabolism of glucose, which can improve endurance, which is why it is a banned substance in elite sport. 

Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva was given a four-year ban last year after testing positive for TMZ in a sample before she competed at the 2022 Winter Olympics.

Swiatek's level of fault was considered to be at the lowest end of the range, as the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted it was caused by contamination of a regulated non-prescription medicine, manufactured and sold in Poland, which she said she took for jet lag and sleep issues.

Sinner twice tested positive for low levels of the banned anabolic steroid clostebol - which can be used to build muscle mass - in March 2024.

As with Swiatek, authorities accepted it was caused by the use of an over-the-counter medication and he was cleared of any wrongdoing by an independent tribunal, which decided not to suspend him.  It accepted he had been inadvertently contaminated by his physiotherapist, who was treating a cut on his hand with an over-the-counter spray, which was later found to contain the banned substance.

Significantly, however, the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) appealed against the panel's ruling that Sinner "bore no fault or negligence", and said it was seeking a ban of between one and two years.

A hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) was set for April - but in February, shortly after retaining his Australian Open title, it was announced that Sinner and Wada had reached a controversial settlement, with the Italian then serving just a three-month ban. 

It meant he did not miss any Grand Slam tournaments, and was back in time for the French Open, prompting accusations of favouritism, with some players openly questioning their faith in clean sport. 

There have also been questions over why Sinner's former physio and trainer - who were both deemed responsible for the clostebol entering his system - could have made such a mistake, and why they have not faced any action from the authorities.

Wada had felt the independent tribunal should have punished Sinner for strict liability - that he was ultimately responsible for failing the two drugs tests.

However, it also accepted that Sinner "did not intend to cheat", that the drug "did not provide any performance-enhancing benefit" and this happened "without his knowledge as the result of negligence of members of his entourage". On this basis, it was prepared to reach a settlement with Sinner, rather than go to Cas where the outcome would have either been a ban of at least a year or Sinner being cleared.

"This was a case that was a million miles away from doping," Wada's general counsel Ross Wenzel told BBC Sport.

Similar case resolutions have been allowed since 2021, and Wenzel said Wada had since struck 67 agreements. The code is set to change from 2027, meaning cases where players have failed tests but were deemed not to be at fault - like Sinner - could be punished from just a reprimand to a two-year ban.

In Swiatek's case, Wada did not appeal against her one-month suspension, claiming that its scientific experts "confirmed the specific contaminated melatonin scenario… is plausible and that there would be no scientific grounds to challenge it at Cas".

Numbers behind Swiatek's dominant Wimbledon win

In the wake of Swiatek's punishment, Simona Halep was one of several players who questioned the differences in how doping cases were treated. 

In 2023, the Romanian had received a four-year ban for two anti-doping violations, later reduced to nine months after an appeal.

Reflecting on both cases in December, Kyrgios said: "I think people are trying to sweep it under the rug. I just think that it's been handled horrifically in our sport. Two world number ones both getting done for doping is disgusting for our sport. It's a horrible look."

In the wake of Sinner's suspension, Spanish legend Rafael Nadal said he was "100%" sure that the Italian was innocent, but former British number one Tim Henman claimed the ban was "too convenient" and left tennis fans with a "pretty sour taste".

"When you're dealing with drugs in sport it very much has to be black and white, it's binary, it's positive or negative, you're banned or you're not banned" he told Sky Sports. 

"When you start reading words like settlement or agreement, it feels like there's been a negotiation and I don't think that will sit well with the player cohort and the fans of the sport." 

Serena Williams said she would have been banned for 20 years and had some of her Grand Slam titles taken away if she had committed the same anti-doping offence as men's world number one Sinner. 

British player Tara Moore, who was provisionally banned for two years while challenging a doping charge of which she was eventually cleared after 19 months, also suggested top players were "treated differently", with their image prioritised.

Accusations of preferential treatment and double standards were firmly disputed by the ITIA and Wada.

The ITIA has also highlighted a 26% increase in anti-doping tests in 2024 compared to the previous year, and says educating players about anti-doping rules is a priority.

But many believe both players have benefitted from being able to pay top lawyers to act quickly.

"A majority of the players don't feel that it's fair," said 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic. "It appears that you can almost affect the outcome if you are a top player, if you have access to the top lawyers."

The Professional Tennis Players' Association (PTPA) - an organisation co-founded by Djokovic which aims to increase player power - said there is a lack of "transparency", "process" and "consistency" in the system.

Three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka, writing on social media, said he did not "believe in a clean sport any more".

Sinner-Alcaraz rivalry 'a gift to our sport'

Four times more online abuse of Wimbledon players detected 

Former British number one Greg Rusedski seemed to speak for many in the sport when he told BBC Sport: "I think you have to give them the benefit of the doubt, look at the tennis they have played in this last year, and I think this will all go away in time."

Certainly there seemed little concern from those present at Wimbledon - or the millions watching and listening on - about the backstory of the pair of champions, with the focus on the quality of their play and the ruthlessness of their respective performances.

Perhaps this should come as no surprise, given that doping controversies are far from unusual in tennis. Indeed, fellow Wimbledon winners Halep, Maria Sharapova, Martina Hingis and Andre Agassi also all had positive drugs tests, albeit after winning the championship, rather than before.

"It's a little embarrassing for the sport and, by extension, for Wimbledon, it's a unique and unwelcome double" says public relations expert Tim Jotischky, of the PHA Group.

"However, the evidence suggests that fellow professionals are more upset than the viewing public… the Alcaraz-Sinner rivalry has captured the imagination of sports fans and, whilst Alcaraz is the more popular player, Sinner has never been targeted by spectators.

"That might be because many don't follow the sport closely enough to be aware of the details, but the main reason is probably because tennis still looks like a clean sport, where performance-enhancing drugs have a minimum impact, in a way that athletics and cycling often do not.

"Iga Swiatek's Wimbledon triumph followed a slump in form… that may have helped divert attention away from her ban.

"But tennis cannot be complacent or ignore the concerns of leading professionals. The rules around drugs offences need to be transparent and implemented consistently, regardless of a player's box office appeal."

The All England Lawn Tennis Club has been approached for comment.

Wimbledon finished in some style for Jannik Sinner as the world number one defeated Carlos Alcaraz in four sets to claim his maiden title at the All England Club. 

Sinner managed to come through against Alcaraz despite losing the first set, taking the next three with some seriously solid tennis. 

Bizarrely, Sinner was actually on the cusp of exiting Wimbledon at the last 16 stage when he trailed Grigor Dimitrov two sets to love before he was forced to retire after tearing his pectoral muscle. 

For a number of players, it proved a tournament to remember, whilst for others the third Grand Slam of the year will be one they're keen to move on from very quickly. 

For Sinner and Alcaraz, there is no real need for them to look too closely at the world rankings, with the pair miles clear at the top of the list. 

However, for other players, it's a case of Wimbledon giving them a lift up the rankings and into a better position ahead of the United States swing. 

Taylor Fritz has been swapping places for a few months with Jack Draper, and after making the semi-finals at SW19, he's now back up to fourth place. 

Ben Shelton made the quarter-final at Wimbledon and he too is moving up the rankings and now sits in ninth place when it comes to the world rankings. 

Andrey Rublev is the big winner of Wimbledon, looking at the rankings, with the Russian player moving up four places from 14th to the top 10. 

With three of the four Grand Slams now completed, attention does start turning towards the end-of-year competition that takes place in Turin. 

Wimbledon has done the world of good for some players and the race looks set to be electric when it comes to making the end-of-year showdown.

The top eight players on the one-year list contest the event, which takes place in Italy and right now it looks like it will be a very close run event. 

Sinner and Alcaraz once again look like being the players to beat at the event, with the world number one claiming success at last year's event.

Carlos Alcaraz's status as two-time defending Wimbledon champion ended after he lost to Jannik Sinner on Sunday evening

The Spaniard was no match for an imperious Sinner, who registered a masterclass in baseline control and court cover to knock Alcaraz off his perch.

It was only a month ago that Alcaraz saved three match points against Sinner in the French Open final before going on to add a fifth Grand Slam to his collection, a match which added more layers to a ‘special' rivalry.

Following the Wimbledon final, it will now be the Spaniard seeking revenge when the US Open rolls around in August.

Ahead of the US Open, one journalist told the Spaniard not to do something which may hamper his chances of completing the career Grand Slam.

Despite losing the Wimbledon final, Carlos Alcaraz remains just one Grand Slam victory away from completing the career Grand Slam: victory at the Australian Open.

Only eight male players have achieved the landmark in tennis history: Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, Andre Agassi, Fred Perry and Don Budge.

The achievement consists of winning all four Grand Slams and acts as a hallmark of player's ability to play on all surfaces.

David Law, speaking on the Tennis Podcast after Sinner's victory over Alcaraz, discussed who will achieve the career Grand Slam first: Iga Swiatek, Carlos Alcaraz or Jannik Sinner.

Law said: “I think I would go Alcaraz. I think he'll regroup, and I hope he has a sensible off-season or whatever that is. You know, something.

“Just to recharge and come out firing in Australia. Well, not playing a load of exhibitions in the middle of goodness knows where, you know? 

“I don't know what all that's about. I think it's stupid. He's got enough money.

“He played Madison Square Garden last year. Was that at the end of the season? He played in Charlotte against Frances Tiafoe. 

“He plays in the Middle East and stuff like that. I just think, just rest up and make sure you're ready to go in Australia.”

Following the loss, a member of Spanish royalty took time to congratulate the Spaniard on his Wimbledon 2025 performance.

An account concerning information about the activities of the Spanish Royal Family and the House of King Felipe VI of Spain, said: “The King has congratulated Carlos Alcaraz after the Wimbledon 2025 final for his great participation in the tournament. 

“Thank you Carlos Alcaraz! You have made us enjoy another thrilling final by giving your very best.“

The King made more headlines in June, after naming tennis legend Rafael Nadal as Marquess of Llevant de Mallorca.

In the post-Wimbledon edition of the PIF WTA Rankings, champion Iga Swiatek is back in the Top 3, quarterfinalist Mirra Andreeva enters the Top 5, runner-up Amanda Anisimova makes her Top 10 debut and semifinalist Belinda Bencic returns to the Top 20.

This year's Wimbledon began with a record-setting slew of upsets, as four Top 10 seeds exited in the first round, and ended with Iga Swiatek claiming her sixth Grand Slam trophy in style.

Swiatek entered Wimbledon ranked No. 4 and seeded No. 8, her lowest at a Grand Slam in over four years. She had not reached a final in 13 months, and her 3-year, 2-month stint inside the Top 2 had ended in May. The Pole responded in style, dropping just one set in seven matches to win her first Wimbledon crown -- indeed, her first grass-court title. Swiatek concluded her run by winning 20 straight games, wrapping up the first 6-0, 6-0 Grand Slam final since Stefanie Graf's whitewash of Natasha Zvereva at Roland Garros 1988 and improving her record in major finals to 6-0.

Swiatek returns to the Top 3 in the PIF WTA Rankings after an eight-week absence, climbing one to No. 3. That's just one of the many significant moves this week, from players hitting brand new career milestones to those on the way back to former highs. Here's how they break down.

Mirra Andreeva, +2 to No. 5: Andreeva breaks into the Top 5 for the first time after reaching her first Wimbledon quarterfinal. The 18-year-old is the youngest player to make her Top 5 debut since a 17-year-old Maria Sharapova in November 2004.

Amanda Anisimova, +5 to No. 7: Wimbledon runner-up Anisimova makes her Top 10 debut after notching her first win over a reigning World No. 1 (Aryna Sabalenka in the semifinals) to reach her first major final. This time last year, the American was ranked No. 175 after falling in the last round of Wimbledon qualifying to Eva Lys. Anisimova is the second player to crack the Top 10 for the first time in 2025, following Andreeva in February.

Clara Tauson, +3 to No. 19: Tauson enters the Top 20 for the first time after defeating former champion Elena Rybakina to reach the fourth round of Wimbledon -- her second time in the last 16 of a Grand Slam. She is the third player to make her Top 20 debut in 2025, following Yulia Putintseva in January and Anisimova in February.

Hailey Baptiste, +7 to No. 48: The 23-year-old American cracks the Top 50 after reaching the Wimbledon third round. Baptiste also made the fourth round of Roland Garros this year.

Jessica Bouzas Maneiro, +12 to No. 50: One year ago, Bouzas Maneiro caused a splash at Wimbledon by ousting defending champion Marketa Vondrousova in the first round and reaching the third round. Twelve months on, the 22-year-old Spaniard went one better to make the last 16 of a major for the first time, and makes her Top 50 debut as a result.

Solana Sierra, +34 to No. 67: Sierra became the first lucky loser in the Open Era to make the Wimbledon fourth round, and the first Argentinian woman since Paola Suárez in 2004. The 20-year-old had also qualified for last year's US Open and this year's Roland Garros, but this result was the first time she had posted wins at tour level. Having cracked the Top 100 for the first time two weeks before Wimbledon, Sierra soars to a new career high in the Top 75.

Elsa Jacquemot, +18 to No. 95: At Roland Garros, Jacquemot lost a third-round heartbreaker to compatriot Lois Boisson -- who went on to reach the semifinals. The 22-year-old Frenchwoman has used that result as a springboard, though. Jacquemot qualified for Wimbledon and notched her first career Top 30 win over Magda Linette to make the second round; then, last week, she made her second career WTA 125 final in Contrexéville. She becomes the 17th player to make her Top 100 debut in 2025.

Belinda Bencic, +15 to No. 20: As recently as the start of November 2024, Bencic was unranked as she began her comeback from maternity leave. Last week, the Swiss former No. 4 reached her second career Grand Slam semifinal at Wimbledon -- nearly six years after her first at the 2019 US Open. Bencic returns to the Top 20 for the first time since January 2024.

Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, +20 to No. 30: Pavlyuchenkova bounced back from a bout of Lyme disease this spring to reach her second Wimbledon quarterfinal, and is back in the Top 30 for the first time since February. Pavlyuchenkova's Wimbledon result was her 10th career major quarterfinal, also including the Australian Open in January -- but this is just the second time (following 2011) that she has made more than one in a single season.

Laura Siegemund, +50 to No. 54: The largest numerical jump in this week's Top 100 belongs to former No. 27 Laura Siegemund, who reached her second Grand Slam quarterfinal at Wimbledon (following Roland Garros 2020). The 37-year-old German defeated Madison Keys in the third round for her second Top 10 win at a major this year, and soars back to her highest ranking since August 2021. Siegemund had won just two main-draw matches at Wimbledon in five appearances before this year.

Elisabetta Cocciaretto, +40 to No. 76: The Italian had been forced to pull out of Wimbledon 2024 due to pneumonia -- the start of a battle with her health that contributed to her falling out of the Top 100 in May. Cocciaretto bounced back in style, reaching the Wimbledon third round after claiming her first career Top 5 win over Jessica Pegula in the first round. The 24-year-old, who reached her career high of No. 29 in August 2023, followed her Wimbledon run by claiming the Bastad WTA 125 title last week.

Aliaksandra Sasnovich, +15 to No. 92: Since last August, former No. 29 Sasnovich had been ranked outside the Top 100 for all but two weeks. She qualified for Wimbledon and won the longest match of The Championships -- a 3-hour, 24-minute triumph from match point down to defeat Varvara Gracheva 6-4, 6-7(5), 7-6[8] -- to reach the second round.

Diane Parry, +20 to No. 98: Parry qualified for Wimbledon and upset Diana Shnaider in the second round for her second Top 20 win. Her fourth career third-round finish at a major means that the 22-year-old Frenchwoman returns to the Top 100.

Caty McNally, +73 to No. 135: McNally reached the Wimbledon second round, where she was the only player to win a set from Swiatek all fortnight. The American built on that result in style, claiming her second career WTA 125 title last week in Newport. Having been sidelined for eight months in 2024 due to elbow surgery, former No. 54 McNally's comeback has gained momentum -- she's back in the Top 200 for the first time since February 2024.

Linda Noskova, +4 to No. 23: Noskova reached the fourth round of Wimbledon -- her second time in the second week of a Grand Slam.

Ashlyn Krueger, +2 to No. 29: Krueger enters the Top 30 for the first time after making the Wimbledon second round.

Tatjana Maria, +9 to No. 36: Queen's champion Maria reached the Newport WTA 125 final last week, and at the age of 37 enters the Top 40 for the first time. Her previous career high was No. 42, set in January 2024.

Sonay Kartal, +7 to No. 44: Kartal was the last British player standing at Wimbledon after making the fourth round of a major for the first time, and returns to the Top 50 as a result.

Zeynep Sonmez, +14 to No. 74: At Wimbledon, Sonmez made history by becoming the first Turkish player, male or female, to reach the third round of a major in the Open Era.

Anastasia Zakharova, +13 to No. 82: After kicking off the grass swing by making the second round of Queen's as a qualifier, Zakharova repeated the feat at Wimbledon, upsetting former World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka in the first round.

Victoria Mboko, +11 to No. 86: The 18-year-old Canadian made the second round of Wimbledon as a lucky loser, notching her first career Top 30 win over Magdalena Frech to do so.

Francesca Jones, +18 to No. 104: Jones, 24, claimed the first WTA 125 trophy of her career last week in Contrexéville. The Briton has also won clay-court titles at the Vacaria and Prague ITF W75s this year.

Veronika Erjavec, +34 to No. 137: The 25-year-old Slovenian qualified for her second Grand Slam of the year at Wimbledon, then upset Marta Kostyuk in the first round for her maiden Top 30 win and first tour-level victory.

Oleksandra Oliynykova, +23 to No. 170: Oliynykova claimed her first ITF W75 title in The Hague last week. The 24-year-old Ukrainian has compiled a 24-4 record since April.

Carson Branstine, +16 to No. 178: Branstine defeated compatriot and former junior doubles partner Bianca Andreescu en route to qualifying for her first Grand Slam main draw at Wimbledon.

Darja Vidmanova, +68 to No. 181: Reigning NCAA singles champion Vidmanova compiled a 15-match winning streak in June and July, culminating in her first ITF W100 title in Cary two weeks ago. The 22-year-old Czech enters the Top 200 for the first time.

Emerson Jones, +17 to No. 190: Junior No. 1 Jones makes her Top 200 debut -- becoming the first 2008-born player to do so -- after the 17-year-old Australian reached the third round of Wimbledon qualifying.

Janice Tjen, +22 to No. 199: Tjen extended her winning streak to 25 matches with her fifth title in a row, and sixth of 2025, at the Taipei ITF W35 three weeks ago. The 23-year-old Pepperdine University alumna becomes the first Indonesian player to be ranked in the Top 200 since Angelique Widjaja in June 2005.

Monika Ekstrand, +134 to No. 353:The 18-year-old American reached her first ITF W100 final in Cary two weeks ago. Ekstrand has compiled a 30-12 record in 2024, also including two ITF W35 titles.

Vittoria Paganetti, +122 to No. 503: The 19-year-old Italian, a former Top 20 junior who made her WTA debut in Rome last year, claimed the first ITF W35 title of her career in Tarvisio three weeks ago.

Mariella Thamm, +93 to No. 591: The 15-year-old German is now the second-highest ranked 2009-born player (following Julieta Pareja) after winning her first pro title at the Kamen ITF W15 three weeks ago.

Ida Wobker, UNR to No. 878: Thamm defeated an even younger compatriot, 14-year-old Wobker, in the Kamen final. Wobker followed that by reaching the Stuttgart Vaihingen ITF W35 quarterfinals and has started her career with an 11-4 pro record. She's the third 2010-born player to reach the Top 1,000 following Jana Kovackova and Kristina Liutova.

Kamilla Rakhimova, +11 to No. 69: Rakhimova upset 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini in the Wimbledon second round for her first career Top 10 win.

Cristina Bucsa, +9 to No. 93: Bucsa reached the third round of a major for the second time after defeating 2024 semifinalist Donna Vekic at Wimbledon, her sixth career Top 30 win.

Katarzyna Kawa, +17 to No. 115: Bogota finalist Kawa was also runner-up at the Bastad WTA 125 last week. The 32-year-old Pole is just three places beneath the career high of No. 112 that she set in November 2020.

Tamara Zidansek, +18 to No. 188: Former Roland Garros semifinalist Zidansek claimed the Bucharest ITF W75 trophy two weeks ago -- her first title at any level since the 2023 Bari WTA 125.

Kaja Juvan, +33 to No. 207: After being sidelined for 12 months in 2024-25 due to a shoulder nerve issue and returning to action unranked in January, Juvan qualified for the first Grand Slam of her comeback at Wimbledon.

Nikola Bartunkova, +112 to No. 339: Bartunkova, 19, won 11 straight matches over the past two weeks, claiming the Stuttgart Vaihingen ITF W35 title as a qualifier then making the Aschaffenburg ITF W50 final.

Vitalia Diatchenko, +146 to No. 439: Former No. 71 Diatchenko returned to action in April after a six-month hiatus. The 34-year-old won the first title of her comeback at last week's Corroios ITF W50.

Lucie Havlickova, UNR to No. 948: Former junior No. 1 Havlickova returned to action in June unranked after a 13-month hiatus.

Jannik Sinner's triumph in the Wimbledon final was more than just another tick in the Grand Slam box.

The Italian's victory avenged a brutal loss to Alcaraz in the French Open final, a match in which he spurned three match points in a row before going on to lose.

The world number one had been destined for greatness ever since his ATP Next Gen Finals victory in 2019, and his potential has blossomed into generational talent on the court.

Sinner has now won three of the last four Grand Slams, and looks unlikely to slow down anytime soon.

One figure who has been influential in his success is Darren Cahill. Sinner and Cahill started working together in July 2022.

The Australian coach, who has also worked with Andre Agassi, discussed the rivalry between Sinner and Alcaraz after the Wimbledon final on Sunday evening.

Speaking to the media after Sinner's victory on Sunday evening, Cahill, who has also worked with Andy Murray and Simona Halep during his career, was honest about the influence Carlos Alcaraz has on Jannik Sinner's mindset and performance.

Cahill, who is set to leave Sinner's coaching team at the end of 2025, said: “Jannik watches more Carlos matches than he does anybody else.

“Because he's fascinated with the improvements coming in his game and he's pushing us as coaches to make sure that he's improving also as a tennis player. 

“The rivalry is real. It's there. Hopefully it's going to be there and real for the next 10 or 12 years.”

Before Sunday's final, the rivalry – described as ‘special' by Jim Courier – was looking a little one-sided, with Alcaraz having won their previous five encounters.

However, Sinner's victory righted the ship somewhat, proving to tennis fans that he is more than capable of competing with his Spanish rival on a surface Alcaraz has been so dominant on for the past two years.

Sinner did not merely set records on a global stage, he smashed records for his home country too.

By winning his first Wimbledon title, Sinner became the first Italian in tennis history to claim men's or women's Singles titles on multiple surfaces at Grand Slam events.

Sinner also became the first Italian to lift the Wimbledon trophy, going one step further than compatriot, Jasmine Paolini, who lost in the women's singles final in 2024.

The world number one will look to add a fourth Grand Slam in five when he competes at the US Open in August.

   04:15 EDT 14 Jul 2025, updated  09:13 EDT 14 Jul 2025    By DOMINIC HOGAN  

Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner traded their tennis whites for some very sharp cocktail wear on Sunday night as the two new Wimbledon singles champions starred at the Champions Dinner. 

Swiatek won the women's tournament in just 57 minutes, double-bageling American Amanda Anisimova in emphatic fashion on Saturday, to become the first Polish singles champion. 

Then on Sunday, Sinner took on double defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the second installment of a growing rivalry at the top of men's tennis, avenging his defeat from the French Open just over a month ago. 

As is traditional at Wimbledon, the two champions featured at a special dinner marking the end of another Championships at SW19. 

Both stars were dressed for the occasion - Swiatek wore a glamourous lilac gown by Stella McCartney worth more than $2,000, and Sinner, who is an ambassador for Italian fashion house Gucci, sported a custom dark suit and tie with a pair of the brand's signature loafers. 

And overcoming any potential awkwardness, the two champions gamely shared an adorable dance on stage to applause and cheers. 

The Champions Dinner used to feature a formal ball to commemorate the tournament, however the musical element was scrapped decades ago. 

Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams notably danced to Night Fever by the Bee Gees back in 2015 in a playful take on the former tradition, though the feature has not yet returned formally. 

The Italian revealed to BBC Sport how emotional he was after securing a memorable four-set victory over Alcaraz for his fourth major crown, describing it as 'the most amazing thing' that could have happened to him.

'Only me and the people who are close to me know exactly what we have been through on and off the court, and it has been everything except easy,' he said. 

'[It is] very emotional, even if I don't cry. To share this moment with my whole family here, it's the most amazing thing that could have happened to me.'

Sinner's victory comes just 10 weeks after he returned from a three-month ban following two positive tests for banned substance clostebol. 

Meanwhile, Swiatek, whose final was far more routine in its brutality, admitted her triumph was beyond even her own dreams. 

'It seems super surreal,' the now-six-time Grand Slam champion admitted. 

'Honestly, I didn't even dream of winning Wimbledon because it was way too far. I feel like I'm an experienced player, having won other Slams, but I didn't expect this.'

The Cincinnati Open and the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers are two great picks.

At the Cincinnati Open, Jannik Sinner clinched the men's singles title last year, demonstrating remarkable resilience despite battling injuries. 

On the women's side, Aryna Sabalenka finally triumphed, breaking a semi-final curse to claim the championship. A notable performance came from Paula Badosa, who made a strong comeback run to the semifinals after injury.

The National Bank Open saw an amazing story unfold in men's singles, with Alexei Popyrin, an unseeded player, becoming a giant-slayer to win his first Masters 1000 title.

In the women's draw, Jessica Pegula successfully defended her title, showing her consistent dominance in Canada. 

Another standout was Amanda Anisimova, who reached the women's final as a particularly lower-ranked player.

The 2024 US Open crowned Jannik Sinner as the men's singles champion and Aryna Sabalenka as the women's singles champion.

Sinner, the top seed, had a strong run, showing his powerful game and dropping only two sets throughout the tournament. He defeated American Taylor Fritz in the final in straight sets, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, securing his second Grand Slam title of the year.

Sabalenka, the second seed, claimed her first US Open title by overcoming American Jessica Pegula in a tight final, 7-5, 7-5. 

After her recent performance at Wimbledon, Aryna Sabalenka shared how it compared to the crowd at the US Open.

Her journey included dropping just one set before the final, demonstrating her aggressive play, especially in overcoming a comeback bid from Pegula in the second set.

With one hand already on the trophy, nearly three hours into one of the biggest matches of his career, Jannik Sinner's worst humiliation may well have played on his mind.

It had only been five weeks since the Italian had squandered three championship points for the French Open title, before losing in five sets to Carlos Alcaraz. Sinner's rival had won the last five matches against him going into their next title clash, the biggest match on the tennis calendar.

During Sunday's Wimbledon final, Sinner had once again used his measured, yet destructive, game to find the decisive breakthrough for a 2-1 sets lead and was up a break in the fourth. But with Alcaraz charging at him again, the Italian was once again staring at the possibility of slipping up, with the Spaniard up double break point in the eighth game of the set.

For Sinner, during his ascent to the top of men's tennis, his consistency and composure has been as much of a hallmark of his game as his pure ball-striking and baseline domination. The World No.1 hardly shows any sign of cracking under the pressure of the spotlight, repetitively executing his fine-tuned game plans with near perfection. This is what made the French Open final such an oddity. And on Sunday, it would be confirmed that what happened in Paris was no more than that.

Sinner would find his best serving form when needed, quell Alcaraz's late charge this time around, and round out a deserved 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory to win his first Wimbledon title and fourth Major trophy: his first away from hard courts. He became the first Italian, male or female, to win the singles title at SW19, and now holds three of the four Grand Slam titles. He handed Alcaraz his first defeat in a Major final.

“It's mostly emotional, because I had a very tough loss in Paris,” Sinner said on court after victory. “But at the end of the day, it doesn't really matter how you win or how you lose at important tournaments, you just have to understand what you did wrong and try to work on that, and that's exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and just kept working. This is for sure one of the reasons I am holding this trophy here.”

The match did not have the same epic feel of their clash in Paris last month. Instead, it was a slow-burner – perhaps even a tad boring compared to some of the other resounding encounters this duo has already produced – in which Sinner was decidedly better in the baseline exchanges, constantly keeping Alcaraz uncomfortable when they went toe-to-toe, groundstroke for groundstroke.

The Spaniard is the more experienced, the better grass player; he was vying to become only the fifth man to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles. Key to that success is his charismatic spark; he is able to produce scintillating tennis at important moments, his very best tennis is better than anyone around at the moment.

But at his lows, Alcaraz is not as steady and composed as Sinner. Cold-blooded and merciless, the latter took advantage of an off-colour Alcaraz, relentlessly pulverising the ball from the baseline, returning his sloppy serves with vindictiveness, and himself keeping a level head through it all. Alcaraz would fall prey to the same metronomic consistency that proved to be too much for seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in their semifinal a couple of days prior.

The match kicked off with the two feeling each other out and while Alcaraz constantly attempted to go up another gear, Sinner fended him off until the final exchanges of the first set, in which the Spaniard outclassed him on the crucial points to run away with the opener.

But Sinner's steadiness prevailed from there. He picked up an early break and contended with a peaking Alcaraz throughout the second, serving phenomenally, and himself found some clutch shots toward the end of the set to level the scores.

From there, Alcaraz simply dipped. His forehand was leaking more errors than it was painting the lines. His first-serve success rate fell to 44 percent in the third and fourth sets. His deftness at the net and usually fine touch betrayed him.

Instead, it was Sinner who took all the initiative. He used his first-strike power to take control before moving to the forecourt to win points – as opposed to the more baseline-heavy strategy he used at Roland Garros. He approached the net double the number of times that Alcaraz did throughout this match and had a higher success rate. He found sting behind his backhand, especially when he took it down the line while returning second serves.

And even as the familiar fears began creeping in at the back end of the fourth set, Sinner's best came out, and vindication was achieved. Not many players would have backed up their worst humiliation with their career's biggest triumph in such emphatic fashion against the same opponent in just over a month. For such a no-frills player, no wonder the Italian was so emotional at the end.

The BBC had a solid fortnight at Wimbledon, with many of the strengths and weaknesses of its coverage the same as ever. Since Sue Barker was, incorrectly, moved on, Clare Balding has been the lead presenter, supported by Isa Guha, and the pundit roster of John McEnroe, Martina Navratilova, Billie Jean King, Pat Cash, Tracy Austin, Tim Henman and Annabel Croft is a line-up that is firmly settled indeed, and bordering on stuck in the mud.

That said, the booking of Andre Agassi for the men's semi-final was a real coup. He was a breath of fresh air, charismatic and full of insights. The only downside was that he rather showed up some of the regulars. Andrew Castle didn't have a great tournament and has taken on the unfortunate status of the commentator that many watchers say they love to hate, and that can be a difficult position from which to escape, particularly if there's an A+ alternative like Andrew Cotter warming the bench.

One particular exchange with Agassi during the Carlos Alcaraz-Taylor Fritz semi-final found Castle wittering on about the various celebrities in the Royal Box and pointing them out to his American guest. This column bows to nobody in its admiration of Dame Elaine Paige, whose dominance of elite musical theatre in the early eighties saw her put together a sustained run of excellence with Evita-Cats-Chess-Sunset Boulevard, the likes of which we may never see again. But she was, unsurprisingly, not a figure of interest for Agassi. On and on Castle went, past the woman who had a top-10 hit with the haunting Memory from Cats, past Benedict Cumberbatch and Sachin Tendulkar, eventually offering up for Andre's consideration the wretched personage of Sir Nick Clegg, at whose mention the Las Vegas native had finally had enough.

Castle: “That was Nick Clegg, our former deputy prime minister.”

Agassi: “People watching are watching for tennis, not for this.”

Can we keep him?

For the final itself, McEnroe had his US commentary duties, so it was Henman and Castle with Todd Woodbridge. Henman and Woodbridge are perfectly acceptable co-commentators but not going to race the pulse. One wonders if Castle has been instructed to give a “this is a national occasion not just a sports match” general interest feel to the commentary because there was again a lot of stuff about the celebs on show, the vibe around Wimbledon and all that. With such an exciting match-up, you'd have hoped the sport could speak for itself.

Another tennis star who has given the BBC coverage something different in recent years is Nick Kyrgios, but he had not been hired by the Beeb this time and instead had been snapped up by TNT Sports, which showed both finals live. Obviously the viewing figures will be a tiny fraction of the free-to-air BBC but, as Des Lynam wrote in these pages recently, rival broadcasters are circling for tennis and you wouldn't bet on the crown jewel being screwed down in the BBC display case forever if Wimbledon rights went on the open market.

That's tomorrow's problem, but over on TNT Sports on Sunday, an experiment: “Wimbledon Watchalong”. A nice idea, and fortunately not a clone of the Jeff Stelling Soccer Saturday format where you don't get to see the action but instead have it erratically relayed to you by Paul Merson. In fact, the pictures of the Centre Court action were as on the BBC, with commentary from Alastair Eykyn but, innovatively, a studio panel of Dan Evans, Kyrgios and CoCo Vandeweghe chipping in with observations.

Some were very illuminating, such as Evans explaining about how Alcaraz was varying where he stood to receive the second serve. Some were enjoyably revealing, such as Kyrgios saying: “When I used the underarm serve it is disrespectful to the game but when anyone else does it they are a genius”. Others were just left-field, such as the Aussie issuing a come-and-get me plea to Anne Hathaway: “I'd love to invite her [to sit in my player's box]. She's my celebrity crush.” Vandeweghe's advice? “Shoot your shot.”

Overall, the format worked, not least because it was helmed with humour and grace by Craig Doyle, who managed to get the best out of the unpredictable Kyrgios. Bit different, would watch again. The BBC's coverage, by contrast, is due a refresh.

The 2025 ATP Los Cabos Open, formally known as the Mifel Tennis Open by Telcel Oppo, marks the beginning of the North American hard-court swing. Andrey Rublev is the top seed alongside many other fantastic players. As always, we at LWOT will offer predictions for every match on the slate. But who will advance?

Head-to-Head: first meeting

World No. 182 Alibek Kachmazov had a good run in Chengdu last year but hasn't won a Tour-level match this season. He will be looking to do that against Juan Pablo Ficovich, who is higher ranked but has never won a tour-level match on hard courts. Ficovich plays most of his tennis on clay and will find it hard to adapt quickly against a good striker like Kachmazov.
Prediction: Kachmazov in 3

Head-to-Head: Daniel 1-0 Hernandez

It has been a forgettable season for the former World No. 58 Taro Daniel as he has failed to win a single tour-level match and is currently ranked outside the Top 150. Daniel desperately needs some match wins. He is a good player on hard courts and can go on a run here if he can find his best tennis. He will face the local wild card, Alex Hernandez, who has just one tour-level win to his name. The Japanese player doesn't have the form, but he should use his experience to win this one.
Prediction: Daniel in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

This should be a close encounter between Aleksandar Vukic and Emilio Nava. Vukic, rated No. 93, has a 5-16 record this year, which is his career worst to this point. Nava, on the other hand, has one Tour-level win this season but has won a lot of matches at the Challenger level and will like his chances in this one. Nava's aggressive style may test Vukic's consistency on the fast Los Cabos hard courts. If Vukic doesn't serve at a high rate, he will most likely lose this one.
Predictions: Nava in 3

Head-to-Head: first meeting

Aleksandar Kovacevic has reached the Los Cabos Open quarterfinals in both his appearances and will look to advance further this time. He is the highest seed playing on Day 1 and has played some good tennis on this surface this season. Hady Habib's aggressive style could pose a threat, but he hasn't been winning a lot of matches recently. I am leaning towards the American player.
Prediction: Kovacevic in 3

LONDON (AP) — Jannik Sinner's Wimbledon title might mean he'll be able to keep Darren Cahill around as one of his coaches beyond this season — by winning the friendly wager they made before Sunday's final at the All England Club.

Back in January, while Sinner was on his way to winning the Australian Open, it came out that Cahill would be leaving his role as one of the No. 1-ranked player's two coaches at the end of the 2025.

After Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 for the championship at Wimbledon on Sunday, Cahill was asked whether he would reconsider the decision to depart the team.

“I don't want to answer this,” Cahill responded. “You know what? You just need to ask Jannik that.”

So an Italian reporter followed those instructions and did put the topic to Sinner, who smiled and paused.

“It depends,” Sinner began, “Whether I want to tell the truth or not.”

And then he proceeded to explain the whole situation in Italian, revealing that maybe Cahill's exit is not set in stone, after all.

That's because the two of them had a conversation on Saturday night.

“We had a bet before the final. He said: ‘If you win tomorrow, you can decide whether or not I stay,'” Sinner recounted. “Now the choice is mine. I've always looked for a person who is honest, a person who gives me a lot, not necessarily only on the tennis court, but (about) how to live.”

Sinner went on to say that he would love to have Cahill stick around. Sinner also did acknowledge that if Cahill did continue to work alongside co-coach Simone Vagnozzi, Cahill probably would not travel on tour as much as he does currently.

“The season is long. There are a lot of tournaments. You never know,” Sinner said. “But let's just say I won the bet, and so we'll see what happens.”

As far as turning points in Grand Slam finals go, the one that changed the complexion of the 2025 Wimbledon men's title match wasn't especially dramatic or memorable. It wasn't a spectacular get, or a powerhouse forehand. It didn't happen in a tiebreaker, or at a seemingly crucial moment.It was just a routine forehand that Carlos Alcaraz sent long at 30-40 in the first game of the second set. But it gave Jannik Sinner a service break, and all the momentum he would need to cross the finish line two hours later.Up to that point, the match had looked destined to end with Alcaraz holding the trophy for the third straight time. Down 2-4 in the first set, he took control by knocking Sinner backward with the power of one of his forehands, and broke serve. From there, he won four straight games to steal that set, and capped his comeback with a genuine Carlitos Moment: A running backhand get at full stretch that dropped over for a winner, and brought the Centre Court crowd to its feet.Alcaraz had won five straight against Sinner coming into this final. Every time the Italian played his best tennis against him, Alcaraz shifted into a higher gear. That's basically what happened in the first set on Sunday. Was this just how their matches were meant to go?

Every time the Italian played his best tennis against him, Alcaraz shifted into a higher gear. That's basically what happened in the first set on Sunday. Was this just how their matches were meant to go?

Up to that point, the match had looked destined to end with Alcaraz holding the trophy for the third straight time.

Not this time. This time Sinner turned the pattern on its head. This time, starting with that seemingly innocuous missed forehand by Alcaraz, he was the one who lifted his game to a higher level, and kept it there.In the second set, Sinner was the one who closed with a flurry of brilliance that might best be described as Alcarazian. He held at 5-4 with running backhand pass, a forehand that skidded off the sideline for a winner, and a crosscourt forehand winner at set point. All three times, Alcaraz hit a shot that normally would have won him the point, only to see Sinner take it away from him.In the third set, Sinner was the one who came up with a clutch response at a pressure-packed moment. Serving at 3-4, he watched as Alcaraz hit a perfect drop shot and followed it with a winning lob to reach 30-30. The crowd buzzed, and then buzzed some more when Sinner missed his first serve. But he quieted those noises right away, with a hooking second serve that landed on the sideline and curled away from Alcaraz for an ace.In the fourth set, Sinner was the one who broke early and—unlike at Roland Garros last month—never gave the lead back. He saved two break points at 4-3, and didn't show a hint of nerves serving it out at 5-4. He clinched his first Wimbledon title with his fastest—137 m.p.h.—serve of the day.

“He needed that win today,” Sinner's coach, Darren Cahill, said. “So he knew the importance of closing this one out when he had the opportunities. I think you saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.”As for Sinner himself, he couldn't have dreamed of a better way to put the ghosts of Roland Garros behind him.“I'm very happy with how I handled every situation on the court today,” Sinner said. “I just tried to be as aggressive as I could. It takes so much to win against him. I'm very happy that I hold my nerves at the end.”The things what went his way in Paris went my way this time.Sinner made them go his way. He attacked whenever possible and hit more winners—40 to 38. He came to net nearly twice as often as Alcaraz—40 times in total—and won 30 of those points. By the end of the third set, the Spaniard was muttering during changeovers about how much better Sinner was than him from the baseline. By the fourth, Alcaraz, for one of the few times in his career, looked resigned to his fate“At some points I didn't know what I had to do in the match because from the baseline I was feeling he was better than me, and I couldn't do anything about it,” he said.“I think the big key was the second serve. He was returning really well there the second serve. Thanks to that, he was in the position to attack the second ball every time.”

We knew that Sinner was an all-time great hitter of a tennis ball. We knew, after he came back from two sets down to win his first Grand Slam final in Australia last year, that he was a clutch performer. But this win, coming so soon after his crushing defeat in Paris, and against the same opponent, was proof of a deeper emotional resilience. A champion's resilience.“I think is the part where I'm the proudest, because it really has not been easy,” Sinner said. “If you lose a Grand Slam final that way, it's much better than [if] someone kills you. Then after you keep going, keep pushing.”“I did a lot of intensity in every practice because I felt like that I could play very good. That's why I said after Roland Garros that it's not the time to put me down, no, because another Grand Slam is coming up, and I did great here.”Sinner-Alcaraz at Wimbledon was not a classic follow-up to their Roland Garros final. But it was an important step in their story. Paris made them famous as a duo; Wimbledon made them true rivals again.Even today's loser could appreciate that.“I'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him,” Alcaraz said. “I think it's great for us, and it's great for tennis. It's going to be better and better.”Anyone ready for the US Open yet?

Fernando Alonso has given an insight into the impact that Adrian Newey has had on the Aston Martin team, with the Spaniard admitting that the squad are "learning" from their new Managing Technical Partner.

Fernando Alonso has admitted that the Aston Martin team are “all learning” from Adrian Newey, with the two-time World Champion conceding that the design chief has a “much wider view of how the team should operate”.

Newey started in his new position as Managing Technical Partner of the Silverstone-based squad in March, months after it was confirmed that the Briton would join the team following his departure from Red Bull.

During the British Grand Prix weekend, Alonso was quizzed on how much he has been speaking with Newey, leading the Spaniard to give an insight into how the famed designer is already having an impact on Aston Martin.

“We had a couple of lunches together,” Alonso said of Newey. “Generally [focused on] things about the team, about the simulator, how to make things a little bit more realistic, and he has a lot of experience [of] how a top team should fight for championships and try to be on top of the game in every area.

“It's not only the aerodynamics. When we think about Adrian, it is all aero performance; I think Adrian has a much wider view of how the team should operate, so we all learn from him every time that we speak with him.”

It is no secret that Newey has been focusing his attentions on preparing for 2026, a year in which a new wave of technical regulations will be introduced into the sport.

Alonso himself is set to remain onboard through next year – but, when asked if he is already thinking about what his future might look like beyond 2026, the 43-year-old responded: “No, not really. Not in my mind now.

“The decision will be made next year, I think, around summer time or before to have things clear as soon as possible. Right now, the championship is challenging this year. We didn't start as competitive as we thought, and now we want to turn the situation [around].

“We want to finish the second part of 2025 as strong as possible. Then 2026, everything remains to be seen. Step by step, and [it's] impossible to think right now into 2027.”

Aston Martin currently sit in eighth place of the Teams' Championship, tied on 36 points with seventh-placed Racing Bulls.

After Nico Hulkenberg's climb from P19 to the podium in the British Grand Prix, F1.com looks back at some of the most impressive rises to the rostrum in the sport's history.

In a result that perhaps few would have predicted beforehand, Nico Hulkenberg rose from the back of the grid to third place in the British Grand Prix to seal his long-awaited first podium. The Kick Sauber man's performance has earned its place on the list of impressive rises to the rostrum – so, to mark that, we've been taking a look back at 10 other remarkable drives to the podium…

Hulkenberg had lined up in P19 on race day at Silverstone – and Rubens Barrichello found himself in a similar position ahead of the German Grand Prix in 2000, the Brazilian ending up in P18 on the grid at Hockenheim after his car suffered electrical issues in Qualifying.

While Ferrari team mate – and championship leader – Michael Schumacher found himself out of the running on Lap 1 following a collision with Benetton's Giancarlo Fisichella, Barrichello started to carve his way through the field in a race featuring changing weather conditions.

The driver from Sao Paulo handled the subsequent chaos of others crashing, Safety Car phases and further heavy rain to clinch his debut victory in F1, leading to emotional scenes on the podium as Barrichello tearfully processed his achievement.

Barrichello went on to achieve a total of 11 victories in Formula 1 – and while none of these took place at his home race, one driver to claim a particularly memorable win in Sao Paulo is Max Verstappen, who pulled off a remarkable comeback drive at the 2024 event.

Race day in Brazil had already proven frenetic hours before the Grand Prix, with Qualifying taking place earlier on Sunday after being postponed owing to Saturday's treacherous weather conditions.

Amid five red flags in the session after several crashes, another big shock occurred when Verstappen exited Q2 in 12th place, which then became 17th on the grid due to a five-place penalty for using a new power unit.

This did not deter the Red Bull driver, who made numerous overtakes to climb up the order during a chaotic rain-affected race – and, after taking the lead from Alpine's Esteban Ocon just past the halfway point, the Dutchman was untouchable as he stormed to a stunning victory.

Brazil has certainly seen its fair share of eventful races over the years, with Verstappen's first Interlagos win some five years earlier also featuring an impressive rise through the field from his former team mate, Carlos Sainz.

After a challenging few seasons, McLaren looked to be on an upward trajectory in 2019, the team scoring a solid haul of points via their new line-up of Sainz and Lando Norris.

A decent result looked like it would be harder to come by at the penultimate round in Sao Paulo, however, with Sainz forced to start from the back of the grid following a loss of power during Saturday's Qualifying.

Despite this, the Spaniard made a one-stop strategy work in his favour on Sunday as he powered through from P20 to cross the line in P4 – and with third-placed Lewis Hamilton later receiving a five-second penalty for a collision with Alex Albon, Sainz was promoted to third, handing him his maiden top-three result as well as marking McLaren's first podium finish since 2014.

Needless to say, there were countless moments of Ayrton Senna brilliance across his career in Formula 1 – and one of these occurred early on for the Brazilian as F1 hit the streets of Monaco during his debut campaign in 1984.

In his fifth Grand Prix start – and first at a street circuit – Senna had put his Toleman in P13 on the grid and went on to display his skill at driving in the wet during a race that saw others struggle in the damp conditions.

His progression through the field saw him work his way up to P2 behind future title rival Alain Prost, the Frenchman leading at the wheel of his McLaren.

Senna went on to pass Prost, but the decision was then taken to stop the race owing to the conditions, with the countback placing Senna in second place at the final order. While he had to wait a little longer for his debut victory, the future World Champion had well and truly made his mark with his storming drive.

When F1 raced in Sakhir for the penultimate round of the 2020 campaign, Sergio Perez was facing an uncertain future amid the news that the Mexican would be replaced at Racing Point – soon to be known as Aston Martin – by Sebastian Vettel in 2021.

As he searched for a new team, Perez had put in some good performances through 2020 including a second place in Turkey, but his prospects in Sakhir did not initially appear so promising after a collision with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc on Lap 1 dropped him to the back of the pack.

However, Perez was a man on the move throughout the ensuing race, climbing the order before later benefitting from the misfortunes of Mercedes up ahead to surge into the lead and grab his first-ever F1 victory.

The Mexican admitted to being left “speechless” by the result, which came on his 190th Grand Prix start – and it seemed to be enough to prove to Red Bull that Perez was deserving of a drive, the team announcing within a matter of weeks that they had signed him for 2021.

Lewis Hamilton has put in more than one impressive recovery drive during his glittering F1 career to date – and one of the most memorable came at the Belgian Grand Prix in 2016, a year famed for the Briton's fierce title fight with Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg.

Hamilton arrived into the weekend as the championship leader, 19 points clear of Rosberg, but a number of grid penalties for changing engine components meant that the British driver would start the race at Spa-Francorchamps from the back.

Drama for some of the frontrunners on the opening lap allowed Hamilton to move up to P15, and from there onwards he stayed out of trouble and handled subsequent Safety Car phases and a red flag to cross the line in third place.

Alongside the fact that this damage limitation allowed Hamilton to maintain his championship lead, the World Champion also notched up the unique statistic of becoming the first driver to have taken a podium from 20th on the grid or lower on three occasions.

When it comes to dramatic events in the sport's history, the Canadian Grand Prix in 2011 has well and truly earned its place in F1 lore.

As well as becoming the longest Formula 1 race ever – at four hours, four minutes and 39 seconds, to be exact – it was made all the more memorable by Jenson Button bouncing back from numerous incidents to seal an against-the-odds victory.

After an early clash with McLaren team mate Lewis Hamilton dropped him backwards, Button's afternoon went on to feature everything from a puncture to a drive-through penalty – just one of his six visits to the pits – and a last lap overtake for the lead on Sebastian Vettel to secure an incredible victory.

“It felt like I spent more time in the pits than on the pit straights,” Button joked afterwards as he reflected back on his extraordinary comeback drive.

Having already achieved two wins during the 1967 season, Jim Clark looked on course to add to this tally when he secured pole position for the ninth round of the campaign at Monza.

The Briton held the lead as the race got underway, but a puncture on Lap 12 saw him drop one lap behind the rest of the field – resulting in the two-time World Champion embarking on a remarkable fightback.

After picking off numerous cars, Clark had hauled himself back into P1 with eight laps remaining. But the Scot's victory chances were again dashed when his Lotus experienced a fuel issue on the final tour, meaning that he was passed by John Surtees and Jack Brabham.

Despite this, Clark still held onto third place in a drive that has been revered by many as one of his greatest.

The 2012 season was a highly competitive one, with a different driver each taking victory across the opening seven rounds of the year.

Reigning champion Sebastian Vettel had embarked on a strong run in the second half of the campaign, the Red Bull driver having won four consecutive races when F1 arrived in Abu Dhabi for the third to last round of the season.

But when officials had been unable to take a fuel sample from his car post-Qualifying, Vettel – who was by this point engaged in a close title fight with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso – was excluded from the results and started the race from the pit lane.

An eventful afternoon followed for the German driver, who recovered from front wing damage early on to pull off a series of overtakes on his rivals. This culminated in a daring move on Jenson Button's McLaren, securing Vettel a stunning podium result in P3 en route to winning his third World Championship at the end of the year.

This list would simply not be complete without a mention of John Watson's history-making win at the Long Beach Street Circuit in 1983.

Qualifying had not gone well for Watson and his McLaren team mate Niki Lauda, the pair finding themselves down in P22 and P23 respectively after tyre struggles during the session.

However, the picture looked very different on race day, with Watson and Lauda both carving their way through the pack to eventually find themselves running in a 1-2 formation.

As Lauda was affected by leg cramps during the latter stages, the Austrian was unable to challenge his team mate and Watson crossed the line to take the win some 27 seconds clear. Having started down in 22nd place, the Northern Irishman continues to hold the record for the lowest grid slot that a win has been taken from.

Last Friday saw the birth of the ChatGPT browser, which already promises to visualize your data, coach your workouts, and trade your stocks; we must now contend with Velvet Sundown; and before the summer's out, we expect the quantum leap of ChatGPT-5. It felt like a good time for In Development to offer some optimism to anyone worried AI might soon take over all that's good in Hollywood. (For those of you ready to embrace our new AI overlords, that's a future column.)  

I'm certain AI is transforming the entertainment industry for better and worse. I have zero faith in Hollywood's ability (or inclination) to “control” it, if that were possible. AI can radically increase output and reduce costs (and: jobs), and of course, the industry will follow that path until it hits a wall.

So where's the optimism? I think I found a wall.  

The insight isn't solely mine. Credit goes to Ethan Helvering at audience intelligence firm Pulsar and Milo Chao at 100% Human, with a shoutout to Diana Williams of Kinetic Energy Entertainment for pointing me their way. The essential idea: Our connection to creativity is rooted in humanity. Without a backstory, stories fall flat. And AI has no backstory game. 

 










Don't believe me? Studios spend billions to make sure you know everything there is to know about what went into making their movies and TV shows. Marketing costs often match production budgets, even when they run to the hundreds of millions. Directors, stars, producers, writers, crew — they give thousands of interviews across every possible platform around the world.  

Sometimes they're thoughtful and reflective; sometimes they're playing with puppies. (Sometimes, they're talking about What No One Tells You.) But ultimately, every panel, article, video, and TV spot is in service of a single, powerful message: “This is who I am and why I made this, and that is why you should see it.”  

Can you mount an Oscar or an Emmy campaign without a backstory? (My husband still teases me about our coverage of Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Oscar-winning “The Revenant”: “You know, I read that it was a really hard movie to make.”) Creation stories are the engine of awards campaigns, so vital that strategists launch counter-narratives: That's not the way I heard it. 

That doesn't even get into the backstories of the backstories. Creative differences! Reshoots! Rewrites! The stars are in love! They won't speak to each other! Studios rarely want to amplify those stories (at least not overtly), but there's no better magnet for human attention than “What really happened?”

 










OK. Now let's assume there's no if, only when: The first feature-length film is made entirely by AI, from script to final frame. The production scale is massive; the budget is not. 

Now imagine being the studio that must sell it. Better yet, imagine being the studio that must sell the second AI film — the one without first-mover advantage.  

Film and TV publicists have hard jobs even in the best circumstances with the crisis control, travel logistics, and the hand-holding that comes with endless junkets and press appearances. But if all of that disappears, how do you promote a film that only has a creator and a team of software engineers behind it? 

Technology exists to reduce friction, whether it's renting a house, calling a car, buying a washer, or creating a blockbuster's explosion. AI promises to smooth everything that's messy about filmmaking: costs, egos, creative clashes. 

Awesome — only without conflict, there is no story.  

Reduce the turbulence and you also lose the frustrating, expensive, and chaotic collaboration. And without that, you lose the one thing AI can't do: create the story worth telling about the story. 

Yet. I haven't seen ChatGPT-5.

The Prime Video series posted a message its social media accounts ahead of the Jenny Han series' premiere on Wednesday.

	Fans may be ready to return to Cousins beach for a third and final time when The Summer I Turned Pretty returns on Wednesday, but Prime Video is giving a warning ahead of time. 


	The official social media account for the Prime Video series on Monday cautioned viewers against bullying and hate speech ahead of season three premiere which will offer the last chapter in TSITP universe and a conclusion to the series' ongoing love triangle. 




	“Cousins is our safe place,” the post read. “Everything good, everything magical. Let's keep the conversation kind this summer.”

	“We have a ZERO tolerance policy for bullying and hate speech. If you engage in any of the following you will be banned,” the post added before listing  “community guidelines” including no “hate speech or bullying,” “targeting our cast or crew” and “harassing or doxxing members of the community.”

	Based on the best-selling book trilogy from Jenny Han, the third season takes place four years after Belly Conklin (Lola Tung) chose to be with Jeremiah Fisher (Gavin Casalegno), leaving brother Conrad (Christopher Briney) heartbroken. For the final season, Belly will once again find herself questioning where her heart lies between Conrad and Jeremiah. Ahead of the third season, devoted fans have continued to voice their sides in the love triangle with many questioning how Han will end the series, whether it will stray or abide by the book's storyline and which brother Belly will end up with. 

	











	Following Prime Video's post, a multitude of fans took to the comments thanking the streamer for the message but noted bullying has long been prevalent since the series' debut, in particular with the negative online fan discourse last season amid the introduction of Elsie Fisher's nonbinary character Skye — the character was not a part of the books. At the time Han addressed the bullying and posted on her Instagram stories: “The Summer I Turned Pretty community is one of inclusivity. The hurtful comments directed at cast are not in the spirit of the show. Please be mindful of what you're putting out there and of who is seeing it.” 


	Season three of The Summer I Turned Pretty, which will feature 11 episodes, is led by showrunners Han and Sarah Kucserka. Han, Kucserka and Karen Rosenfelt serve as executive producers, along with Paul Lee, Hope Hartman and Mads Hansen for wiip. The series is a co-production of Amazon Studios and wiip.

Primer is The A.V. Club‘s ongoing series of beginners' guides to pop culture's most notable subjects: filmmakers, music styles, literary genres, and whatever else interests us—and hopefully you.

The world painted by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is one of disaffection. The Japanese auteur has made a career of identity thrillers, metaphysical horror, and cultural commentary, with films often sporting deceptively simple monosyllabic titles—Cure, Pulse, Chime, and now Cloud—that circle around existential themes. What is personal or cultural identity in contemporary Japan? How does economic precarity and technology transform the self? Do they always create the conditions for self-destruction and violence? Finally, and maybe most importantly, why does this movie feel like that? The quiet, unceremonious editing, the sudden bursts of violence, an abundance of negative space, and the sparse but abrupt use of score all conjure an eerie mood that can be difficult to parse but impossible to ignore.

Isolated stills from Kurosawa's films may look unassuming or unremarkable—perhaps a plain domestic room or the floor of an abandoned factory, with two or three characters separated by clear lines and empty space—but when you're immersed in the scene, every image is loaded with strangeness and dread. Why have they stood still for so long? Why are their voices so soft and muted? What's that ambient, industrial whine in the background? What's upset Kōji Yakusho this time?

The latest Kiyoshi Kurosawa thriller to ask these questions is Cloud—at once an exciting and funny genre exercise, a commentary on the vulnerability and inhumanity of online grifter culture, and only one third of the films that the prolific filmmaker premiered in a year's span. In the film, Yoshii (Masaki Suda) is an internet reseller who values his independence even as he profits off the inventors and workers he screws over. But the success of his growing enterprise makes him an especially isolated target for a vengeful mob that gathers in the wake of his eat-or-be-eaten business strategy.

It's a lively, amusing, and incredibly off-putting romp (especially in its final stretch, where supporting characters undergo metaphysical transformations), and an apt update to the themes of spiritual alienation and abandonment that have lingered in Kurosawa's work for decades. For the uninitiated, here's a primer to the work of Japan's most titanic genre filmmaker.

There's no more apt and scintillating doorway to the world of Kiyoshi Kurosawa than Cure (1997). Pitched as a thriller about a detective on the trail of an enigmatic killer, Cure has a chillingly subdued surface that mirrors the conventions of Hollywood's post-Silence Of The Lambs serial killer boom, but expresses them with a decidedly restrained voice. Detective Takabe (Kōji Yakusho) is on the case of the mysterious “X” killer, named for the carved-in-flesh symbol that links a slew of inexplicable murders. Each bout of violence has a clear culprit with a relationship to the victim, but their confessions can't account for why they committed an act of horrid violence. A drowsy and absent-minded young man (Masato Hagiwara) has asked each needling questions, which have seemingly tipped each unsuspecting murderer over the edge. The mumbling amnesiac (and his lighter) become an obsession for Takabe as he marches closer to the heart of the case.

Mesmerism plays a crucial role in Cure‘s plot, but Kurosawa uses the study of hypnosis as an entry point to broader, more upsetting questions of identity and will. Is identity fixed? Is behavior dependent on a stable environment, and on avoiding specific stimuli that unleash our dark, selfish impulses? The characters in Cure sit on a precipice of understanding, if not their true selves, then their inherent helplessness in the face of their ugly desires. As a thriller, it's elliptical and sparse, sometimes leaping to the next strangely empty composition (or even the end credits) right after dropping a striking and revealing image.

Lingering behind Takabe's plight is his own capacity for violence. His wife Fumie (Anna Nakagawa) suffers from schizophrenia, and disassociates at regular intervals. Takabe is a neglectful, resentful husband; the scenes he shares with Fumie are pent up with his silent shame, and his frustration with her abnormal behavior. In one memorable moment, he comes home and hallucinates that she's hanged herself in the kitchen. He's still on his knees in agony when Kurosawa cuts to Fumie standing behind him, alive as ever. Takabe sees her death because he's imagined it—dreamed of it—before.

The motif of death imposing itself on an unsuspecting but not entirely innocent soul is a profoundly Gothic idea, and two genre-mixing ghost stories by Kurosawa are essential next steps for those seeking out his major hits. Retribution (2006) plays in more traditionally supernatural waters than Cure, but belongs to the same family, as it also stars Yakusho as a beleaguered, haunted detective. (See also: Kurosawa and Yakusho's environmental identity thriller Charisma.) In Retribution, Detective Yoshioka (Yakusho) looks into a Tokyo waterfront murder, but his investigation begets some troubling contradictions—including the fact that he is the most likely suspect. His complicity is compounded by a repeated sighting of a gaunt, flowing female ghost, dressed in vibrant, incriminating scarlet colors, who teases out the connection between Yoshioka and the woman in red when she was alive.

Kurosawa transposes Gothic questions of complicity, repression, and apathy to a modern, urban Tokyo, making Retribution the next step in a career-long exploration of what the enforced atomization of a society does to our humane responsibilities. What does a cry for help look like when it's been denied oxygen for years, even past the boundaries of life and into the spectral realm of death? To Kurosawa, the scary, inhuman presence of ghosts is unavoidable, and has a clear causal explanation. Modernity—with its defensive, individualist imperatives of self-protection and betterment—bludgeons compassion and connection.

If Cure preceded the most essential films in the J-horror boom around Y2K (Ringu, Ju-On: The Grudge, Audition), then Kurosawa's Retribution and Pulse (2001) are reacting to the genre movement's immense commercial appeal and influence. In Pulse, the recently emerged instant communication of the world wide web becomes a pathway for lonely, mournful spirits to spill back into our world, so helpless and desperate are they in the vast prison of the afterlife. Pulse is less subdued than Cure, but has a quieter pitch than Retribution, spending a lot of its scenes in students' humble living quarters or mundane computer labs—a mundanity broken by sudden visitations, rituals sourced from web forums, and friends succumbing to invisible, self-destructive urges.

Nearing its quarter-century anniversary, Pulse has outlived its early internet context, now more of a prophesy about the cursed promise of online hyper-convenience: The vessels and channels of the internet will inevitably allow for infinite distress and sadness to pour into our private worlds, impossible to ignore or be unaffected by, until pain we thought forgotten or irrelevant overrides every waking moment.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa's unique horror cannot be fully appreciated, on the level of both craft and themes, without sampling his more straightforward dramatic work. Across three dramas—License To Live (1998), Bright Future (2002) and Tokyo Sonata (2008)—Kurosawa makes unusual revisions to traditional family structures to reflect a fraught and shifting Japanese society. 

The disaffection and disconnection that characterizes Kurosawa's modern Japanese films was born out of a distinct national mood. After emerging as the world's second biggest economy in the 1980s, Japan's economic growth abruptly collapsed after an asset bubble burst in the early '90s, leaving a stagnant real estate and stock market landscape that affected the entire country. The era following this would be referred to as the “Lost Decade.” With three films made across 10 years, Kurosawa told stories of alienation that gives birth to hopeful renewal, while avoiding the worst defects of sentimental melodrama. In fact, even in these grounded films he maintained most of the tenets of his dread-inducing, purposefully empty, and emotionally decentering style.

The plots are all unique but share connective tissue: In License To Live, 24-year-old Yutaka Yoshii (Hidetoshi Nishijima) wakes up from a 10-year coma in a state of adolescent ennui. He's woken up to a world with no Iron Curtain and no Japanese economic growth, and his small family (his parents and sister) live independently from each other in different states of modest living. When Yoshii is taken in by his father's childhood friend Fujimori (Kōji Yakusho), he attempts to unite his disparate family despite their disinterest. In Bright Future, the lives of two young factory workers are turned upside-down when one (Tadanobu Asano) kills their boss as revenge for his bothersome intrusions on their life. The other worker (Joe Odagiri) is entrusted with their shared jellyfish and strikes up a friendship with his incarcerated friend's father (Tatsuya Fuji), even as anti-social unrest and vandalism starts to dominate the young man's life. The most acclaimed of the three, Tokyo Sonata, details a family spiraling in the wake of a father's redundancy. Here, adolescent rebellion takes the form of both clandestine piano lessons and joining the U.S. military, and a father's shameful employment problems intersect with a housewife being kidnapped from her domestic sphere by a burglar.

Kurosawa's family dramas are not exclusively tied to social interpretations of this “Lost” era (some commentators say it lasted for 30 years), but like many films concerning social relations and expectations, the stories include a single but crucial change that affects every character's life. No matter how hard they try, the past cannot be recovered or rebuilt, and fractured families have to face their newly tested and often diminished status in order to reconstitute themselves. Rarely are characters on the same page—just like the schemes and murders of his genre pictures, Kurosawa maps out his dramas with independent wills and drives that can only run alongside each other for a brief time before they combust or fall to disorder. These films are about capitalism's promise falling woefully short, but Kurosawa ends each on a bittersweet hopeful note, showing a remote but clear possibility to transcend these punishing conditions.

Kiyoshi Kurosawa has made so many films (averaging out to one a year for 40 years) because most are overwhelmingly commercial projects made cheaply. “Foreign directors ask me, ‘How come you make so many movies?'” Kurosawa told Film Comment in 2017, while promoting his French-language Gothic film Daguerrotype. “And I say, ‘Well, if I'm not working, that means I'm unemployed.'” His career is not one of pure auteurist expression, but of constantly navigating industry restrictions—the first decade-and-a-half of his filmography consists of “pink” films (independent films with sexual content), horror oddities, and Yakuza sagas. Early highlights from before his international breakthrough include The Guard From Underground, about a murderer disguised as an office block's security guard and the haunted house thriller Sweet Home, which was released alongside a video game of the same name that inspired Resident Evil.

Watching Kurosawa's Seance (a sterling TV movie adaptation of the British novel Séance On A Wet Afternoon) or Doppelganger (a comedic thriller about duality that saved money by giving star Kōji Yakusho double duty), one can tell that his production resources are tight. But the naturalistic conversations and grungy, ugly environments are still animated by entrancing and startling editing. Kurosawa's power lies in his films' beguiling rhythm, one the audience fears will be interrupted at any moment by something outside the characters' control.

The most underrated films in Kurosawa's catalogue never got a theatrical release at all—during his wildly prolific run at the end of the century, (he released 11 films from '96 to '98), Kurosawa added to his V-cinema filmography with a pair of 1998 revenge films: Serpent's Path and Eye Of The Spider. In both films, an ordinary man loses his daughter and hunts down the sadists who killed her; in each film, Kurosawa chooses a different moment in a conventional Yakuza revenge story to examine under a microscope, letting his distressed and violent characters flounder within criminal organizations and under the mentorship of criminal professionals who promise they have their best interests at heart. 

Kiyoshi Kurosawa films don't get more stripped-back and nasty than this. Inside abandoned industrial caverns, righteous men inch closer to a brutal clarity, deluding themselves with the hope of closure and new beginnings, but really only sign a series of contracts with a mean, bureaucratic Devil taking advantage of their unmoored psyches—an unsubtle but gut-punching metaphor for the grasp of capitalism on modern Japan. Pull a double feature with both, and one can lose their certainty about the nature of good and evil in less than three hours.

	Naomi LaChance



	Following the shrinking of Medicaid by President Donald Trump and the GOP's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” Mehmet Oz, heart surgeon turned TV doctor turned Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, says Americans will still be able to receive help — but that they need to stay healthy and avoid things like cake. 


	The new legislation could kick as many as 15 million people off Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. The bill implements new work requirements mandating people work, go to school, or volunteer 80 hours a month. They can't earn too much money, though, lest they exceed the income cap and get kicked off the program.


	“We don't even call it a work requirement, it's community engagement,” Oz told Fox Business' Stuart Varney on Monday. Oz claimed people are spending “6.1” hours a day watching TV.


	In January, President Donald Trump promised to “love and cherish” Medicaid. Vice President J.D. Vance recently dismissed the prospect of millions losing coverage as “minutiae.” 

	











	Oz was reportedly an “enduring presence” in the effort to pass the bill. 


	“It was a promise to the American people to take care of you if you're having problems financially or if you're having an issue because you were older and needed health care,” Oz said. “It changed the country in a good way, for many reasons, but we're all in it together, Stuart, which means we'll be there for you, the American people, when you need help with Medicaid and Medicare.” 

	











	Then, he added a caveat: “But you've got to stay healthy, as well. Be vital. Do the most you can do to really live up to … your God-given potential to live a full and healthy life. Don't eat carrot cake.” 


	He gestured to a carrot cake sitting on the table to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of Medicaid.


	“That's what you've given me,” Varney said, laughing. 


	“This is a little bit of a wink, I was jokingly calling this the MAHA Medi-cake, but of course I couldn't find a healthy cake, so I bought the closest they get, carrot cake.”

	MAHA, or Make America Healthy Again, is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health project which includes avoiding things like seed oils and food dyes and questioning vaccines. In May, he released his first report, which cited fake studies and seemed to have been written using AI. 


	Oz also told Fox Business that he wants to make health care “productive.”“If we make health care function the way banks function, the way you can order food, the way you can watch streaming videos, transform it to be a 21st Century industry, it'll become productive again. The loss of productivity is what hurts medicine,” he said.


	Last month, Oz told Fox Business that Medicaid recipients have to “do something that shows you have agency over your future.”

	“Go out there, do entry-level jobs, get into the workforce, prove that you matter. Get agency into your own life,” he said. “It's a much more enjoyable experience if you go through life thinking you are in control of your destiny and you will get better insurance at the same time.”


	Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) noted the absurdity of Oz's statement in an X post later on Monday. “17 million people are going to lose their health insurance because of the Trump administration,” she wrote. “Dr. Oz‘s advice is ‘don't eat carrot cake.”

When Heightened Scrutiny played at the Sundance Film Festival in January, audiences didn't know how United States v. Skrmetti, the trans healthcare case argued in front of the Supreme Court by ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio, would shake out. Arguments in that case, which Sam Feder's intimate documentary gives ground-level context for, were heard on December 4, 2024. The justices' decision wouldn't come down until June. In the interim, the end of the documentary relied on Schrödinger's ruling; Strangio's efforts were relentless and surrounded by the rapturous support of his community, but the film had also laid bare the prejudice stacked against them. Donald Trump had not yet retaken office, open hatred was not yet so publicly encouraged. Winning or losing seemed equally possible, equally implausible. Now, though, Heightened Scrutiny is being released to general audiences who already know its ending. That means the majority of its power comes from another case it argues: One against high-profile media outlets and the writers who made targeting trans people into a professional beat.

While much of Feder's film follows Strangio as he practices, preps, and advocates on a grassroot level for trans youth, some of the most painful and infuriating segments give context for where this apparent surge of nationwide transphobia came from. As the film's mix of journalist and trans advocate talking heads—like Columbia Journalism dean Jelani Cobb, Semafor executive editor Gina Chua, and Mina Brewer, the 22-year-old model misgendered on The Atlantic‘s famous fearmongering cover—unpack, at its root are a few well-respected publications and the lucrative business model that's always accompanied moral panic.

These interviewees, shot by Feder in the same diner-style booth at a restaurant (a place for a chat, not a pulpit for a sermon), movingly explain how public opinion had been astro-TERFed against them. A decade ago, Laverne Cox (who also appears in and executive produced the film) dominated the cover of Time, the face of the “transgender tipping point” that would lead to increased visibility of and rights for trans people. For a bit, that inclusive shift seemed true. In 2016, for example, the NBA relocated its All-Star game out of Charlotte because of its discriminatory “bathroom bill.” Trans rights were good PR, worth backing up with a billion-dollar pocketbook. But, between 2021 and 2024, the nation went from having absolutely no states with laws banning gender-affirming care for adolescents, to 23. This turn seems to have originated from far-right Christian nationalists, but was given a massive platform, and an Anita Bryant-like rallying cry, by outlets with a bit more clout than The Daily Wire—all “just asking questions.”


“By writing about trans kids instead of trans adults, [Jesse Singal] can express his concern over the ways we live our lives by framing his concern as a parental one, thus looping parents into the conversation,” Harron Walker wrote for Jezebel in 2018. “It's a children's issue, not a trans issue, which gives any reader, cis or trans, permission to weigh in on the subject with authority. It's that classic ‘think of the children' strawman.”

This framing, analogous to Bryant's claim in the '70s that those dastardly gays were “trying to recruit our children into homosexuality,” paved a path for an onslaught of op-eds. Media analyst Julie Hollar provides Heightened Scrutiny with research showing that, over the course of a calendar year, the New York Times was far more likely to run stories portraying the trans rights movement was a threat than to cover any threat against trans people. In the kind of journalistic “if it bleeds, it leads” strategizing that had Nightcrawler‘s star orchestrating his own crime footage, the click-inducing backlash to and credulous consumption of transphobic rhetoric only encouraged editors to greenlight more of it. The floodgates were opened. Hate-reading developed into actual hate. It became such a transparent trend that it led to one of the best Onion headlines in years: “It Is Journalism's Sacred Duty To Endanger The Lives Of As Many Trans People As Possible.”

But that's not all it led to. In the most shocking scene of Heightened Scrutiny, Feder constructs a montage explaining how, in Strangio's words, “the coverage of trans people by the center-left morphs into far-right policy in a matter of a few years.” The scare tactics of writers like Singal and Pamela Paul are directly and immediately echoed by lawyers, judges, and “experts” brought into courts around the nation.

Paul's NYT column titled “As Kids, They Thought They Were Trans. They No Longer Do.” ran on February 2, 2024. On February 6, it was cited by the state of Idaho in Poe v. Labrador as evidence that gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth should continue to be criminalized. On June 15, 2022, the Times published the widely condemned piece “The Battle Over Gender Therapy” by Emily Bazelon. That July, a Texas court was trotting it out in order to redefine gender-affirming healthcare as “child abuse.” If it was good enough for the New York Times, these courts reasoned, it should be good enough for the people of America. This means lawyers like Strangio aren't just arguing against the law, but arguing against rhetoric that judges are consuming in their free time—rhetoric seen as mainstream enough to make it into the paper of record.

It's not like the aggressive regression of these outlets—musing on trans athletes and children and the locker rooms and school bathrooms they should be forced to use—has been a secret, but their influence on the laws of the land has rarely been spelled out with such directness and clarity as in this film. Though Skremetti may have prompted the Supreme Court to reopen a slew of trans rights cases, the case was itself prompted by the endless poking and prodding of a select few columnists trying to stay in the spotlight by egging on a witchhunt. No amount of fair, compassionate coverage could fully combat a court literally stacked against pretty much every thinking member of the American public. But as Heightened Scrutiny makes plain, selling out your neighbors for a cushy op-ed gig sprays gasoline on the oppressive flames.

Is James Gunn's new feature the best Man of Steel movie ever? Maybe not. But it's the Superman we could all use right now. How it stacks up against the rest.


							By 

	Benjamin Svetkey



	He's the same old Man of Steel — faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, still wearing his underwear on the outside of his pants. But there's one big difference. For the first time in decades, Superman has a heart. 


	In fact, in James Gunn's new adaptation of the classic DC comic book, that's the character's greatest superpower. Not strength. Not speed. Not X-ray vision. But decency, empathy and… that other thing Americans used to admire. What was it again? Oh, right: kindness. 


	This is a Superman who during a chaos-filled monster attack on Metropolis takes the time to rescue a squirrel.


	For a franchise that's spent the last dozen years moping in the shadows — with Zack Snyder turning the Kid from Krypton into a gloomy, angsty, nihilistic bore, brooding over tall buildings with a single scowl — it's more than a little refreshing to see a joyful bounce in those famous red boots.


	MAGA critics who apparently haven't bothered to see the movie (like former Lois & Clark star Dean Cain) are already complaining that it's too “woke” — as if Superman changed his name to Superperson and turned the Fortress of Solitude into a co-op housing collective. It's the kind of chowderheaded online blather that a roomful of monkeys with keyboards might tap out — which, in Superman, by the way, is exactly how Lex Luthor (played as a raging tech bro billionaire by Nicholas Hoult) manufactures online agitprop aimed at turning the social media masses against everyone's favorite visitor from another world (mop-headed newcomer David Corenswet in the red and blue spandex).


	That said, there are plenty of plot points in this movie that feel as fresh as this morning's headlines. Yes, Superman battles monsters — with a little help from “Justice Gang” members Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion), Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), not to mention Lois Lane (the always-marvelous Rachel Brosnahan) and Krypto, Supe's scene-stealing, poorly-trained dog who keeps trashing his Arctic sanctuary. But now he's also fending off misinformation, xenophobia, and a Luthor who is equal parts Elon Musk's megalomania and Jeff Bezos' haircut. 


	The film is never overtly political, even when Superman ticks off Washington by zipping half-way around the world to stop a war between Boravia and Jarhanpur without consulting the White House. Is one of these fictional countries supposed to be Russia and the other Ukraine? Or are they stand-ins for Israel and Gaza? The answer is probably yes to both — but Gunn leaves it vague enough to keep you guessing. 


	There is one issue he does take on more directly than any other, but it's kind of unavoidable given Superman's questionable immigration status. After all, this is a guy who literally fell from the sky without any documentation. There aren't any ICE agents chasing him around Home Depot, but he is side eyed by certain humans who don't think he belongs and there is a harrowing scene in which he gets detained by authorities and sent to a “pocket universe” that looks almost as bad as an El Salvadorian supermax. Also, the way Luthor sneers the word “alien” when referring to Superman, it's almost as if Hoult took acting lessons from Stephen Miller.


	Is it the best Superman movie ever made? Maybe not. Some critics are finding it a bit overstuffed and chaotic, complaining that Gunn is juggling a too-crowded array of secondary characters, geopolitical allegories, monster fights and, just because, a clone subplot. On the other hand, most everybody agrees that Corenswet rises to the occasion — he seems as comfortable in the role as any actor since Christopher Reeve slipped into the tights. 


	Still, even if it isn't the best Superman ever made — and feel free to check out the list below for a ranking of all the movies that came before — it's certainly the best Superman movie for right now. The perfect hero for these unkindest of times, swooping in to remind us of what truth, justice, and the American way are supposed to look like.


	This isn't just the best Superman movie ever made — it's arguably the best superhero film of all time. Tone-perfect in nearly every way, it still makes you believe a man can fly. An army of A-listers were approached for the lead — Robert Redford reportedly turned it down, as did Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds, and James Caan. At one point, Neil Diamond and Bruce Jenner even showed up for screen tests (no joke). But the role ultimately went to an unknown soap actor named Christopher Reeve, who fit into Kal-El's blue-and-red onesie better than anyone has since.


	Reeve had help, of course. His performance was super-powered by an emotionally charged, action-packed origin story penned by literary legend Mario Puzo and polished by Hollywood fix-it man Tom Mankiewicz. Richard Donner's direction, which brought a then-unheard-of seriousness and mythic grandeur to what had been a mostly low-rent genre, also made a huge difference.  As did the film's super-sized budget — $55 million, the most expensive movie in Hollywood history at the time. Granted, $3.7 million of that went to Marlon Brando, who filmed his ten minutes as Jor-El in just 12 days and reportedly made everyone on the set miserable by refusing to memorize lines and instead reading from cue cards, including one taped to baby Kal-El's diaper.


	Still, Brando's phoning it in aside, the movie was an historic blockbuster. It ended up grossing $300 million — roughly $1.25 billion in today's dollars — turned Reeve into a cultural icon and kicked open the doors for the modern superhero genre. Every Superman since has been chasing its cape.


	The plan was to make Superman I and II simultaneously, and for the most part, that's exactly what happened. Gene Hackman, for instance, shot all his Lex Luthor scenes for both films back-to-back. But before production on the sequel could be completed, director Richard Donner ran into “creative differences” with father-and-son producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind and was replaced by Richard Lester, the auteur behind A Hard Day's Night.But whatever. The sequel — in which Reeve's Man of Steel gives up his powers to settle down with Lois Lane, just as three escaped supervillains from Krypton arrive to conquer Earth — is almost as good as the original.Part of what makes the film fly is Terence Stamp's scene-stealing badassery as General Zod (“Kneel before Zod!”), but part is also Lester's lighter touch. He's the one who shot the Niagara Falls sequence, where Superman rescues a kid who falls over the railing (“Of course he's Jewish!” someone shouts off-camera from the cheering crowd).But Donner's fingerprints are still all over the film, too — most notably in the full-on Kryptonian brawl in downtown Metropolis, which predates Man of Steel's citywide mayhem by 30 years, but does it with a whole lot more grace and cinematic finesse.


	There were a ton of false starts between Reeve's final Superman film — 1987's The Quest for Peace, which bombed at the box office (see below) — and the release of this low-key but poignant reboot. In the mid-1990s, Clerks director (and famous comic book geek) Kevin Smith tapped out multiple drafts of his never-produced Superman Lives, then Tim Burton signed on for a version that would've starred Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel (and, in a much more promising bit of casting, Chris Rock as Jimmy Olsen). J.J. Abrams, McG, Brett Ratner — they were all at one point attached to a Superman movie.In the end, though, it was X-Men auteur Bryan Singer who brought the character back to the screen, with another unknown — Reeve lookalike Brandon Routh — wearing the red cape, Kevin Spacey shaving his head to play Lex Luthor, and a touching storyline about lost love. Although it disappointed at the box office and drew only lukewarm reviews — “reverent, beautifully crafted and a little too sedate,” sniffed The New York Times — it had the one superpower that matters most in a Superman movie: soul.


	Yes, it's four hours long and soaked in operatic self-importance. And Superman is dead for the first half of the movie (and when he does come back — thanks to Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash — he's wearing a black suit). Still, of all the Zack Snyder Superman movies, this one probably gets it the most right — or at least the least wrong. Zack Snyder's Justice League softens the character a bit compared to the brooding gloom of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman; there are even moments when Henry Cavill's Kal-El cracks something resembling a smile — not to mention a shirt-rip callback to the Christopher Reeve era.The plot is a mess (something about an alien warlord uniting three world-ending cubes?), the CGI is distractingly awful, and the tone remains almost entirely joyless. Joss Whedon's earlier version — he took over the 2017 theatrical release after Snyder suffered a family tragedy — adds more quips and color but is somehow even more incomprehensible.


	This one's a curio — just 58 minutes long, shot on a shoestring budget, and originally intended as a kind of proof-of-concept for a potential Adventures of Superman TV series. But there's something kind of wonderful about it. Made at the height of the Red Scare, it plays like a blunt but heartfelt parable about paranoia, prejudice, and mob mentality. When a pair of wide-eyed, big-headed creatures emerge from deep underground (thanks to oil drillers boring too far into the Earth), the townspeople panic, grab their rifles, and prepare for a Mole Men lynching. But George Reeves' Superman shows up to save the day, scolding the bigots and protecting the outsiders. “They're not monsters,” he insists. “They're just different.”It's corny, sure. And the Mole Men look like toddlers in bald caps. But it's also pure. Idealistic. Uncomplicated. And in its own modest way, more faithful to what Superman is supposed to be than a lot of what came after… like, say, Man of Steel.


	Zack Snyder's first crack at Superman isn't just a tonal misfire — it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the character. Instead of portraying Kal-El as the bright, benevolent savior he's always been — a kind of sci-fi angel who swoops down from the heavens to save the innocent — Man of Steel gives us a brooding, joyless slab of existential ennui. Snyder clearly wants to do for Superman what The Dark Knight did for Batman, but in stripping away all the warmth, idealism, and moral clarity, he leaves behind a character who barely seems to like humanity, let alone has any incentive to fight for it.Cavill looks the part, but he's mostly asked to glower and sulk, while the movie drowns him in grim flashbacks, dead-dad lectures, and Jesus imagery so heavy-handed it borders on parody. The plot is essentially a reboot of the 1978 film — Kal-El crash-lands in Kansas, grows up confused, and must face off against a fellow Kryptonian, General Zod (a snarling Michael Shannon), who wants to terraform Earth into a new Krypton. The final act devolves into a city-obliterating CGI brawl that racks up more collateral damage than three Michael Bay movies combined — and ends with Superman doing the one thing he's never done before in any major screen adaptation: snapping his enemy's neck.Sure, it's glossy and expensive and takes itself very seriously. But it lacks the one thing a Superman movie should never be without: hope.


	If Man of Steel misunderstood Superman, this sequel seems to actively resent him. Snyder doubles down on the grimdark here, pitting a sulky, superpowered alien against a rage-fueled billionaire in a metal batsuit, somehow making both equally unlikable. Cavill's Superman is as brooding and disconnected as ever, while Ben Affleck's Batman is paranoid, brutal, and seemingly just a few Bat-gadgets away from full-blown fascism. The plot is a Cuisinart full of mythology-building and Justice League leftovers, with Jesse Eisenberg's twitchy, millennial Lex Luthor pulling the strings for reasons that never entirely make sense. There's also a resurrected cave troll named Doomsday, a forced Wonder Woman cameo, and another massive CGI deathmatch in a smoldering cityscape. There are moments — fleeting, glimmering moments — when the film hints at something mythic and operatic. But then Synder blows it all up. Literally.


	Christopher Reeve is still game, but the story — a baffling mashup of slapstick and sci-fi — seems like it flew in from a totally different franchise. Richard Pryor is inexplicably cast as a wacky computer hacker and there's a plot (of sorts) involving a synthetic kryptonite that turns Superman into a boozy, stubbly jerk, leading to an unintentionally hilarious junkyard brawl between “bad” Superman and “good” Clark Kent. The effects are cheap, the villain laughable (Robert Vaughn as a corrupt wannabe coffee mogul) and the magic of Reeve's first two movies is nowhere in sight.


	By the time this one limped into theaters, the series was out of ideas, out of budget, and — judging by the final cut — out of dignity. Superman IV was Reeve's passion project, built around his desire to deliver an anti-nuclear message. But it's buried under bargain-bin effects, stock footage, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious villains in comic book history: Nuclear Man, a mullet-sporting solar-powered baddie who looks like he wandered in from a heavy metal album cover (played by Mark Pillow, in his first and — unsurprisingly — last film role). The plot? Superman collects all the world's nukes and throws them into space, battles his glowy nemesis on the moon, and tries to save both Lois Lane and the franchise. He pretty much fails on all counts.

The song surges 2-1 on the Global 200 and 5-1 on Global Excl. U.S.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



	HUNTR/X's “Golden,” from the soundtrack to the hit animated film KPop Demon Hunters, conquers the competition on both the Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts to become the biggest song in the world. It rises 2-1 on the former ranking and 5-1 on the latter.


KPop Demon Hunters premiered June 20 in a limited theatrical release in the U.S., and on Netflix, alongside its soundtrack. For the week ending July 6, it ranked at No. 2 on Netflix's Top 10 Movies in United States chart.

	











	Meanwhile, as HUNTR/X earns its first No. 1 on the Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S., it becomes the first fictional act to reign — “Golden” is by KPop Demon Hunters' protagonist trio whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami.




			Trending on Billboard		







	HUNTR/X outpaces its rival KPop Demon Hunters boy band Saja Boys, though the latter act claims two tracks in the top 10 of the Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S.: “Your Idol” (up 10-3 and 15-5 on the respective charts) and “Soda Pop” (up 13-6 and 17-7, respectively). The Saja Boys songs feature the vocals of Andrew Choi, Neckwav, Danny Chung, Kevin Woo and samUIL Lee.

	











	Elsewhere, Drake's “What Did I Miss?” debuts at No. 9 on the Global 200.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, which began in September 2020 — and three weeks earlier marked their 250th week — rank songs based on streaming and sales activity culled from more than 200 territories around the world, as compiled by Luminate. The Global 200 is inclusive of worldwide data and the Global Excl. U.S. chart comprises data from territories excluding the United States.


	Chart ranks are based on a weighted formula incorporating official-only streams on both subscription and ad-supported tiers of audio and video music services, as well as download sales, the latter of which reflect purchases from full-service digital music retailers from around the world, with sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites excluded from the charts' calculations.


	HUNTR/X's “Golden” crowns the Global 200 with 67.7 million streams (up 40% week-over-week) and 6,000 sold (up 27%) worldwide July 4-10.


	Alex Warren's “Ordinary” drops to No. 2 on the Global 200 after 10 weeks on top beginning in May.


	Saja Boys' “Your Idol” soars 10-3 on the Global 200 led by 45.7 million streams worldwide (up 22%) and “Soda Pop” buzzes 13-6 with 41.3 million (up 24%). Each song sold 3,000 globally.


	Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” slips 3-4 on the Global 200, after 18 weeks at No. 1 starting last September, and ROSÉ and Bruno Mars' “APT.” ascends 6-5, following 12 weeks at No. 1 beginning in November.


	Plus, Drake's “What Did I Miss?” enters the Global 200 at No. 9 with 35.5 million streams and 7,000 sold worldwide from its July 5 release through July 10. He ups his total to a record-extending 37 top 10s since the chart began. (Taylor Swift ranks second with 33 top 10s, followed by Bad Bunny with 25.)

	











	“Golden” rules Global Excl. U.S. with 49.1 million streams (up 40%) and 2,000 sold (up 38%) outside the U.S.


	“Ordinary” falls to No. 2 on Global Excl. U.S. after eight weeks in the lead starting in May; “Die With a Smile” holds at No. 3 after 17 weeks at the summit starting last September; and “APT.” extends its lease at No. 4 after reigning for a record 19 weeks beginning in November.


	“Your Idol” blasts 15-5 on Global Excl. U.S. powered by 30.3 million streams outside the U.S. (up 21%) and “Soda Pop” bounds 17-7 with 29.8 million (up 23%). They sold 1,000 and 2,000 beyond the U.S., respectively.


	The Billboard Global 200 and Billboard Global Excl. U.S. charts (dated July 19, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 15. For both charts, the top 100 titles are available to all readers on Billboard.com, while the complete 200-title rankings are visible on Billboard Pro, Billboard's subscription-based service.

					By Matt Grobar 

Senior Film Reporter


EXCLUSIVE: Jack Henry Robbins is teaming with 20th Television to develop Nepo Baby, a new comedy series for Hulu, based on his viral character.


	In the show created by Robbins, the world's least successful nepo baby, Jack Henry Robbins, attempts to make it big and grow up all on his own no matter what it takes (with help from his famous parents).


	Robbins based it on his “nepo baby” alter ego, which was made famous on social media via a series of viral videos, as well as through last year's much circulated New York Times feature story, “His Parents Are Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. That's the Joke.”












	Sam Zvibleman (Pen15) is on board to direct and will exec produce alongside Peter Principato, Bryan Walsh, and Casey Neumeier at Artists First.




			Watch on Deadline		







	For Robbins, Nepo Baby comes on the heels of his directorial debut, VHYes, which is Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and was released by Oscilloscope in 2020. Premiering at Fantastic Fest, the film is described as a bizarre, retro comedy shot entirely on VHS and Betamax that follows 12-year-old Ralph as he accidentally records home videos and his favorite late-night shows over his parents' wedding tape. What We Do in the Shadows standout Mark Proksch was joined in the cast by Kerri Kenney and Thomas Lennon of The State.


	Robbins' short films Painting with Joan and Hot Winter both premiered at Sundance. On the television side, he got his start with the live-action pilot Ultimate Ultimate, produced by Comedy Central and distributed by Funny or Die. He has also served as a segment director on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.


Verve recently signed the multi-hyphenate filmmaker, who continues to be represented by Artists First, as well as Brecheen Feldman Breimer. Zvibleman is repped by Iconoclast and Jackoway Austen Tyerman.

"Ordinary" rules the Hot 100 for a sixth week.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” adds a sixth week atop the Billboard Hot 100. The song has linked its lead consecutively, having become the singer-songwriter's first No. 1 on the chart.


	Plus, two songs soar into the Hot 100's top 10, led by Drake's “What Did I Miss?,” which debuts at No. 2. The track — the week's most-streamed and top-selling song — arrives as his record-extending 81st top 10. At No. 6, HUNTR/X's “Golden” races from No. 23. The song is from the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack, which jumps to No. 2 on the Billboard 200.


	Meanwhile, Morgan Wallen logs his 10th career week with at least three simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s, a mark that only five acts — and no core country artists — previously reached. His I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three of his current top 10 hits, scores an eighth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated July 19, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 15.

	“Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.1 million official streams (down 5% week-over-week),  73 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 5%) and 6,000 sold (down 9%) in the United States July 4-10.


	The single's airplay performance is especially noteworthy, as it becomes the first song this year to reach 70 million in weekly airplay audience, and the first since Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” last November. “Ordinary” tops the Adult Pop Airplay chart for a seventh week and Pop Airplay for a fifth week.


	“Ordinary” slips 2-4 on the Streaming Songs chart, following four weeks at the summit; claims a fourth week at No. 1 on Radio Songs; and drops to No. 2 after eight weeks atop Digital Song Sales.


	The track also continues its sizzling run at No. 1 on the Songs of the Summer chart, having led in all seven weeks since the seasonal survey made its annual return after Memorial Day.


	Drake's “What Did I Miss?” bounds onto the Hot 100 at No. 2 with 22.6 million streams, 3.6 million in airplay audience and 6,000 sold through July 10 following its July 5 release.


	Drake pushes his career total to 81 Hot 100 top 10s, extending his record for the most in the chart's nearly 67-year history.


Most Hot 100 Top 10s:


	The track concurrently launches at No. 1 on Streaming Songs — where it's Drake's record-extending 21st leader — and Digital Song Sales, where it's his 15th chart-topper, the most among male artists; overall, only Taylor Swift (29 No. 1s) and Nicki Minaj (17) have more.


	Plus, “What Did I Miss?” charges in at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts — marking Drake's record-padding 31st leader on each list.


	HUNTR/X's “Golden” blasts 23-6 on the Hot 100 with 18.8 million streams — up 39% — 950,000 in airplay audience and 3,000 sold. The song is from the KPop Demon Hunters soundtrack, which shoots 3-2 on the Billboard 200, having become the highest-charting soundtrack of 2025.


KPop Demon Hunters premiered June 20 in a limited theatrical release in the U.S., and on Netflix, alongside its soundtrack. For the week ending July 6, it ranked at No. 2 on Netflix's Top 10 Movies in United States chart.


	Meanwhile, as HUNTR/X earns its first Hot 100 top 10, it becomes the latest fictional artist to chart in the region IRL — “Golden” is by KPop Demon Hunters' protagonist trio whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami. Among fictitious singing acts that have hit the chart's top 10, HUNTR/X joins the likes of Hannah Montana in 2009, the Heights (1992), the Partridge Family ('70s), the Archies (‘60s-‘70s) and the Chipmunks (‘50s).


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, retreats 2-3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It logs an eighth week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Wallen follows on the Hot 100 with the No. 2-peaking “Just in Case,” which slides 3-4, and “I'm the Problem,” which falls 5-8. He posts his 10th career week with at least three simultaneous top 10s and his eighth this year, as he continues scaling both leaderboards.


Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s All-Time:


Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s in a Single Year:


	Similarly, Wallen tallies five songs in the Hot Country Songs top 10. Dating to his first such frame in January 2021, it's his 29th week with at least half the chart's top 10 — no other act has more than one week achieving the feat (Beyoncé, in 2024, and Zach Bryan and Taylor Swift, both in 2023).


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” staggers 4-5 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” drops 6-7 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, backtracks 8-9. It adds a record-extending 69th week in the top 10 and — potentially setting up another historic milestone next week — a record-furthering 99th week on the chart overall.


	Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” descends 9-10 after five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.

	On Feb. 18, two weeks after having her son via C-section, Monique Rodriguez was battling postpartum depression. The Black mother of two, who was born and raised in St. Catherine Parish in Jamaica, had come to the U.S. in 2022 on a six-month visa and settled in Florida with her husband. But after finding herself alone and overwhelmed from the lack of support, she spiraled. “My husband is American and a first-time dad and was scared of hurting the baby. He kept pushing the baby off on me, which I didn't like. I was in pain and I was tired and overwhelmed. I got frustrated and I hit my husband,” she says. A family member called the police, resulting in Rodriguez's arrest. Suddenly, a private domestic dispute led to more serious consequences: When Rodriguez's husband arrived to bail her out the following day, Immigration and Customs Enforcement was waiting to detain her. Despite being married and having a pending Green Card application, she became one of thousands of immigrants deported this year because of contact with police.

	











	Since Donald Trump took office for the second time, ICE has been raiding immigrant communities across the nation. Prior to the raids, Black immigrants, like Rodriguez, have historically been targeted at higher rates due to systemic racism. With a host of complications, including anti-blackness and colorism in the Latino community — which often leaves Black immigrants out of conversations around protests and solidarity — the future is bleak. And Black immigrants and immigration attorneys are predicting a trickle-down effect to Black communities in America, making them vulnerable even more. 

	











	On June 6, protests broke out in Los Angeles — whose population is roughly half Hispanic, and one in five residents live with an undocumented person. On TikTok, Latino creators and activists called on Black creators and community members to protest and stand in solidarity. But to their disappointment, many Black Americans remained silent, some even voicing that the current deportations were not their fight. “Latinos have been completely silent when Black people are getting deported by ICE,” says Alexander Duncan, a Los Angeles resident who made a viral TikTok on the subject. “All of a sudden it impacts them and they want Black people to the front lines.” Prejudice has long disconnected Black and Latino communities — but the blatant dismissal of ICE raids as a Latino issue is off base.

	For some Black Americans, the reluctancy to put their bodies on the line isn't out of apathy but self-preservation. Duncan, who moved from New York City to a predominantly Mexican neighborhood in L.A., was surprised to find the City of Angels segregated. “One of my neighbors, who has done microaggressions, was like ‘I haven't seen you go to the protests,” he tells Rolling Stone. “I said, ‘Bro, you haven't spoken to me in six months. Why would you think I'm going to the front lines for you and you're not even a good neighbor?'”  


	Following the 2024 elections, many Black Democratic voters disengaged. Nationally, the Latino community's support for Trump doubled from 2016, when he first won the presidency. Despite  notable increases of support for Trump across all marginalized demographics, Latino's Republican votes set a new record. “Anti-Blackness is a huge sentiment in the Latino community,” says Cesar Flores, an activist and law student in Miami, who also spoke on the matter via TikTok. “I've seen a lot of Latinos complain that they aren't receiving support from the Black community but 70 percent of people in Miami are Latino or foreign born, and 55 percent voted for Trump.” Although 51 percent of the Latino community voted for Kamala Harris overall, Black folks had the highest voting percentage for the Democratic ballot, at 83 percent. For people like Duncan, the 48 percent of Latinos who voted for Trump did so against both the Latino and Black community's interest. “The Black community feels betrayed,” says Flores. “It's a common misconception that deportations and raids only affect Latinos, but Black folks are impacted even more negatively by the immigration system.”

	The devastation that deportation causes cannot be overstated. When ICE detained Rodriguez in February, weeks after filing her green card application, there was no consideration that she'd just given birth two weeks prior. “I was just taken away from the child. I was leaking breast milk all over. I was still bleeding because I just had a baby and was on medication but I didn't get those back.” Rodriguez thought her situation was unique until she was transported to a Louisiana detention center and met other detained mothers. “I was probably the only one that had a newborn, but there were women there that were ripped away from babies three months [to] 14 years old,” says Rodriguez. 


	On May 29, her 30th birthday, Rodriguez was one of 107 people sent to Jamaica. Around the same time, Jermaine Thomas, born on an U.S. Army base in Germany, where his father served for two years, was also flown there. Though his father was born in Jamaica, Thomas has never been there, and, with the exception of his birth, has lived within the U.S. all of his life. “I'm one of the lucky ones,” says Rodriguez, who is now back in Jamaica with her baby and husband, who maintain their American citizenships. “My husband and his mom took care of the baby when I was away. But there's no process. They're just taking you away from your kids and some of the kids end up in foster care or are missing.” 


	In January, Joe Biden posthumously pardoned Marcus Garvey, America's first notable deportation of a Jamaican migrant in 1927. His faulty conviction of mail fraud set a precedent for convicted Black and brown migrants within the U.S. 


	“Seventy-six percent of Black migrants are deported because of contact with police and have been in this country for a long time,” says Nana Gyamfi, an immigration attorney and the executive director of the Black Alliance For Just Immigration. A 2021 report from the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants found that while only seven percent of the immigrant population is Black, Black immigrants make up 20 percent of those facing deportation for criminal convictions, including low-level, nonviolent offences. “If you're from the Caribbean it's even higher,” says Gyamfi. “For Jamaicans, it's 98 percent higher. People talk about the Chinese Exclusion Act, but I've recently learned that the first people excluded from this country were Haitians.”


	On June 27, the Trump administration announced the removal of Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for Haitians starting in September, putting thousands of migrants in jeopardy given Haiti's political climate. Though a judge ruled it unconstitutional, the threat to Black migrants remains. “You have Black U.S. citizens being grabbed [by ICE] and held for days because they are racially profiling,” says Gyamfi, referring to folks like Thomas and Peter Sean Brown, who was wrongfully detained in Florida and almost deported to Jamaica, despite having proof of citizenship. “Black people are being told their real IDs are not real.” With much of the coverage concerning the ICE raids being based around Latino immigrants, some feel disconnected from the issue, often forgetting that 12 percent of Latinos are Black in the United States. “A lot of the conversation is, ‘ICE isn't looking for Black people, they're looking for Hispanics,'” Anayka She, a Black Panamanian TikTok creator, said to her 1.7 million followers. “[But] It's not just Mexican people they are looking for, it's all immigrants that are obviously not white.”  

	











	“A lot of times, as Black Americans, we don't realize that people may be Caribbean or West African,” she tells Rolling Stone. Her family moved to the U.S. in the 1980s, after her grandfather worked in the American zone of the Panama Canal and was awarded visas for him and his family. “If I didn't tell you I was Panamanian, you could assume I was any other ethnicity. [In the media], they depict immigration one way but I wanted to give a different perspective as somebody who is visibly Black.” America's racism is partly to blame. “Los Angeles has the largest number of Belizeans in the United States but people don't know because they get mixed in with African Americans,” says Gyafami. “Black Immigrants are in an invisibilized world because in people's brains, immigrants are non Black Latinos.”


	The path forward is complex. Rodriguez and Sainviluste, whose children are U.S. citizens,  hope to come back to America to witness milestones like graduation or marriage. “I want to be able to go and be emotional support,” says Rodriguez.

	Yet she feels conflicted. “I came to America battered and bruised, for a new opportunity. I understand there are laws but those laws also stated that if you overstayed, there are ways to situate yourself. But they forced me out.” 


	Activists like Gyamfi want all Americans, especially those marginalized, to pay attention. “Black folks have been feeling the brunt of the police-to-deportation pipeline and Black people right now are being arrested in immigration court.” In a country where mass incarceration overwhelmingly impacts Black people, Gyamfi sees these deportations as a warning sign. “Trump just recently brought up sending U.S. citizens convicted of crimes to prison colonies all over the world. In this climate, anyone can get it.”

Eva Longoria (Flamin' Hot) is re-teaming with Searchlight Pictures to direct Xochitl Gonzalez's film adaptation of her own novel Anita de Monte Laughs Last. Longoria will also produce through Hyphenate Media Group, her prodco with Cris Abrego, along with Jada Miranda.


	The New York Times bestseller tells the story of a first-generation Ivy League student who uncovers the genius work of a female artist decades after her suspicious death. Anita de Monte Laughs Last is a propulsive examination of power, love, and art, daring to ask who gets to be remembered and who is left behind in the rarefied world of the elite.

EXCLUSIVE: Another Dick Wolf universe actor is migrating from one show to another. Two months after Deadline broke the news that Law & Order: SVU series regular Juliana Aidén Martinez would not be returning for the venerable NBC drama's 27th season, she has closed a deal to join CBS' FBI as a series regular for its upcoming eighth season. Both shows hail from Wolf Entertainment and Universal Television.


	No details about Martinez's character are being provided. With FBI‘s Stuart Scola (John Boyd) still looking for a permanent partner after the departure last fall of Tiffany Wallace (Katherine Renee Kane), Martinez could play a new agent paired with him.

	











	Lisette Olivera was initially cast as a series regular last season to succeed Kane but left after a handful of episodes as Scola's new partner Syd Ortiz. Emily Alabi was subsequently added as a recurring, playing Dani Rhodes, a temporary partner for Scola. Alabi will return in the fall to wrap Dani's story, sources said.

	In addition to Boyd, Martinez joins returning FBI series regulars Missy Peregrym, Zeeko Zaki, Jeremy Sisto and Alana de la Garza.


	Other actors who have moved from one Wolf Entertainment show to another as new characters include Dylan McDermott (Law & Order: Organized Crime to FBI: Most Wanted), Jesse Lee Soffer (Chicago P.D. to FBI: International) and, most recently, Brandon Larracuente (On Call to Chicago Fire).


	Known for her breakout role in Netflix's limited series Griselda opposite Sofia Vergara, Martinez played Detective Kate Silva on Season 26 of SVU. She was one of two series regulars to depart in May, along with Octavio Pisano.

	











	Martinez also starred in the 2022 indie thriller Boundary and guest starred on 9-1-1, The Blacklist and Prodigal Son. She is repped by Innovative Artists Entertainment, Anonymous Content and Hansen Jacobson Teller.

“Twin Peaks” co-creator Mark Frost is putting the possibility of a Season 4 on ice. The filmmaker said that without late auteur David Lynch, “Twin Peaks” would be a different entity entirely. Lynch died January 16, 2025, at the age of 78 due to complications from emphysema. Prior to his passing, Lynch was in discussion with Frost about potentially revisiting the beloved series.

“Twin Peaks” first premiered on ABC in 1990 and aired for two seasons. Prequel film “Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me” was released in 1992; in 2017, Lynch and Frost reunited for revival series “Twin Peaks: The Return” on Showtime. Lynch also reprised his acting role as FBI agent Gordon Cole for “The Return.”

“We had talked a little bit about where a fourth season might go,” Frost recently told Empire, “but with David having left us, it's hard to imagine doing anything beyond this. It certainly feels like it closed the circle.”




			Popular on IndieWire		






Frost also explained how he had differing views from Lynch about how “The Return” ended.

 










“Initially, David and I were in two minds about how to end ‘The Return.' I felt that Cooper [Kyle McLachlan] going back and rescuing Laura, then having the mystery of her death disappear, might be an extraordinary way to bring us back to ground zero,” Frost said. “But David said, ‘He has to pay a price for what he's tried to do.' Sheryl Lee was incredible. This is the moment when the full horror comes back to this poor soul; it's the price Laura Palmer pays for Cooper's attempted good deed. That was the end of this story.”

Frost previously told NME that he and Lynch “had a little bit of a recipe forming” about a possible fourth installment of “Twin Peaks.” However, due to Lynch's health concerns, the series was shelved. 

“I felt there were uncertainties about his health, so I didn't press him on it, but nothing really stopped the flow of his creativity,” Frost said. He added at the time that it was “still kind of too soon” to say whether or not “Twin Peaks” was done for good, “but it's something I'll get around to thinking about long and hard.” 

All 18 parts of David Lynch's “Twin Peaks: The Return” recently screened at the Metrograph in NYC as part of a two-day marathon courtesy of MUBI.

Farmiga, who plays Gladys, answers burning questions about her beloved character's state of mind throughout her current harrowing ordeal.


							By 

	Ronda Racha Penrice



[This story contains spoilers from season three, episode four of The Gilded Age.]


	Who Gladys Russell will marry has been one of the most compelling storylines for The Gilded Age's explosive third season. While Gladys very much wants to marry for love, her mother Bertha has pushed her to marry Hector, the Duke of Buckingham (Ben Lamb), which will in turn make her a Duchess. Because Bertha (Carrie Coon) and her husband George (Morgan Spector), an industrialist, began the series with the disdained tag as “new money” with no social status, Bertha being able to marry her daughter Gladys off to the Duke in a lavish ceremony with all the right people in attendance at the end of episode four's “Marriage Is a Gamble” is a major coup. Although Bertha has had major societal wins, none of them, however, ensures her position as solidly as this one.

	Mrs. Astor (Donna Murphy) says this outright to Ward McAllister (Nathan Lane), her long-time confidante, during the ceremony. “What a triumph for Mrs. Russell,” she says. “Strange, really, when you think that three years ago none of us ever heard of her.”


At what price? is the question that has circulated through the Russell household, especially among its matriarch and patriarch. Bertha's insistence that she is doing what is best for her daughter and not just feeding her ambitions does little to convince her husband that she has their daughter's best interests at heart. Gladys pleading with her father to allow her to marry for love puts George in an extremely humbling position. His inability to overcome Bertha's will, especially after he needs her assistance to with his latest audacious business, is crushing. This difference of opinion as well as departure in parenting styles creates major tension between the once loving and united couple. Gladys may have agreed to walk down the aisle, but that does not mean everything is good, as is evident in her actions and her body language.

	











	Prior to the wedding, Gladys refused to leave her room. Moments before the ceremony, her attendance was doubtful. At Bertha's behest, George spoke to his daughter to convince her to go through with the marriage. And though Gladys agreed to go to the church, the dread written all over face as she cried through her veil and looked speechless at the altar still made her saying “I do” seem doubtful. As little more than a sacrificial lamb or a deer in headlights unable to change her fate, Gladys seemed so small in that big church. The “I will” she uttered to seal her marriage to the Duke felt more like a death sentence. Consummating their marriage on a boat headed to England at the end of the episode did little to erase doubts as to whether Bertha's big bet would actually pay off.


Taissa Farmiga, who plays Gladys, graciously spoke with The Hollywood Reporter and answered several questions regarding her beloved character's state of mind throughout this especially harrowing ordeal.


	***


Why does Gladys decide to show up for the wedding?


	I think Gladys was uncertain until the moment she's walking down the aisle to the moment she says “yes.” After answering and saying that “I will,” I don't feel like she's even certain of her decision then. There's the pressures of everyone around her, pressures of society, her mother, familial expectations, even of her parents and her father, who is so supportive of her and saying, “I'm here for you. But at the same time, think about your future. How does this impact you? If you say no, what will your life be like? If you say yes, what will your life be like?” 

	











	It's hard to know why you're supposed to do something. And, honestly, I don't think Gladys really knows. I think she's sick of feeling the weight of the world on her shoulders that everyone has put there and the easiest way out is through it by saying yes.


Let's talk about the conversation Marian has with Gladys about marriage at Bertha's request. While Marian is going to marry for love, presumably, talk about why Gladys can't marry for love.


	It's a big conversation this season. A big theme is marriage and divorce. There are two kinds of marriages: We have the romantic and the transactional. The people around Gladys want to marry for love, in terms of Marian (Louisa Jacobson) and Carrie Astor (Amy Forsyth). They've been both such big emotional supports for Gladys. The thing is that Bertha's ambition takes up so much space in the room, in the Russell family, that there isn't really room for Gladys' own personal ambition. Even so, if Gladys' ambition is small and she wants to marry some banker and have her house in Manhattan and her house in Newport that'll make her happy, there's no place for that in Bertha's world. So even though Marian is talking with her about the option to marry for love or doing it because you're supposed to, there's not really a choice for Gladys.


	Marian says something along the lines of, “I don't have the same responsibilities as you.” If Larry (Harry Richardson) is to ask for her hand, it's just based on a personal decision. It's not based on opinions of everybody else. Marian was influenced by Bertha when she walked into that room to help nudge Gladys in the right direction. But I think that Marian's point of: “Look around us, people that have married for love are now about to be divorced, and people that have arranged marriages, they're thriving and in love. I think you really don't know what you're going to get.”

	











What do you think Gladys' relationship to her mother Bertha was before? And what is it now?


	Previously, Gladys was a precious flower in her mother's eyes. She was a doll she could dress up. More of an object. But to defend Bertha, she shows her love in a in a different way than Gladys needs. Their love languages don't align. And previously, Gladys didn't have a say. She followed along like a puppy because that was what was expected. At the beginning of season three, Gladys has found a new confidence, an 1880 swagger. She's got her eye on a potential new suitor, one that her mother has not chosen for her. She's found a bit of her backbone and her individuality. I think with this newfound confidence, Gladys has almost forgotten how controlling her mother can be. You see it up until the end of episode four when Gladys gets married; it's definitely not of her choosing. Even though Gladys wants freedom from her mother, she still has not achieved it.


What are her thoughts on her dad? Because she was so confident that her dad was going to pull through for her.


	Gladys has always been a daddy's girl, and George has always been there emotionally looking out for his daughter, where Bertha is looking out more for the future and societal happiness of Gladys. Gladys has always relied on her father in the past. There was no indicator he wouldn't be there for her. I think that's also what boosted that confidence that Gladys has at the beginning of season three because she was assured when father promised I could marry for love. 

	











	Bertha's in charge, but Daddy Russell is the head honcho. At the end, George tried to be there for his daughter. As Taissa, I can sympathize with George because you're balancing the happiness of your daughter with that of your wife, but also the anxieties and the stress and tears from your daughter. I think part of the numbness that you see Gladys feel before the wedding, and just the emotional rut she's in, was because she had such high expectations for her father to defend her, and he does, but not enough. She just feels lost. She doesn't know what to do. Ah that's a good question. I don't think she's lost trust in George, but I think she feels lost.


I think that Gladys' decision to go through with the wedding shows that Bertha is more powerful than anyone suspected.


	Absolutely. I wholeheartedly agree. Gladys thought that George is number one, even though we always knew Bertha ran all the society endeavors of the family. But at the end of the day, Bertha Russell is the leader.


And it also shows that in this arena that is so often presented as frivolous, that women actually have had more far-reaching power than has been communicated.


	In that realm, absolutely. But, even at that time, if you look at the amount of wealthy families to the amount of working class families or the lower class families, the women who actually had an opportunity to attain a power like that, even if it wasn't “the generic financial business,” but it was the business of society, the amount of women who got to experience that was obviously much, much less than we have nowadays. But I think it's fascinating to be able to tell the stories that really show different parts of history that our audiences are not quite used to seeing or don't know much about.

	











Talk about Gladys' feelings when Billy does not speak up for her, doesn't even seek her hand.


	Oh God, my heart just dropped. This poor girl has been heartbroken so many times in the course of just a few days — first from Billy Carlton (Matt Walker), second from her father not supporting her in the way that he'd promised. In that moment. I'm picturing standing there with Matt [Walker who plays Billy Carlton] and filming this scene. It was just incredibly heartbreaking, because for her, again, there was a man that said, “I'm going to stand up for you. I am here for you. I agree with you. We can do this.” And at the end, he backed away. He went back on his word in the same way George Russell did. I think Gladys just kept getting hit with whammy after whammy. You see her after that moment when Billy breaks up with her. She's standing there in front of the Duke, again, she's still trying to do her duties. She knows her mother would probably have her whipped if she didn't show up to greet the Duke, and she's just numb and lost. It's almost too much feeling to even be able to fully express it.


And then her relationship with her brother Larry, especially in that moment where he tells her the truth about the futility in him nudging Billy to continue pursuing her.


	I think Larry and Gladys have always had a beautiful sibling relationship. It's amazing to work with Harry Richardson because we dive into that dynamic very easily. Larry has always been there from the beginning of season one. You've seen the little side eye between the siblings, and the way he supports her in front of her mother. It's so beautiful how after this [heartbreak] happens with Billy Carlton, she just collapses into his arms. He's the only male in her life who is 100 percent sticking by her side. And when Larry says that Billy basically didn't have the balls to stand there and speak to father and ask for her hand and fight for her, then what's the point? I think Larry saying that makes Gladys realize and agree. Otherwise she probably would have fallen more into [despair about] the heartbreak, but I think because Larry gave her the truth, she's more open to seeing it.

	











And then with the Duke? In talking to Hector, do you think Gladys feels “at least he's honest with me?” What about Hector makes her okay to go ahead with marrying him?


	Honestly, it's the amount of pressure that Gladys feels that that really moves her forward. But I think that conversation she has with Hector in the drawing room, where it's just the two of them, might actually be the very first time it's simply Gladys and the Duke in one room having a private conversation. And one of the first things he says is just brutally honest. He doesn't play games. At this point, again, Gladys has been burned by Billy Carlton. She's been burned by men who made promises. This is the first guy who is sort of like “This is fucking weird, but we're kind of in it together.” I think there's a part of her that respects that. But, again, she feels super lost, super numb, she doesn't know where to turn, she doesn't know who to rely on. In that moment, she's trying to see a tiny bit of a bright side of, “Well, this man, at least, he's trying to be honest.”


In the end, do you think Gladys will ever feel that her mother was right?


	What a loaded question. How to answer that? I think it's going to take time for Gladys to realize just how much Bertha loves her. Even as an audience member, there's certain moments where we see just how cold Bertha can be in her ambition. But, at the end of the day, what is motivating her is, yes, status in society, but also comfort and freedom for her daughter. And freedom comes with having power. The only power women could have in that time period is having a position in society. So I think if the moment arrives for Gladys to have to, oh my god, utter the words “my mother was right,” I think those words are going to have to be dragged from her. She will not say it willingly.

The DoD was forced to rework the video to remove the song after the band's legal action.

Metallica have never taken kindly to people using their music in ways they don't approve of. The latest example is the Pentagon, which was forced to delete and then repost a video featuring Defense Sec. Pete Hegseth boasting about the administration's ramped up effort “unleashing American drone dominance” after the rock group objected to the unauthorized use of one of their biggest hits.

	











	The original clip was cued to Metallica's “Enter Sandman,” but a spokesperson for the Department of Defense confirmed to Billboard on Monday morning (July 14) that the clip was taken down and re-edited after the copyright complaint from the group. A statement from the DoD shared with Billboard, “On Friday, representatives from X reached out to DoD regarding a video posted to our social media page and asked that the video be removed due to a copyright issue with the song ‘Enter Sandman' by Metallica. The video has been taken down, corrected, and re-uploaded to our page.”


	A spokesperson for Metallica confirmed to Billboard that the use of “Enter Sandman” in the promotional video was “absolutely not authorized.”

	The two-minute video filmed in front of the Pentagon found Fox News host Hegseth boasting of the Trump administration's removal of “bureaucratic red tape” in the manufacturing of military drones as a buzzing quadcopter carrying a memo for him to sign hovered near his head. “Here's the memo we're signing today, delivered via drone,” he said as he signed the piece of paper. The second version of the video has no soundtrack.

	











	Donald Trump has long used music at his rallies and events without the consent of the artists, with many speaking out it over the years. From his first run for the White House in 2015 through his current term, Trump has faced backlash from musicians who objected to him playing their songs at his events, including Adele, Beyoncé, Celine Dion, Foo Fighters, Guns N' Roses, the estate of Isaac Hayes — which sued trump for using the late soul singer's “Hold On, I'm Coming” at rallies — as well as the White Stripes' Jack White, Neil Young, Prince, R.E.M., Rihanna, the Rolling Stones and many more.

Sam Haskell Jr., the son of a prominent television producer, died by suicide just days before his preliminary hearing to determine whether he should stand trial for allegedly dismembering his wife and killing her parents, according to TMZ.


	Haskell was in prison at the time of his death. Last year, he pleaded not guilty to three counts of murder in a Los Angeles court. He was accused in the 2023 murders of his wife Mei Li Haskell and her parents, Gaoshan Li and Yanxiang Wang. He allegedly dismembered their bodies, placed them in garbage bags, and hired day laborers to take the bags to a dump site.

	











	Haskell's father was Sam Haskell Sr., founder and president of Magnolia Hill Productions, which produced various TV specials starring Dolly Parton and others featuring The Waltons. Before that, Haskell Sr. spent time at William Morris, where he rose to Worldwide Head of Television before retiring. During his time at the agency he repped numerous stars, including George Clooney, Dolly Parton and Whoopi Goldberg.

HBO‘s Harry Potter series has unveiled a first look at Harry in his wizarding robes, as cameras are now rolling on one of the most anticipated shows of the decade, which will be released in 2027.


	The photo sent out in the past few minutes sees Dominic McLaughin for the first time as the boy who lived. He is taking on the role played by Daniel Radcliffe in the iconic noughties movies.


	The first-look image will likely lead to a frenzy of interest from excited fans, who will in a couple of year's time see all of their favorite Potter characters on the small screen.


	There have also been a number of new cast additions including Rory Wilmot as Neville Longbottom, Amos Kitson as Dudley Dursley, Louise Brealey as Madam Rolanda Hooch, and Anton Lesser as Garrick Ollivander.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	The additions join a wealth of big names that have been announced for the series over the past months, including John Lithgow, Paapa Essiedu, Janet McTeer and Nick Frost, who will play Dumbledore, Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, and Rubeus Hagrid, respectively.


	The previous cast announcement saw Lox Pratt slated to play Draco Malfoy, with Johnny Flynn as his father Lucius Malfoy. In more family castings, Bel Powley was cast as Petunia Dursley and Daniel Rigby as Vernon Dursley, Harry's aunt and uncle. Additionally, Katherine Parkinson will play Ron's mom, Molly Weasley.

	











	This followed the biggest casting of them all, the three young leads, who will be played by newcomers McLaughlin, Alastair Stout (Ron Weasley) and Arabella Stanton (Hermione Granger) in the HBO franchise that is set to run for a decade.


	Cameras have started rolling now at Warner Bros Studios Leavesden in the UK and the series will debut in 2027 on HBO and HBO Max where it's available, including in upcoming launch markets Germany, Italy and the UK.


	Today, HBO also unveiled the department heads behind the show. These are Adriano Goldman (Director of Photography), Cate Hall (Hair and Makeup Designer), Paul Herbert (Stunt Coordinator), Mark Holt (SFX Supervisor), Mara LePere-Schloop (Production Designer), Naomi Moore (Set Decorator), John Nolan (Creature Effects Design Supervisor), Alexis Wajsbrot (VFX Supervisor), Dom Sidoli (VFX Producer), and previously announced Holly Waddington (Costume Designer). 


	The series has been described as a “faithful adaptation” of the beloved books and is being exec produced by the source material's author J.K. Rowling. Harry Potter is written and executive produced by Francesca Gardiner. Mark Mylod will executive produce and direct multiple episodes of the series, produced by HBO in association with Brontë Film and TV and Warner Bros Television. Rowling executive produces with Neil Blair, and Ruth Kenley-Letts of Brontë Film and TV, and David Heyman of Heyday Films.

Wow this kid looks more like Harry Potter than Harry Potter himself! Great casting (yes ALL of them and yes talking about the adults too).

Quite a reimagining. Good thing we're getting this new, fresh take.

He looks great!
I wish all the kids nothing but luck. I hope everyone will be generous to them.

Morat has signed an exclusive management agreement with WK Entertainment in partnership with HYBE Latin America, Billboard can exclusively announce today (July 14). 


	The Colombian pop-rock band, composed of Juan Pablo Villamil, Simón Vargas, Juan Pablo Isaza and  Martín Vargas, joins Walter Kolm's (WK Entertainment's CEO and founder) prolific roster that includes Carlos Vives, Emilia, Prince Royce, Wisin and Xavi, to name a few.

	“Morat is one of the most consistent and respected bands in Latin music today,” Kolm said in a press statement. “We're thrilled to work together and support their next chapter with a global strategy that matches their ambitions.”

Isaac Lee, chairman and CEO of HYBE Americas added: “This partnership with Morat reflects our conviction in the power of Spanish-language music as a global force. Morat is one of the most influential bands of their generation, and their incorporation into HYBE Latin America aligns with Bang Si-Hyuk's vision of building a truly global ecosystem for superstar development. We are honored to be in business with Walter Kolm.”


	The news of the signing comes on the heels of Morat's headlining show at the SummerStage festival in Central Park during the 2025 Latin Alternative Music Conference (LAMC) in New York. 


	The Bogotá-based group kicked off their career more than 10 years ago and first achieved international success in 2015 with “Mi Nuevo Vicio” in collaboration with Paulina Rubio. They are currently making the rounds with their fifth studio album Ya Es Mañana (YEM) — one of Billboard's Best Latin Albums of 2025 (So Far) — and home to their Camilo-assisted “Me Toca a Mi,” which peaked at No. 5 on Latin Pop Airplay this April. Morat is also on their Asuntos Pendientes 2025 tour that started this May in Mexico.


	“This partnership with WK comes at the perfect time. We have so much happening with the album and tour, and we're excited to have their team help us take it even further,” the band noted.

Stellan Skarsgård sees the value in having a good meal, especially while on set. The actor said during the Karlovy Vary Film Festival, via Variety, that he opted to take a half-million kroner pay cut (about $50,000 USD) for Joachim Trier's “Sentimental Value” to ensure the crew received good lunches from craft services.

“I wasn't supposed to be [an executive producer] at first, but I said, ‘I'd never film in Norway without having a special contract.' After [Erik Skjoldbjærg's 1997 film] ‘Insomnia,' I gathered the whole crew and said, ‘I'll never film in this country again – unless we get a good lunch,'” Skarsgård said. “I lost eight kilos on ‘Insomnia.' We would usually get a loaf of bread, that's pre-sliced, and a plastic salami. That's it! I've made other films in Norway since then, but it has always said in my contract that everybody should get lunches of the highest European standard. And that's expensive. Norway, they're the richest country, but they don't want to spend money on food.”

Skarsgård's poor experience on “Insomnia” led him to take matters into his own hands for “Sentimental Value,” which won the Grand Prix at Cannes 2025 and is already a 2026 Oscar contender.

 










“I went down, I think, half a million kroner in my salary to pay for this, for the food for everybody,” he said. “And the producer said, ‘You'll get credit for that.' Also, the food has to be served on real china – no plastic, paper bags or whatever. And you're not standing in line, you sit down and eat. It makes everybody happier and makes the film much better. I haven't made one bad film in Norway since.”

Skarsgård compared his taste for food to his taste for films, saying, “There's a lot of people who limit what they eat. ‘I'm not eating meat,' they say. I eat everything. I have this appetite for life, but also, it's not a genre that makes the film bad. It's laziness. The American films I've made, they were made by really good directors. Like ‘Ronin' with John Frankenheimer, ‘Dune' with Denis Villeneuve or my first Marvel film. Unfortunately, I had to sign up for four of them. But the first one was directed by Kenneth Branagh!”

He continued, “They are valid projects, even if they are a part of the big system. What's bad about the system is something that has to do with the neo-capitalistic society we live in, where everything is owned by investment firms. Like when AT&T, a fucking telephone company, took over Time Warner. A telephone company! And the head of AT&T, he said to the HBO people: ‘Now you quit this sort of arty-farty shit and start doing lighter fare so we can get our 15%.' That's horrible.”

	Alex Morris



	Fresh off a Ph.D. in astrophysics, science journalist Adam Becker moved to Silicon Valley with an academic's acclimation to hearing the word “no.” “In academic science, you need to doubt yourself,” he says. “That's essential to the process.” So it was strange to find himself suddenly surrounded by a culture that branded itself as data-oriented and scientific but where, he soon came to realize, the ideas were more grounded in science fiction than in actual science and the grip on reality was tenuous at best. “What this sort of crystallized for me,” says Becker, “was that these tech guys — who people think of as knowing a lot about science — actually, don't really know anything about science at all.”


	In More Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley's Crusade to Control the Fate of Humanity, published this spring, Becker subjects Silicon Valley's ideology to some much-needed critical scrutiny, poking holes in — and a decent amount of fun at — the outlandish ideas that so many tech billionaires take as gospel. In so doing, he champions reality while also exposing the dangers of letting the tech billionaires push us toward a future that could never actually exist. “The title of the book is More Everything Forever,” says Becker. “But the secret title of the book, like, in my heart is These Fucking People.”

	











	Over several Zooms, Rolling Stone recently chatted with Becker about these fucking people, their magical thinking, and what the rest of us can do to fight for a reality that works for us.

A lot of people who move to Silicon Valley get swept up in its vibe. How did you avoid it?


	I did sort of see the glittering temptation of Silicon Valley, but there's a toxic positivity to the culture. The startup ethos out here runs on positive emotion, and especially hype. It needs hype. It can't function without it. It's not enough that your startup could be widely adopted. It needs to change the world. It has to be something that's going to make everything better. So this ends up becoming an exercise in meaning-making, and then people start talking about these startups — their own or other people's — in semi-religious or explicitly-religious terms. And it was just a shock to see all of these people talking this way. It all feels plastic and fake. I thought, Oh wow, this is awful. I want to watch these people and see what the hell they're up to. I want to understand what is happening here, because this is bad.

And what were they up to, as far as you could tell?


	Underpinning a lot of that toxic positivity was this idea that if you just make more tech, eventually tech will improve itself and become super-intelligent and godlike. [The technocrats] subscribe to a kind of ideology of technological salvation — and I use that word “salvation” very deliberately in the Christian sense. They believe that technology is going to bring about the end of this world and usher in a new perfect world, a kind of transhumanist, algorithmically-guaranteed utopia, where every problem in the world gets reduced to a problem that can be solved with technology. And this will allow for perpetual growth, which allows for perpetual wealth creation and resource extraction. 


	These are deeply unoriginal ideas about the future. They're from science fiction, and I didn't know how seriously people were taking them. And then I started seeing people take them very, very seriously indeed. So, I was like, “OK, let me go talk to actual experts in the areas these people are talking about.” I talked to the experts, and: Yeah, it's all nonsense. 


What exactly is nonsensical about it?


	It's a story that is based on a lot of ideas that have no evidence for them and a great deal of evidence against them. It's based on a lot of wrong ideas.

	For example, I think the public perception of AI has been driven by narratives that have no foundation in reality. What does it mean to say a machine is as intelligent as a human? What does “intelligence” mean? What does it mean to say that an intelligent machine could design an even more intelligent one? Intelligence is not this monolithic thing that is measured by IQ tests, and the history of humans trying to think about intelligence as a monolithic thing is a deeply troubling and problematic history that usually gets tied to eugenics and racism because that's what those tests were invented for. And so, unsurprisingly, there's a fair amount of eugenics and racism thrown around in these communities that discuss these ideas really seriously. 

	











	There's also no particular reason to believe that the kinds of machines that we are building now and calling “AI” are sufficiently similar to the human brain to be able to do what humans do. Calling the systems that we have now “AI” is a kind of marketing tool. You can see that if you think about the deflation in the term that's occurred just in the last 30 years. When I was a kid, calling something “AI” meant Commander Data from Star Trek, something that can do what humans do. Now, AI is, like, really good autocomplete. 


	That's not to say that it would never be possible to build an artificial machine that does what humans do, but there's no reason to think that these can and a lot of reason to think that they can't. And the self-improvement thing is kind of silly, right? It's like saying, “Oh, you can become an infinitely good brain surgeon by doing brain surgery on the brain surgery part of your brain.” 


Can you explain the difference between the systems we have now, which we call “AI,” and the systems that would qualify as AGI? How big is the gulf and what are the major impediments to bridging it?


	So one of the problems here is that “AGI” is ill-defined, and the vagueness is strategically useful for the people who talk about this stuff. But put that aside and just take a look at what a large language model like ChatGPT does. It's a text generation engine. I feel like that's a much better way of talking about it than calling it “AI.” ChatGPT only cares about one thing: Generating the next word based on what words have already been generated and produced in the conversation so far. And to do that, ChatGPT consumes roughly the entire internet. It was trained on the entire Internet to pull out statistical patterns in the language usage. It's like this smeared-out average voice of the internet, and when you ask it a question, all it cares about is answering that question in that voice. It doesn't care about things like answering the question correctly. That only happens accidentally as a result of trying to sound like the text it was trained on. And so when these machines, quote-unquote, “hallucinate,” when they make things up and get things wrong, they're not doing anything differently than they're doing when they get the right answer, because they only know how to do one thing. They're constantly hallucinating. That's all they do.


So what we're calling “artificial intelligence” is really just kind of like an advanced version of spellcheck?












	Yeah, in a way. I mean, this is not even the first time in the history of AI that people have been having conversations with these machines and thinking, “Oh wow, there's actually something in there that's intelligent and helping me.” Back in the 1960s, there was this program called Eliza, that basically acted like a very simple version of a therapist that just reflects everything that you say back to you. So you say, “Hey Eliza, I had a really bad day today,” and Eliza says, “Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Why did you have a really bad day today?” And then you say, “I got in a fight with my partner,” and they say, “Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Why did you get in a fight with your partner?” I mean, it's a little bit more complicated than that but not a lot more complicated than that. It just kind of fills in the blanks. These are stock responses — something that's very clearly not thinking. And people would say, “Oh, Eliza really helped me. I feel like Eliza really understands who I am.”


The human impulse for connection is powerful.


	Precisely. It's the human impulse for connection — and the impulse to attribute human-like characteristics to things that are not humans, which we do constantly. We do it with our pets. We do it with random patterns that we find in nature. We'll see an arrangement of rocks and think, “Oh, that's a smiley face.” That's called “pareidolia.” And that's what this is. 


So current AI is not even close to being human, but these tech titans think it could be godlike?


Sam Altman gave a talk two or three years ago, and he was asked a question about global warming, and he said something like, “Oh, global warming is a really serious problem, but if we have a super-intelligent AI, then we can ask it, ‘Hey, how do you build a lot of renewable energy? And hey, how do you build a lot of carbon capture systems? And hey, how do we build them at scale cheaply and quickly?' And then it would solve global warming.” What Sam Altman is saying is that his plan for solving global warming is to build a machine that nobody knows how to build and can't even define and then ask it for three wishes.


	But they really believe that this is coming. Altman said earlier this year that he thinks that AGI is coming in the next four years. If a godlike AI is coming, then global warming doesn't matter. All that matters is making sure that the godlike AI is good and comes soon and is friendly and helpful to us. And so, suddenly, you have a way of solving all of the problems in the world with this one weird trick, and that one weird trick is the tech that these companies are building. It offers the possibility of control, it offers the possibility of transcendence of all boundaries, and it offers the possibility of tremendous amounts of money. 

	











If you have an understanding of what the technology is doing right now — versus some magical idea of what it could be doing — it sounds like it would be hard to trust it with the future of humanity. Is it just complete delusion? 


	There's a lot of delusional thinking at work, and it's really, really easy to believe stuff that makes you rich. But there's also a lot of groupthink. If everybody around you believes this, then that makes it more likely that you're going to believe it, too. And then if all of the most powerful people and the wealthiest people and the most successful people and the most intelligent-seeming people around you all believe this, it's going to make it harder for you not to believe it. 


	And the arguments that they give sound pretty good at first blush. You have to really drill down to find what's wrong with them. If you were raised on a lot of science fiction, especially, these ideas are very familiar to you — and I say this as a huge science fiction fan. And so when you start looking at ideas like super-intelligent AI or going to space, these ideas carry a lot of cultural power. The point is, it's very easy for them to believe these things, because it goes along with this picture of the future that they already had, and it offers to make them a lot of money and give them a lot of power and control. It gives them the possibility of ignoring inconvenient problems, problems that often they themselves are contributing to through their work. And it also gives them a sense of moral absolution and meaning by providing this grand vision and project that they're working toward. They want to save humanity. [Elon] Musk talks about this all the time. [Jeff] Bezos talks about this. Altman talks about this. They all talk about this. And I think that's a pretty powerful drug. Then throw in, for the billionaires, the fact that when you're a billionaire, you get insulated from the world and from criticism because you're surrounded by sycophants who want your money, and it becomes very hard to change your mind about anything. 


Your reality testing gets pretty messed up.


	Yeah, exactly. Also, a lot of these ideas just sound ridiculous, and so there hasn't been as much trenchant criticism as there should have been for the past decades. And now, suddenly, these guys have lots of money, and they're saying what the future is, and people are just believing that. 


So what you're telling me is that I'm not gonna get to live on Mars.












	Yeah, that's right. You're not going to. But you shouldn't be disappointed because Mars sucks. Mars fucking sucks. Just to name a few of the problems: gravity is too low, the radiation is too high, there's no air, and the dirt is made of poison. 


Sounds fun.


	Also you're going to freeze even if you solve all of those problems. I mean there are some spots where you wouldn't freeze if you really bundled up, but Elton John was right: Mars isn't the place to raise your kid. It's really terrifying to see the most powerful people in the world — and some of the loudest voices in the world — confuse these beliefs with reality.


You talk about in the book about how this is a sort of messianic belief, but also about how technological utopia won't be available to everyone — which is a pretty common view in apocalyptic narratives, right? There's a chosen group that will get to enjoy the utopia, but not everyone will.


	Look, inequality is a fundamental feature of the world, and I think nobody knows that better than these billionaires. I don't mean “fundamental” in the sense that it's unalterable. I just mean it's fundamental to how we've structured our society, and billionaires are beneficiaries of that. But I think that in the version of these utopias that are promoted by these tech billionaires, there are definitely unseen and unquestioned forms of inequality that would lead to some people having a lot more control and a lot more of that utopia than other people would get. 


	A lot of this is in the form of questions that, surprisingly, people don't tend to ask these tech billionaires. Jeff Bezos says that he wants humanity living in giant space stations that have millions of people, and he wants millions of these space stations, so there'll be one trillion people in space generations from now. And that leads to questions like, “OK, buddy, who's gonna own that?” One of the nice things about living on Earth is that we have these shared natural resources. If you go out into space into an artificial environment that, say, Blue Origin is going to be building, doesn't that mean that Blue Origin or some successor company is going to own those space stations and all of the air and water and whatnot inside? And doesn't that mean that there's somebody who's going to be effectively king of the space station? And if everybody lives in these space stations, isn't that going be not just a company town but a company civilization? 

	











	Musk talks about a city with a million people on Mars. The air won't even be free, right? You'll have to pay Musk just to stay alive. That's not my vision of utopia, and I think not many other people's either.


It seems pretty unlikely that these guys are going to get this utopia of which they dream, so how concerned should we even be about their delusions?


	They have so much power and so much money that the choices that they make about how to exercise that power and spend that money unavoidably affect the rest of us. This is a real danger that we are seeing and experiencing right now. Musk thinks that his mission to go to Mars and beyond is the salvation of humanity — he has said as much in as many words — and he believes that, therefore, nothing should be allowed to stand in his way, not even law. So, therefore, he supported a lawless candidate for President of the United States, a literal felon, and said that it was important for the future of humanity that that felon win. This is a billionaire interfering with the democratic process and trying to erode the democratic fabric of this country — and succeeding — in order to pursue his own personal vision of utopia that will never happen. That's a fucking problem. And that makes it everybody's business.


I suppose it's also a question of who gets to decide which problems are humanity's biggest.


	Which is what a lot of this comes down to, right? Part of the problem with trying to solve issues in the world through billionaire philanthropy is that it's fundamentally undemocratic who gets to make the decision: The billionaire gets to make the decision. Who elected the billionaire? Nobody. And so billionaire philanthropy is an exercise of power and deserves skepticism rather than gratitude. 


	But I think a lot of these billionaires see wealth as proof of someone's value and intelligence, and since they're the wealthiest people who have ever lived, that makes them the smartest people who have ever lived and so they are the ones who should be leading us into this new utopia. And if the rest of us can't see it or think that it doesn't work, well, that's because we're not as smart as they are. And if experts tell them that it can't work, well, then the experts are wrong, because, you know, if they are smart, why are they so poor? It's like [these technocrats] are constantly high on a drug called billions of dollars, and the human brain was not built to deal with that. It insulates them from criticism and makes it harder for them to think critically. 

	











What can we do about all this? Are we all just basically fucked?


	Well, look, the billionaires have an enormous amount of power and money, but there's a lot more of us than there are of them. Also, we can think critically, and so I think there's a few different things that we can do. In the short term we need to organize. One of the things that these guys are completely terrified by — and it's one of the reasons they love AI — is the idea of labor organization. They don't want workers rising up. They don't want to have to deal with workers at all, and so I think labor organizing is really important. I think political organizing is really important. We need to build political power structures that can counterbalance the massively outsized power of this really very small community of individuals who just have massive amounts of wealth. And I know that that sounds kind of facile, but I really do think it's what we have to do, and historically it is how [people] have always combated the very wealthy and their fantasies of power.

	We can also point out when they're wrong. Say “The emperor has no clothes, we are not going to Mars, and that is ridiculous.” Public ridicule of these ideas — informed, factually accurate public ridicule — is part of what I'm trying to do, and I think it's a really important and powerful tool. 


	And then in the longer term — hopefully not that far away, if we get to a place where we have political power to balance these guys out — I think we've got to tax their wealth away. They did not earn that money alone. They needed the infrastructure and community that the rest of us provide and they also, frankly, needed a lot of government investment. They are the biggest welfare queens in existence, right? Silicon Valley got enormous amounts of government spending to benefit it over the years, both on infrastructure and in buying products and whatnot. The government built the internet. The government was the biggest client of Silicon Valley back when it was first starting up through buying computer chips for the space program. The government built the space program without which you wouldn't be able to have something like SpaceX. So I think it's time to stop giving them handouts and start saying, “What we invested, the bill has come due.”

Shamus Records has announced the new release Woody at Home - Vol 1 + 2, a collection of 22 tracks by the late Woody Guthrie that were previously unreleased. It's out August 14 via Shamus. Today, the label has shared Guthrie's only known recording of “Deportee,” the 1948 track written in response to The New York Times' coverage of a plane crash in Los Gatos Canyon, California, that killed 32 people, including 28 migrant farm workers. Although long covered by artists like Pete Seeger, Bruce Springsteen, and Joni Mitchell, this is the only version in existence of Guthrie himself singing it. Give “Deportee” a listen below.

Woody at Home - Vol 1 + 2 was created by restoring analog tapes that Guthrie himself recorded when he was 38 years old, and uncovering unpublished family photographs, lyric sheets, and artwork from his archive. In early 1951 and 1952, Guthrie recorded these songs himself using one microphone on a reel-to-reel tape machine at his family's two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, New York. Nearly 75 years later, those recordings were transferred by Steve Rosenthal, restored and mastered by Jessica Thompson, and co-produced by Rosenthal, Anna Canoni, and Kathryn Ostien for this new collection.

Captured on these tracks are not just his original songs, but also the sounds of his then-toddlers, doors creaking open, and unplanned commentary from the musician. “I was here at home watching the kids by myself,” Guthrie says in audio found on one of the original home tapes. “So the kids tapes I'm sending you, the ones with me and the kids on them, I don't want you sending them back or anything like that. I just want you to keep them and play them, and see the place from whence all good folk songs breed and spring.”

Anna Canoni, Guthrie's granddaughter and the president of Woody Guthrie Publications, elaborated on the importance of these special home recordings: “These raw and intimate home tapes consist primarily of songs that Woody was unable to release in his lifetime, a life cut short by Huntington's disease. Never intended for commercial release, these tapes were recorded as Woody's introduction to his music publisher. In these private tapes, Woody sings about important moments in history like the plane crash at Los Gatos Canyon and the case of Trenton Six, meeting Albert Einstein and how his theories can help end race hate, stories of the disenfranchised and ignored, he sings about love, and of course, the fight against fascism. Woody's gentle, matter-of-fact voice and sometimes out-of-tune guitar is a refreshing and humble reminder of the true power of song.”

	When Jessie Murph returns home to northern Alabama, she heads to the gas station for an oversize cup of boiled peanuts. It's one of several rituals she now enjoys when she comes back to the region that Murph despised growing up in and fled as a teenager. 


	“My relationship with home has changed so much since I've left,” says Murph, who grew up in a town called Athens (home to the Alabama Shakes). “I really remember being 15, 16, even younger, and just knowing that I was not meant to be there. I didn't feel right there. But I go back and I'm so grateful to be there. There's something so sweet, something very nostalgic and beautiful, about the South.”


	Murph can't find boiled peanuts in Los Angeles, where over the past few years she's launched her career as a fast-rising pop star who's collaborated with Jelly Roll, Diplo and BigXthaPlug. That rise will only accelerate with Sex Hysteria, her bold second album, due later this week. The record hops from Amy Winehouse-inspired classic R&B (“1965,” “Touch Me Like a Gangster”) to pop-rap earworms (the Top 20 hit “Blue Strips”) to downcast balladry that channels one of Murph's heroes, Lana Del Rey (“Heroin”). The album, which she says she boiled down from 100 or so songs she wrote for the record, features two of Murph's favorite artists, Lil Baby and Gucci Mane.

	











	Murph hopes that her daring new collection — with its “‘fuck it and we'll see what happens' energy,” as she puts it — displays more sides of herself than she's previously shown, including her chops as a songwriter. The past year, she says, has been one of her most creative: She says she both wrote and recorded two of the album's tracks — “A Little Too Drunk” and “Blue Strips”— in a half-hour. “I feel very misunderstood sometimes,” says Murph. “I don't think people have seen the half of what I'm capable of.”

	Part of that is because, as Murph says herself, she's been reluctant to share all that much about her own life, including an Alabama upbringing that she's alluded to as having been very dark. She's thus far much preferred leaving her most vulnerable moments for her songs.

	Murph writes about this dynamic in “Gucci Mane,” the album's opening track. The song alludes to the “fucked up things” the narrator's father once did. “I don't want to talk about it,” Murph sings in the chorus. “I wanna write my way around it.”


	The most vulnerable moment on the record is “The Man That Came Back,” a piano ballad addressed to a character who is seemingly a broken father who tries to redeem himself after inflicting pain and violence on his family. In it, Murph sings about a “daughter who grew up trusting no one” left to deal with “the bruises on her skin.” 


	Murph wrote the song about three years ago. “I've refused to put it out because it was too vulnerable, and this is the first time I've had enough balls to put it on a project,” she says. “It's about things I would otherwise never talk about.”


	During a recent interview in Rolling Stone, Murph was guarded but self-reflective. But she's learning to take that armor off, at least in her music. “You do receive pressure from the label and people on your team to be more autobiographical,” she says. “So I had some talks before this album and that was a concern: ‘You don't really talk about yourself.' And I realized they were right. I never really talked about the past, and I've had an interesting upbringing, so that's something I felt pressure to do a little bit on this album. Once I did, I realized it was something I was holding myself back from out of fear.”


	GROWING UP IN north Alabama, Murph was always finding a bogus rule she needed to break. “Even when I was very little, in elementary school, I remember always being so pissed off about dress codes,” she says. “I thought they were so stupid and so catered towards [men.]” She was forced to run laps when she posted songs online with curses. Adults around her policed the clothes she wore to gym as a teenage girl. All her friends around her dreamed of becoming housewives the moment they graduated high school. The Southern, conservative culture she grew up amid was, she felt from an early age, full of hypocrisy and double standards. She bristled against all of it, “anything that felt like a dress code, is what I'm trying to say.”

	Murph fled town as a teenager, eventually making her way to Nashville. She'd grown up on Drake and Mac Miller and started incorporating rap and hip-hop into her music. Today, Murph is adjacent to contemporary country music, has collaborated with many of the genre's contemporary hitmakers, and, like Morgan Wallen and Jelly Roll, is a white Southern artist singing music that borrows heavily from Black forms like R&B and sonic innovations like trap drums.


	But Murph is not a country artist: Though she briefly lived in Nashville, and had quite a bit of fun there, it was not, ultimately, for her. She didn't relate to the industry's standard of going to an office every day to write a new song with an anonymous songwriter, and she found some of those collaborators to be unwelcoming. “In the bro country scene, sometimes they're a little hectic with women,” she says. “I've definitely met rude people in sessions, and you can tell they just don't respect women. That's definitely a thing.”


	Murph is no longer in Nashville, but as she quickly emerges into the public's consciousness (“Blue Strips” is her first solo hit), she's now dealing with a whole new host of dress codes and expectations placed upon her as a young woman in the music industry. “I started out at 16 or 17, and a big thing has been people being like, ‘I miss the old Jessie' or shit like that,” she says. “Some people want that version of you which is unhealthy and realistic.” 


	“I was really fucked up when I was 17,” she continues. “I was very severely depressed, dealing with a lot of shit. I was really struggling and I think people like to have music they can relate to. I'm very grateful for the music I put out during that's just not … ” 


	Murph trails off before collecting her thoughts. “Thank God I'm past some of that.”

	Instead, Murph is already looking ahead at the future, at what she hopes will be a long career in which she's allowed to evolve. She wants to one day make a record that belongs alongside her shelf of vinyl albums by her favorites like Alicia Keys, J. Cole, Taylor Swift, SZA, Noah Kahan, and, of course, Amy Winehouse and Lana Del Rey. “I want to make something that is completely and utterly timeless, like it could have been made 50 years ago,” she says. “I'm very inspired by Elton John, Don McLean, Adele, stuff like that.”


	For now, Murph says, “I'm having fun and experiencing life, but eventually I want to drop a very serious [record]. Not that this new one isn't serious, but I feel like I have a lot to show the world that people haven't seen yet. I think it'll come with time.”

	Podcasting company Kaleidoscope is looking to produce more original shows and turn titles from its audio content library into Hollywood movies and TV series after raising $5 million in a Series A funding round.


	The fundraising was led by Burda Principal Investments, a division of Hubert Burda Media, the German publisher, and North Base Media, the investment firm launched by former Washington Post editor Marcus Brauchli and Saša Vučinić, who started the Media Development Loan Fund.




	Also adding to the cash injection for Kaleidoscope are prior investors like The Raine Group, former MTV leader Tom Freston and venture capital firm Nimble Ventures. Kaleidoscope has a focus on science and technology storytelling, with popular audio titles like ON Musk featuring Walter Isaacson.

	Upcoming content from Kaleidoscope includes collaborations with producer John Legend and actor, creator and entrepreneur Rob Mac.


	“Kaleidoscope is building for an audience that's educated, globally minded, and culturally engaged — with underserved demand to understand how their lives are being changed by rapid advances in science and tech,” Woloshyn said in a statement. 

	











	Hattikudur added the company would look to create compelling audio content around artificial intelligence, biotech and other new technologies increasingly impacting ordinary lives.


	“We're eager to tap into the richness of those stories and tell them the vibrancy they deserve. We know young audiences are hungry for this content, and they're turning to podcasts as their primary source of news. And we're excited to ply them with addictive content they'll want to evangelize,” Hattikudur said in another statement.

Spoiler Space offers thoughts on, and a place to discuss, the plot points we can't disclose in our official review. Fair warning: This article features plot details of Superman.

Superheroes are always in a state of reaction. One way or another, every artist who picks up the brush is responding to previous iterations, elaborating on ideas they like and retconning those they don't. Superman is no exception. Throughout his 87 years on the job, his powers have expanded and contracted as often as his appearance, going from curlicue to mullet faster than a locomotive. One generation's Superman opens the Fortress of Solitude with a giant key, another's uses Kryptonian DNA. The same is true on film. 2013's bombastic Man Of Steel was a reaction to 2006's muted Superman Returns, and 2025's Superman sees Big Blue (David Corenswet) reckon with a personification of the murderous, mindless, and punchy juggernaut of the Snyderverse. 

In the climax of the new film, Lex Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) plays his trump card: His silent, masked Ultraman (Corenswet), is nothing more than a clone of Superman. Luthor's Ultraman is an automaton devoid of personality or agency. Luthor created the ultimate weapon, an invulnerable pseudo-Kryptonian that emphasizes physical strength over truth and justice. Their final fight, set in a drab Metropolis sewer, might as well take place in Zack Snyder's world, Ultraman pounding on the superhero as Luthor commands his proxy to repeatedly punch Superman in the face: “A1, A1, A1.” Ultraman is the weaponized Superman that the Snyderverse is so terrified of.

Superman has faced himself plenty of times over the years. For one, the Ultraman of the comics isn't a clone, but a malevolent version of Superman from Earth-3. Of course, there's also Bizarro, which the films have always avoided, despite him being one of the more recognizable villains in Superman's limited rogues' gallery. One would be forgiven for assuming Gunn's Ultraman was Bizarro, with Corenswet's drooping eye, shaggy mane, and hunched posture teasing an inconsistent backward speech pattern that never comes.

Much like Lex Luthor's real estate schemes, Evil Superman is well-tread territory on film, too. The high point of Richard Lester's Superman III is a junkyard brawl between Christopher Reeve's Superman and his hotter, unshaven doppelgänger. More recently, in Zack Snyder's Justice League, after Henry Cavill's Kryptonian is resurrected, he goes rogue and uses his powers against his Super Friends.

This Superman‘s mirror version is the personification of a cynic's interpretation of Superman, a character who can pack a punch but whose dopey optimism and commitment to morality make him a cornball character from a bygone age. “Brains over brawn,” Luthor sneers as he commands Ultraman, revealing how his Genius Level Intellect understands the Last Son Of Krypton.

The last time this interpretation of Superman hit the big screen, WB was reacting to the primary criticism against Superman Returns: A criminal lack of punching. Snyder was primed to correct it, spending the second hour of Man Of Steel letting Superman light up General Zod (Michael Shannon) from a desaturated Smallville to Metropolis. He'd follow it up with Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, a movie devised for Batman to kick Superman's ass. But say what you will about Superman Returns, at least its hero has an ethos. As has been debated for the last 12 years, Snyder's Superman kills more people than he saves, and even when he decides to do some rescuing, he has to snap Zod's neck first. Snyder was playing with action figures, essentially shouting “A1, A1, A1” at Henry Cavill as he crafted a version of Superman in Luthor's vision—one who doesn't inspire hope, but fear, and whose Super Obedience to his father's wishes gets Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) killed. 

Gunn's hero makes his own choices, rejecting his parents' Kryptonian Supremacist wishes. Gunn created a Man Of Steel that's a big softy, a physically and emotionally vulnerable Superman, one who values kindness over violence. It's not “brains” that Superman has over Luthor and Ultraman. It's heart. (And the foster dog that's always a whistle away.)

The Idaho Four: An American Tragedy (Little, Brown) by James Patterson and Vicky Ward, out July 14, tells the story of the college murders that took place in Moscow, Idaho in November 2022. As the title suggests, the book takes the reader into the lives of the four victims: Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, Xana Kernodle, and Ethan Chapin. It also gives what the New York Post has called “the clearest account” yet of the motives driving Bryan Kohberger, the criminology PhD student who pleaded guilty to the crimes this month thus escaping a trial and the death penalty. The book is also the story of the fallout from the murders on the twin college towns of Moscow, Idaho, and Pullman, Washington State, which are cultural opposites, but a mere 10-minute drive from each other. Typically, when there's a serious crime in either town, both police departments spring into action to help each other. But in the winter of 2022, the Moscow PD remained tight-lipped, even to their friends over in Pullman, fearful that the smallest leak could jeopardize the investigation — which appeared to be going nowhere.












Until, that is, after six weeks, they got a break, after a lab successfully used the new methodology of  Investigative Genetic Geneaology to reconstruct a family tree from the DNA found on a knife sheath left behind at the crime scene. Suddenly, the police chief of Washington State University in Pullman, gets a call from his old friend in Moscow, Chief James Fry…

Below is an excerpt from the book, telling what happens next:


	***


	Pullman, WashingtonDecember 28, 2022


	The WSU police chief, Gary Jenkins, is finishing up for the day when he sees that James Fry is calling his cell phone.


	“Can you meet at our police department?” Fry asks. 


	Jenkins and Fry are old friends. Jenkins was recently reassigned to WSU, but prior to that, he ran the Pullman Police Department for twelve years.


	It's highly unusual for Fry to be as secretive and tight- lipped as he's been about the Idaho Four, as the victims are coming to be known, but the chiefs have helped each other out on dozens of cases. Jenkins knows what his friend is trying to prevent: somehow tipping off the murderer. So, as he drives over to the Moscow police station, he assumes Fry's holding a second multiagency briefing, similar to the one where they asked for help searching for the white Hyundai Elantra.

	But when Fry meets Jenkins at the front door of the station, the WSUchief senses this is different.


	Jenkins follows Fry upstairs and into the conference room and sees asea of faces. He realizes the entire team of investigators is gathered there,waiting for him.


	What they are about to tell him, Fry says, is completely confidential, not to be shared even with his agency. 


	In that instant he realizes why he's there.


	They've found whoever did this.


	And this person is at WSU. On his turf.


	His heart sinks.


	Brett Payne says, “We think we know who the suspect is, and he's in WSU housing.”


	And then he says his name: “Bryan Kohberger.”

	Odd name, Jenkins thinks. But it's an odd familiar name. It rings a bell, and then it comes to him.


	“I know that name,” he tells the people in the room.


	He sees astonishment on their faces.


	“I think I interviewed him for an internship position when I was Pullman chief. I probably have his résumé and cover letter in my files.”


	He goes straight back to his office and sends them over.


	Payne and the team receive them, and their contents make it straight onto Payne's draft affidavit, the one he'll submit providing evidence to justify an arrest warrant for Kohberger. It already contains what the police have discovered about the path of the Hyundai Elantra, Kohberger's cell phone records, and what Dylan Mortensen saw that night.


	Payne now adds to it the following: Pursuant to records provided by a member of the interview panel for Pullman Police Department, we learned that Kohberger's past education included undergraduate degrees in psychology and cloud-based forensics. These records also showed Kohberger wrote an essay when he applied for an internship with the Pullman Police Department in the fall of 2022. 

	











	Kohberger wrote in his essay he had interest in assisting rural law enforcement agencies with how to better collect and analyze technological data in public safety operations. Kohberger also posted a Reddit survey which can be found by an open-source internet search. The survey asked for participants to provide information to “understand how emotions and psychological traits influence decision makingwhen committing a crime.”


	While Payne is writing, Jenkins is sitting in front of his computer, already running his to-do list through his mind. He's getting ready for what he'll say when he's allowed to share what he knows and for whenhis team gets the green light to write the warrants for the Moscow team to search Kohberger's home and office.


	Thank God he'd spoken to the guy in charge of camera security along Stadium Way, the main street in Pullman.


	Soon after the murders they'd agreed it might be worth holding on to the footage of the night of the murders beyond the regular retention of sixty days.


	He sees in his databases that the Pullman cops pulled over Kohberger in October. And he now sees that his guys, Officers Tiengo and Whitman, had identified the car a few weeks back.


	WSU's community is going to freak out when Kohberger is arrested. Jenkins knows this. He's got a team of counselors on standby for the cops; he'll almost certainly have to offer their services to the university.


	He goes back to his database. What else was there about this guy that was missed?


	There was a break-in near his apartment reported recently. Wasn't there some story about a student being followed to her car? 


	What else?


	His train of thought is interrupted by his phone. It's Fry, thanking him for Kohberger's résumé and cover letter. “No problem,” says Jenkins. 


	“Oh, and Gary, one more thing,” says Fry, letting out a small chuckle:


	“Aren't you glad you didn't accept his application?”

Bebe Buell turns 72 today, and the rock & roll grand dame has never been more vital. Or more appreciative of her time on this planet.


	Last summer, the singer, songwriter, and model was diagnosed with breast cancer after a routine mammogram. She had a lumpectomy, and then a breast reduction, before embarking on a holistic journey to regain her health. Buell succeeded and is presently showing no signs of cancer seven months after her surgery.


	On Monday, she celebrates her resilience, while taking stock of the temporary nature of life, with the release of her new song and video “Skin Suit.” Buell delivers the gothic rock ballad, which she co-wrote with producer Greg Lattimer and her husband and creative partner, Jim Wallerstein, with gravitas, grace, and good ol' fashioned theatricality. While her “skin suit” may be her very flesh and blood, she considers it no more important than the haute couture in her closet.


	“This is just my skin suit/Hanging next to my Manuel,” she sings, cheekily name-checking the Nashville tailor famous for his rhinestoned creations. In the next line, Buell says she stores her “skin suit” next to “my Coco Chanel.”

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“The ‘skin suit' is the physical body. It's not our soul. It's what we use to be on this earth,” Buell tells Rolling Stone. “I had the title and I had the chorus in my head whirling around. And then after I got my diagnosis, it was almost like something channeled. I put my pen to a piece of paper and it literally just poured out of me exactly as I sing it.”

	











	Despite its connection to her cancer battle, Buell is reluctant to describe “Skin Suit” as a survivor story. “It's a warrior story, because I am a warrior that is not going to be killed in battle,” she says. “I'm being very Joan of Arc about this.”


	In the video, directed by Alden Allen and Elise Lacret, Buell — in her Manuel pants and jacket — performs the song in front of an unfolding galaxy of stars. Long after she was famously photographed in the Seventies in a Creem T-shirt and little else, she embraces her decades. “I'm trying to age gracefully and show people that you can be very alive and very on the road to healing at all ages. And music is healing,” she says.

	Buell, who's lived in Nashville since 2013, continues to perform live. Back in 2018, she joined Steven Tyler onstage for “Train Kept A-Rollin'” during the Aerosmith frontman's solo show in Nashville. Buell and Tyler are the parents of the actress Liv Tyler, and Buell says she sent “Skin Suit” to her longtime friend for him to hear. “Catchy as fuck,” Tyler replied in a lengthy, praiseful text.


	Buell will play “Skin Suit” and songs off her other projects on Nov. 8 at Nashville venue the Basement. Das Damen, the Eighties alt-rock band led by Wallerstein, will perform their own set and also back up Buell. “A full-on rock, face-melting set,” Buell promises. “I just want to show women and people that rocking doesn't have an age. It has an ability, it has an attitude, it has physicality, and either you either you got it or you don't, dog.”

Sony Music Central America & Caribbean enters a distribution agreement with Alofoke Music and acquires a significant portion of its catalog.


													By
												

	Leila Cobo


Chief Content Officer Latin/Español, Billboard


In a bid to widen awareness and distribution of Dominican music at a global scale, Alofoke Music, the label founded by media personality Santiago “Alofoke” Matías, has entered into a strategic alliance with Sony Music Central America and the Caribbean (CAC). Under the new partnership, Sony Music CAC will become the exclusive distributor of all upcoming Alofoke Music releases, and will also help market and promote those titles.  


	As part of the deal, Sony has also acquired the majority of the more than 700 tracks released under Alofoke Music for over a decade, including  viral hits like “Que Linda” (Lomiiel, Donaty, and Papera); “Con Sonido”(Bulin 47, Ceky Vicini, Alofoke Music), and “Baje Con Trenza” (El Cherry Scom and Ozuna).


	“This is a collaboration,” Matías said an exclusive interview in Billboard's New York offices. “Sony Music is providing us a great opportunity for the platform we've created for music and to raise awareness of popular culture, not only in Dominican Republic but also in the Caribbean and throughout Latin America.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	Matías, known by his stage and media name Alofoke, is Dominican Republic's best-known media personality and founder of Alofoke Media Group, a multimedia platform for urban music, culture and entertainment that's been instrumental in the promotion and popularization of Dominican music and personalities.


	Its holdings include Alofoke Music, which oversees the group's recorded music ventures, plus radio shows, management of two radio stations in the Dominican Republic (including Alofoke Radio, 99.3FM), social media channels, and his hugely popular YouTube channels: Alofokeradioshow (with 5.49 million subscribers) and AlofokeTVshow (with over 1 million subscribers).


	While the Sony deal will no doubt make use of Alofoke's vast platform, the partnership is only with Alofoke Music, which oversees the group's recorded music ventures, including the acclaimed “Alofoke Music Sessions”—live studio performances during Alofoke's radio/YouTube broadcasts that spotlight emerging and established urban artists.


	At a time when dembow is finally getting mainstream attention and local artists from El Alfa to Tokischa have millions of streams, acquisition of the Alofoke recordings provides Sony a strong foothold into the market, both for existing material and for new recordings. These will include strategic collaborations on select tracks with potential for global rollout under a shared rights model. The first two releases under Sony are already in development, with official release dates to be announced soon.


	“We're thrilled to join forces with Alofoke, who is a monumental figure in the music and media space in the Dominican Republic and beyond,” said Melissa Exposito, president of Sony Music CAC in a statement. “What he represents in terms of community, culture, and championing talent aligns perfectly with our vision. This partnership is about elevating regional voices in key international markets and building bridges for emerging artists to thrive globally.”


	Matías originally launched Alofoke as a website where fans could download music and watch interviews with Dominican artists. When the advent of streaming services made downloading obsolete, the website evolved to become a platform for news and information on Dominican and urban music. What Matías quickly realized was fans not only wanted to hear the music but also hear the news and learn about the artists. The platform became so successful, Matías eventually also took it to radio.


	“There were always a lot of websites to download music from. But I gave mine a more informative spin,” says Matías. “I wrote articles on the artists, I would go see them record in the studios and I started to post content on YouTube. YouTube was our big ally.” 


	Alofoke was an early supporter of many artists. His 2013 compilation album Un Sólo Movimiento, for example, includes tracks by Bad Bunny and Lenny Tavarez.


	Matías also used his recording studios to record live performances, often bringing artists together to collaborate, like Lomiiel, Donaty, and Papera in “Que Linda.” On the Alofoke El Iluminado YouTube channel, the video has over 60 million views, and on Spotify, it has over 28 million streams.


	Sony began to take notice. Last year, after Matías sold out the Prudential Center for a performance that included his live podcast and musical performances, he began conversations with Sony's Exposito.


	“I sum up this partnership as a blessing,” says Matías. “Not for Alofoke, but for Dominian Republic, the Caribbean, the music, including dembow, merengue, bachata, perico ripiao. All those Dominican roots rhythms that haven't had exposure. I don't see it as a business, because the Dominican Republic is a small country and we don't have an international platform to support us. Sony is bringing that platform and that experience to a country that is so culturally rich. It's putting us on the map.”

With TV Club 10, we point you toward the 10 episodes that best represent a TV series, classic or modern. They might not be the 10 best episodes, but they're the 10 episodes that'll help you understand what the show's all about.

Orange Is The New Black‘s debut in July 2013, mere months after Netflix evolved from a DVD rental program to a streaming service, helped usher in a new era. If the platform's first commissioned original, the political thriller House Of Cards, established a norm of releasing all episodes at the same time, then OITNB further popularized binge-watching. After all, it was impossible not to press play on Jenji Kohan's series, which was equal parts devastating and entertaining. Based on Piper Kerman's memoir, its nuanced portrayal of prison life was, and remains, unlike anything else on TV.

Launched in a crowded year of shows about flawed men (Breaking Bad, Justified, Mad Men, Hannibal, etc.), OITNB was a breath of fresh air and a promising sign of how streaming could push boundaries. The stories of its messy, complex women struck a chord with audiences, especially as the show expanded well beyond Piper Chapman's (Taylor Schilling) fish-out-of-water journey. Each season explored in detail the lives and relationships of Litchfield's inmates, using character-specific flashbacks to show how they ended up behind bars. OITNB‘s dark humor helped viewers process weighty issues surrounding mass incarceration, from privatization of prisons and corruption to guard brutality and racial discrimination.

Striking this tonal balance became essential to OITNB‘s success. The setting inherently provided an opportunity to toggle between tragedy and comedy. For every arc about kitchen wars, a funeral for books, and a Martha Stewart-esque figure, there were nuanced tales of addiction, mental health, rehabilitation, grief, resistance, and finding a community. The show deftly handled both genres, making Emmys history as the first series to be nominated under Outstanding Comedy (for its first season) and Outstanding Drama (for subsequent seasons), following a rule change the show itself prompted in 2015. This shift resulted in fewer nominations for OITNB as the show went on, with the Television Academy rejecting a petition for it to compete as a comedy.

Of course, it remains difficult to categorize a TV show under one single genre. Look no further than FX's The Bear, a serious half-hour show that's added to the discourse around what constitutes a comedy on the ballot. Meanwhile, it was OITNB‘s 12 initial nominations that pushed the Academy to reevaluate its stance on this topic and where an hour-long series truly belongs. Despite this upheaval, the Netflix original remained steadfast in wielding its comedic and dramatic capabilities till the end. To mark the show's 12th anniversary, and in time for a whole new round of Emmy nominations on July 15, we look at the five funniest and five darkest installments that capture how well OITNB walked the line.

One of Orange Is The New Black's earliest scenes is also one of its most memorable: Suzanne (Uzo Aduba) pops a squat and pees right in front of Piper's bed, and all her Dandelion can do is stare in wide-eyed shock. Piper, who'd already turned down any notion of a romance between them, shows she has no idea that things are not as simple here. In “Lesbian Request Denied,” directed by none other than Jodie Foster, Piper is still getting the lay of the land and is confused by the fact that she has a “prison wife.” Her pregnant BFF Polly (Maria Dizzia) even expresses some jealousy. Piper and Suzanne's back-and-forth is a pretty funny escape from the episode's main plot: Sophia (Laverne Cox) needs her estrogen dosage that has been halved and eventually cut down by the prison doctor. No one, not even her ex-wife or the corrections officer, listens to her pleas. To end the hour on Suzanne's vengeful act is both absurd and a wise setup of the character arc to come.



Can a chicken be a metaphor for freedom? That's the question raised halfway through season one when Piper spots an elusive bird pecking at grass in the lawn. Having spent a relatively relaxed morning adjusting to a new normal, she gloms onto this sighting as a weird symbol of hope, so much so that she abandons an important work call to chase after it. Her priorities, right or wrong, are finally in order. Maybe, like this chicken, Piper can make the most of her time even if she can't fly out of here just yet. The hunt for the possibly drug-filled creature acts as an ideal distraction for Piper and the prisoners, who are otherwise engaged in turmoil or infighting. “The Chickening” is not laugh-out-loud funny, but the surreal and broad humor is grounded by the little things that become important while in an isolated setting. The chicken reappears throughout the series, but here, it's a hilarious way to unpack everyone's psyche, as evidenced by how Pipes looks longingly at it freely roaming outside of the walls caging her in.



OITNB used comedy as a salve for tragedy in any given episode. The Sian Heder-directed “A Whole Other Hole” centers on the potent reveal of Lorna's (Yael Stone) backstory and obsession with her “fiancé. To counteract that heaviness, a subplot in this episode is about a female anatomy lesson for the inmates. A device Poussey to pee standing up leads to a necessary conversation among her friends about the urethra. The subplot is not entirely out of left field, considering the show's openness about nudity and sex. But this episode mines plenty of laughs from how Taystee (Danielle Brooks), Suzanne, Poussey, Piper, Angie (Julie Lake), Leanne (Emma Myles), among others, discuss a topic that's hardly talked about in society. And in some of their cases, it also leads to self-discovery about seeking pleasure. A similar, almost sitcom-like arc occurs with Big Boo (Lea DeLaria) and Nicky competing over how many people they're hooking up with and giving orgasms to, which adds levity to an episode that unravels Lorna.

This Nicky-focused installment unpacks how her distant parents and privileged upbringing set her up to fail, considering she never knew how to take accountability in the past. OITNB uses this episode to address how much display whether or not Nicky has changed in present day, but the primary source of laughs comes courtesy of a brand new Litchfield entrant: Counselor Berdie Rogers (Marsha Stephanie Blake), who opens up a drama club, offering inmates a safe place to express and channel their emotions. Berdie hopes the power of acting will help free them, and she's proven right when Piper and Alex use a class assignment to come clean about their feelings for each other despite a lack of trust. The performances that take place during the drama club are not only hilarious, but also used by Berdie to encourage Suzanne and Black Cindy to embrace their artistic side. After two seasons of CO's like Pornstache or even Bennett (Matt McGorry)—who has ditched a pregnant Daya (Dascha Polanco) at this point—it's heartwarming to witness Berdie bond with the inmates.

The entirety of season five takes place during a tumultuous three days in the aftermath of Poussey's murder, with the inmates holding the MCC employees hostage until their demands are met. On one end, Taystee takes control of negotiating with Caputo and Fig (Alysia Reiner), while hellish officer Piscatella (Brad William Henke) makes it his mission to kidnap, torture, and mentally destroy the prisoners who dared to rebel for basic human rights. Amid all this, it's a relief that OITNB squeezes in “Litchfield's Got Talent.” A lot of stuff goes down in this hour. Meth heads Angie and Leanne get control of the gun, and they use their newfound power for the funniest possible thing: They make the MCC hostages put on a talent show that ranges from singing to a Joseph Smith reenactment. Perhaps the most out-there performance comes courtesy of CEO Stratman (Evan Hall), who performs a strip tease and lap dance to raucous applause and cheers. For a brief moment, Litchfield becomes a dimly lit fun zone. Also of note: Suzanne hosts a seance, and poor Judy King is tied up to a cross as a revenge for the luxuries she has been afforded.

OITNB often pulled the rug out from under us with unexpected twists and harrowing deaths (Samira Wiley's Poussey and Taryn Manning's Pennsatucky come to mind right away). But an early crushing blow, and a sign that this show is not for the weak, comes with Tricia (Madeline Brewer). This episode emphasizes the bleak reality of the people trapped within and preyed upon by a corrupt justice system. In this case, corrections officer Mendez, a.k.a. Pornstache (Pablo Schreiber), takes advantage of Tricia to smuggle drugs despite knowing her history of addiction. After forcing her to work and then locking her in a room, he returns to find she has overdosed and died. If the guy wasn't a villain already, “Bora Bora Bora” loudly proclaims him as the enemy. Pornstache makes the accident look like Tricia took her own life, which sends her close pals Nicky (Natasha Lyonne) and Red (Kate Mulgrew) into a spiral. Elsewhere, Piper gets real with a juvenile delinquent and lectures her about what it takes to survive. “I'm scared that I'm not myself in here, and I'm scared that I am,” she says. The dialogue feels pertinent to everyone inside Litchfield who has been forced to adapt, or, worse, encouraged to follow their worst impulses.



One of OITNB‘s polarizing and dangerous villains was Vee (Lorraine Toussaint). As The A.V. Club's recap of this finale noted, she's the catalyst for main players like Taystee, Poussey, and Suzanne to evolve. “We Have Manners. We Are Polite” is not a wholly satisfying conclusion to their dynamic. The dramatic stakes are high because everything is on the line for Vee after she assaulted Red, and Healy (Michael Harney) is hot on her trail. Against all odds, OITNB makes the audience (slightly) empathize with Vee's fear and loneliness, even if that's exactly how she made the girls under her thumb feel. The show's power truly came from how it humanized its flawed women. Then again, it's just as cathartic when Miss Rosa (Barbara Rosenblat)—who is driving away, hoping to escape so she doesn't die of cancer in prison—runs down Vee, who has also escaped. Season two's closer comes full circle for Piper as well, whose relationship with Alex (Laura Prepon) is on the line. Piper manipulates Polly and Larry (Jason Biggs) to let Alex's parole officer know about her plans, ensuring she doesn't skip town. It's a cold move similar to what Alex pulled earlier when she gave Piper's name during her own trial. Their love story reaches a toxic stage here that, thankfully, develops as it goes on.

Season four's penultimate hour, in which the inmates' silent protests quickly turn violent, is one of OITNB‘s definitive episodes. Poussey's desire to help a non-medicated Suzanne turned fatal after she was pinned down by CO Bayley (Alan Aisenberg), crushed under his weight. Yet, the most poignant hour comes after her death. In “Toast Can Never Be Bread,” flashbacks take us back to a much happier day in Poussey's life when she could hop on a bus with friends and take whatever the open road threw her way. In the present, Taystee and the rest of Poussey's friends struggle to cope. They go through all stages of grief, sticking primarily with righteous anger; anger that Poussey's murderer is likely going to go free and that the only ones facing consequences will be them. Not even Caputo (Nick Sandow) stands up for the truth. “Toast Can Never Be Bread Again” is sad and infuriating, exploring the pervasive evil of corporate and government bureaucracy. It's no wonder that the end, with Daya picking up a gun and pointing it at an officer, is one of the most charged final shots of any OITNB episode.



OITNB‘s deft handling of immigration laws and how the country's broken system affects people resonated when the final season aired in 2019, but it feels like a must-watch right now (for both educational and humanitarian reasons). In “Minority Deport,” Maritza (Diane Guerrero), who's being held in a PolyCon ICE facility, manages to get a lawyer's information from Gloria (Selenis Leyva). Being the sweetheart that she is, Maritza passes the number to the other women held there. That's the last straw because officers round her up with a few others and put them all on a plane. The final minutes of “Minority Deport” are the hardest to shake off: Maritza, along with the other passengers, slowly fades away from the airplane seat, as if she'd never existed—a terrifying notion if there ever was one. In highlighting the many hoops people have to jump through to obtain U.S. citizenship, OITNB delivered a poignant and necessary message.



After 90 episodes of complicated stories about resilient women who have endured unspeakable things, there's no fairytale ending for Orange Is The New Black. Instead, the dramatic closer offers a realistic conclusion; gritty, grounded, and full of hope about the human spirit. That's ultimately what Kohan's series was all about: Overcoming hardships through empathy, even in the toughest of circumstances. Piper and Alex are divided by the walls of an Ohio prison, the latter has been transferred to, but their connection is stronger than ever. Pennsatucky's death weighs on Taystee and Suzanne, but they're both used to moving on. Black Cindy and Gloria acclimate to life outside of Litchfield, unnerving as it may be. Best of all, Nicky pays tribute to her saviors by taking over the kitchen as the next maternal figure (adorned in red lipstick, of course). Like any powerful OITNB outing, “Here's Where We Get Off” puts us through the wringer, but not shying away from these emotions is exactly what made this an incredible—and incredibly dramatic—series finale.

The public broadcaster came under fire in February when one of the 13-year-old subjects in the film, a young boy called Abdullah Al-Yazouri, was found to be the son of a Hamas official.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	The BBC documentary Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone breached one of the broadcaster's editorial guidelines by failing to disclose a child's connection to Hamas, a report published on Monday has found.


	The corporation came under fire in February when one of the 13-year-old subjects in the film, a young boy called Abdullah Al-Yazouri, was found to be the son of Hamas' deputy minister of agriculture.




	The BBC pulled the doc from its streaming service, BBC iPlayer, and apologized for the “unacceptable flaws” in airing the program. It said at the time that production company Hoyo Films “assured [the BBC] that no payments were made to members of Hamas or its affiliates, either directly, in kind, or as a gift”.

	A review by Peter Johnston — independent of BBC News and current affairs — was ordered and made available on Monday. The review team identified and considered 5000 documents from a 10-month production period, as well as 150 hours of material filmed during production.




			Related Video		







	Johnson concluded that the program breached a guideline on accuracy, which deals with misleading audiences. His report describes the background on Al-Yazouri's father as “critical information” not shared with the BBC before broadcast. “Regardless of how the significance or otherwise of the narrator's father's position was judged, the audience should have been informed about this,” it says.

	











	While the review does not consider that Hoyo Films intentionally misled the BBC about the narrator's father's position, it finds the independent production company bears “most responsibility for this failure”. The BBC is also partially to blame, it adds.


	The corporation takes “this finding very seriously,” according to a press release. BBC director-general Tim Davie said the report identifies “a significant failing in relation to accuracy.”


	“We will now take action on two fronts,” he continued, “fair, clear and appropriate actions to ensure proper accountability and the immediate implementation of steps to prevent such errors being repeated.”


	A statement from the BBC board added: “Nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. We welcome the actions the executive are taking to avoid this failing being repeated in the future.”


	Hoyo Films apologized for the mistake and added that they are working with the BBC to see if there's a way to bring back to iPlayer the stories of those featured in the program. It comes after outrage from industry figures who were, in February, calling on the BBC to reinstate the program. Soccer star Gary Lineker, actors Riz Ahmed, Khalid Abdalla, Miriam Margolyes and director Mike Leigh were among the 800+ signatories of an open letter published by Artists for Palestine U.K.


	“Our team in Gaza risked their lives to document the devastating impact of war on children,” said the production company. “Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone remains a vital account, and our contributors, who have no say in the conflict, deserve to have their voices heard.”

	











	The report found no other breaches of the BBC's editorial guidelines, including any breaches of impartiality, and no evidence that outside interests “inappropriately impacted on the programme”.


	“Careful consideration of the requirements of due impartiality was undertaken in this project given the highly contested nature of the subject matter,” it concluded.

A lapsed streaming deal and the ongoing Paramount-Skydance merger review have left viewers outside the U.S. scrambling for access to the long-running animated hit, just ahead of its season 27 premiere.


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


International fans of Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny were left reeling last week after South Park was pulled off streaming service Paramount+ amid an ongoing licensing dispute between the show's creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone and Comedy Central's parent company, Paramount Global.


The Hollywood Reporter broke the news that Paramount+'s international license to stream episodes of the long-running animated series has expired, forcing the streamer to pull the show off its global service. Outside the U.S., Paramount+ is available in the English-speaking territories of Canada, Australia, the U.K. and Ireland; in France, Italy and German-speaking Europe; in Japan, and across Latin America.

	Threads on the South Park subreddit and social media have lit up with foul-mouthed complaints from international fans, most of them directed at Paramount and David Ellison's Skydance Media, whose $8 billion buyout of Paramount is at the heart of the South Park dispute. 


	“wtf. 100 % cancelling my subscription now,” noted user @emale27. “The only reason I had Paramount+ was to watch South Park. I just canceled,” concurred @jaywinner.


	“How does one go about setting Paramount on fire?'” asked @Acceptable-Bid-1019, prompting another user, @probably420stoned to quip: “They've basically just done this themselves.”


	Amid threats to cancel their Paramount+ subscriptions, devotees of the long-running animated series from Canada, Australia, France, Germany and elsewhere traded tips on how to watch the show, legally or otherwise, from their respective territories.

	











	Paramount+ still has the rights to stream South Park specials internationally. South Park remains on the air on Paramount's Comedy Central channels worldwide, whose footprint spans most of Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Australia/New Zealand. Paramount's ad-supported streaming service Pluto.TV also carries the show in several territories, including Canada, Latin America and select European countries. Back episodes are available for purchase on other services, including Apple TV and Amazon Prime. In some territories, including Germany and the Latin American region, back episodes are available to stream, ad-supported, on a stand-alone South Park website.


	That fragmented global access was not what Paramount had in mind ahead of the season 27 premiere of South Park, which is set to bow on Comedy Central in the U.S. and internationally on July 23, two weeks later than originally planned.


	Sources close to Paramount told THR the studio remains in negotiations and hopes to have the show back on Paramount+ soon. 


	Talks over a new South Park streaming deal, to replace its now-expired five-year pact with Warner Bros. Discovery's HBO Max, have stalled amid Paramount's protracted sale to Skydance.


	As first reported by The Hollywood Reporter last month, Parker and Stone, through their Park County business entity, threatened legal action against Paramount. Park County accuses incoming president Jeff Shell, currently chairman of sports and media at Skydance investor Redbird Capital Partners, of interfering with their contract negotiations with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Netflix to modify certain terms “to benefit Paramount at the expense” of Park County. It pointed to Shell pushing WBD to give Paramount+ an exclusive 12-month window for new episodes of the show and to shorten the term of the licensing deal from 10 to five years.

	











	A representative for Skydance released a statement dismissing the allegations. “Any accusation that Jeff Shell tried to lower the price or devalue the franchise in any way is not only nonsensical but patently false,” the statement reads. “Under the terms of the transaction agreement, Skydance has the right to approve material contracts.”


	Paramount has two years left on its $900 million licensing deal for South Park but without unified international streaming rights, many global fans of the potty-mouthed kids from Colorado will remain frustrated.


	But that doesn't mean they've lost their sense of humor.


	“The silver lining of all this merger crap,” noted @Kalse1229 on the South Park subreddit, “is that it's gonna make for an excellent South Park takedown.”

The international superstars put their global sounds on display as Chelsea took home the trophy with a dominant 3-0 win over PSG.

	Just about 52 miles from Manhattan, a quartet of global superstars teamed up as Doja Cat, Tems, J Balvin and Coldplay performed from the upper deck of MetLife Stadium in New Jersey with a view of the Big Apple skyline at their back.

	Not long after the whistle blew following Cole Palmer's first half masterclass, fans' necks and attention turned toward the innovative stage design that felt as if it was floating above the stadium.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	With how much conversation there was around the newly-planted grass at MetLife, concert organizers shrewdly pivoted to the creative multi-level platform hundreds of feet in the sky to avoid game interruption, which was built with 40,000 pounds of staging structures. 

	











	J Balvin got the 15-minute party started with his moombahton smash “Mi Gente.” Draped in all-white, the Colombian star was flanked by dancers and drummers repping the colors of his native country. 


	Tems brought the African vibes with her tender “Love Me Jeje.” The Nigerian singer glided across the stage in a sparkling cold shoulder black top and heels to the tune of her guitar-tinged hit before Balvin returned for “Reggaeton.”


	Doja Cat turned the show into overdrive with her empowering “Woman” bop while rocking a glistening red and blue Adidas dress filled with custom Swarovski crystals and Samba heels, which felt like a mix of Sporty and Baby Spice. She also gave a tease of her upcoming album with her wardrobe as “Vie” was emblazoned across her midsection.


	“I'm proud to represent America on this unique stage that will bring people from all corners of the world together,” Doja told Rolling Stone of the performance last week. “I'm also extremely grateful to continue to support global education efforts by raising funds for the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund.”


	The surprise of the afternoon came when Coldplay hit the stage for the band's “A Sky Full of Stars,” which saw the stage's backdrop turn into a rainbow paradigm. They were joined by Australian artist Emmanuel Kelly, who preached a message of unity while sharing a hug with Chris Martin and Doja Cat. 


	“I'm so happy we're here together,” he shouted as fans held up towels spelling out love in various global languages. Kelly made history as the first differently abled FIFA halftime performer. Fireworks filled the sky, but were faint due to the shining daylight. 


	“Today we witnessed something truly historic — artists representing the Americas, Africa, Europe and Oceania coming together on football's biggest stage for the first ever FIFA halftime show,” said Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans. “This international lineup perfectly embodied the idea that music and football can unite the world, and when we take action together, we can make an outsized impact to help children around the world access quality education.”

	











	FIFA and Global Citizen have raised $10 million of their $100 million goal to provide educational funding for children through the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund. The FIFA-Global Citizen partnership will continue next year when the FIFA World Cup Final Halftime Show comes to MetLife Stadium in July 2026.

Olivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey are officially parents. The couple announced the birth of their first child, a daughter named Colette Annalise McCaffrey, on Sunday, July 13, via a joint Instagram post showing their newborn's hand. “Colette Annalise McCaffrey 🤍,” they captioned the photo.

A post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)

In a follow-up post on her Instagram Stories, Culpo shared a heartfelt moment: “Colette is so lucky to have the best daddy in the world,” she wrote, showing McCaffrey watching over their baby girl. “A love like no other.”

A post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)

In more Instagram stories, Culpo, 33, revealed that she delivered via C-section and described it as: “The scariest and most rewarding of all experiences.” According to people, she credited her husband's calming presence in the operating room. “As soon as [Christian] came into the room, I felt most at peace,” she wrote, adding that she held tightly onto his arm.

A post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)

Culpo first announced her pregnancy on Instagram in March 2024, captioning a black-and-white maternity shoot: “Next chapter, motherhood 🤍.”

In another post, she and McCaffrey strolled through a field while holding hands and showing off her baby bump. McCaffrey also held sonogram photos in a sweet moment captured on video. The couple met through a blind date in June 2019 but kept their relationship private until Valentine's Day 2020. 

A post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)

NFL player McCaffrey proposed in April 2023, and they married in Watch Hill, Rhode Island, in June 2024.

Baby shower of my dreams 🧸 thank you to everyone who made this day so special. Best surprise ever 

On an episode of The Culpo Sisters in December 2022, Olivia discussed freezing her eggs: “I've been making decisions out of fear for the future… There's a lot of pressure that I've been putting on my relationship because of fertility.”

She added: “I am going to freeze my eggs so that I can have babies when the time is right for Christian and me. It's an insurance policy. It's exciting.”

In a lighthearted TikTok from October 2023, Culpo joked that she wanted to: “Rip out” her IUD and “start trying immediately” after their wedding.

A post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)

Though Olivia tried to keep her pregnancy under wraps, sister Sophia Culpo playfully called her out. “Now you all know why her nickname is Oblivia … she ain't stealth,” Sophia joked, sharing a throwback of Olivia trying to cover her bump with her dog.

She later teased that Olivia's dress at a February wedding “poorly” hid the baby bump, quoting her sister's attempt at cover: “I'm just bloated.”

A post shared by Olivia Frances Culpo (@oliviaculpo)

Despite the teasing, Olivia's sisters had no doubt she'd be a natural mother. “I know she's going to be a really loving mother,” Aurora Culpo told People in October 2024. “She's probably already picking out her children's preschool.”

The couple is now settling into life as new parents, filled with love and gratitude.

Man, what a nightmare it is to be Gladys lately. Despite her best efforts to live a life not completely defined by her mother Bertha's rules, those wishes are all but unstoppable. After spending much of this episode hiding away in her room as the Russell home busies itself with preparations for her wedding to the Duke of Buckingham, she walks down the aisle in tears to marry a man she's met, I'm guessing, fewer than five times. We don't even see a reception. She's quickly whisked to England on a boat where the marriage is, at best, unenthusiastically consummated. While The Gilded Age plotlines are often described as frivolous, Gladys' storyline here feels a lot more like Sansa Stark than Cinderella. 

Bertha is pretty sure Gladys will get over it eventually, and if she doesn't, at least the union is a victory for her social climbing. Even Mrs. Astor is gagging. As her daughter is sobbing her way down the aisle, Bertha can only produce happy tears. Three years ago, almost no one wanted to be associated with the Russells. Now, they're legally bound to the British Crown. The price was steep, and the marriage has been the most personally expensive part. Bertha, as an individual lady, reached a ceiling when she won the opera last season. The only way to keep climbing from that height is to elevate the standing of her children. 

We've never learned too much about Bertha's life before we met her in season one, but the introduction of her sister Monica (the always delightful Merritt Weaver) gives new context. Monica does not fit into the image Bertha wants to present, despite being wry, competent, and curious—words that also describe Bertha at her best. Still, Bertha is embarrassed by Monica, who, despite a deep knowledge of who her sister is, is not immune to Bertha's manipulation. After disapproving of Monica's clothes, Bertha arranges for Church to spill coffee on her, forcing her to change. Monica seems to live a comfortable middle-class life in Albany, a sort of ideal averageness that Bertha wants none of. 

To Bertha, wanting this social capital and actual capital badly enough to break these familial bonds is worth it. It's just the price of poker. (Some might say it's the American way—and I don't mean that positively!) It's not that Bertha can't understand why someone would want a more modest and loving life—she is completely uninterested in their viewpoint. It's a testament to Carrie Coon's skill as an actor that Bertha remains at all stomachable these past few episodes. Her unwillingness to take “no” for an answer has always made her the best character on the show, but she is becoming downright sinister. I hope there is more Monica, or at least more of the O'Brien side of the family, to learn why Bertha is like this. Maybe the Irish-sounding maiden name is a clue to why she long felt so close yet so far from polite society. 

The Gilded Age is pretty cagey overall about who these characters were before we joined them on 61st Street. The past and the future are meeting for our other major families, though they all take a backseat to the dynamic between Gladys and Bertha. Last week, the show introduced the parents of Dr. William Kirkland, the physician who cared for and struck up a romance with Peggy after the season premiere. His father, Frederick (Brian Stokes Mitchell), is much warmer to the Scotts than Elizabeth (Phylicia Rashad), who is shockingly dismissive of Arthur when she finds out he was a former slave. We don't get too much more development on this front yet, but it is refreshing to see The Gilded Age allow its Black characters to explore their monied hierarchies the way the white characters get to do. The dynamics are nuanced, and it's a relief to see Peggy with a storyline that isn't completely tragic or horrific.

Meanwhile, things are getting a little crazy in the Forte/van Reijn/Brook household: Agnes is still mourning the loss of her great fortune, and Ada is mourning her late husband Luke by enlisting a medium (played by, who else, Andrea Martin). It must be said, Ada's methods of coping are a lot more fun to watch than Agnes', whose primary character trait is “resistant to change.” There seems to be a growing contingent of ladies on the outs from society with Agnes, Aurora Fane, and the soon-to-be-single Charlotte Astor. Still, it hasn't quite coalesced into anything yet amid the Bertha and Gladys show. Marian has also been spending a lot more time at the Russell residence, even becoming a bridesmaid in Gladys' wedding, though through Larry's action, not her own. “I just stood still while they made it fit,” she says when she appears in the dress, which sounds about right. Marian is also on the list of people Bertha dislikes, especially to marry her son, due to Marian's downwardly mobile family. Ironic, given that the duke she just married her daughter off to is pretty broke himself.  

At least one person is, visibly, upwardly mobile: Jack Trotter, who, with the help of Larry Russell, just sold his clock invention for a cool $600,000 to split between the two of them. Google (not the AI) tells me that Jack's share is about $7.6 million in 2025 money, meaning he never needs to work again if he doesn't want to, and certainly not as anyone's servant. It's a bittersweet realization because he doesn't know anything or anyone else. Still, it's a good problem to have, and he and Larry will surely remain the best of friends.

It has been quite a year for Lisa Yamada, who plays Luna Nozawa on “The Bold and the Beautiful.” She took the sweet, somewhat boring Forrester intern and turned her into one of the very best villains, maybe in all of soap history. It has been like watching two completely different characters collide, sometimes mid-sentence, thanks to the brilliance of the young actress.

On July 10, 2025, Lisa Yamada was nominated for her first Daytime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Emerging Talent in a Daytime Drama Series. The actress took to Instagram to share her joy with the B&B fans who believe that she has been the shot in the arm that the show needed. 

In an Instagram Story that has since disappeared, Yamada stated that she had been on a plane when the nominees were first announced, but not long after landing, she shared her joy in a post.

“impostor syndrome goin crazy rn 

15 years in and this career STILL feels like a pipe dream… that pipe dream just landed me an emmy nomination ????? say whaaaaat lol this is a prank right ???

thank you brad bell for trusting me with such a beautifully complex villain like luna. playing her has been the honor of my life. i walk into television city everyday full of gratitude. how lucky am i to call this my job.

i love you @christianweissmann, i'm so happy i get to do this with you

idk what i did to be deserving of this incredible life i live. I'm so eternally grateful for whatever magic the universe is working up there 7777 ,” said the actress in her caption.

It appears that the character of Luna Nozawa may have met her demise, but true soap fans know that death is negotiable and people often return to life in the world of daytime. As we wait to see what happens to Luna, her portrayer has a few other projects coming to a big or small screen near you.

Lisa announced on Instagram that she has a new film. “Wish You All the Best,” coming to theaters on November 7, 2025.

Then there is that spot that she has landed in “Elle,” the prequel to “Legally Blonde” that is coming to Amazon Prime.

While Luna Nozawa's true fate may hang in the balance, it's pretty clear that Lisa Yamada's career is only just now beginning to take

      Date and time are approximate as this was captured on an old phone with unsynced time/date. Date is more accurate +/- 1 day at most.
    


      If you aren't indoors in a dark room and/or interested in technical videos, I recommend not investing the 44 seconds into watching this video.
    


      Basically all of the action occurs from 00:35 - 00:40 in this video. If you slowly scrub through that portion, I propose you will see two UFOs. One UFO remains stationary, providing a point of reference, while the other UFO accelerates upward.
    


      After 00:40 the point of reference is lost, but my memory is that it continued accelerating up (as depicted in the video).
    


      Also, regarding psi phenomena, I had the subjective experience of having my arm telekinetically assisted and directed to better capture these UFOs, while recording. It was highly consensual telekinetic assistance, as that was my objective, to record them.

The actor said that he's "grateful" for the outpouring of support he's received from fans

 Jared Padalecki is opening up about the mental health struggles he's faced during his decades as an actor — and how fans have accepted his willingness to share.


 Earlier this year, Padalecki, 42, was joined by several of his Supernatural castmates at MegaCon Orlando, when the conversation turned to the show's 20th anniversary (it debuted in September 2005).


 "I can think back to the 20 years — with the strike and COVID and this and that — and there were a lot of sacrifices," Padalecki said. "There's been a lot that like, this sucks, and I don't wanna wake up and I don't wanna leave the house, I don't wanna get out of bed and I don't wanna go be with that person."


 He continued, "But in hindsight, I just feel so grateful [for the fans] because I was very public about some of the s--- I was going through that I've been kind of not secret about but haven't shared yet and I was met with such love and acceptance that it meant a lot to me."

 Padalecki went on to say how "grateful" he was to Supernatural's fan base, adding that he's enjoyed watching people get interested in the show in the years since it ended in 2020. "The more people that join, it's like a rising tide that raises all boats," he said.


 In 2024, the actor revealed that he checked into a clinic in 2015 — during the run of Supernatural —while struggling with suicidal ideation.


 “It was 2015, I had a really low moment,” he said on an episode of Tommy DiDario's I've Never Said This Before podcast, alongside wife Genevieve Padalecki. “I was letting my thoughts take over and going to places of dramatic suicidal ideation. I called my wife and she said, ‘Get home.'” 


 “And so, I got home, went to a clinic for a couple weeks and looked into it and haven't been suicidal since — not for a moment,” he said, before adding that he needed "a full reset."


 "I had spent 15 years in this industry. You go to an audition or on a red carpet and they don't want, ‘Jared, how are you doing today?' ‘Oh today was rough, I didn't sleep.' They want, ‘Oh it's great! Excited to be here!' So I had done that for so long, trying to focus on what's best for the person who's talking to me as opposed to just being honest," he continued.

 Padalecki added that he never saw the struggles as something to be ashamed of. “I don't wear it as a scarlet letter. It's not like I'm shameful like, 'Hey, I see a therapist, I've been to a clinic,' " he said. "I wear it proudly. I put it on my face and tell everybody. If you're not in a situation where you need that degree of help then don't seek it. I needed a surgeon — not literally — but I needed it and here I am.”

The infamous haunted doll, Annabelle, made a tour stop in Gettysburg over the weekend.

Known for her creepy presence and eerie backstory, Annabelle has captivated horror fans and paranormal enthusiasts across the country and around the world. 

The doll was put on display as part of the "Devils on the Run Tour" on July 11 at the Soldier's Orphanage Homestead, a historic building that served as a field hospital during the Battle of Gettysburg.

WGAL was able to get an up-close look at the doll. You can see that video above. 

A sign posted beneath the doll said:



"Annabelle

"This Raggedy Ann doll was believed to be possessed by a young girl named Annabelle. After the owner experienced more sinister and dangerous activity, Ed Warren determined that the doll was possessed by the demonic. The doll was soon turned over to the Warrens for safekeeping and placed in the Warren's Occult Museum. Annabelle is responsible for scratching one of its victims with seven psychic scratches, and several motor vehicle accidents including the death of a motorcyclist who taunted Annabelle shortly before the crash."

let us do the work

A firsthand journey into Columbia's haunted history—where ghost stories, unsolved mysteries, and Southern gothic legacies come to life after dark.

Written by 

Welcome to Rumor Has It, a series investigating some of the most compelling lore and legend across the U.S. These articles invite readers to dig deeper, ask questions, and be curious.

By the time our guide lit the lantern, the sun was just beginning to dip behind the skyline, casting a blue-gray wash over Columbia's wide streets and old brick facades. There's something about this Southern capital after dark that chilled me. It doesn't try to be spooky. It just is

I love a good walking tour, especially after the sun sets and the real stories come to light. I recently went to Philadelphia to enjoy a haunted history tour that showed me a completely different side to the city, and wanted to do the same with my trip to Columbia, South Carolina.  I stumbled upon a company called US Ghost Adventures and decided to sign myself up. While I had an idea of what to expect on this nighttime adventure (hello, local folklore and legends!), I was unprepared for just how much I would learn about Soda City's past, including one of the most infamous murders the South has ever seen in broad daylight.

By the time our guide lit the lantern, the sun was just beginning to dip behind the skyline, casting a blue-gray wash over Columbia's wide streets and old brick facades. There's something about this Southern capital after dark that chilled me. It doesn't try to be spooky. It just is. Quiet, very humid, and a little too still, this was the perfect stage for US Ghost Adventures' walking tour, which promises a walk through Columbia's haunted heart without veering into the campy.

We began at the Trinity Episcopal Cathedral graveyard, where quite a few notable families and politicians are buried. Our tour guide, Hayden, was dressed in old timey clothes, complete with a vest, dress shoes, a wide brimmed hat, and of course, a lantern. As we wandered through the cemetery, Hayden pointed out, the cemetery walls were different than most. Why? Because the plans to build the cemetery walls were not proportioned properly to the size of the lot. So, he explained, "the gravestones were simply built into the walls."

As we walked through downtown, the city revealed its layers, not just its ghosts, but its historic scars. Columbia has been burned to the ground, rebuilt, divided, and reimagined, but some things still cling to its streets. On the University of South Carolina campus, we stopped at the horseshoe in the center. Hayden got up on a cement planter and asked, "Can any of you find the only cemetery plot still remaining within this courtyard?" While nobody could accurately pinpoint, he pointed to a stone grave just outside of a campus building door. "Seems pretty strange to still have someone buried right in a courtyard of college campus, no?"

I shivered.

At one point in the evening, as Hayden's shoes clacked along the sidewalk, he turned to us and said, "now let's go find the spot where the most gruesome murder in Columbia took place."

We stopped in front of the State House, not to enjoy the bronze Washington sculpture or gaze up at the beauty of the lights illuminating the columns, but instead for a story that took place across the street where an old dive bar once stood and now a Moxy hotel.

In 1903, journalist Narciso Gonzales, co-founder of The State newspaper, was shot in broad daylight on Main Street in Columbia, South Carolina, by Lieutenant Governor James H. Tillman. Gonzales had publicly criticized Tillman in scathing editorials, calling him unfit for office. Despite Gonzales being unarmed, Tillman claimed self-defense and was shockingly acquitted. The killing, just steps from the State House, exposed deep political corruption and remains one of South Carolina's most infamous injustices. Gonzales is remembered as a fearless voice for truth—murdered for holding the powerful accountable in a city still haunted by its past.

What struck me about the Columbia haunted tour wasn't just the stories, though those were rich, complicated, and rooted in place, but the way the city itself seemed to shift the longer we walked. Shadows deepened. Buildings whispered. History wasn't just something you read in plaques, it pulsed, quietly, around us, in the spots on the capitol building's walls where canon shots were marked with stars, or in the hidden gravestone our tour guide brought us too right on a main thoroughfare.

There's no jump scares or hokey theatrics here. Just a slow, steady immersion into the parts of Columbia that don't make it into travel brochures. The tour felt less like a ghost hunt and more like a history lesson with a heartbeat, a reminder that every city has its share of spirits—some seen, others simply felt.

What struck me about the Columbia haunted tour wasn't just the stories, though those were rich, complicated, and rooted in place, but the way the city itself seemed to shift the longer we walked. 

By the time we circled back to our starting point, I didn't need to be convinced that Columbia was haunted. Haunted not just by ghosts, but by the weight of its own past. You don't need to believe in spirits to feel them brushing against your shoulder here. You just need to listen.

The discovery of interstellar objects over the past decade raises an important question that could shape the future of humanity: how to distinguish extraterrestrial spacecraft from interstellar asteroids? Both types of objects reflect sunlight. However, no telescope on Earth can resolve a hundred-meter object — the scale of our largest rocket — Starship, from a distance of about a billion kilometers — the distance where 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025.

Unfortunately, we cannot rely on sky watchers to alert us to the possibility that a spacecraft just entered the solar system. Even after the first reported interstellar object, 1I/`Oumuamua, showed the anomalies of a flat shape and a non-gravitational acceleration without a cometary tail that distinguished it from any known asteroid or comet, it was nevertheless labeled as a “dark comet”, namely a comet without the unique signature that would flag it as a comet: a visible plume of gas and dust. Given this definition, any object launched by humans to space — which is pushed by rocket fuel or solar radiation pressure, is a dark comet.

The best we can hope for is courageous astronomers that would admit anomalies exhibited by outliers, namely features that may fit better the description of a technologically manufactured object than a natural rock.

Recently, I listed the anomalies of the new interstellar object 3I/ATLAS. This object is anomalously bright, implying a diameter of ~20 kilometers for the typical reflectance of asteroids. The implied diameter and detection rate are untenable by the mass budget in interstellar asteroids, as I showed in a new paper — just published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society. If 3I/ATLAS ends up being a comet, its nucleus must be an order of magnitude smaller. But if it happens not to possess a large cometary plume of dust or gas, what is the nature of this object?

Without asking this question, humanity will remain in the “stone age,” regarding interstellar objects. Even if 3I/ATLAS will show up as a genuine comet, like 2I/Borisov, as it gets closer to the Sun and heats up, we should always ask this question about future interstellar objects.

An interstellar comet is easy to identify by its tail. But what are the markers that would distinguish a technological interstellar object — a spacecraft, from an asteroid? Here is a list of some of them:

1. Propulsion: a central engine or solar radiation pressure (as I suggested in a paper with Shmuel Bialy for 1I/'Oumuamua) would cause a technological object to deviate from a Keplerian hyperbolic orbit, dictated solely by gravity.

2. Trajectory: the path of the object could selectively target the inner planets in the Solar system. For example, the orbital plane of 3I/ATLAS was within 5 degrees of the ecliptic plane for the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The likelihood for these orbital angular momenta to be aligned so well is ~0.001, as I had mentioned in my recent anomalies essay.

3. Artificial lights: Reflection of sunlight can be distinguished from artificial light by its spectrum and through its faster decline with increasing distance from the Sun, as I discussed in a paper with Ed Turner.

4. Shape: An artificially-designed shape can be inferred from the light curve of reflected sunlight as the object rotates. This is how 1I/'Oumuamua was inferred in a paper by Sergei Mashchenko to have a disk-like shape.

5. Image from a flyby: Resolved details of the object's surface could instantly distinguish a technological object from a rock. Such an image can be taken by a camera on a dedicated intercept mission or in case the object happens to be passing very close to Earth. Landing on a technological object through a rendezvous mission like OSIRIS-REx would offer the benefit of a direct inspection, including the privilege of pressing buttons on it.

6. Surface composition: remote spectroscopy of the surface might show signatures of bombardment by cosmic-rays, interstellar dust particles and interstellar protons. The energy deposition rate scales as velocity cubed and travel duration. Faster or older objects should be more scarred by interstellar damage.

7. Signals: A functioning technological device might transmit electromagnetic signs that terrestrial telescopes could search for over a broad range of frequencies from the radio to gamma-rays.

8. Launch of mini-probes from a mothership: An efficient way to seed habitable planets with probes is to pass near them and release small devices at the right time and place with the appropriate velocity kick, so that they will intercept the planets while the mothership continues on its journey to the next star.

Ironically, 3I/ATLAS was discovered by the small ATLAS telescope with an aperture diameter of half a meter, during the same month that the 8.36-meter aperture of the Rubin Observatory started to search for interstellar objects from nearly the same location in Chile. Over the next decade, the Rubin observatory is expected to find tens of new interstellar objects.

My advocacy is simple. We should study the Rubin data with an open mind to the possibility that it may discover technological objects from extraterrestrial civilizations. If we insist that all interstellar objects are asteroids and comets with the outliers catalogued as dark comets, then the answer to the question “Are we alone?” would be “Yes, by choice.” Some of the loneliest people in the world are those who stopped searching for a partner. Their status is a self-fulfilling prophecy. In order to find our cosmic partners, we must allow them to exist in our mind as we inspect the Rubin data.

Surely, interstellar objects were passing overhead in the sky in 1950 when Enrico Fermi asked: “where is everybody?” As an experimental physicist, his oversight was not to build a large telescope to search for them.

            The conspiracy-soaked culture that propelled President Donald Trump to political power is now coming for him.
    


            Some of the most influential voices in right-wing media are rejecting Trump's call to stop wasting “time and energy on Jeffrey Epstein.”
    


            Trump said “nobody cares about” the late convicted sex offender, but the incensed replies to his Truth Social post showed otherwise.
    


            The online outrage highlights a vulnerability for Trump and an unfortunate reality about the incentive structure of this social media era.
    


            In short, it's that conspiracy theories keep people watching, sharing and playing along, even about a topic as lurid as sex trafficking. So it makes sense that many people are insisting on further disclosures about Epstein and his connections to powerful people.
    


            Right-wing TV networks and social media platforms have long rewarded hyperbolic rhetoric and reckless speculation. Algorithms don't necessarily want answers; they want engagement, and asking questions about an alleged government coverup definitely stokes engagement.
    


            Conservative host Steve Deace said over the weekend that he sensed the social media incentives at work. “It's very clear the algorithm wants some Epstein answers every bit as much as many of us do,” he wrote on X.
    


            Epstein's last name has become shorthand for a much bigger conspiracy theory. His crimes, and his 2019 suicide while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges, are just a piece of an imagined plot to abuse children at an industrial scale.
    


            The professed details vary from influencer from influencer, but the general idea is always that a cabal of liberal elites are both evil and beyond the reach of any accountability.
    


            “The Epstein story mattered so much in MAGA circles because it was a key element in their indictment of America's so-called ruling class,” New York Times opinion columnist David French wrote Monday.
    


            That is why last week's joint memo from the FBI and Justice Department denying the existence of an Epstein “list” and discouraging “unfounded” speculation was so disturbing to pro-Trump influencers.
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi handed out binders to social media influencers in February misleadingly labeled “The Epstein Files: Phase 1.” Most of the records were already public, and evidently there will be no “Phase 2.”
    


            Thus, some MAGA media power players now claim the Trump administration is trying to bury the truth.
    


            It's a stunning turn of events since conspiracy-theorizing has historically helped Trump enormously. His “birther” lie arguably birthed his political career and directly boosted his popularity with Republican voters. Conspiratorial claims about immigration and crime also helped him win the election the first time around.
    


            Then “QAnon” emerged. The movement, which has been likened to a virtual cult, imagined that Trump was secretly fighting a cabal of Democrat child abusers.
    


            According to the Public Religion Research Institute, which has tracked the conspiracy theory's popularity, some QAnon adherents believe that “the government, media, and financial worlds in the U.S. are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles who run a global child sex trafficking operation.”
    


            Epstein-related theories are an extension of that conspiratorial worldview, just as QAnon picked up where “Pizzagate” left off. (In 2016, the false theory about Hillary Clinton leading a child-sex ring in the basement of a Washington, DC, pizza shop led a North Carolina man to show up with a gun. He discovered that the restaurant didn't even have a basement.)
    


            Epstein is a complicated matter for Trump since the two men were described as friends decades ago. “I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,” Trump told New York magazine in 2002. “He's a lot of fun to be with.” Trump later denounced Epstein and said he “threw him out” of Mar-a-Lago.
    


            Trump is now increasingly the target of his base's conspiratorial thinking — the same position he put Barack Obama in by baselessly questioning Obama's birthplace more than a decade ago.
    


            Over the weekend, Trump even tried to shift blame back to Obama and other Democrats, but with little success.
    


            Mike Davis, a former legal adviser to Trump with close ties to the administration, wrote on X that the sex-ring evidence many right-wing media stars have demanded to see simply does not exist.
    


            “Here's the problem with the Epstein mess: The FBI doesn't have the evidence many thought it did. There are not tapes with powerful men raping kids. There is not a list,” Davis wrote.
    


            Judging from some of the replies to Davis, this attempt to deflate the conspiracy-mongering has inflated it even more.

Epstein fallout poses a loyalty test: Trump — or MAGA?



            Researchers like to point out that conspiracy theories are self-sealing, meaning they're impervious to scrutiny because evidence that contradicts the theory can be turned around and viewed as part of the conspiracy itself.
    


            The irate reactions to FBI director Kash Patel's tweet on Saturday — “the conspiracy theories just aren't true, never have been” — reaffirmed this.
    


            In 2023, when Patel was a frequent guest on pro-Trump podcasts, he told Glenn Beck that the FBI had possession of Epstein's “black book.”
    


            “That's under direct control of the director of the FBI,” Patel said.
    


            Such conjecture about a supposed Epstein “client list” lit up MAGA chat rooms and forums for years. Online guessing games about “the list” were an endless source of MAGA media content. Some Fox News hosts and Trump family members played along.
    


            “I keep hearing about some of the Jeffrey Epstein clients names being released today,” Donald Trump Jr. wrote on X in January 2024, “but I'd be willing to bet that something happens between now and then that prevents those names from ever coming out.”
    


            The implication of his post was that a massive cover-up was underway. Now, though, his father is the head of the government and the one catching heat for an alleged lack of transparency.
    


            Some commentators have portrayed it as a profound betrayal. Writing on X, podcast host Matt Walsh cast Epstein as a symbol of how “the corrupt and the powerful are never held accountable.”
    


            “We want these evil doers to be punished. We want the innocent to be vindicated and defended. We want justice,” he wrote.
    


            On Sunday, the InfoWars host Alex Jones called on Trump to “release everything” and warned, “This is not going away. It's only blowing up ten times bigger. It's out of control.”

            Mike Cernovich, one of the social media personalities who received an “Epstein Files” binder back in February, wrote that “Trump's persuasive power over his base, especially during his first term, was almost magical… The reaction on Epstein should thus be startling to him. No one is buying it. No one is dropping it.”
    


            Perhaps some people have been so hooked on the speculation that they don't want answers at all.
    


            Salacious QAnon-style theories about powerful people preying on kids are an “addictive alternative reality” for participants, disinformation researcher Molly McKew told CNN in 2020.
    


            “It exploits the sense that something is broken in our society,” McKew said. “But rather than focus on understanding these social fractures and healing them, QAnon instead fixates on the pursuit of enemies and villains described in such extreme terms that any action — either by adherents or by identified champions like President Trump — becomes justifiable.”

About a week ago, at a White House Cabinet meeting, a reporter asked Attorney General Pam Bondi about a controversial report her department had released a day earlier. “Your memo and release yesterday on Jeffrey Epstein, it left some lingering mysteries,” the reporter noted.

Before Bondi could respond, Donald Trump interjected — and tried his best to shut down the entire line of inquiry. “Are people still talking about this guy, this creep?” the president asked incredulously. He went on to suggest that the reporter was wasting time with his question, given that there were more important things to talk about.

If the idea was to end the discussion about the late millionaire pedophile, the Republican failed. Indeed, it was his own base that was largely responsible for keeping the controversy going throughout last week.

On Saturday, he tried a new approach.

In a statement published to his social media platform, spanning nearly 400 words, Trump praised his attorney general, and unironically described his administration as “PERFECT,” before complaining that he didn't “like what's happening” in MAGA World with regard to Epstein. In fact, he seemed to criticize some of his own followers, admonishing them as “selfish people” for their focus on Epstein, adding that “nobody cares about” Epstein, despite all evidence to the contrary.

But that's not all he said. From the same online missive:

Why are we giving publicity to Files written by Obama, Crooked Hillary, Comey, Brennan, and the Losers and Criminals of the Biden Administration. ... They created the Epstein Files, just like they created the FAKE Hillary Clinton/Christopher Steele Dossier that they used on me, and now my so-called ‘friends' are playing right into their hands.

While referencing a variety of other conspiracy theories, the president went on to complain about “the same old, Radical Left inspired Documents on Jeffrey Epstein.”

Or put another way, Trump, an ardent conspiracy theorist, has come up with a new conspiracy theory about the underlying conspiracy theory, which is a bit like watching a snake eat its own tail.

To the extent that reality still has any relevance in the public discussion, it was the Trump administration that investigated, arrested and charged Epstein. It was during Trump's first term when Epstein, facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges, died in 2019 while in custody, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.

But according to Trump, the so-called Epstein files were written by Barack Obama (who left office in early 2017), Hillary Clinton (who left office in early 2013), former FBI Director James Comey (who left office in 2017) and former CIA Director John Brennan (who left office in early 2017).

How could they have “created the Epstein Files” given that they were nowhere near public office when Trump's own team tried to prosecute him? I haven't the foggiest idea, and Trump's weird tantrum never explained how this could even be possible.

Complicating matters, the president appeared to reinvigorate the story he wants to go away, but changing his administration's official line. What started with (1) the “Epstein Files” are real and important, transformed into (2) the “Epstein Files” don't actually exist so everyone should just move on, has now evolved into (3) the “Epstein Files” do exist, but they're fake.

If the White House was counting on this new line shutting down the chatter and speculation, it should probably lower its expectations.

According to new research, aliens could already be monitoring us, or at least be aware of our existence, thanks to what's called ‘electromagnetic leakage'.

Right now, radar systems utilized by civilian airports and military operations are unintentionally broadcasting our existence to potential advanced alien civilizations, according to new research. The study at the UK's University of Manchester examined how concealed electromagnetic leakage might appear to extraterrestrials up to 200 light-years from Earth, assuming they possess state-of-the-art radio telescopes similar to ours.

According to the Royal Astronomical Society, theoretically, it also suggests this is the distance we could detect if aliens have evolved to use comparable technology.

The findings, presented at the Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting 2025 in Durham, reveal how global aviation hubs like Heathrow, Gatwick, and New York's JFK International Airport emit signals indicative of our existence.

By meticulously simulating how these radar signals radiate from Earth over time and space, researchers were able to assess their visibility from nearby stars such as Barnard's Star and AU Microscopii.

The study showed that airport radar systems could be giving us away to faraway civilisations. These systems, which scan the skies for airplanes, emit a combined radio signal of 2 × 10^15 watts, which is strong enough to be detected as far as 200 light-years away by telescopes equivalent to the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia.

But which planets can see these powerful radar signals? To provide some perspective, the closest potentially habitable world beyond our solar system is Proxima Centauri b, located 4 light-years away. Even so, reaching it with current spacecraft technology would take thousands of years.

These unique patterns of radar signals, likened to a lighthouse beam sweeping the sky, can peak at an emission of about 1 × 10^14 watts within an observer's field of view.

Lead researcher Ramiro Caisse Saide from the University of Manchester pointed out that these would appear "clearly artificial to anyone watching from interstellar distances with powerful radio telescopes".

"These military signals can appear up to a hundred times stronger from certain points in space, depending on where an observer is located," he said.

"Our findings suggest that radar signals – produced unintentionally by any planet with advanced technology and a complex aviation system – could act as a universal sign of intelligent life."

While the findings are probably a little bit too complicated for laypeople to understand, the researcher emphasized that this research could lead the hunt for extraterrestrial civilizations.

"By learning how our signals travel through space, we gain valuable insights into how to protect the radio spectrum for communications and design future radar systems," Professor Michael Garrett of the University of Manchester elaborated, highlighting the dual benefits of their work.

Another researcher, Caisse Saide, said, "In this way, our work supports both the scientific quest to answer the question 'Are we alone?' and practical efforts to manage the influence of technology on our world and beyond."

Joao Felix was absent from Chelsea's Club World Cup triumph after being axed by Enzo Maresca, but at least the Portuguese star had something else to watch.

The 25-year-old has been ostracised at Stamford Bridge since returning to West London for a second spell, this time permanently, in 2024 in a deal worth around £46million. But it's been a disaster for him since making his comeback to the Premier League.

After playing 20 times for the Blues in the first half of the season, with just three of them Premier League starts, he was loaned out to AC Milan, again to limited success as he managed just four goal involvements in 21 appearances.

Felix looks set to be on his way out of Stamford Bridge again after he was left out of the Blues' victorious Club World Cup squad. The Portugal international never travelled with the team to the US before Cole Palmer inspired them to a 3-0 win over PSG in the final.

However, Felix was probably watching a viral video with his rumoured stunning Colombian model other half Valentina Rueda Velez.

Valentina earned fame and fortune in her homeland when she appeared on Netflix 's dating show Too Hot to Handle last year. Her Instagram page has exploded to 171,000 followers and over 21,000 followers on TikTok.

And one of the reasons for her social media fame, alongside her bikini-clad pictures, is a crystal-clear video she took in 2023 of an apparent UFO sighting.

In the clip she shared on her Instagram Story, she is flying at an altitude of 20,000 feet under a bright, blue sky. About 10 seconds into the video, a small black dot appears on the right side of the screen.

A disc-shaped saucer zooms past the cockpit and banks to one side before sliding past Valentina's plane.

UFO enthusiast The Hidden Underbelly, shared the clip and said: "In this footage we get a clear view of this object and this looks damn good. It seems to be a saucer shape craft." The clip has gone down as one of the best UFO sightings ever recorded.

Speculation surrounding Felix's future has been incredibly quiet with potential destinations for the forward, who is under contract until 2031, so far appearing limited.

Maresca also took the step to strip him of a squad number, virtually sealing his fate. But at least he's been able to mull over that viral UFO video all summer.

When Supernatural debuted in 2005, the plan was never for it to run 15 seasons. The original Supernatural ending was meant to come in season 5, with creator Eric Kripke stepping away after wrapping up the apocalyptic showdown between heaven, hell, and two brothers in the middle. It was a tightly plotted arc that gave viewers a satisfying resolution, but also one that almost cut the show off just as it was finding new, unexpected ways to evolve.

Had the original Supernatural ending gone ahead and the show concluded with season 5's “Swan Song”, we wouldn't have gotten 10 more years of monster hunts, meta mayhem, and character arcs that pushed Sam and Dean to their limits. More importantly, we would've missed out on the best episode of Supernatural ever made - season 6's “The French Mistake.”

"The French Mistake" arrived in season 6, episode 15, a full 15 episodes beyond the original Supernatural ending point. If Eric Kripke's five-season plan had gone ahead, it never would've seen the light of day. That would've been a huge loss, because this episode became an instant fan-favorite, showcasing a wildly creative side of Supernatural that rarely got a spotlight during the earlier, darker seasons.

In “The French Mistake,” Sam Winchester (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles) are thrown into an alternate reality where they're not monster-hunting brothers - they're actors named Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles filming a show called Supernatural.

The meta setup flips the script completely, letting the characters interact with a hilariously exaggerated version of the real world.

The meta setup flips the script completely, letting the characters interact with a hilariously exaggerated version of the real world. From Misha Collins playing a cringingly earnest version of himself to fourth-wall-breaking jokes about the CW and showrunner Robert Singer, “The French Mistake” is packed with the bold, bizarre brilliance Supernatural is now known for.

However, beyond the laughs, “The French Mistake” marks an important turning point. It proved that Supernatural could take major creative swings and still land them. The show didn't just continue past season 5 - it reinvented itself.

“The French Mistake” wouldn't have fit within the original Supernatural ending because its tone and structure were too playful for Kripke's biblical finale. Yet its success helped justify the show's extended run, giving fans a clear reason to keep tuning in.

 There are countless great episodes across Supernatural's 15 seasons, but “The French Mistake” stands out as the most beloved for good reason. For many fans, it represents everything that made the show special: its ability to be self-aware, hilarious, genre-bending, and emotionally grounded all at once. Even after so many monster-of-the-week stories and apocalyptic arcs, nothing hit quite like this.

A key reason it works is that the cast fully leans into the absurdity. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles deliver some of their funniest performances, playing off their fictionalized lives with awkward charm. Misha Collins, in particular, steals the show - especially when he tweets “Ola, Mishamigos!” while chaos erupts around him. It's a surreal, wink-to-the-audience experience that rewards longtime fans without alienating newcomers.

The man behind Sam has a lot of love for one of the strangest episodes in the show.

“The French Mistake” also functions as a love letter to the production crew, poking fun at real-life showrunners, VFX teams, and network quirks. However, underneath all the in-jokes is a story that still centers Sam and Dean's brotherhood and purpose, grounding the madness in emotional stakes. That balance is hard to pull off, but Supernatural nailed it here.

If the original Supernatural ending had been the last word, we'd never have seen the show at its most inventive. “The French Mistake” proved that Supernatural could take huge risks and still deliver something deeply memorable - a reminder that sometimes the best moments happen after a planned goodbye.
