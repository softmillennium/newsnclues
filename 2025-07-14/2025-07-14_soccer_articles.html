                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president Donald Trump has claimed that the Club World Cup trophy that has featured prominently in the Oval Office will stay there, and that Fifa made a copy of the trophy that was awarded to Chelsea after their win in the tournament's final on Sunday. Trump attended the final along with numerous members of his cabinet and Fifa president Gianni Infantino. “I said, When are you going to pick up the trophy? [They said] ‘We're never going to pick it up. You can have it forever in the Oval Office. We're making a new one,'” Trump said in an interview with official Club World Cup broadcaster Dazn on Sunday. So that was quite exciting, but it is in the Oval [Office] right now.” “It's about everybody getting together and a lot of love between countries. Jonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccer Planning for next year's World Cup has faced a few hurdles presented by the second Trump administration, including travel bans on countries that would impact fans hoping to travel to the United States to see the games (though there are exceptions for athletes and staff), threats of Ice raids at games, and long wait times for visas to get into the country.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump's awkward interaction with one team at the close of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in New Jersey on Sunday confounded both players and fans alike. But Trump kept grinning happily, so James, the victorious Chelsea captain, decided he might as well just hoist that giant gold-plated trophy skywards. And that probably highlights how big the tournament is.” Chelsea soccer star Cole Palmer, who was named the tournament's top player, told reporters later Sunday that he was baffled by Trump's lingering presence. “I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused,” Palmer said. You can watch a clip of the trophy presentation here. Trump attended the game with first lady Melania Trump and reportedly hosted several high-profile guests in his suite, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, NFL icon Tom Brady and conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to hold its final matches next July at MetLife Stadium. As The Washington Post's Matt Viser reported, Sunday's uncomfortable Trump moments could be a “preview of what could happen on the same field one year from now.” Hayley Miller is the senior blog editor for MSNBC.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The trophy, crafted in collaboration with Tiffany & Co, features a central disc with three rotating outer rings. If FIFA lets Trump keep the orbital award for good, it is likely to end up in the National Archives. “They [FIFA] said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?' We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [FIFA President Gianni Infantino] said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office,'” Trump explained in a mid-game chat with the broadcaster, DAZN. “And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now [the original] is in the Oval,” he said. And it's not just the trophy that Trump got his hands on, according to reports. The Athletic was among several outlets to report that Infantino kept a medal aside for his friend, handing it to him after the trophy-lifting ceremony. The FIFA boss has been in Washington, D.C., 10 times since Donald Trump returned to office in January, in an attempt to woo the president. It comes as FIFA last week inadvertently confirmed the cosy Infantino-Trump relationship by moving its New York employees to a new office in Trump Tower, Manhattan. Trump also set about making the Club World Cup, a club soccer tournament designed to bring the world's best teams into one premier competition, all about himself. This is despite being booed before kick-off. But as Reece James readied to celebrate with his teammates, Trump lurked on the stage—something the players, including star man Cole Palmer, didn't miss. “I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused, yeah,“ he said post-game. Chelsea's captain also explained that Trump had ditched the protocol to stay in the spotlight. “They told me that he was going to present the trophy and then exit the stage, and I thought that he was going to exit the stage, but he wanted to stay,” James added, according to PA Media. Trump also mused about the possibility of signing an executive order to have soccer officially recognized as ‘football' in the U.S. Send it to The Daily Beast here.</p>

A high-speed rail line hopes to connect Los Angeles to New York City in time for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

A proposal — dubbed “The Transcontinental Chief” and pitched to Amtrak as well as President Trump and his secretary of transportation, Sean Duffy — would shoot riders between the country's two biggest cities in just 72 hours.

Delaware-based Ameristar Rail said it would use existing infrastructure owned by Amtrak and other regional rail lines passing through major cities like Kansas City, Chicago and Philadelphia rather than launch a massive and costly new public project.

It would be funded by private investors — not taxpayers — and would carry vehicles as well as passengers, modeled after Europe's truck transport trains, Ameristar said.

“The Transcontinental Chief will be a great opportunity for Amtrak to team up with the private sector to confront the challenges of its money-losing long-distance trains and create opportunities to usher in a profitable Golden Age of rail travel for passengers and truckers, with the ingenuity of free enterprise, as we celebrate our great nation's 250th birthday next year,” Scott Spencer, AmeriStarRail's chief operating officer, wrote in a letter to Amtrak, according to Newsweek.

AmeriStarRail hopes to have it running by May 10, 2026 — in time for the FIFA World Cup, which is being hosted across North America, with the finals at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.

The plan has been pitched to President Trump and Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, the paper reported.

Ameristar leaders said taxpayers will not foot the project, which would be funded by private investors.

“Subject to operating agreements with the host railroads (BNSF, Norfolk Southern and New Jersey Transit) the Transcontinental Chief can start operations on National Train Day, Sunday, May 10, 2026 to begin serving tourists for America 250 celebrations and the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” a spokesperson said.

“The Transcontinental Chief can be privately operated and funded, without new congressional legislation or additional federal spending.”

Amtrak has not yet responded to the proposal, according to Newsweek.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Steve Nicol reacts to Chelsea's 3-0 win over PSG in the Club World Cup final. So, the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup is over, with Chelsea crowned champions after thumping Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in Sunday's showpiece final. Did the atmosphere (good at times, underwhelming at others) come close to meeting expectations, or does FIFA president Gianni Infantino have work to do if this tournament's going to be a long-term success? On the downside, 32 teams in the competition is too many, and that isn't a dig at sides such as Auckland City, Urawa Red Diamonds or Ulsan HD, who earned one point between them -- it's also about the likes of FC Salzburg, who really had no right to be at the tournament. But overall, weather issues aside, it has been a positive first attempt at the competition. Lizzy Becherano: The Club World Cup somewhat exceeded my expectations after watching teams take the competition seriously and dedicated fans filling most stadiums. Like many, I worried that the top teams would treat the competition like a series of preseason friendlies, playing lackluster football inside empty stadiums. There are still too many aspects of the Club World Cup to improve, however, in order for this tournament to truly be seen as successful rather than just an opportunity for more games. Rob Dawson: It wasn't perfect, but it was a largely positive first edition of the expanded Club World Cup. There were some good games, shock results, drama and talking points. Fluminense and Al Hilal showed exactly why the idea of a Club World Cup is valid. As long as lessons are learned in terms of ticket pricing, travel and the timing of the tournament, there's every chance it could thrive going forward. Gab Marcotti: It has been said time and again, but it's the first of its kind, it came about for self-serving reasons, staging a tournament in the U.S. in the summer isn't straightforward and we really had no clue what success would look like. Now at least we know the rest of the world can take on UEFA's big boys without embarrassing themselves. We know there's genuine passion and interest, at least from fans of teams participating. James Olley: Somewhere in the middle of this bloated, ego-driven tournament is a good idea trying to emerge. FIFA's attempt to force this on the world at an accelerated pace rather than growing the competition more steadily over time -- it would have been a 24-team format in 2021 had the COVID pandemic not disrupted the calendar -- led to a version that was often difficult to like. The support those teams enjoyed, along with the Argentine sides and Wydad AC of Tunisia, brought color and vibrancy to games. Alex Kirkland: We got some entertaining games, some great goals, some big crowds, and enough memorable moments that made you feel like this tournament was delivering on its premise: a truly global competition, bringing the best of world football -- Europe's elite teams, South America's passionate fans, giants being humbled, and underdogs being celebrated -- together in one place. It's also a tournament that was greeted with complete indifference by many football fans around the world. Ogden: Fluminense are the obvious one when you consider how much they struggled in the Brazilian league last season. To reach the semifinal was an achievement, even though they were easily beaten by Chelsea thanks to two goals from João Pedro. And let's give some love to Inter Miami too, even though their place in the competition was controversially awarded by FIFA president Infantino. They reached the knockout stage and gave us a couple of magic moments from Lionel Messi, so they rose to the occasion. Frank Leboeuf assesses PSG's season after their 3-0 loss to Chelsea in the Club World Cup final. Becherano: FC Porto entered the Club World Cup as the favorites to top Group A and likely triumph over Inter Miami, Palmeiras and Al Ahly to advance to the round of 16 with three victories. Instead, the team struggled tremendously, going from favorites to failures quickly. I expected a tough match between Porto and Palmeiras, even some difficulty for the European team to beat Inter Miami, but I never could have imagined the club letting in four goals from Al Ahly to conclude the competition with a 4-4 draw. At that point, the bracket had opened up and they could plot a manageable path to New York and the semifinals. But that was until they ran into Al Hilal, with the second half bringing back memories of everything that was wrong last season. It was a big surprise they didn't get further. Marcotti: Maybe it's that I watched them twice in person, or maybe it's that their fans raised the roof everywhere they went. But Flamengo stood out -- not just for the passion of their supporters, but for what they showed on the pitch, starting from their 3-1 victory over future world champions, Chelsea. They arrived at the tournament having quieted (but not silenced) doubts over manager Enzo Maresca, with some supporters questioning his style of play despite qualifying for the Champions League and winning the Conference League. The indifference many have shown towards the Club World Cup may mean the afterglow from victory may not last as long as more conventional successes, but Maresca starts next season from a renewed position of strength. Moreover, this young group should now possess genuine belief they can go and challenge for the honors that matter most, having put PSG to the sword in such an impressive way. Alex Kirkland: It ended up being Chelsea, given how incredibly and unexpectedly well they performed in the final on Sunday, but before that: Atletico Madrid. And then they lost 4-0 to PSG in their opening game. Even two subsequent wins against Seattle Sounders and Botafogo weren't enough to see them go through to the round of 16, and that was bad luck, but it was a disappointing and premature departure, nonetheless. Chelsea have given their players room to breathe during their month in the U.S. because, at the same time as taking the competition seriously, they have also accepted that this tournament is taking place at a time when most players are on holiday or enjoying downtime ahead of the new season. Too often, clubs or international teams lock their players away in remote hotels or training bases and expect them to focus solely on football. It was also proof that footballers have a life away from the game. For a brief moment, Boca Juniors fans truly believed they would win against Bayern, and the atmosphere reflected it. It's nothing against PSG or Chelsea -- both deserved to reach the final -- but those results are exactly what a Club World Cup should be about. It would have been boring if the UEFA teams had blitzed everyone else. The knockout rounds turning into a less-exciting version of the Champions League would not have suited anyone -- fans or FIFA. Botafogo and Flamengo scoring those early wins for South America against European heavyweights was proof that the premise of the tournament is sound. It just needs some tweaks and a viable place in the calendar. Marcotti: Wessam Abou Ali's hat trick against Porto. It finished 4-4 and turned out to be irrelevant for both clubs given that both sides went home early, but the Danish-born, Palestinian striker stole the show. The forward is on his way to becoming a legend in Egypt at Al Ahly. Again, you have to park the cynical construction that led to this moment, with Inter Miami crowbarred into the tournament just so Messi could help sell tickets. Yet watching the 38-year-old bend in a superb match-winning free kick was still a heartwarming moment of endurance and longevity from arguably the game's greatest-ever player. FIFA got its viral moment for social media; the world got a reminder that Messi is still capable of getting you out of your seat. Kirkland: Thibaut Courtois' 99th-minute save for Real Madrid vs. Borussia Dortmund, clawing away Marcel Sabitzer's near-perfect shot to preserve Madrid's 3-2 lead in the quarterfinals. It was one of those saves that got better with every replay you watched, and every fresh angle you saw. The fact that it was the decisive, last touch of the game, after a frantic finale that had three goals and a red card in added time -- a bizarre ending to an otherwise serene Madrid performance -- made it even better. This is what makes a truly great goalkeeper: doing absolutely nothing, all game, and then, when it really matters, producing that. Any tournament played in a northern hemisphere summer will have heat issues -- Germany was very hot during Euro 2024 -- but the conditions in the United States during June and July have been so difficult at times that it has opened up a big conversation about how the 2026 World Cup will be staged next year. Infantino appeared to make a significant concession by saying that more daytime games will now be staged at stadiums with roofs at the World Cup, but kickoff times still to be finalized and with some games likely to be midday starts next year, we will only discover if lessons have truly been learned when those games are allocated venues and kickoff times. Becherano: Hard Rock Stadium played host to several exciting moments of the Club World Cup, with Boca Juniors fans turning the venue into La Bombonera North, a great goal by Luis Suárez and celebrations from Mamelodi Sundowns fans. There are no public options available to reach the stadium, forcing fans and outlets to use Ubers, private cars or chartered buses, making the experience a nightmare for all. I get it -- safety first -- but there are lessons to be learned here and if certain venues at certain times are at greater risk of this sort of thing, then we may need a rethink. Gab Marcotti and Don Hutchison debate whether Donnarumma was at fault for Musiala's injury in the Club World Cup. Musiala's awful broken leg vs. PSG was the consequence of the type of challenge that could have happened at any time -- fatigue didn't appear an obvious factor -- but asking players to keep going for 11 months of the year is putting an excessive strain on the game's elite. It is a relief that there weren't more serious injuries. That feels unsustainable but, once again, nobody in a position of power is listening. Kirkland: Sunday's final offered several contenders -- from PSG's undignified reaction to defeat, to the awkwardly handled trophy presentation -- but for me, the worst moment came much earlier in the tournament: speaking to a fan and his excited young family, prematch at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena ahead of PSG vs. Atletico Madrid, and then hearing from them subsequently that the game had, in fact, turned into a quite unpleasant ordeal, with the midday heat forcing them to abandon their seats for much of the second half. If you've paid hundreds of dollars for tickets, the least you should expect is to be able to enjoy the experience in relative comfort. Dawson: This belongs in a separate category to "worst moment," but it was extremely hard to watch Rúben Neves and João Cancelo break down during the tribute to Diogo Jota ahead of Al Hilal's quarterfinal against Fluminense. The Liverpool forward died in a car accident along with his brother, just days before the team was to regroup for preseason, and he was international teammates with the Al Hilal pair. The pair found out about Jota's passing on that Thursday, and played a match less than 24 hours later. To watch Neves and Cancelo in tears as his picture, along with brother André Silva, flashed up on the big screens at Camping World Stadium was heartbreaking. It was a reminder of how unimportant football can be. Ogden: I'd have a smaller tournament, maybe 24 teams, and ensure that those involved really are the best in their Confederation. This Club World Cup has taken place without the reigning champions of England (Liverpool), Spain (Barcelona) Italy (Napoli) and Argentina (Velez Sarsfield), at the same time as including Chelsea -- who qualified as 2021 Champions League winners -- and Salzburg who have, quite frankly, done nothing outside the Austrian Bundesliga and aren't even the current champions (hello, Sturm Graz.) Balance it out and find a way to have teams from South America who aren't just from Brazil and Argentina. Ultimately, FIFA needs to come up with more convincing, and equitable, qualifying criteria. Frank Leboeuf criticises Kylian Mbappé's work rate at Real Madrid following their 4-0 Club World Cup semifinal loss to PSG. Becherano: Without a doubt, kickoff times for most matches need to be pushed back until after sunset. FIFA's decision to schedule a noon or 3 p.m. kickoff at Hard Rock Stadium in the middle of summer will continue to be shocking. Unless the venue boasts a roof, no game can or should be played before 7:30 p.m. local time. Beyond the obvious safety and health concerns, one could also argue that no one plays their best under such conditions in Miami. How can officials expect the tournament to thrive if players are not given the proper conditions to play? FIFA decided to go straight to 32 teams, so can't then row back and make it a 16-team competition (which it should have been in the first place.) Pitching more of the heavyweights against each other early on would kick-start things. Let's face it: FIFA felt it needed to promise mega prize money to get some of the European heavyweights on board and because the competition was in its infancy, it became tough to sell. Let this summer show you don't need to go big from day one. It'll never happen now, obviously -- money dictates that. But a tighter version would be an easier sell globally and fewer games would place less of a demand on players who are already overworked. Related to this, reduce the travel required and limit logistical demands. There is always a balancing act in terms of taking teams around a country -- the sheer scale of the U.S. doesn't help in that regard -- but the balance wasn't right this time. Kirkland: It might be a very Anglo-centric point, but I can't help but feel that for the tournament to have real widespread breakthrough appeal, FIFA must find a way to ensure that the biggest Premier League teams in terms of support and online engagement -- Manchester United, or Liverpool, or Arsenal -- are involved. It would be no surprise at all if FIFA somehow found a way to remedy both of those challenges in time for 2029.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump joined family, friends and close advisers to witness Chelsea's FIFA Club World Cup final victory on Sunday, calling it “a great match.” “I knew he was going to be here, but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy, so I was a bit confused,” Palmer said. Trump — wearing a bright red tie — appeared to leave the award stand with a medal of his own, handed to him by FIFA President Gianni Infantino right after the medallion presented to James. Chelsea pleayers celebrate with the championship trophy after the Club World Cup final soccer match between Chelsea and PSG in East Rutherford, N.J., Sunday, July 13, 2025. At 23, Palmer was selected player of the match for Chelsea's second straight final. A rising English star, he assisted twice in a 4-1 win over Real Betis on May 28 that won the Europa Conference League. He also scored the Blues' first goal in the 2-1 quarterfinal Club World Cup win over Palmeiras and had England's goal in its 2024 European Championship final defeat to Spain. He had his name up in the bright lights this weekend.

Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca, who wanted to exploit space on PSG's left flank, told his players he wanted them to attack from the opening whistle. Chelsea's Cole Palmer reacts after scoring a goal against Paris Saint-Germain during the first half of the Club World Cup final soccer match in East Rutherford, N.J., Sunday, July 13, 2025. Chelsea went ahead after Sánchez kicked the ball downfield and Nuno Mendes mis-hit his header 15 yards past the midfield stripe toward his own goal. Malo Gusto's shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo and rebounded to Palmer, who ended PSG's streak of 436 minutes without conceding. “These are the games where we expect Cole to appear because they are big games, big moments,” Maresca said. Even better because obviously everyone doubted us before the game,” Palmer said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump has suggested Chelsea will not receive the original Club World Cup trophy after winning the tournament in New Jersey on Sunday. Fifa state that Chelsea will be able to call themselves world champions for four years, and emboss their kits with a specialist badge. The Blues racked up over £80m in prize money. But the trophy – a gold structure that moves and twists after a key is inserted in its rear – is likely to stay Stateside, according to President Trump, who was in attendance on Sunday. He then revealed that he has the original Club World Cup trophy, on the orders of Fifa president Gianni Infantino. “[Fifa] is doing fantastically well for [football in America], it's a growing sport, it is a great sport,” President Trump told Dazn. “They said: ‘Could you hold this trophy for a little while?'. We put it in the Oval Office and then I said: ‘When are you going to pick up the trophy', and [Infantino] said: ‘We're never going to pick it up, you can have it forever in the Oval Office'”. “And they actually made a new one [for Chelsea] but right now [the original] is in the Oval.” The cosy relationship between Fifa and Trump intensified last week with football's governing body opening an office in New York's Trump Tower ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea's Reece James (24) lifts the trophy as President Donald Trump looks on following the Club World Cup final soccer match between Chelsea and PSG in East Rutherford, N.J. on Sunday. EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — President Donald Trump on Sunday marked the one-year anniversary of a failed attempt on his life, joining family, friends and close advisers to witness Chelsea's dominating FIFA Club World Cup final victory over Paris Saint-Germain. "It was an upset today I guess," Trump told reporters after flying back to Washington following Chelsea's victory. Trump and first lady Melania Trump were greeted with cheers as they arrived at MetLife Stadium just ahead of the pre-match performance by musical artists Robbie Williams and Laura Pausini. And the president got a smattering of boos when he was briefly shown on the stadium's mega-screen. The president waved to the crowd and pumped his fist as he and his entourage arrived at the stadium luxury box, where they took in the match with FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his wife, Leena Al Ashqar. Other guests spotted in the president's suite included Attorney General Pam Bondi, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, NFL great Tom Brady and media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Chelsea, of the English Premier League, spoiled PSG's bid to win its fourth major title of the season, exactly 100 days after PSG clinched Ligue 1 on April 5. Chelsea dominated throughout, racing out to a 3-0 lead in the first half behind a pair of goals from Cole Palmer and one from João Pedro. Sunday's match fell on the first anniversary of the assassination attempt Trump survived in Butler, Pennsylvania, while campaigning for president. "It remains my firm conviction that God alone saved me that day for a righteous purpose: to restore our beloved Republic to greatness and to rescue our Nation from those who seek its ruin," Trump said in a statement released Sunday night after he returned to Washington. He also hailed doctors, first responders and rallygoers who helped guide other attendees to safety, saying, "These men and women arrived at the rally grounds as ordinary Americans, but left as heroes." The international sporting match also offered an opportunity for Trump and aides to huddle with Qatari government officials. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, in a brief exchange with reporters ahead of the match, said he remained "hopeful" about Gaza ceasefire and hostage negotiations. Witkoff, who joined Trump for the tournament finale, appeared to nod affirmatively when asked by reporters if he planned on meeting with senior officials from the Gulf nation of Qatar, which is serving as an intermediary with Hamas in the talks, during the match. The president, who has a warm relationship with Infantino, has said he plans to attend multiple matches of the World Cup tournament next year that will be held at stadiums in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. But it comes amid heightened tensions between the U.S. and its neighbors over proposed tariffs, immigration and Trump repeatedly saying that Canada should become the 51st state.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sunday's FIFA Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium  featured Chelsea FC  defeating Paris Saint-Germain 3-0, culminating weeks of competition in U.S. stadiums. That's why many world leaders and sports fans have been scrutinizing the club games for on- and off-field clues about America's ability to host. The skepticism is driven by concerns over whether a president who has taken actions to close America's borders and imposed wholesale bans on residents from some countries can host a quadrennial celebration of global camaraderie and athleticism. Chelsea players gave one another confused looks as Trump continued to linger while they raised the trophy in celebration. Next year's multiweek event has many logistical challenges as it stretches over three host countries, including 11 U.S. cities. If the 2026 event is to be a success, it may rely both on Trump's love of pageantry and his relationship with Infantino, who sat with him Sunday and who has spent more time with Trump during his second term than any president or prime minister. The World Cup is likely to bring a host of other organizational and political challenges, especially amid the Trump administration's harsh crackdown on immigration. Will international fans and players be welcomed to stadiums in American cities that Trump has threatened over their more open immigration policies — and will the president be welcomed at an opening match played in Los Angeles, where he recently deployed National Guard troops? Other countries whose citizens Trump could ban — such as Ghana, Cabo Verde, and Egypt —  might also qualify to be among the 48 nations competing. While Trump administration officials have sought to assure the world that they are capable of staging what they are calling “the largest sporting event in history,” Trump has also relished the uncertainty over how it will play out. “Oh I think it's going to make it more exciting,” Trump said in March during an appearance in the Oval Office with Infantino. He pushed Major League Baseball to reinstate Pete Rose, bashed NFL players for protesting racial inequality during his first term, and this year became the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl. He has been less connected with soccer — although golf caddies reportedly nicknamed him Pelé after seeing him frequently kick his ball onto the fairway — but has taken pride in hosting the World Cup. The event will come next summer as America celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding, an event that Trump has also been heavily involved in planning, and two years before Los Angeles hosts the Olympics. Trump in March appointed Andrew Giuliani, son of close Trump ally Rudy Giuliani, as executive director of a World Cup task force he created to oversee planning and coordinating. Trump's signature legislation — the One Big Beautiful Bill — included $625 million for security and other costs related to the World Cup, and some of his immigration policies have included carve-outs for soccer players and coaches, even as people from their country could be barred from attending. “We want these games to be safe and secure,” Giuliani said in an interview. But there have been growing concerns that Trump's immigration policies will dampen enthusiasm for an event that is marked by its global flavor, one where an Iranian can sit next to an American and watch their teams compete or where Argentines and Brazilians chant on subway rides to a stadium. “But the World Cup is supposed to be an inclusive celebration of humanity. Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, said Trump is committed “to promoting national pride, hospitality, and economic opportunity.” “These games will be a historic opportunity to unite the nation, celebrate America, and reinforce our status as a premier global destination for major events,” he said. Giuliani has asked his staff  to review what worked during the recent club games ahead of next year's broader event, which World Cup organizers expect to attract far more people. Giuliani said about a quarter to a third of those accredited to attend the Club World Cup matches during the past few months needed visas, and he helped ensure that State Department and FIFA officials updated the frequency of their meetings to address any processing issues. “The visa process is extremely important in making sure that we are vetting people properly but also making sure we welcome the world here,” he said. There is also worry that soccer matches could be targets for immigration enforcement. Ahead of Club World Cup matches last month, Customs and Border Protection wrote on social media that it would be “suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games,” which triggered concerns about arrests at stadiums. Giuliani said immigration officials would not target stadiums where matches were being played. The order provides exemptions specifically for players and coaches in the World Cup, as well as support staff and immediate family members. Human rights groups have also warned that fans from countries that are not officially banned from visiting might think twice, given Trump's  border policies. Giuliani said that the U.S. is still working with FIFA and awaiting the results of  qualification matches to figure out which countries will be competing, and how to handle administration policies with countries  such as Iran. “This is a dynamic situation right now,” Giuliani said. “This will have to be a conversation between some of the task force members and probably even the president himself in terms of what this looks like moving forward.”</p>
