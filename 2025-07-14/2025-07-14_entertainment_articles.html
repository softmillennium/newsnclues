Last Friday saw the birth of the ChatGPT browser, which already promises to visualize your data, coach your workouts, and trade your stocks; we must now contend with Velvet Sundown; and before the summer's out, we expect the quantum leap of ChatGPT-5. It felt like a good time for In Development to offer some optimism to anyone worried AI might soon take over all that's good in Hollywood. (For those of you ready to embrace our new AI overlords, that's a future column.) I'm certain AI is transforming the entertainment industry for better and worse. I have zero faith in Hollywood's ability (or inclination) to “control” it, if that were possible. Related Stories The American Film Institute's AFI DWW+ Directing Workshop Opens Call for Applicants Sundance's Last Year in Park City Will Honor Robert Redford and the Festival's Longtime Utah Home Credit goes to Ethan Helvering at audience intelligence firm Pulsar and Milo Chao at 100% Human, with a shoutout to Diana Williams of Kinetic Energy Entertainment for pointing me their way. The essential idea: Our connection to creativity is rooted in humanity. Studios spend billions to make sure you know everything there is to know about what went into making their movies and TV shows. Marketing costs often match production budgets, even when they run to the hundreds of millions. Directors, stars, producers, writers, crew — they give thousands of interviews across every possible platform around the world. (Sometimes, they're talking about What No One Tells You.) But ultimately, every panel, article, video, and TV spot is in service of a single, powerful message: “This is who I am and why I made this, and that is why you should see it.” (My husband still teases me about our coverage of Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Oscar-winning “The Revenant”: “You know, I read that it was a really hard movie to make.”) Creation stories are the engine of awards campaigns, so vital that strategists launch counter-narratives: That's not the way I heard it. They won't speak to each other! Studios rarely want to amplify those stories (at least not overtly), but there's no better magnet for human attention than “What really happened?” OK. Now let's assume there's no if, only when: The first feature-length film is made entirely by AI, from script to final frame. Now imagine being the studio that must sell it. Film and TV publicists have hard jobs even in the best circumstances with the crisis control, travel logistics, and the hand-holding that comes with endless junkets and press appearances. But if all of that disappears, how do you promote a film that only has a creator and a team of software engineers behind it? AI promises to smooth everything that's messy about filmmaking: costs, egos, creative clashes. Awesome — only without conflict, there is no story. Writer Emily J. Edwards pens the latest for the Substack, looking at exactly what role TikTok may have to play in establishing an entertainment career in 2025. Cinemantics' gives a clinic on the seminal John Ford western “The Searches,” and explains exactly why it continues to be so celebrated nearly 70 years later. Cartoon Brew reviews how exactly the animation community is feeling after the recent passage in California of an increased $750 million (with an up-to 35% rebate) tax incentive for film and television productions — which does, indeed, include animated projects for the first time in the credit's history. The Viv Loves Film Substack is offering a free educational screen industry masterclass, aimed at 18-24 year olds who are looking to break in and figure out their place in the world of film and television. Set for July 24 from 5-7 p.m. and just requires a sign up. This article was posted a couple months ago, but is worth unearthing for its relevance to this week's newsletter. In it, Kristina Budelis explains as to why the anxiety we all feel around AI isn't exactly a new phenomenon. By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Club‘s ongoing series of beginners' guides to pop culture's most notable subjects: filmmakers, music styles, literary genres, and whatever else interests us—and hopefully you. The world painted by Kiyoshi Kurosawa is one of disaffection. The Japanese auteur has made a career of identity thrillers, metaphysical horror, and cultural commentary, with films often sporting deceptively simple monosyllabic titles—Cure, Pulse, Chime, and now Cloud—that circle around existential themes. Do they always create the conditions for self-destruction and violence? Finally, and maybe most importantly, why does this movie feel like that? The quiet, unceremonious editing, the sudden bursts of violence, an abundance of negative space, and the sparse but abrupt use of score all conjure an eerie mood that can be difficult to parse but impossible to ignore. Isolated stills from Kurosawa's films may look unassuming or unremarkable—perhaps a plain domestic room or the floor of an abandoned factory, with two or three characters separated by clear lines and empty space—but when you're immersed in the scene, every image is loaded with strangeness and dread. In the film, Yoshii (Masaki Suda) is an internet reseller who values his independence even as he profits off the inventors and workers he screws over. But the success of his growing enterprise makes him an especially isolated target for a vengeful mob that gathers in the wake of his eat-or-be-eaten business strategy. It's a lively, amusing, and incredibly off-putting romp (especially in its final stretch, where supporting characters undergo metaphysical transformations), and an apt update to the themes of spiritual alienation and abandonment that have lingered in Kurosawa's work for decades. There's no more apt and scintillating doorway to the world of Kiyoshi Kurosawa than Cure (1997). Each bout of violence has a clear culprit with a relationship to the victim, but their confessions can't account for why they committed an act of horrid violence. A drowsy and absent-minded young man (Masato Hagiwara) has asked each needling questions, which have seemingly tipped each unsuspecting murderer over the edge. Mesmerism plays a crucial role in Cure‘s plot, but Kurosawa uses the study of hypnosis as an entry point to broader, more upsetting questions of identity and will. As a thriller, it's elliptical and sparse, sometimes leaping to the next strangely empty composition (or even the end credits) right after dropping a striking and revealing image. Lingering behind Takabe's plight is his own capacity for violence. His wife Fumie (Anna Nakagawa) suffers from schizophrenia, and disassociates at regular intervals. He's still on his knees in agony when Kurosawa cuts to Fumie standing behind him, alive as ever. The motif of death imposing itself on an unsuspecting but not entirely innocent soul is a profoundly Gothic idea, and two genre-mixing ghost stories by Kurosawa are essential next steps for those seeking out his major hits. Retribution (2006) plays in more traditionally supernatural waters than Cure, but belongs to the same family, as it also stars Yakusho as a beleaguered, haunted detective. In Retribution, Detective Yoshioka (Yakusho) looks into a Tokyo waterfront murder, but his investigation begets some troubling contradictions—including the fact that he is the most likely suspect. His complicity is compounded by a repeated sighting of a gaunt, flowing female ghost, dressed in vibrant, incriminating scarlet colors, who teases out the connection between Yoshioka and the woman in red when she was alive. Kurosawa transposes Gothic questions of complicity, repression, and apathy to a modern, urban Tokyo, making Retribution the next step in a career-long exploration of what the enforced atomization of a society does to our humane responsibilities. What does a cry for help look like when it's been denied oxygen for years, even past the boundaries of life and into the spectral realm of death? To Kurosawa, the scary, inhuman presence of ghosts is unavoidable, and has a clear causal explanation. Pulse is less subdued than Cure, but has a quieter pitch than Retribution, spending a lot of its scenes in students' humble living quarters or mundane computer labs—a mundanity broken by sudden visitations, rituals sourced from web forums, and friends succumbing to invisible, self-destructive urges. Nearing its quarter-century anniversary, Pulse has outlived its early internet context, now more of a prophesy about the cursed promise of online hyper-convenience: The vessels and channels of the internet will inevitably allow for infinite distress and sadness to pour into our private worlds, impossible to ignore or be unaffected by, until pain we thought forgotten or irrelevant overrides every waking moment. Kiyoshi Kurosawa's unique horror cannot be fully appreciated, on the level of both craft and themes, without sampling his more straightforward dramatic work. The disaffection and disconnection that characterizes Kurosawa's modern Japanese films was born out of a distinct national mood. The plots are all unique but share connective tissue: In License To Live, 24-year-old Yutaka Yoshii (Hidetoshi Nishijima) wakes up from a 10-year coma in a state of adolescent ennui. When Yoshii is taken in by his father's childhood friend Fujimori (Kōji Yakusho), he attempts to unite his disparate family despite their disinterest. In Bright Future, the lives of two young factory workers are turned upside-down when one (Tadanobu Asano) kills their boss as revenge for his bothersome intrusions on their life. The other worker (Joe Odagiri) is entrusted with their shared jellyfish and strikes up a friendship with his incarcerated friend's father (Tatsuya Fuji), even as anti-social unrest and vandalism starts to dominate the young man's life. Kurosawa's family dramas are not exclusively tied to social interpretations of this “Lost” era (some commentators say it lasted for 30 years), but like many films concerning social relations and expectations, the stories include a single but crucial change that affects every character's life. No matter how hard they try, the past cannot be recovered or rebuilt, and fractured families have to face their newly tested and often diminished status in order to reconstitute themselves. Rarely are characters on the same page—just like the schemes and murders of his genre pictures, Kurosawa maps out his dramas with independent wills and drives that can only run alongside each other for a brief time before they combust or fall to disorder. These films are about capitalism's promise falling woefully short, but Kurosawa ends each on a bittersweet hopeful note, showing a remote but clear possibility to transcend these punishing conditions. Kiyoshi Kurosawa has made so many films (averaging out to one a year for 40 years) because most are overwhelmingly commercial projects made cheaply. “Foreign directors ask me, ‘How come you make so many movies? Early highlights from before his international breakthrough include The Guard From Underground, about a murderer disguised as an office block's security guard and the haunted house thriller Sweet Home, which was released alongside a video game of the same name that inspired Resident Evil. Watching Kurosawa's Seance (a sterling TV movie adaptation of the British novel Séance On A Wet Afternoon) or Doppelganger (a comedic thriller about duality that saved money by giving star Kōji Yakusho double duty), one can tell that his production resources are tight. Kurosawa's power lies in his films' beguiling rhythm, one the audience fears will be interrupted at any moment by something outside the characters' control. In both films, an ordinary man loses his daughter and hunts down the sadists who killed her; in each film, Kurosawa chooses a different moment in a conventional Yakuza revenge story to examine under a microscope, letting his distressed and violent characters flounder within criminal organizations and under the mentorship of criminal professionals who promise they have their best interests at heart. Kiyoshi Kurosawa films don't get more stripped-back and nasty than this. Inside abandoned industrial caverns, righteous men inch closer to a brutal clarity, deluding themselves with the hope of closure and new beginnings, but really only sign a series of contracts with a mean, bureaucratic Devil taking advantage of their unmoored psyches—an unsubtle but gut-punching metaphor for the grasp of capitalism on modern Japan. Pull a double feature with both, and one can lose their certainty about the nature of good and evil in less than three hours.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Following the shrinking of Medicaid by President Donald Trump and the GOP's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” Mehmet Oz, heart surgeon turned TV doctor turned Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, says Americans will still be able to receive help — but that they need to stay healthy and avoid things like cake. The new legislation could kick as many as 15 million people off Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans. Oz claimed people are spending “6.1” hours a day watching TV. In January, President Donald Trump promised to “love and cherish” Medicaid. Vance recently dismissed the prospect of millions losing coverage as “minutiae.” “It changed the country in a good way, for many reasons, but we're all in it together, Stuart, which means we'll be there for you, the American people, when you need help with Medicaid and Medicare.” Then, he added a caveat: “But you've got to stay healthy, as well. “This is a little bit of a wink, I was jokingly calling this the MAHA Medi-cake, but of course I couldn't find a healthy cake, so I bought the closest they get, carrot cake.” In May, he released his first report, which cited fake studies and seemed to have been written using AI. Oz also told Fox Business that he wants to make health care “productive.”“If we make health care function the way banks function, the way you can order food, the way you can watch streaming videos, transform it to be a 21st Century industry, it'll become productive again. The loss of productivity is what hurts medicine,” he said. Last month, Oz told Fox Business that Medicaid recipients have to “do something that shows you have agency over your future.” Blaming ‘Obama, Crooked Hillary': Trump's Epstein Memo Meltdown Gets Even Worse Justin Bieber Finally Had ‘100% Creative Freedom' on ‘Swag' After Scooter Braun Split: Source “Go out there, do entry-level jobs, get into the workforce, prove that you matter. noted the absurdity of Oz's statement in an X post later on Monday. “17 million people are going to lose their health insurance because of the Trump administration,” she wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Heightened Scrutiny played at the Sundance Film Festival in January, audiences didn't know how United States v. Skrmetti, the trans healthcare case argued in front of the Supreme Court by ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio, would shake out. Arguments in that case, which Sam Feder's intimate documentary gives ground-level context for, were heard on December 4, 2024. Now, though, Heightened Scrutiny is being released to general audiences who already know its ending. That means the majority of its power comes from another case it argues: One against high-profile media outlets and the writers who made targeting trans people into a professional beat. While much of Feder's film follows Strangio as he practices, preps, and advocates on a grassroot level for trans youth, some of the most painful and infuriating segments give context for where this apparent surge of nationwide transphobia came from. In 2016, for example, the NBA relocated its All-Star game out of Charlotte because of its discriminatory “bathroom bill.” Trans rights were good PR, worth backing up with a billion-dollar pocketbook. But, between 2021 and 2024, the nation went from having absolutely no states with laws banning gender-affirming care for adolescents, to 23. This turn seems to have originated from far-right Christian nationalists, but was given a massive platform, and an Anita Bryant-like rallying cry, by outlets with a bit more clout than The Daily Wire—all “just asking questions.” “By writing about trans kids instead of trans adults, [Jesse Singal] can express his concern over the ways we live our lives by framing his concern as a parental one, thus looping parents into the conversation,” Harron Walker wrote for Jezebel in 2018. “It's a children's issue, not a trans issue, which gives any reader, cis or trans, permission to weigh in on the subject with authority. This framing, analogous to Bryant's claim in the '70s that those dastardly gays were “trying to recruit our children into homosexuality,” paved a path for an onslaught of op-eds. Media analyst Julie Hollar provides Heightened Scrutiny with research showing that, over the course of a calendar year, the New York Times was far more likely to run stories portraying the trans rights movement was a threat than to cover any threat against trans people. In the kind of journalistic “if it bleeds, it leads” strategizing that had Nightcrawler‘s star orchestrating his own crime footage, the click-inducing backlash to and credulous consumption of transphobic rhetoric only encouraged editors to greenlight more of it. On February 6, it was cited by the state of Idaho in Poe v. Labrador as evidence that gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth should continue to be criminalized. That July, a Texas court was trotting it out in order to redefine gender-affirming healthcare as “child abuse.” If it was good enough for the New York Times, these courts reasoned, it should be good enough for the people of America. This means lawyers like Strangio aren't just arguing against the law, but arguing against rhetoric that judges are consuming in their free time—rhetoric seen as mainstream enough to make it into the paper of record. It's not like the aggressive regression of these outlets—musing on trans athletes and children and the locker rooms and school bathrooms they should be forced to use—has been a secret, but their influence on the laws of the land has rarely been spelled out with such directness and clarity as in this film. No amount of fair, compassionate coverage could fully combat a court literally stacked against pretty much every thinking member of the American public. But as Heightened Scrutiny makes plain, selling out your neighbors for a cushy op-ed gig sprays gasoline on the oppressive flames.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Is James Gunn's new feature the best Man of Steel movie ever? But it's the Superman we could all use right now. He's the same old Man of Steel — faster than a speeding bullet, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, still wearing his underwear on the outside of his pants. For the first time in decades, Superman has a heart. But decency, empathy and… that other thing Americans used to admire. MAGA critics who apparently haven't bothered to see the movie (like former Lois & Clark star Dean Cain) are already complaining that it's too “woke” — as if Superman changed his name to Superperson and turned the Fortress of Solitude into a co-op housing collective. It's the kind of chowderheaded online blather that a roomful of monkeys with keyboards might tap out — which, in Superman, by the way, is exactly how Lex Luthor (played as a raging tech bro billionaire by Nicholas Hoult) manufactures online agitprop aimed at turning the social media masses against everyone's favorite visitor from another world (mop-headed newcomer David Corenswet in the red and blue spandex). That said, there are plenty of plot points in this movie that feel as fresh as this morning's headlines. Yes, Superman battles monsters — with a little help from “Justice Gang” members Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion), Mister Terrific (Edi Gathegi), and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced), not to mention Lois Lane (the always-marvelous Rachel Brosnahan) and Krypto, Supe's scene-stealing, poorly-trained dog who keeps trashing his Arctic sanctuary. But now he's also fending off misinformation, xenophobia, and a Luthor who is equal parts Elon Musk's megalomania and Jeff Bezos' haircut. Is one of these fictional countries supposed to be Russia and the other Ukraine? Or are they stand-ins for Israel and Gaza? There is one issue he does take on more directly than any other, but it's kind of unavoidable given Superman's questionable immigration status. After all, this is a guy who literally fell from the sky without any documentation. There aren't any ICE agents chasing him around Home Depot, but he is side eyed by certain humans who don't think he belongs and there is a harrowing scene in which he gets detained by authorities and sent to a “pocket universe” that looks almost as bad as an El Salvadorian supermax. Also, the way Luthor sneers the word “alien” when referring to Superman, it's almost as if Hoult took acting lessons from Stephen Miller. Is it the best Superman movie ever made? Some critics are finding it a bit overstuffed and chaotic, complaining that Gunn is juggling a too-crowded array of secondary characters, geopolitical allegories, monster fights and, just because, a clone subplot. The perfect hero for these unkindest of times, swooping in to remind us of what truth, justice, and the American way are supposed to look like. This isn't just the best Superman movie ever made — it's arguably the best superhero film of all time. Tone-perfect in nearly every way, it still makes you believe a man can fly. An army of A-listers were approached for the lead — Robert Redford reportedly turned it down, as did Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds, and James Caan. At one point, Neil Diamond and Bruce Jenner even showed up for screen tests (no joke). But the role ultimately went to an unknown soap actor named Christopher Reeve, who fit into Kal-El's blue-and-red onesie better than anyone has since. Granted, $3.7 million of that went to Marlon Brando, who filmed his ten minutes as Jor-El in just 12 days and reportedly made everyone on the set miserable by refusing to memorize lines and instead reading from cue cards, including one taped to baby Kal-El's diaper. Still, Brando's phoning it in aside, the movie was an historic blockbuster. It ended up grossing $300 million — roughly $1.25 billion in today's dollars — turned Reeve into a cultural icon and kicked open the doors for the modern superhero genre. Every Superman since has been chasing its cape. The plan was to make Superman I and II simultaneously, and for the most part, that's exactly what happened. But before production on the sequel could be completed, director Richard Donner ran into “creative differences” with father-and-son producers Alexander and Ilya Salkind and was replaced by Richard Lester, the auteur behind A Hard Day's Night.But whatever. The sequel — in which Reeve's Man of Steel gives up his powers to settle down with Lois Lane, just as three escaped supervillains from Krypton arrive to conquer Earth — is almost as good as the original.Part of what makes the film fly is Terence Stamp's scene-stealing badassery as General Zod (“Kneel before Zod!”), but part is also Lester's lighter touch. He's the one who shot the Niagara Falls sequence, where Superman rescues a kid who falls over the railing (“Of course he's Jewish!” someone shouts off-camera from the cheering crowd).But Donner's fingerprints are still all over the film, too — most notably in the full-on Kryptonian brawl in downtown Metropolis, which predates Man of Steel's citywide mayhem by 30 years, but does it with a whole lot more grace and cinematic finesse. There were a ton of false starts between Reeve's final Superman film — 1987's The Quest for Peace, which bombed at the box office (see below) — and the release of this low-key but poignant reboot. In the mid-1990s, Clerks director (and famous comic book geek) Kevin Smith tapped out multiple drafts of his never-produced Superman Lives, then Tim Burton signed on for a version that would've starred Nicolas Cage as the Man of Steel (and, in a much more promising bit of casting, Chris Rock as Jimmy Olsen). J.J. Abrams, McG, Brett Ratner — they were all at one point attached to a Superman movie.In the end, though, it was X-Men auteur Bryan Singer who brought the character back to the screen, with another unknown — Reeve lookalike Brandon Routh — wearing the red cape, Kevin Spacey shaving his head to play Lex Luthor, and a touching storyline about lost love. Although it disappointed at the box office and drew only lukewarm reviews — “reverent, beautifully crafted and a little too sedate,” sniffed The New York Times — it had the one superpower that matters most in a Superman movie: soul. Yes, it's four hours long and soaked in operatic self-importance. And Superman is dead for the first half of the movie (and when he does come back — thanks to Batman, Wonder Woman and The Flash — he's wearing a black suit). Zack Snyder's Justice League softens the character a bit compared to the brooding gloom of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman; there are even moments when Henry Cavill's Kal-El cracks something resembling a smile — not to mention a shirt-rip callback to the Christopher Reeve era.The plot is a mess (something about an alien warlord uniting three world-ending cubes? Joss Whedon's earlier version — he took over the 2017 theatrical release after Snyder suffered a family tragedy — adds more quips and color but is somehow even more incomprehensible. But there's something kind of wonderful about it. Made at the height of the Red Scare, it plays like a blunt but heartfelt parable about paranoia, prejudice, and mob mentality. When a pair of wide-eyed, big-headed creatures emerge from deep underground (thanks to oil drillers boring too far into the Earth), the townspeople panic, grab their rifles, and prepare for a Mole Men lynching. And the Mole Men look like toddlers in bald caps. And in its own modest way, more faithful to what Superman is supposed to be than a lot of what came after… like, say, Man of Steel. Zack Snyder's first crack at Superman isn't just a tonal misfire — it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the character. Snyder clearly wants to do for Superman what The Dark Knight did for Batman, but in stripping away all the warmth, idealism, and moral clarity, he leaves behind a character who barely seems to like humanity, let alone has any incentive to fight for it.Cavill looks the part, but he's mostly asked to glower and sulk, while the movie drowns him in grim flashbacks, dead-dad lectures, and Jesus imagery so heavy-handed it borders on parody. The final act devolves into a city-obliterating CGI brawl that racks up more collateral damage than three Michael Bay movies combined — and ends with Superman doing the one thing he's never done before in any major screen adaptation: snapping his enemy's neck.Sure, it's glossy and expensive and takes itself very seriously. But it lacks the one thing a Superman movie should never be without: hope. If Man of Steel misunderstood Superman, this sequel seems to actively resent him. Cavill's Superman is as brooding and disconnected as ever, while Ben Affleck's Batman is paranoid, brutal, and seemingly just a few Bat-gadgets away from full-blown fascism. The plot is a Cuisinart full of mythology-building and Justice League leftovers, with Jesse Eisenberg's twitchy, millennial Lex Luthor pulling the strings for reasons that never entirely make sense. Christopher Reeve is still game, but the story — a baffling mashup of slapstick and sci-fi — seems like it flew in from a totally different franchise. Superman IV was Reeve's passion project, built around his desire to deliver an anti-nuclear message. But it's buried under bargain-bin effects, stock footage, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious villains in comic book history: Nuclear Man, a mullet-sporting solar-powered baddie who looks like he wandered in from a heavy metal album cover (played by Mark Pillow, in his first and — unsurprisingly — last film role).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Jack Henry Robbins is teaming with 20th Television to develop Nepo Baby, a new comedy series for Hulu, based on his viral character. In the show created by Robbins, the world's least successful nepo baby, Jack Henry Robbins, attempts to make it big and grow up all on his own no matter what it takes (with help from his famous parents). Robbins based it on his “nepo baby” alter ego, which was made famous on social media via a series of viral videos, as well as through last year's much circulated New York Times feature story, “His Parents Are Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. Sam Zvibleman (Pen15) is on board to direct and will exec produce alongside Peter Principato, Bryan Walsh, and Casey Neumeier at Artists First. For Robbins, Nepo Baby comes on the heels of his directorial debut, VHYes, which is Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes and was released by Oscilloscope in 2020. Premiering at Fantastic Fest, the film is described as a bizarre, retro comedy shot entirely on VHS and Betamax that follows 12-year-old Ralph as he accidentally records home videos and his favorite late-night shows over his parents' wedding tape. Robbins' short films Painting with Joan and Hot Winter both premiered at Sundance. On the television side, he got his start with the live-action pilot Ultimate Ultimate, produced by Comedy Central and distributed by Funny or Die. He has also served as a segment director on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Verve recently signed the multi-hyphenate filmmaker, who continues to be represented by Artists First, as well as Brecheen Feldman Breimer. Zvibleman is repped by Iconoclast and Jackoway Austen Tyerman. This story originated as part of Deadline's new Comedy Means Business newsletter.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Ordinary" rules the Hot 100 for a sixth week. Alex Warren's “Ordinary” adds a sixth week atop the Billboard Hot 100. Plus, two songs soar into the Hot 100's top 10, led by Drake's “What Did I Miss?,” which debuts at No. Meanwhile, Morgan Wallen logs his 10th career week with at least three simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s, a mark that only five acts — and no core country artists — previously reached. His I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three of his current top 10 hits, scores an eighth week at No. Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below. The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.1 million official streams (down 5% week-over-week),  73 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 5%) and 6,000 sold (down 9%) in the United States July 4-10. The single's airplay performance is especially noteworthy, as it becomes the first song this year to reach 70 million in weekly airplay audience, and the first since Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” last November. “Ordinary” tops the Adult Pop Airplay chart for a seventh week and Pop Airplay for a fifth week. “Ordinary” slips 2-4 on the Streaming Songs chart, following four weeks at the summit; claims a fourth week at No. The track also continues its sizzling run at No. Drake's “What Did I Miss?” bounds onto the Hot 100 at No. Drake pushes his career total to 81 Hot 100 top 10s, extending his record for the most in the chart's nearly 67-year history. 1 on Streaming Songs — where it's Drake's record-extending 21st leader — and Digital Song Sales, where it's his 15th chart-topper, the most among male artists; overall, only Taylor Swift (29 No. Plus, “What Did I Miss?” charges in at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts — marking Drake's record-padding 31st leader on each list. HUNTR/X's “Golden” blasts 23-6 on the Hot 100 with 18.8 million streams — up 39% — 950,000 in airplay audience and 3,000 sold. KPop Demon Hunters premiered June 20 in a limited theatrical release in the U.S., and on Netflix, alongside its soundtrack. For the week ending July 6, it ranked at No. 2 on Netflix's Top 10 Movies in United States chart. Meanwhile, as HUNTR/X earns its first Hot 100 top 10, it becomes the latest fictional artist to chart in the region IRL — “Golden” is by KPop Demon Hunters' protagonist trio whose music is voiced by EJAE, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, retreats 2-3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. He posts his 10th career week with at least three simultaneous top 10s and his eighth this year, as he continues scaling both leaderboards. Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s All-Time: Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s in a Single Year: Dating to his first such frame in January 2021, it's his 29th week with at least half the chart's top 10 — no other act has more than one week achieving the feat (Beyoncé, in 2024, and Zach Bryan and Taylor Swift, both in 2023). Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” staggers 4-5 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” drops 6-7 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. Rounding out the Hot 100's top 10, Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” descends 9-10 after five weeks at No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On Feb. 18, two weeks after having her son via C-section, Monique Rodriguez was battling postpartum depression. But after finding herself alone and overwhelmed from the lack of support, she spiraled. He kept pushing the baby off on me, which I didn't like. A family member called the police, resulting in Rodriguez's arrest. With a host of complications, including anti-blackness and colorism in the Latino community — which often leaves Black immigrants out of conversations around protests and solidarity — the future is bleak. On June 6, protests broke out in Los Angeles — whose population is roughly half Hispanic, and one in five residents live with an undocumented person. “Latinos have been completely silent when Black people are getting deported by ICE,” says Alexander Duncan, a Los Angeles resident who made a viral TikTok on the subject. “All of a sudden it impacts them and they want Black people to the front lines.” Prejudice has long disconnected Black and Latino communities — but the blatant dismissal of ICE raids as a Latino issue is off base. Duncan, who moved from New York City to a predominantly Mexican neighborhood in L.A., was surprised to find the City of Angels segregated. “One of my neighbors, who has done microaggressions, was like ‘I haven't seen you go to the protests,” he tells Rolling Stone. “I said, ‘Bro, you haven't spoken to me in six months. Despite  notable increases of support for Trump across all marginalized demographics, Latino's Republican votes set a new record. “Anti-Blackness is a huge sentiment in the Latino community,” says Cesar Flores, an activist and law student in Miami, who also spoke on the matter via TikTok. “I've seen a lot of Latinos complain that they aren't receiving support from the Black community but 70 percent of people in Miami are Latino or foreign born, and 55 percent voted for Trump.” Although 51 percent of the Latino community voted for Kamala Harris overall, Black folks had the highest voting percentage for the Democratic ballot, at 83 percent. For people like Duncan, the 48 percent of Latinos who voted for Trump did so against both the Latino and Black community's interest. “It's a common misconception that deportations and raids only affect Latinos, but Black folks are impacted even more negatively by the immigration system.” Hacked Elmo X Account Shares Antisemitic Posts, Calls Trump Netanyahu's ‘Puppet' ‘I Made Every Single' Decision: Biden Fires Back at Trump Over Clemency Autopen Use Senate Report on Trump Assassination Attempt Lists ‘Preventable Failures' by Secret Service The devastation that deportation causes cannot be overstated. When ICE detained Rodriguez in February, weeks after filing her green card application, there was no consideration that she'd just given birth two weeks prior. “I was probably the only one that had a newborn, but there were women there that were ripped away from babies three months [to] 14 years old,” says Rodriguez. On May 29, her 30th birthday, Rodriguez was one of 107 people sent to Jamaica. Around the same time, Jermaine Thomas, born on an U.S. Army base in Germany, where his father served for two years, was also flown there. “I'm one of the lucky ones,” says Rodriguez, who is now back in Jamaica with her baby and husband, who maintain their American citizenships. “My husband and his mom took care of the baby when I was away. His faulty conviction of mail fraud set a precedent for convicted Black and brown migrants within the U.S. “Seventy-six percent of Black migrants are deported because of contact with police and have been in this country for a long time,” says Nana Gyamfi, an immigration attorney and the executive director of the Black Alliance For Just Immigration. A 2021 report from the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants found that while only seven percent of the immigrant population is Black, Black immigrants make up 20 percent of those facing deportation for criminal convictions, including low-level, nonviolent offences. “If you're from the Caribbean it's even higher,” says Gyamfi. On June 27, the Trump administration announced the removal of Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for Haitians starting in September, putting thousands of migrants in jeopardy given Haiti's political climate. Though a judge ruled it unconstitutional, the threat to Black migrants remains. “You have Black U.S. citizens being grabbed [by ICE] and held for days because they are racially profiling,” says Gyamfi, referring to folks like Thomas and Peter Sean Brown, who was wrongfully detained in Florida and almost deported to Jamaica, despite having proof of citizenship. “A lot of the conversation is, ‘ICE isn't looking for Black people, they're looking for Hispanics,'” Anayka She, a Black Panamanian TikTok creator, said to her 1.7 million followers. “A lot of times, as Black Americans, we don't realize that people may be Caribbean or West African,” she tells Rolling Stone. [In the media], they depict immigration one way but I wanted to give a different perspective as somebody who is visibly Black.” America's racism is partly to blame. “Los Angeles has the largest number of Belizeans in the United States but people don't know because they get mixed in with African Americans,” says Gyafami. Blaming ‘Obama, Crooked Hillary': Trump's Epstein Memo Meltdown Gets Even Worse Justin Bieber Finally Had ‘100% Creative Freedom' on ‘Swag' After Scooter Braun Split: Source “I came to America battered and bruised, for a new opportunity. Activists like Gyamfi want all Americans, especially those marginalized, to pay attention. “Black folks have been feeling the brunt of the police-to-deportation pipeline and Black people right now are being arrested in immigration court.” In a country where mass incarceration overwhelmingly impacts Black people, Gyamfi sees these deportations as a warning sign. “Trump just recently brought up sending U.S. citizens convicted of crimes to prison colonies all over the world.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shamus Records has announced the new release Woody at Home - Vol 1 + 2, a collection of 22 tracks by the late Woody Guthrie that were previously unreleased. Although long covered by artists like Pete Seeger, Bruce Springsteen, and Joni Mitchell, this is the only version in existence of Guthrie himself singing it. Woody at Home - Vol 1 + 2 was created by restoring analog tapes that Guthrie himself recorded when he was 38 years old, and uncovering unpublished family photographs, lyric sheets, and artwork from his archive. In early 1951 and 1952, Guthrie recorded these songs himself using one microphone on a reel-to-reel tape machine at his family's two-bedroom apartment in Brooklyn, New York. Captured on these tracks are not just his original songs, but also the sounds of his then-toddlers, doors creaking open, and unplanned commentary from the musician. Anna Canoni, Guthrie's granddaughter and the president of Woody Guthrie Publications, elaborated on the importance of these special home recordings: “These raw and intimate home tapes consist primarily of songs that Woody was unable to release in his lifetime, a life cut short by Huntington's disease. Never intended for commercial release, these tapes were recorded as Woody's introduction to his music publisher. In these private tapes, Woody sings about important moments in history like the plane crash at Los Gatos Canyon and the case of Trenton Six, meeting Albert Einstein and how his theories can help end race hate, stories of the disenfranchised and ignored, he sings about love, and of course, the fight against fascism. 01 This Land Is Your Land (Woody's Home Tape)02 Biggest Thing That Man Has Ever Done03 Howie, I'd Like to Talk to Yuh04 Deportee (Woody's Home Tape)05 Great Ship06 Pastures of Plenty07 Jesus Christ08 I'm a Child ta Fight09 Innocent Man10 I've Got to Know11 Backdoor Bum and the Big Land Lord 01 I Just Want to Tell You Fellers02 Peace Call03 Ain't Afraid to Die04 Buoy Bells for Trenton05 Einstein Theme Song06 One Little Thing an Atom Can't Do07 Forsaken Lover08 My Id & My Ego09 Lifebelt Washed Up10 Funny Mountain11 You Better Git Ready The material on this site may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, cached or otherwise used, except with the prior written permission of Condé Nast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The couple announced the birth of their first child, a daughter named Colette Annalise McCaffrey, on Sunday, July 13, via a joint Instagram post showing their newborn's hand. In a follow-up post on her Instagram Stories, Culpo shared a heartfelt moment: “Colette is so lucky to have the best daddy in the world,” she wrote, showing McCaffrey watching over their baby girl. In more Instagram stories, Culpo, 33, revealed that she delivered via C-section and described it as: “The scariest and most rewarding of all experiences.” According to people, she credited her husband's calming presence in the operating room. Culpo first announced her pregnancy on Instagram in March 2024, captioning a black-and-white maternity shoot: “Next chapter, motherhood 🤍.” McCaffrey also held sonogram photos in a sweet moment captured on video. The couple met through a blind date in June 2019 but kept their relationship private until Valentine's Day 2020. Baby shower of my dreams 🧸 thank you to everyone who made this day so special. She added: “I am going to freeze my eggs so that I can have babies when the time is right for Christian and me. In a lighthearted TikTok from October 2023, Culpo joked that she wanted to: “Rip out” her IUD and “start trying immediately” after their wedding. She later teased that Olivia's dress at a February wedding “poorly” hid the baby bump, quoting her sister's attempt at cover: “I'm just bloated.” Despite the teasing, Olivia's sisters had no doubt she'd be a natural mother. “I know she's going to be a really loving mother,” Aurora Culpo told People in October 2024. The couple is now settling into life as new parents, filled with love and gratitude.</p>

On July 10, 2025, Lisa Yamada was nominated for her first Daytime Emmy in the category of Outstanding Emerging Talent in a Daytime Drama Series. In an Instagram Story that has since disappeared, Yamada stated that she had been on a plane when the nominees were first announced, but not long after landing, she shared her joy in a post. say whaaaaat lol this is a prank right ? thank you brad bell for trusting me with such a beautifully complex villain like luna. playing her has been the honor of my life. i walk into television city everyday full of gratitude. how lucky am i to call this my job.

It appears that the character of Luna Nozawa may have met her demise, but true soap fans know that death is negotiable and people often return to life in the world of daytime. Lisa announced on Instagram that she has a new film. “Wish You All the Best,” coming to theaters on November 7, 2025. While Luna Nozawa's true fate may hang in the balance, it's pretty clear that Lisa Yamada's career is only just now beginning to take</p>
