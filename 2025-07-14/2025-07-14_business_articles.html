                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Port of Los Angeles reported its best June ever for shipping container traffic, an increase in ocean freight that port executives described as a tariff whipsaw effect, with shippers racing to beat President Trump's trade taxes, especially a mid-August deadline for tariffs on Chinese goods. A total of 892,340 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) were processed at the Port of Los Angeles in June, containers that were filled with holiday season and consumer replenishment products. An increase in U.S. manufacturing orders from China during the pause helped fuel China's trade surplus to $114.7 billion last month. Port of LA Executive Director Gene Seroka said that more than anything else, the monthly data highlights the tariff whipsaw effect. Imports had slowed significantly in May and continued to drop through the first half of June. "Looking into August, if everything holds the way we see it right now, I expect volume to ease because of those new tariffs being in place, making it more costly for American importers," he said, citing a National Retail Federation forecast for a double-digit percentage drop in cargo volume from August through November at U.S. ports. Seroka said the year-end holiday cargo orders should already be in. Bobby Djavaheri, president of Yedi Houseware, told CNBC during a monthly container update call hosted by the Port of Los Angeles that the layering of China tariffs plus stainless steel tariffs has greatly increased the tariff bill his firm is paying on air fryers and other kitchen appliances. "Before the tariffs, one load would have cost between $1,500 to $2,000. Mike Short, president of global freight forwarding for C.H. Robinson, said even with the big June numbers at the port, some shippers are reducing import volumes and only bringing in essential products like back-to-school items. "Others accelerated shipments to beat tariff deadlines from Southeast Asia, and many stuck to their standard peak season schedules, taking a more wait-and-see approach," said Short. "Although we're approaching traditional retail peak season for ocean, it's not likely the industry will see traditional peak volumes, as many of our 7,500 retail customers are working through inventories and being highly selective and strategic, bringing in only the essential products they must import," he said. Trump last week issued letters covering new tariffs he plans to place on several Asian nations, while recently striking a preliminary trade deal with Vietnam that brings tariffs on many of its products up to 30%. Short said while the recent deadline extensions provided nearly a month of breathing room, that's not enough time for most ocean shipments, which take on average between 20–30 days of transit time. For U.S. companies that need to bring in product but did not secure ocean freight, more expensive air freight is the only option. Josh Allen, COO of ITS Logistics, said the landscape of sourcing is changing, and supply chain and logistics professionals are now charged with building new routes to move goods from manufacturing locations to end markets. When a company's manufacturing base is changed to a different country, travel time on the ocean can be longer, and the U.S. port destination can be different. "We are watching and responding to these changes in real time," Allen said. He added that despite a record June for LA's port, the broader trade slump is helping to navigate the changes. "The logistics industry can handle and recover because demand has been depressed," he said. Kim Vaccarella, founder and CEO of fashion and accessories company Bogg, started to diversify her company's manufacturing in Vietnam to offset the tariffs on China, but all of the machines, product molds, and raw materials continue to come from China. "We have narrowed the production of our bags from four to two," said Vaccarella. President Trump's trade deal with Vietnam is still not official, and the initial language on the deal includes a 40% additional tariff on transhipments, a reference to products that begin their manufacturing journey in China even if they are ultimately finished in another nation such as Vietnam. Bogg temporarily increased prices back in April before Trump paused tariff schedules, but then reinstated the original pricing.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Millions of federal student borrowers whose loans have been in an interest-free pause will see that relief come to an end within weeks. The Trump administration announced on July 9 that the so-called SAVE forbearance will expire on Aug. 1, and that enrollees' education debts will begin to grow again if they don't make payments large enough to cover the accruing interest. More from Personal Finance:Trump's 'big beautiful bill' slashes CFPB funding78% say Trump's tariffs will make it harder to deal with debtTax changes under Trump's 'big beautiful bill' — in one chart Nearly 7.7 million federal student borrowers enrolled in the Biden-era Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, the Education Department said in its press release earlier this month. "There is a short window before interest begins to accrue again for SAVE Plan borrowers, and they need to set aside some time to decide on their next steps," said Elaine Rubin, director of corporate communications at Edvisors, which helps students navigate college costs and borrowing. Former President Joe Biden rolled out the SAVE plan in the summer of 2023, describing it as "the most affordable student loan plan ever." But millions of borrowers who signed up for the plan were caught in limbo after GOP-led lawsuits led to a block on the plan last year. The Biden administration put these borrowers in a forbearance while the legal challenges played out, and stopped interest from accruing on people's debts in the meantime. Forbearances are a period during which federal student loan borrowers are excused from making payments. "lacks the authority to put borrowers into a zero percent interest rate status." Because the SAVE plan is no longer available and its interest-free forbearance is ending, borrowers need to move quickly to find a new repayment plan, experts said. Currently, there is only one income-driven repayment plan available to borrowers: the Income-Based Repayment plan, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. (Income-driven repayment plans cap borrowers' monthly bills at a share of their discretionary income, with the aim of making payments affordable.) President Donald Trump's "one big beautiful bill" establishes another IDR repayment plan, known as RAP, but that plan won't be operational until next year. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The European Union on Monday called in representatives from Elon Musk's xAI after the company's social network X, and chatbot Grok, generated and spread anti-semitic hate speech, including praise for Adolf Hitler, last week. A spokesperson for the European Commission told CNBC via e-mail that a technical meeting will take place on Tuesday. xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Sandro Gozi, a member of Italy's parliament and member of the Renew Europe group, last week urged the Commission to hold a formal inquiry. X was already under a Commission probe for possible violations of the DSA. Grok also generated and spread offensive posts about political leaders in Poland and Turkey, including Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Turkish President Recep Erdogan. "First off, we deeply apologize for the horrific behavior that many experienced. Musk and his xAI team launched a new version of Grok Wednesday night amid the backlash. xAI works with other businesses run and largely owned by Musk, including Tesla, the publicly traded automaker, and SpaceX, the U.S. aerospace and defense contractor. Despite Grok's recent outburst of hate speech, the U.S. Department of Defense awarded xAI a $200 million contract to develop AI. Anthropic, Google and OpenAI also received AI contracts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta on Monday said it has removed about 10 million profiles for impersonating large content producers through the first half of 2025 as part of an effort by the company to combat "spammy content." The crackdown is part of Meta's broader effort to make the Facebook feed more relevant and authentic by taking action against and removing accounts that engage in "spammy" behavior, such as content created using artificial intelligence tools. As part of that initiative, Meta is also rolling out stricter measures to promote original posts from creators, the company said in a blog post. Facebook also took action against approximately 500,000 accounts that it identified to be engaged in inauthentic behavior and spam. These actions included demoting comments and reducing distribution of content, which are intended to make it harder for these accounts to monetize their posts. Meta said unoriginal content is when images or videos are reused without crediting the original creator. The action against spam and inauthentic content comes as Meta increases its investment in AI, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Monday announcing plans to spend "hundreds of billions of dollars" on AI compute infrastructure to bring the company's first supercluster online next year. This mandate comes at a time when AI is making it easier to mass-produce content across social media platforms. Other platforms are also taking action to combat the increase of spammy, low-quality content on social media, also known as "AI slop." Google's YouTube announced a change in policy this month that prevents content that is mass-produced or repetitive from being eligible for being awarded revenue. However, YouTube clarified that the policy change is aimed at curbing unoriginal, spammy and repetitive videos. "We welcome creators using AI tools to enhance their storytelling, and channels that use AI in their content remain eligible to monetize," said a spokesperson for YouTube in a blog post to clarify the new policy. YouTube's new policy change will take effect on Tuesday. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Department of Defense on Monday said it's granting contract awards of up to $200 million for artificial intelligence development at Anthropic, Google, OpenAI and xAI. The DoD's Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office said the awards will help the agency accelerate its adoption of "advanced AI capabilities to address critical national security challenges." "The adoption of AI is transforming the Department's ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries," Doug Matty, the DoD's chief digital and AI officer, said in a release. Elon Musk's xAI also announced Grok for Government on Monday, which is a suite of products that make the company's models available to U.S. government customers. The products are available through the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule, which allows federal government departments, agencies, or offices to purchase them, according to a post on X. Musk's AI startup has launched a new version of Grok and Grok for Government services after the chatbot generated and spread anti-semitic posts and other offensive content, sparking a backlash. OpenAI was previously awarded a year-long $200 million contract from the DoD in 2024, shortly after it said it would collaborate with defense technology startup Anduril to deploy advanced AI systems for "national security missions." In June, the company launched OpenAI for Government for U.S. federal, state, and local government workers.

Trump's Tariffs:

President Donald Trump indicated he is open to more trade negotiations, including with the European Union, even as he insisted that his letters threatening new tariff rates are “the deals” for US trading partners.

“The letters are the deals. The deals are made. There are no deals to make,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett speculated Monday that new tariff policies are not yet sparking widespread price inflation because President Donald Trump has convinced more people to buy American. "There's, I think, a lot of patriotism in the data," Hassett said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" when he was asked to explain why Trump's protectionist policies have not stoked higher prices, despite warnings by many economists. The National Economic Council director pointed to a recent White House report, which found prices of imported goods fell between December and May. "My theory, as an economist, of why that is, is that Americans, because of President Trump's leadership, have recognized that when they buy an American product, they not only get perhaps a better product, certainly a better product most of the time, but they're also making their community stronger," Hassett said. "The bottom line is, people prefer American products," he said. "Therefore, the demand for imports has gone way down, so much that even with what tariffs have been there, where people would say, 'Oh, they might increase prices at least a little bit,' we've seen prices going down." Hassett also argued that countries with which the United States has trade deficits are eating the cost of the tariffs, instead of passing on higher prices to American consumers. And critics have noted that Trump has at least temporarily pulled back on some of his biggest tariff plans, including many announced during his "liberation day" in early April. Others note that many importers stockpiled goods in anticipation of incoming tariffs, muting the near-term effects of the duties on prices. Ernest Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, wrote that the methodology used in the White House's report "will understate tariff effects in their import indices." Tedeschi, who served as the top economist at the White House Council of Economic Advisers under former President Joe Biden, also cited data from Harvard University's Pricing Lab showing that prices on imported goods have risen since early March, when U.S. tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China took effect.

Meta:

CEO of Meta Platforms Inc. Mark Zuckerberg

Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said the company is building several massive data centers to power its artificial intelligence efforts with the first one expected to come online next year. 

“We're calling the first one Prometheus and it's coming online in ‘26,” Zuckerberg said in a post on his social platform Threads on Monday. “We're building multiple more titan clusters as well,” he said, referring to the large data-center complexes. </p>

Crypto:

Vanguard's campus in Paoli, Pennsylvania.

Bitcoin is not “appropriate” for long-term investors. Also, digital assets are more a speculation and less an investment. And they're an “immature asset class” with little history and “no inherent economic value” that can wreak “havoc” on portfolios. 

Vanguard Group Inc. executives, channeling the logic of the venerable Jack Bogle, have made their opinions on crypto clear. Yet thanks to the cold logic of index investing, the $10 trillion money-management giant is now the biggest backer of Strategy, the software firm that famously reinvented itself as a proxy for Bitcoin and became a poster child for the industry's ambitions.</p>

Extreme Weather:

Debris fill the banks of the Guadalupe River in Center Point, Texas, on July 13.

Central Texas is facing the threat of more flooding as persistent storms bring heavy rain to the area, while a separate system will unleash downpours on New York City and throughout the Mid-Atlantic. 

Monday has begun with one round of rain in Central Texas, which will likely be followed by another later tonight, said Bryan Jackson, a forecaster with the US Weather Prediction Center. On Sunday, recovery efforts in the region were paused as the flood risk rose more than a week after devastating deluges killed at least 130 people and left dozens missing.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Crypto policy has been a key area of focus for the Trump administration, creating a steady tailwind for the market in recent months. Bitcoin prices recently surged to new record highs as it passed $120,000, sparking bullish predictions for how far the rally could go. While no new crypto bills have been fully passed yet, optimism for legislative support has helped fuel gains for bitcoin and other cryptos this year. "This growing optimism suggests that clearer rules could restore trust and bring cautious investors back into the fold," Adrian Fritz, head of research at 21Shares, told BI. "US crypto stocks and bitcoin are rallying as traders position themselves ahead of next week's expected publicity." Fritz also cited stronger global liquidity and lower geopolitical tensions as contributing factors to bitcoin's latest rally past $120,000, but still sees the crypto push on Capitol Hill as an important catalyst. Fritz said that under the GENIUS Act, stablecoins would be recognized as programmable money, likely leading to further integration into payment systems. "The stablecoin sector is thus positioned for significant expansion, likely experiencing increased institutional adoption for remittances, e-commerce transactions, and decentralized finance (DeFi) collateral" he said. Chris Kline, COO & co-founder of BitcoinIRA, also flagged a possible boost to stablecoins, highlighting the benefits for stablecoin infrastructure and compliance frameworks that can stem from further regularity clarity. "Stablecoins and tokenized assets represent the most immediate growth opportunities," he told Business Insider. "These sectors will likely experience complementary rather than competitive development." Doug Carrillo, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Bitstop & GoldATM predicts that crypto week will spur growth for stablecoins but also highlighted another asset class that's likely to benefit. will experience accelerated growth as clear frameworks reduce perceived legal risks, opening opportunities for new markets," he stated. All three crypto bills being mulled in Congress are expected to garner strong support, and the market implications for such a vote of confidence from lawmakers are powerful. "Passage in the House would mark a historic milestone as the most comprehensive crypto legislation package ever approved by a chamber of Congress," Fritz noted. Sahel Ahyaie Assar, an international tax attorney who serves as blockchain and digital asset practice group leader at Buchanan Ingersoll and Rooney, sees legislation on stablecoins as being particularly important this week. "As currently drafted, the GENIUS Act's treatment of decentralized protocols and 'digital commodity' classification will be most impactful. If DeFi protocols receive treatment akin to commodities or software platforms—as distinguished from securities issuers—it may change the entire posture of the U.S. crypto enforcement regime," she stated. Anthony Tuths, a tax principal and digital asset practice leader at KPMG, predicts that even more changes will be coming for the financial sector in the wake of crypto week. "The programmable money and intra-day collateral movements will save large financial institutions billions due to greater capital efficiency."</p>

Trump's Immigration Policy:

The Trump administration's $45 billion for detention is raising fresh concerns over law enforcement visits to families.

A group of armed federal agents greeted a family in Spokane, Washington, when they opened their front door to run an errand. They bolted back into the house. Undeterred, the agents pounded on the doors and windows, asking for a 16-year-old boy by name.

From inside, the family agreed to speak to the agents and answer a few questions: Was the boy going to school? Was he being fed? How did he injure himself in gym class? Then, the agents left. They haven't returned.</p>

Trump's Tariffs:

Despite the wild swings in trade policies, these entrepreneurs say the math on reshoring doesn't work for them.

For years, it was a winning business model: A startup in the US would have a clever idea for the kind of everyday product that everybody else wished they'd thought of first. The design and innovation were American, but the manufacturing was outsourced to a country with much cheaper production costs, such as China, Mexico or Vietnam.

That model was a feature of many of the businesses that appear on the hit television series Shark Tank, in which entrepreneurs pitch their idea to a panel of potential investors. Landing a spot on the show has been a coveted prize for any small business given the visibility—and sales boost—it typically brings.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Google's most powerful leaders is someone who long tried to distance his company from the search giant. AI mastermind and chess wiz Demis Hassabis, who founded DeepMind and later sold it to Google in 2014, has been propelled into the center of Google's universe in the past two years amid the frenzied race for AI dominance. Now, company insiders close to Hassabis say he is destined for even greater heights that may give him more control over the powerful AI technology he builds — and possibly one day lead the company. For years, Hassabis hoped the AI race would be one led by academics and scientists in research labs, with international organizations to prevent AI's misuse and to map humanity's path through a new era of technological transformation. He's wrangling a 6,000-plus team inside Google's AI engine room that has accrued increasingly more power and talent—Google DeepMind just poached the core team of the AI coding startup Windsurf, which rival OpenAI had previously planned to acquire. The stakes have never been higher: He has to keep Google ahead of corporate rivals and keep the US ahead of China. Business Insider spoke to more than a dozen company insiders for this story. They described how Google tapped its ultimate AI weapon in Hassabis, who has the makings of a CEO — and whose ascent within Google has come with trade-offs. In 2014, Hassabis sold the company to Google for $650 million with a caveat: It would create an AI ethics board that would limit how Google could use DeepMind's technology. In the years to come, Hassabis would take this further, fighting to create legal thicker walls between his lab and the search giant, BI previously reported. One former employee said they were confused at the time as to how DeepMind could ever build something that would directly compete with Google's own Assistant. In 2023, after talks to secure DeepMind's independence failed, Pichai announced the unit would fuse with Google's internal AI lab, and they merged their AI assistant efforts. Google was caught flat-footed by OpenAI's ChatGPT and needed a battle plan. Merging DeepMind with the Brain team from Google Research meant Hassabis had to oversee the merging of two units that historically had behaved more like competitors than colleagues. Years before the merger, things had gotten so bad between both organizations trying to scoop one another that Hassabis had DeepMind's code locked so it wasn't visible to Google employees. Now, bringing them together meant deciding who should sit under whom, leading to some political infighting, according to multiple people who were there. DeepMind also used different programming technology than Google — a decision Hassabis made to avoid dependencies on Google teams — and so the merger posed a large technical challenge. A Google spokesperson said these issues had since been resolved. Thrusting Hassabis into the driver's seat gave him more power but less control. For example, Hassabis has had to change his stance on what were once red lines: In February 2024, Google dropped a pledge made in 2018 not to use its AI for military purposes, following the rest of Silicon Valley. "Since we first published our AI Principles in 2018, the AI field has evolved substantially, and we've updated our Principles to more effectively meet the environment of today. In the merger process, dozens of DeepMind employees left for other labs, pushed out by internal politics and pulled away by a red-hot AI job market. A pullback on publishing certain types of research also rankled some staff, insiders said. "Some people joined an academic research lab and suddenly they're being asked to build products, and that's not what they wanted," a former DeepMind employee said. Others were excited by how Google had been shaken out of its slumber, especially when cofounder Sergey Brin returned to the trenches. The merger has required Hassabis to play a hand in the sorts of Google politicking DeepMind had for a long time avoided to some degree. "There have been many shared views and ways of working between the two teams, and the merger has been very smooth," they said. Hassabis' new position has some employees wondering if he is being groomed to succeed Pichai and if the CEO chair could give him the level of control over Google's AI he has always wanted. Others close to Hassabis believe he wouldn't care for such responsibilities. Running Google means overseeing a search business and an advertising empire. It means being dragged in front of Congress to answer uncomfortable questions. "But being CEO would push him away from the things he wants to do. For Hassabis, the past two years have punched up an already powerful résumé. He was a chess prodigy at age 4 and master standard by 13. At 17, he joined the computer game company Bullfrog, where, after completing his studies, he later returned to build a multimillion-selling video game (Theme Park; you might have played it). In 2010, he co-founded DeepMind, one of the world's most powerful and successful AI labs. In 2024 alone, he oversaw a series of Google AI product launches, earned a Nobel Prize for his work on DeepMind's protein folding project, and even slipped in a knighthood for "services to artificial intelligence," bestowed upon him by King Charles III. People who have worked with Hassabis describe him as a double threat: He's incredibly smart and can dive deep into technical topics. Devang Agrawal, a former DeepMinder, recalled how he was studying for his undergraduate degree when Hassabis visited his university and gave the students a demo where an AI system used reinforcement learning to play Atari games. "I think Demis has this really brilliant quality about him, to talk in an inspirational way," said Agrawal. "Demis is very good at convincing you that you and him together are going to change the world," said another former DeepMind employee. Hassabis can also be fiercely competitive, colleagues and friends say. When asked about Elon Musk's AI ambitions during an interview at Davos in January, Hassabis remarked, "I think I got him into AI in the first place." In an interview with The New York Times last year, he said of fellow DeepMind founder and now Microsoft competitor Mustafa Suleyman: "Most of what he has learned about AI comes from working with me over all these years." His work on AlphaFold, a project for predicting the protein structures of the human body, resulted in a new spin-off company and garnered him his Nobel Prize. "I want to understand the fundamental nature of reality," he said during a fireside chat at Davos in January. For him, AI is a tool to do that, and he's most comfortable when discussing the Nobel-winning breakthroughs of protein folding and the potential for AI to eradicate diseases. After Google bought DeepMind, the AI lab embarked on an initiative — codenamed "Watermelon" and later called "Mario" — to create thicker walls between its group and its funder. It wanted to protect its valuable creations and prevent them from being used for military or surveillance purposes. Hassabis knew he was racing against the clock, multiple former and current DeepMind employees said. Hassabis spun it as a win: it meant DeepMind would continue to have access to Google's vast computing power, necessary for building vast AI systems and ultimately, Hassabis hoped, artificial general intelligence — a hypothetical level of machine intelligence that surpasses human cognition across a range of areas. Before selling to Google, a person familiar with the matter said Hassabis considered forming a second company to build video games and fund DeepMind's research. Google's $650 million price tag looks like a bargain when compared to OpenAI's $6.6 billion funding round or the $14.3 billion Meta is spending to invest in Scale AI. The arrangement allowed DeepMind to continue its research without being part of Google's corporate bureaucracy, while also giving the company access to what would become more valuable than anything else: compute power. "Whereas today there's enough interest where you can raise enough money without giving away the whole company, so they get to retain control. I can just imagine that's how Demis would prefer things — to be in control," one former employee said. Hassabis now walks a difficult line between his own interests regarding AGI and those of Google's shareholders. Running Google's control room now means pushing the frontiers of AI research while infusing it into the company's suite of products, from Search to Maps to Workspace. At the same time, Google DeepMind has scaled back the types of papers it publishes to prevent rivals from taking Google's ideas. It's a change in tune from 2016 when Hassabis told Bloomberg Businessweek that work on AI should be carried out in an "open way" and that DeepMind did this by "publishing everything we write." "I think ultimately the control of this technology should belong to the world, and we need to think about how that's done," he said. Almost a decade later, Hassabis appears to still be wrestling with his concerns, though it's unclear if he has the power to do much about them while running Google's corporate AI engine. At SXSW London in June, Hassabis again called for international cooperation to better safeguard the transformative technology he sees coming. In recent years, he has become more vocal about his concerns that the world is not ready for AGI. At I/O in May, he and Brin predicted AGI would arrive around 2030. People aren't thinking enough about AI's long-term implications, Hassabis has said. "What's going to happen in the next five, 10-year timescale is going to be monumental," he said at Davos earlier this year, "and I think that's not understood yet." "But I do think we should be thinking very carefully about these next steps."</p>
