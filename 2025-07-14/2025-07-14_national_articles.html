The attorney general spoke about the DOJ's efforts to protect religious freedom rights during a hearing and indicated to lawmakers that she was focused on a range of religions, from Judaism to Islam. For the first time, Florida tops the national rankings, followed by Montana, Illinois, Ohio and Mississippi. Illinois and Mississippi have garnered a spot in the top five every year since the index was first released by the First Liberty Institute's Center for Religion, Culture & Democracy (CRCD) in 2022. The index uses a detailed scoring system measuring legal protections and ranking states based on the percentage of possible safeguards they have adopted. This year, with 2025's rankings, nearly 55 percentage points separates Florida from the last-place state, West Virginia, which has been last on the index for three years in a row. "We find that the states are laboratories of religious liberty where different protections for free exercise can be implemented and tested," CRCD Executive Director Jordan Ballor wrote in an introduction for the 2025 index. There are positive lessons to be learned from this experimentation, as states that have been at the vanguard of protecting religious liberty can serve as exemplars for states that have lagged behind." The index's accompanying report points out that Florida "is an exemplar" for how state lawmakers can improve their protections around religious freedom. Much of this improvement came from legislation passed in 2023 strengthening religious protections that allow healthcare providers to refuse to participate in medical procedures or services, such as abortion or sterilization, based on their religious or moral beliefs. The report also pointed to Florida's passage of legislation in 2022 protecting houses of worship from discriminatory treatment during pandemics and other emergencies. Florida was crowned number one among all 50 states in the First Liberty Institute's 2025 religious liberty rankings. "We're grateful for this recognition from the First Liberty Institute, which has just named Florida the number one state in the nation for protecting religious liberty." "This year's findings show clearly that states taking legislative action are pulling ahead," added Kelly Shackelford, president, CEO and chief counsel at First Liberty. DeSantis, Florida passed real laws that protect real people, and now the Sunshine State is the national leader in protecting religious liberty. It's time for more states to follow Gov. DeSantis's example and adopt strong religious liberty laws." While Florida was pointed to in the RLS index as an "exemplar," the report stated that religious freedom was becoming increasingly "tenuous" in the blue state of Illinois. The move downward for the Land of Lincoln was not because the state repealed protections, but mainly because it has not implemented new protections that other states, like Florida, have, the report noted. Per the 2025 RLS report, almost all of Illinois' protections came when the state was more conservative between 1934 and 1998. While Florida was pointed to in the RLS index as an "exemplar," the report stated that religious freedom was becoming increasingly "tenuous" in the blue state of Illinois. In an effort to demonstrate the dangers of "complacency," the report also pointed to Colorado when Republicans "routinely" had control of both houses of the state legislature. The First Liberty Institute said the results of the 2024 election may give some people the idea that passing laws protecting religious liberty is not as important, but the conservative Christian legal group warned this is "emphatically not the case," noting that data shows passing such laws is just as critical amid a "favorable" political climate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This image released by A24 shows Joaquin Phoenix, left, and Pedro Pascal in a scene from “Eddington.” (A24 via AP) Emma Stone, left, and Ari Aster arrive at the premiere of “Eddington” on Thursday, June 26, 2025, at the DGA Theater Complex in Los Angeles.

Deirdre O'Connell, from left, Emma Stone, Ari Aster, Joaquin Phoenix, and Clifton Collins Jr. arrive at the premiere of “Eddington” on Thursday, June 26, 2025, at the DGA Theater Complex in Los Angeles. You might need to lie down for a bit after “Eddington.” Preferably in a dark room with no screens and no talking. “Eddington,” Ari Aster's latest nightmare vision, is sure to divide (along which lines, I'm can't fathom) but there is one thing I think everyone will be able to agree on: It is an experience that will leave you asking “WHAT?” The movie opens on the aggravated ramblings of an unhoused man and doesn't get much more coherent from there. It is an anti-escapist symphony of masking debates, conspiracy theories, YouTube prophets, TikTok trends and third-rail topics in which no side is spared. Joaquin Phoenix plays the town sheriff, a soft-spoken wife guy named Joe Cross, who we meet out in the desert one night watching YouTube videos about how to convince your wife to have a baby. He pits himself against the slick local mayor Ted Garcia (Pedro Pascal), who is up for reelection, in the pocket of big tech and ready to exploit his single fatherhood for political gain. At home, Joe's mother-in-law Dawn (Deirdre O'Connell) spends all day consuming internet conspiracy theories, while his wife Louise (a criminally underused Emma Stone) works on crafts and nurses unspoken traumas. Joe's eagerness to take on Ted isn't just about masking. Years ago, Ted dated his now-wife, a story that will be twisted into rape and grooming accusations. Caricatures and stereotypes are everywhere in “Eddington,” but in this world it feels like the women are especially underwritten — they are kooks, victims, zealots and the ones who push fragile men to the brink. But in “Eddington,” all the conspiracies are real and ordinary people are all susceptible to the madness. In fact, insanity is just an inevitability no matter how well-intentioned one starts out, whether that's the woke-curious teen rattled by rejection, or the loyal deputy Guy (Luke Grimes) who is suddenly more than happy to accuse a colleague of murder. Louise will also be swayed by a floppy-haired internet guru, a cult-like leader played with perfect swagger by Austin Butler. The problem with an anarchic satire like “Eddington,” in theaters Friday, is that any criticism could easily be dismissed with a “that's the point” counterargument. And yet there is very little to be learned in this silo of provocations that, like all Aster movies, escalates until the movie is over. “Eddington” is not incompetently done or unwatchable (the cast and the director kind of guarantee that); it just doesn't feel a whole of anything other than a cinematic expression of broken brains. Five years after we just went through (at least a lot of) this, “Eddington” somehow seems both too late and too soon, especially when it offers so little wisdom or insight beyond a vision of hopelessness. I wonder what world Aster thought he'd be releasing this film into. Maybe one that was better, not cosmically worse. Perhaps it's the kind of movie that future Gen Alpha cinephiles will point to as being ahead of its time, a work that was woefully misunderstood by head-in-the-sand critics who didn't see that it was 2025's answer to the prescient paranoia cinema of the 1970s. “Eddington,” an A24 release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for “for strong violence, some grisly images, language and graphic nudity.” Running time: 148 minutes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo speaks to supporters during a Democratic primary watch party, Tuesday, June 24, 2025, in New York. Andrew Cuomo said Monday he will campaign for mayor of New York City as an independent candidate, staying in a crowded field running against surging left-wing Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani. In a video, Cuomo, who last month suffered a bruising loss to Mamdani in the Democratic primary, announced he was making another run to combat the progressive Mamdani, who he said “offers slick slogans but no real solutions.” “The fight to save our city isn't over,” Cuomo said. “Only 13 percent of New Yorkers voted in the June primary. Democrat mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks during a rally at the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council headquarters in New York, Wednesday, July 2, 2025. People opposed to Mamdani's progressive agenda, which includes higher taxes on the wealthy, have called on donors and voters to unite behind a single candidate for the November election. Mamdani's campaign responded to Cuomo's announcement by saying the ex-governor and mayor are cozying up to “billionaires and Republicans” while the Democratic nominee remains focused on affordability issues. “That's the choice this November,” campaign spokesperson Jeffrey Lerner said in a statement. Cuomo's decision to continue on in the race is the latest chapter in his comeback attempt, launched almost four years after he resigned as governor in 2021 following a barrage of sexual harassment allegations. He limited media interviews, held few unscripted events and avoided mingling with voters. That strategy contrasted with Mamdani's energetic street-level campaign centered around affordability issues. Final results released after the city ran through its ranked choice voting calculations showed Mamdani besting the former governor by 12 percentage points. Despite the Democratic primary loss, Cuomo had also qualified to run on an independent ballot line in November under a party he created called “Fight and Deliver.” Al Sharpton, an influential Black leader, urged Cuomo to step aside. Some deep-pocketed contributors have meanwhile aligned behind Adams, who is running as an independent. Although he's still a Democrat, Adams pulled out of the primary shortly after a federal judge dismissed a corruption case against him at the request of President Donald Trump's Justice Department, arguing that the case had sidelined him from campaigning. Cuomo, 67, served as governor for over a decade and modeled himself as a socially progressive Democrat who got things done. He pushed through legislation that legalized gay marriage and tackled massive infrastructure projects, like a three-mile bridge over the Hudson River that he named after his father. The governor leavened stern warnings for people to wear masks with heartfelt expressions of concern for his elderly mother or brotherly banter with Chris Cuomo, a TV journalist. His reputation was soon tainted when it emerged that the state's official count of nursing home deaths had excluded many victims who had been transferred to hospitals before they succumbed. Cuomo resigned shortly after New York's attorney general released the results of an investigation that found he sexually harassed at least 11 women.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the central bank's inspector general to conduct an additional review of an ongoing $2.5 billion renovation of the institution's headquarters that has drawn fire from President Donald Trump and others, according to a source familiar with the matter. The renovation has come up as a new line of attack from Trump, who has railed against Powell for months for not lowering interest rates further. At his semiannual monetary policy hearing before Congress last month, Powell was grilled by some Senate lawmakers over what they depicted as lavish upgrades to the Fed's headquarters in Washington, DC. Since then, the Fed head has been under fire by top Trump officials, with some accusing him of lying under oath. Related article Trump's increasingly aggressive attacks on Powell aren't what you think “The Federal Reserve's Inspector General is considering opening an investigation into the massive cost overruns for their $2.5B+ HQ renovation project,” wrote James Blair, a White House deputy chief of staff, on Monday on X. The Fed in an FAQ posted last week said the cost overruns were due to “unforeseen conditions” requiring more spending to rectify, such as “more asbestos than anticipated, toxic contamination in soil, and a higher-than-expected water table.” Jaret Seiberg, a managing director at TD Cowen, said in commentary issued Monday that “Team Trump is building a case to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for failing to manage the renovation of the central bank's headquarters complex.” “We still see Powell's firing as unlikely though the risk is growing that pressure from conservative media becomes so great the President feels compelled to act,” he wrote. By law, the Fed chair can only be fired “for cause,” which is broadly interpreted to mean for malfeasance or a dereliction of duty. The Fed's handling of its renovation, which administration officials are describing as mismanaged, could be used as one step in a possible pathway for Trump to sack Powell. Powell has said Fed officials are waiting to see the impact of Trump's tariffs first before lowering rates again. He has said that if it weren't for the tariffs, the Fed would have already lowered rates this year by now. Trump also told reporters on Sunday that Powell refuses to lower rates “and yet he's spending two and a half billion dollars rebuilding the Federal Reserve building.” (Decisions about rate moves are voted on by a rotating committee of 12 Fed officials, including the chair.) “So he got this approved, and he started the work during the Biden administration, and he doesn't look like the kind of a guy, frankly, that wants to spend two and a half billion dollars,” he said. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House's National Economic Council and seen as a front-runner to be Powell's successor, has also slammed the Fed for its renovation project, but he's stopped short of saying the central bank should bend to Trump's will. “We'll see how the Fed responds to this incredible cost overrun,” Hassett told CNBC. “I think that we've got a real problem of oversight and excess spending.” “We 100% want independent monetary policy, but it sure looks like they need more congressional oversight on things like the way they build their buildings,” he added.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump criticized Joe Biden over his autopen use after the former president defended himself in a rare media interview amid escalating congressional investigations into his administration. Trump repeated that Biden's autopen use is “one of the biggest scandals” in “50 to 100 years” because his predecessor “knew nothing about what he was signing.” “They're going to figure it out, and we'll see what happens,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday of the congressional inquiries. “It's not supposed to be for signing major legislation.” “I think the radical Left people that took — they took over the White House,” he said alongside NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. “If I didn't win, our country was finished.” “I made every single one of those,” he told the news outlet. “And — including the categories, when we set this up to begin with. And so, you know, that's just — this is how it worked.” At the same time, Biden did confirm his autopen use, contending it was necessary because “there were a lot” of clemency actions. But the point is that, you know, we're talking about a whole lot of people.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Denver Broncos consultant John Elway looks on against the Houston Texans during an NFL football game, Sept. 18, 2022, in Denver. LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) — NFL Hall of Famer John Elway won't be charged after his business partner Jeffrey Sperbeck was fatally injured falling out of his golf cart at a Southern California golf resort community last April, authorities said. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told KUSA-TV in Denver on Friday that investigators found nothing criminal and ruled it a tragic accident. Sperbeck, Elway's partner and former agent, died after suffering an injury when he tumbled out of a golf cart driven by the former quarterback on April 26 at The Madison Club in La Quinta, east of Los Angeles. Sperbeck's cause of death was “blunt force trauma” and the manner of death was an accident that occurred when the “passenger fell from the golf cart,” the county coroner's report said. “I've looked at video 100 times and there's no explanation as to why he fell off, he just fell off,'' Bianco said. Elway didn't immediately comment on the findings. He said in an April statement that he was devastated by the death of his close friend. “There are no words to truly express the profound sadness I feel with the sudden loss of someone who has meant so much to me,” Elway said at the time. Elway's April statement did not address his presence at the scene. He represented more than 100 NFL players during a three-decade career as an agent and business adviser. He was best known as Elway's partner who helped manage the Hall of Famer's extensive off-field business empire, which included restaurants, car dealerships and a winery.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said Monday he would punish Russia with tariffs if there isn't a deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days. He made the announcement during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. President Donald Trump said Monday he would punish Russia with tariffs if there isn't a deal to end the war in Ukraine within 50 days, the latest example of his growing anger with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump made the announcement during an Oval Office meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. He said they would be “secondary tariffs,” meaning they would target Russia's trading partners in an effort to isolate Moscow in the global economy. He also touted a recent decision allowing religious leaders to endorse candidates without their organizations losing tax exempt status. Addressing religious leaders at a White House event, Trump said “you have more power than anybody, but you're not allowed to use your power.” There has not yet been an official statement from the Kremlin. Trump's remarks quickly turned from religion to the economy. The president began his remarks at an event hosted by the White House Faith Office by expressing his support for religion in public life. Trump said the economy was doing well despite Powell's refusal to reduce rates to Trump's liking, but it would be “nice” if there rate cuts “because people would be able to buy housing a lot easier.” There is also the possibility that tariffs harm economic growth in ways that require rate cuts in order to limit job losses. Trump added that it was unfortunate that Biden got to use the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office just like he does. And he noted that, while the use of the autopen is legal, it is “not supposed to be for signing major legislation” and things like presidential pardons. Trump derided the Gaza Strip as “one of the worst real estate deals ever made” and suggested that its formation involved giving up “oceanfront property.” The president has for months suggested that Israel could seize control of Gaza amid its war with Hamas there, and then cede it to the U.S.Trump has said repeatedly that U.S. authorities could then transform the area into a Riviera-like resort. Trump said one of his administration's chief foreign envoys, Steve Witkoff, would be working on Gaza and that there could be something “fairly soon to talk about” on that front. Trump and Rutte say Germany is going to supply Ukraine with a massive amount of weaponry, including Patriot missile defense systems, as part of the broader initiative by the U.S. and the alliance to shore up Ukrainian defenses. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is due to meet later Monday with Pete Hegseth to discuss the Patriot transfers, which Trump and Rutte said could occur within days.

Trump repeated his frustration that Putin has resisted making a deal with Ukraine to end the war. He said his conversations with the Russian president “are always very pleasant,” but “then missiles go off that night.” Putin “knows what a fair deal is,” Trump said. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, July 14, 2025, in Washington. Trump seems increasingly sanguine about European nations playing a larger role in opposing Russia's war with Ukraine and spending more to help increase military security on the continent. Trump says he's pleased with Europe spending more on defense — after many NATO members at a recent summit in The Hague agreed to increase spending to 5% of their GDP — and reiterated his complaints that the U.S. still spends heavily to defend Ukraine. Trump says of a GOP-championed sanctions package against Russia, “I'm not sure we need it.” “It could be very useful, we'll have to see,” Trump said. President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, July 14, 2025, in Washington. Trump says the European governments will then transfer the munitions to Ukraine under a new deal to support Kyiv in defending itself against Russia. Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday with Rutte that those transfers — combined with a threat to impose 100% tariffs on all Russian exports if a peace deal isn't reached within 50 days — should serve as notice to Putin that he's serious about ending the war. Trump did not provide details but said the weapons would include Patriot missile defense batteries. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte speaks during a meeting with President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Monday, July 14, 2025, in Washington. Mark Rutte said Europeans will buy weapons from the U.S. to equip Ukraine, and that the armaments and equipment should cause Russian President Vladimir Putin to “reconsider” peace negotiations. Rutte said Ukraine would get “massive numbers of military equipment” such as missiles, air defense systems and ammunition. He described them as secondary tariffs, meaning they would target Russia's trading partners. If implemented, it would be an attempt to isolate Moscow in the global economy.

It wasn't immediately clear what products could be targeted. Trump's cuts to international programs, tariffs on allies and partners, and unfriendly moves against international students have “deeply” undermined U.S. competitiveness in its rivalry against China, warned the Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a report released today. The House is considering far more sweeping cryptocurrency market structure legislation. The S&P 500 was edging down early Monday, still within 0.5% of its all-time high set on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq composite were holding steady in their first trading after Trump said he plans 30% tariffs on goods from Mexico and the European Union starting Aug. 1, the same deadline he announced for Japan, South Korea and a dozen other countries. The latest postponements allow time for more dealmaking to mitigate economic damage. Enacting all his import taxes on U.S. consumers would raise the risk of a recession and raise U.S. debt pressure as big tax cuts add to the deficit. Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, global head of equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicts the Trump administration “will ultimately de-escalate, especially if there is a new bout of heightened bond and stock market volatility.” As Trump slaps trading partners with tariffs rather than slog through prolonged negotiations, pressures the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates and launches a new investigation aimed at reshaping higher education, it's clear that threats are a permanent feature of his presidency. Republicans in Congress fear primary challenges, and the Supreme Court is stocked with his appointees.

Trump's allies believe his aggression is required in a political ecosystem where he's under siege from Democrats, the court system and the media. Critics fear he's eroding the country's democratic foundations with an authoritarian style. ▶ Read more about Trump's moves to expand his power They met in Kyiv on Monday as anticipation grew over a possible shift in the Trump administration's policy on the three-year war. Zelenskyy said he and retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg had “a productive conversation” about strengthening Ukrainian air defenses, joint arms production, purchasing U.S. weapons in conjunction with European countries and the possibility of tighter sanctions on the Kremlin. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration about Russian President Vladimir Putin's unbudging stance on U.S-led peace efforts. “I am very disappointed with President Putin, I thought he was somebody that meant what he said,” Trump said late Sunday. “We hope for the leadership of the United States, because it is clear that Moscow will not stop unless its ... ambitions are stopped by force,” Zelenskyy said on Telegram.

(AP Photo/Sophie Park) These children attend after-school and summer programming at a Boys & Girls Club, YMCA or public school for free thanks to funding set Congress set aside for academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families. Many now face closure as the Trump administration withholds more than $6 billion in federal education grants to align with his priorities. Ninety-one of the 100 school districts receiving the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. “I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,” said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican. ▶ Read more about the children's programs that face closure Congress set up a process under President Richard Nixon to speedily claw back previously approved spending authority with only a simple Senate majority. “How Republicans answer this question on rescissions and other forthcoming issues will have grave implications for the Congress, the very role of the legislative branch, and, more importantly, our country,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned in a letter to colleagues. The Trump administration is likening this as a test case and says more could come if Congress goes along. The headquarters for National Public Radio (NPR) is seen in Washington, April 15, 2013. In recent testimony, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought criticized a “Sesame Street” town hall on CNN about combating racism. Senate Republicans will test the popularity of Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts this week by aiming to pass Trump's request to claw back $9.4 billion in public media and foreign aid spending. Senate Democrats are trying to kill the measure, but they need help from a few Republicans. If Congress fails to act before that clock expires Friday, the spending stands. The House has already approved Trump's request on a mostly party line 214-212 vote. Another House vote will be needed if senators amend the legislation, adding more uncertainty. If Trump makes good on his tariff threats against dozens of countries, it could have ramifications for nearly every aspect of the global economy. ▶ Read more about the European Union on Trump tariffs talks ''This is now the time for negotiations,'' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels on Sunday after Trump sent a letter announcing new 30% tariffs on all EU goods starting Aug. 1.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Spanish police have arrested eight people after three nights of clashes between far-right groups and North African migrants in a town in southeastern Spain, the government said on Monday. In one of Spain's worst such flare-ups of recent times, several dozen youths, some hooded, hurled glass bottles and other objects at riot police in Torre Pacheco on Sunday night, Reuters journalists saw. Police fired rubber bullets to quell the unrest. The trouble stemmed from an attack last week on a man in his late 60s that left him injured and recovering at home. The victim told LaSexta broadcaster last week that he had been on a walk in a cemetery garden when two men, speaking in a language he did not understand, ran towards him, one in an agitated state. I think they hit me and then left,” said the man, whom LaSexta and other media identified as Domingo Tomas. Authorities said they arrested two foreigners suspected of being involved in the assault though they were still looking for the main perpetrator, who had been identified. The other six - five Spaniards and one person of North African origin - were arrested for assault, public disorder, hate crimes or damage to property, the Interior Ministry said. “I ask the migrant community not to leave their homes and not to confront rioters, because confrontation achieves nothing and ultimately makes us all afraid,” local mayor Pedro Angel Roca told national broadcaster TVE. Speaking to radio station Cadena Ser, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska attributed the violence to anti-immigration rhetoric from far-right groups and political parties such as Vox, which he said unjustifiably links immigration to crime. The violence in Torre Pacheco was organized and fomented by calls on social media, the minister added. Vox leader Santiago Abascal denied any responsibility for the incidents and said the government's migration policies were to blame. Spain has been open to migration and its economic benefits, even as other European governments have tightened borders. But debate has reignited, led by Vox, as plans to relocate unaccompanied underage migrants from the Canary Islands to the rest of Spain have been confirmed in recent weeks. “Spain is not a country that hunts down immigrants, and if we have to take to the streets, it is to defend the rights of thousands of people who are completely trapped and distressed by this hunt for immigrants,” Migration Minister Elma Saiz told El Pais newspaper. Abdelali, a North African migrant who lives in Torre Pacheco and declined to give his surname, said he was afraid of riding his scooter for fear of being hit by bottles from rioters. That's what we want, we don't want anything else,” he told Reuters on Sunday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cameroon's 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who has held an iron grip on the Central African nation for nearly 43 years has launched a reelection bid that could keep him in power until almost his 100th birthday. Biya is seeking a fresh seven-year term in a presidential election scheduled for October, despite reports that his health has deteriorated. He said his decision to extend his grip on power rested “on urgent appeals coming from the 10 regions of our country and from the diaspora.” His announcement comes months after his office pushed back on speculation he was unwell or had died following a lengthy absence from the public eye. Discussions about his health were later banned in the media, with the Cameroon interior ministry declaring it a national security matter. Related article President's daughter hopes to help Cameroon's gays by coming out For years, rumors about Biya's health and whereabouts have been major talking points in Cameroon, where he has rarely been seen in public. Biya came to power in 1982 and has remained in office for more than four decades, becoming one of the globe's longest-serving heads of state, excluding monarchs. Questions swirled around the prospects of Biya seeking an eighth term in office with many local leaders urging him to seek a new mandate. Defeating Biya at the polls may not come easily for his opponents, according to political analyst Collins Molua Ikome, who is based in Germany. Ikome told CNN that Cameroon's opposition, which comprises more than 300 political parties, is too fragmented to dislodge Biya's ruling Cameroon People's Democratic Movement (CPDM) party at the October polls. “They (the opposition) don't stand a chance as individual candidates. In March last year, plans by two opposition parties to create a coalition were dubbed illegal by the country's interior ministry, a move described by Human Rights Watch as “part of a government crackdown on opposition and dissent.” Biya's long rule has been marred by widespread accusations of human rights violations that included “extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests, unlawful detentions, torture… unfair trials, and persecution and imprisonment of people for their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity,” according to rights group Amnesty International.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is set to meet with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte on Monday as the United States warms up to the idea of providing Ukraine with missiles in its war with Russia. Trump teased a “major announcement” on Monday regarding Russia, and it is expected to be more weapons for Ukraine. Sources told Axios that the announcement is a new weapons package for Ukraine, including offensive and defensive missiles, which would be a major shift for Trump. The package is likely to include long-range missiles that can strike deeply into Russian territory. His announcement tomorrow is going to be very aggressive,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said. The plan, to be revealed in the meeting between Rutte and Trump, will see European countries pay for U.S.-made weapons that will be delivered to Ukraine. It was proposed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky two weeks ago at the NATO summit. An official suggested Zelensky made a good argument. “Zelensky came like a normal human being, not crazy, and was dressed like a somebody that should be at NATO. He had a group of people with him that also seemed not crazy. The likely source of Trump's renewed vigor to defend Ukraine is his frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom he once prioritized relations with. Trump is angry with Putin's decision to press on with the conflict against Ukraine with little willingness to work toward a ceasefire, an objective Trump aspires to achieve in his presidency. In Putin's July 3 call with Trump, the Russian leader indicated he had little interest in de-escalation and was pressing forward with the war. He reportedly told French President Emmanuel Macron after the call that Putin wants to “take all” of Ukraine. Trump told reporters Sunday that he was sending Ukraine various weapons, including “pieces of very sophisticated” military equipment, such as Patriot air defense batteries. He said European countries “are going to pay us 100% for them. It is going to be business for us.” The president added that he was “disappointed” in Putin for seeking peace before waging an intensifying war. Zelensky said that, nevertheless, Russia has underperformed its expectations of the assault. “We see the enemy's intentions and attempts to advance, and it is important that each of these attempts is being thwarted thanks to the resilience of our units and active defense,” Zelensky said on Telegram. “The Russian army has fallen far short of its command's expectations for this summer.” We are preparing new long-range strikes,” Zelensky added.</p>

Flames from the Dragon Bravo Fire engulfed the lodge, visitor center, gas station, wastewater treatment plant, administrative offices, and employee housing, according to park Superintendent Ed Keable. The National Park Service (NPS) estimates between 50 and 80 structures were lost. Lightning sparked the Dragon Bravo Fire on July 4. Authorities initially managed the fire with a "confine and contain" strategy. A week later, amid scorching heat, low humidity, and high winds, officials shifted to full suppression as the growing blaze scorched 7.8 square miles.

John MacArthur, pastor of Grace Community Church (GCC) in Sun Valley, California, has reportedly been hospitalized with pneumonia following years of health complications. Pastor John MacArthur preaches at Grace Community Church in Los Angeles, California. Patton reportedly asked the congregation to pray for MacArthur, along with his wife, four children and fifteen grandchildren.

He was reportedly hospitalized earlier this year while undergoing a "second procedure" on his lungs, according to the outlet. "That procedure was successful, and (I) am now back at home," MacArthur previously said in a statement at the time, according to The Roys Report. "The doctors are optimistic about my recovery, and I am eager to return to you once I regain my strength."

MacArthur has led GCC's congregation for 56 years and is president of Grace to You, a nonprofit organization dedicated to distributing nearly 400 book titles authored by the pastor, according to the church's website. "We place our dear pastor at the feet of the glorious Savior," Patton was quoted as saying during Sunday's service. "Whom he has served so faithfully for so many years and now awaits His final command to be in his presence forever."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Repealing net neutrality regulations would end the internet as we know it. People would die if President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts were passed. From Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Democrats making alarmist, doomsday claims about Republican policies isn't exactly a new phenomenon. “The Yale Budget Lab estimates that it will kill, over 10 years, 100,000 people,” Summers said. “That is 2,000 days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend … in my 70 years, I've never been as embarrassed for my country on July Fourth.” “The Yale Budget Lab estimates that it will kill, over ten years, 100,000 people. That is two thousand days of death like we've seen in Texas this weekend…In my 70 years, I've never been as embarrassed for my country on July 4th” – former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers on… pic.twitter.com/T7z6JV7IDf That's right: The Republicans' modest Medicaid reforms, under which Medicaid spending will still massively increase over the next decade, are supposedly going to “kill” 100,000 people. Well, I tracked it back to a Washington Post op-ed in which a Yale lawyer specifically claims that the bill will cause an “uptick in the uninsured population [that] will translate to about 100,000 more avoidable deaths over the next decade.” Well, the author takes a Congressional Budget Office estimate that 10.8 million people will lose health insurance coverage as a result of the bill's provision and then extrapolates from that number using studies estimating a reduction in mortality correlated with Medicaid expansion. But this analysis is wrong on every level and flawed beyond belief. Well, for example, included in this figure are about 1.4 million illegal immigrants to whom states have extended Medicaid benefits. But the logic of Summers & co. suggests that by removing them from the Medicaid rolls, we are “killing” possibly thousands of them if they develop medical problems and do not receive taxpayer-funded healthcare. Many of these people will purchase insurance for themselves or receive it through employment after they lose Medicaid coverage. But the logic of Summers & his ilk suggests that the government cannot remove people from Medicaid who are ineligible under federal law for Medicaid without being morally responsible for thousands of murders. Again, that cannot be right, unless you believe that the U.S. government is murdering people every day by not giving every person in the country Medicaid. But when it comes to projecting insurance coverage changes resulting from shifts in federal policy … their track record is very poor. According to the Paragon Health Institute, CBO's past projections about the impact of policy changes on insurance coverage were between “10 and 20 times what actually resulted.” It's reasonable to expect that their current estimates are similarly inflated, making projections based on them wildly inflated, too. Yet even if the numbers losing Medicaid coverage are exactly as large as the CBO expects, this analysis still doesn't hold water. While insurance is surely a valuable financial tool, as the Paragon Health Institute's Liam Sigaud explains, “outside of a few vulnerable population subgroups (e.g., children), there is little evidence that insurance significantly improves the health of most people.” Meanwhile, some significant, high-quality research has found no mortality reduction caused by the expansion of health insurance access. So, given that Summers's analysis relies on a supposed reduction in mortality from insurance that does not appear to exist, the entire alarmist “people will die!” narrative is illegitimate. And the sad fact that so many people believe this fearmongering propaganda is a serious obstacle to preserving our financially unsustainable safety net — for the people who actually need it.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? They were already on the edge of extinction. It was June, and rainy, and I was searching for a glossy amphibian called the Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander. That makes them nearly invisible against the lichen-covered rocks they typically hide in. I had previously traveled here — to this very rock — in the spring of last year for a story about the salamanders of southern Appalachia. With somewhere around a hundred species, the region, and particularly western North Carolina, near Asheville, is a global salamander hot spot. It has a higher concentration of salamanders than anywhere else in the world. At the time of my 2024 visit, some of Appalachia's salamanders, including the Hickory Nut Gorge green, were already in trouble. These amphibious animals have an incredibly small range — they're found only in one valley, the Hickory Nut Gorge, southwest of Asheville. In 2021, North Carolina listed them as endangered and, in 2024, federal officials said protection under the Endangered Species Act may be warranted. The storm, which struck North Carolina in late September, killed dozens of people. But it also took a severe toll on the state's wildlife, the species that make southern Appalachia so unique. This sudden destruction of habitat — some areas look as though they've been clearcut — is pushing the region's most endangered species even closer to extinction. So this June, I came back to witness a rescue mission. Flooding from Helene uprooted the forest around one of the only known breeding populations of Hickory Nut Gorge green salamanders, which makes up a significant portion of the entire species. It's not clear whether they will survive without trees or withstand another severe weather event. Government forecasters have again predicted an above-average hurricane season this year and central North Carolina has already faced deadly flooding from the remnants of storm Chantal, which struck parts of the state earlier this month. In the long term, warming from climate change is expected to intensify both hurricanes and flooding. Now, to save this population of greens — and perhaps the entire species — scientists are working quickly to bring a number of them into captivity. It's a strategy that's increasingly common in a heavily altered world: To save animals from blinking out, scientists have to build backup populations and manage them under human care. If you're just passing through Asheville, it's hard to imagine that less than a year ago the city was hit by one of the worst natural disasters in state history. The River Arts District — which was under water just months ago — looks like any trendy area with busy restaurants and bars. But if you look more closely, signs of Helene's devastation start to appear. And in some areas the damage is impossible to miss. In a charming district called Biltmore Village, which abuts the Swannanoa River, only the skeletons of some buildings remain, their insides rotted out or washed away. Even against this backdrop, however, Hickory Nut Gorge still looks worse. You can only reach the gorge now on a temporary road that doesn't show up on Google Maps. Homes and inns are broken in half, still unrepaired. Downpours triggered mudslides, unearthing boulders and uprooting trees, ultimately leaving large chunks of the gorge deforested. That's bad for salamanders, and especially for the Hickory Nut Gorge green, said JJ Apodaca, executive director of the Amphibian and Reptile Conservancy, an environmental group. Greens are lungless — they breathe through their skin. But that bit of biological magic requires water, so it only works if their skin is moist. Plus, greens spend part of the year in trees, where they feed on insects like ants and beetles. And today, much of this habitat is treeless. According to the North Carolina Forest Service, the storm damaged more than a quarter of all forested areas in North Carolina counties that it passed through. One especially destructive blow is visible from the new road through the gorge: High up on the ravine, a large section of forest is missing, leveled by floodwaters or a mudslide. That bald spot is exactly where a population of breeding greens resides — and it's where this rescue mission has been taking place. Apodaca has a soft spot for the Hickory Nut Gorge green — he was part of the team that first described this animal as a new species in 2019. “They're just cool,” he told me, before explaining that they're visually striking, lungless, adapted to live in rock cracks, and skilled at climbing trees. It took us about 20 minutes to reach a large granite outcropping that Apodaca calls Party Rock, so named because it's where loads of greens normally hang out. This spring, once the gorge was accessible and he obtained permits, Apodaca began a rescue operation for the greens living in and around Party Rock. So far Apodaca has rescued 15 individuals, mostly from Party Rock, which he brought to the North Carolina Zoo. Apodaca has a permit to collect another 10 salamanders. According to Apodaca and Williams, 25 salamanders is enough to establish a breeding population, but not so many that it will further endanger the wild population. “The fact that we've pushed this species so close to the edge makes it really hard to sit back and do nothing once something like this happens,” Apodaca told me. “It's just to the point where we have to do something now or we're gonna lose a species.” Apodaca and I spent hours at Party Rock, staring into cracks with a flashlight. Every time my brain sensed movement I'd feel a jolt of adrenaline. But 10 times out of 10 it was a giant, leggy camel cricket. As the afternoon dragged on, we searched other boulders and explored some newly opened caves, which are good spots to find greens because they're cold and damp, Apodaca said. At one point I army crawled into a tight opening and when I looked up, careful not to ram my head against the ceiling, I saw a different salamander species staring back at me — a crevice salamander. I managed to cover myself in poison ivy. Apodaca was still 10 individuals short of his quota. It could be that we were too late in the season, Apodaca said. But another, more troubling explanation is that not many of the greens here survived the damage from Helene, and Apodaca has already captured most of those that did. “This site is probably gone,” Apodaca told me. For now, the captive population relies on just 15 greens — all but four of which are male. In a small windowless room at the North Carolina Zoo, several containers labeled with masking tape sat atop a folding table. They were made of thin plastic and shaped like circular cookie tins. Each container, though unremarkable, held something precious inside a bit of damp paper towel: a Hickory Nut Gorge green salamander. Their green splotches looked even more vibrant up close, like they had caught crossfire in a paintball match. And luckily, the four females they have in the collection were already pregnant when they were captured and each carrying a dozen or so eggs. Several black circles appeared on the screen: eggs. These animals live in a remote region, tucked away in crevices; they're hard to find even for the few people who know what to look for. Why then does it matter that we save them? Like any salamander, like any animal, the greens play an important role in their ecosystem, as both predator and prey. They help limit the number of insects, including those humans don't like. That's been shown to help keep carbon locked up in the forest that might otherwise contribute to climate change. It's not a stretch to say that without salamanders, forest ecosystems in southern Appalachia could collapse. And those are the ecosystems that provide water to towns and attract tourists that fuel the local economy. But more than that, Apodaca says, these salamanders simply have a right to exist. That's why he's fighting to protect them — why he's been hiking into a disaster zone week after week. “I can't make you care more than I can convince somebody that doesn't care about art that the Mona Lisa is priceless,” he said. “You either relish in nature and view the world that has a right to exist beyond us, or you don't.” The Endangered Species Act has a major problem. ﻿The wild reason why bird advocates are releasing these reviled insects from the sky. You may not know about it either, but the program helps keep people — and animals — in good health. What most of us get wrong about animal instincts.</p>

I have also seen both the immense potential — and frustrating inertia — that plagues public service. Consider this: of the world's 10 largest companies by market capitalization, a staggering eight are American founded. Entrenched legacy vendors have dug their claws in, and this has led to a general resistance to change. That rings true with actual warships and aircraft carriers, but it also applies to how government agencies resist adopting new tools that improve collaboration, efficiency and security. Instead, the U.S. government and its outdated procurement processes cling to existing technology platforms, such as Microsoft's suite of products that have been compromised time and again by China, which also happens to be one of the company's most significant business partners. Artificial Intelligence has enormous potential to remake and reform our government. Breaking the shackles of "vendor lock-in" — where the government becomes overly reliant on specific vendors even if they underperform — is crucial for fostering a new era of innovation that benefits America. When a company or product fails to perform well in the commercial sector, it's terminated immediately. In the public sector, the company is usually allowed to see out their multi-year contracts and when it's finally time to negotiate a renewal, all is forgotten. A more competitive public sector landscape, welcoming innovators and startups, can provide fresh perspectives, specialized solutions, and the speed to address rapidly evolving challenges. Other nations are adopting this model, attempting to gain an edge over America. For example, China launched a program in 2023, with 39 partners, including Alibaba Cloud and Baidu, to advance computing power and AI. Russia subsidizes companies implementing digital transformation; and Iran, despite sanctions, is investing significantly in AI research and building a sovereign AI ecosystem. Our adversaries recognize that commercial tools drive rapid progress and are actively breaking down barriers to catch up to American AI leadership. For years, Silicon Valley has been closely associated with the "move fast and break things" mantra, while the U.S. government has looked on with both envy (of the speed and efficiency) and concern (over potential impacts to its services). However, learning from the commercial mindset of agility and a relentless drive for improvement will help it to serve the American public better. Reduced waste, greater efficiency and better taxpayer value. Nowhere is this approach more critical than in national security. The threats America faces are constantly evolving and leveraging emerging technology to do so. Maintaining our edge requires more than just incremental improvements; it demands continuous access to cutting-edge capabilities. Leveraging the R&D engines of American commercial innovation — in areas like AI, cybersecurity, data analytics and resilient infrastructure — is not just advantageous; it's essential. If Washington fails to leverage this homegrown ingenuity, it does so at our national peril, especially as our adversaries work tirelessly to do just that. Other nations are adopting this model, attempting to gain an edge over America. For example, China launched a program in 2023, with 39 partners, including Alibaba Cloud and Baidu, to advance computing power and AI. Government agencies tasked with everything from defending the nation to delivering health services need to have immediate access to the latest advancements in AI and data analytics, and they can only do so by leveraging powerful commercial tools with a platform for continuous improvement — an asset for national security and public service. AI could be used to accelerate some of the government's most notorious backlogs, such as the millions of immigration court cases, the accumulation in environmental reviews for energy projects, and pileups in programs like Social Security or Veterans Affairs healthcare. AI can analyze data at lightning speed, helping federal agencies and their partners deliver on mission-critical work at an accelerated pace. The urgent need for a more agile, efficient, innovative and secure government is too significant to ignore. But as adversaries gain on America — or worse, overtake us — change is mandatory.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Joe Biden said in a new interview published on Sunday that he “consciously” made all of the clemency decisions during his presidency, a defense that comes as a House committee is probing the 46th president's use of an autopen for the controversial pardons and commutations. As his time in the Oval Office came to a close, Biden issued many last-minute pardons, most notably to his son Hunter Biden and other family members, Dr. Anthony Fauci, members of the Jan. 6 committee, former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, and a host of others. He also commuted the death sentences of 37 federal inmates, a move that was blasted by critics as an overreach of executive power. “I made every single one of those. And — including the categories, when we set this up to begin with. And so — but I understand why Trump would think that, because obviously, I guess, he doesn't focus much. Anyway, so — yes, I made every decision,” Biden said, according to excerpts from the call. Despite Biden's insistence, however, he also confirmed he did not approve each name for the pardons that applied to groups of people. Instead, he signed off on the standards he wanted to be used to determine which convicts would qualify for a reduction in sentence. Biden later revealed how that process worked, saying his aides would only read off the names of prominent figures, such as Milley. So the only things that really we read off names for were, for example, you know, was I, what was I going to do about, for example, Mark Milley?” Biden explained. The former president added, “I laid out a strategy how I want to go about these, dealing with pardons and commutations. And so, you know, that's just — this is how it worked.” In terms of the autopen, Biden confirmed its usage, saying it was necessary because “there were a lot” of clemency decisions — over 4,000 of them, according to the Pew Research Center. As you know, other presidents used it, including Trump. But the point is that, you know, we're talking about a whole lot of people,” Biden said. Biden's defense comes as the Oversight Committee is slated to hear more testimonies from Biden's senior staff over the next few weeks. A former aide to Jill Biden, Anthony Bernal, has also been subpoenaed after previously refusing to testify. The best thing they can do is try to change the focus and focus on something else.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three locations used by Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime as torture and execution sites 50 years ago have been added by UNESCO to its World Heritage List. UNESCO's World Heritage List lists sites considered important to humanity and includes the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Taj Mahal in India and Cambodia's Angkor archaeological complex. The three sites listed Friday include two notorious prisons and an execution site immortalized in a Hollywood film. Better known as S-21, about 15,000 people were imprisoned and tortured there. Choeung Ek, located about 15 kilometers (10 miles) south of the capital, was used as an execution site and mass grave. The Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975, and immediately herded almost all the city's residents into the countryside, where they were forced to toil in harsh conditions until 1979, when the regime was driven from power by an invasion from neighboring Vietnam. The tribunal cost $337 million over 16 years but convicted just three men. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet issued a message Friday directing people to beat drums simultaneously across the country Sunday morning to mark the UNESCO listing. “May this inscription serve as a lasting reminder that peace must always be defended,” Hun Manet said in a video message posted online. “From the darkest chapters of history, we can draw strength to build a better future for humanity.” Youk Chhang, executive director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia in Phnom Penh, said the country is “still grappling with the painful legacies of genocide, torture, and mass atrocity.” But naming the three sites to the UNESCO list will play a role in educating younger generations of Cambodians and others worldwide. “Though they were the landscape of violence, they too will and can contribute to heal the wounds inflicted during that era that have yet to heal,” he said. The UNESCO inscription was Cambodia's first nomination for a modern and non-classical archaeological site and is among the first in the world to be submitted as a site associated with recent conflict, Cambodia's Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts said in a statement Friday. Four Cambodian archaeological sites were previously inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites including Angkor, Preah Vihear, Sambo Prei Kuk and Koh Ker, the ministry said.</p>
