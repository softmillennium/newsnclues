                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meta announced on Monday that it will take additional measures to crack down on accounts sharing “unoriginal” content to Facebook, meaning those that repeatedly reuse someone else's text, photos, or videos. This year, Meta has already taken down around 10 million profiles that were impersonating large content creators, it said. The update from Meta follows only days after YouTube said it was also clarifying its policy around unoriginal content, including mass-produced and repetitive videos — things that have become easier to generate with the help of AI technology. Like YouTube, Meta says it won't penalize users who are engaging with other people's content, doing things like making reaction videos, joining a trend, or adding their own takes. Accounts that abuse the system by repeatedly reusing someone else's content will lose access to Facebook monetization programs for a period of time and see reduced distribution of their posts, the company said. A petition with nearly 30,000 signatures asks Meta to fix the issue with wrongfully disabled accounts and its lack of human support, which has users feeling abandoned and has hurt many small businesses. Meta has not yet publicly addressed the issue, despite attention from press and other high-profile creators. Meta's update seemingly only focuses on reused content, but its post suggests that it may be taking AI slop into consideration, too. In a section where the company offers “tips” for making original content, Meta notes that creators shouldn't just be “stitching together clips” or adding their watermark when using content from other sources, and they should focus on “authentic storytelling,” not short videos offering little value. In the post, Meta also warns creators not to reuse content from other apps or sources, which has been a longstanding rule. It also notes that video captions should be high quality, which could mean cutting down on the use of automated AI captions that aren't edited by the creator. Meta says these changes will roll out gradually over the months ahead, so Facebook creators have time to adjust. If creators think their content isn't being distributed, they can view the new post-level insights in Facebook's Professional Dashboard to see why. Creators will also be able to see if they're at risk of content recommendation or monetization penalties in the Support home screen from their Page or professional profile's main menu. In the last quarter, Meta said that 3% of its worldwide monthly active users on Facebook were fake accounts, and it had taken action on 1 billion fake accounts from January through March 2025. More recently, Meta has backed away from fact-checking content itself in favor of Community Notes in the U.S., similar to X, which allows users and contributors to determine if posts follow Meta's Community Standards and are accurate. She joined the company after having previously spent over three years at ReadWriteWeb.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The contract with each company has a ceiling of $200 million, and while it's not surprising that DoD is pushing hard into AI, the inclusion of Elon Musk's xAI will raise plenty of eyebrows after Grok's recent erratic behavior. The Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office (CDAO) announced the new contracts in a press release Monday, which notes DoD is “implementing a commercial-first approach to accelerating DoD adoption of AI.” “Establishing these partnerships will broaden DoD use of and experience in frontier AI capabilities and increase the ability of these companies to understand and address critical national security needs with the most advanced AI capabilities U.S. industry has to offer,” the press release explains. But xAI has been generating lots of attention lately that may give people both in and out of government some pause. Grok, xAI's chatbot, started randomly spouting right-wing conspiracy theories back in May about white farmers in South Africa being murdered for their race. The Grok public relations account on X noted the new contract with DoD in a tweet Monday but also introduced a new suite of products called Grok for Government and said its products would be listed on the General Services Administration (GSA) schedule, a huge win for the company that makes Grok available to federal government employees even beyond the Pentagon. “This allows every federal government department, agency, or office, to purchase xAI products,” the company wrote. “Under the umbrella of Grok For Government, we will be bringing all of our world-class AI tools to federal, local, state, and national security customers,” the company said in a press release. We are especially excited about two new partnerships for our US Government partners 1) a new contract from the US Department of Defense2) our… Musk held a livestream demonstration about Grok 4 on Wednesday of last week, just a day after the AI chatbot went full Nazi. Musk was recently a special government employee in the White House as the head of DOGE until he had a falling out with President Donald Trump. The Department of Defense under Secretary Pete Hegseth has been fixated on buzzwords like “warfighting” and “warfighters,” and adopting new AI tools is part of that mission, according to leaders at the agency. And Monday's press release was filled to the brim with similarly grandiose language. “The adoption of AI is transforming the Department's ability to support our warfighters and maintain strategic advantage over our adversaries,” said DoD Chief Digital and AI Officer Dr. Doug Matty. “Leveraging commercially available solutions into an integrated capabilities approach will accelerate the use of advanced AI as part of our Joint mission essential tasks in our warfighting domain as well as intelligence, business, and enterprise information systems.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The provision in Trump's landmark One Big Beautiful Bill does not say what those “offensive cyber operations” are, nor what specific tools or software would qualify. “The Trump administration has slashed funding for cybersecurity and government technology and left our country wide open to attack by foreign hackers,” Wyden said in an emailed statement to TechCrunch. “Vastly expanding U.S. government hacking is going to invite retaliation — not just against federal agencies, but also rural hospitals, local governments and private companies who don't stand a chance against nation-state hackers.” Offensive cyber operations can describe a wide range of targeted hacks against U.S. adversaries, which include the use of zero-day exploits — unknown flaws in software that give their operators the ability to hack into a target's device — or the deployment of spyware, which can be used to steal data from a person. But these operations can also include more everyday components needed to support those operations, such as setting up the infrastructure needed to carry out cyberattacks, intelligence gathering, such as collecting or buying internet traffic (known as “netflow”), and more.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>General Motors has just announced its latest and likely final piece in what now appears to be a three-pronged cell-chemistry strategy to power GM's lineup of a dozen EVs through the end of the decade and beyond. Conversion of cell lines to produce that chemistry will begin later this year. Under Kurt Kelty, GM vice president of battery, propulsion, and sustainability, the company has diversified from its previous strategy of “one cell for all EVs.” Kelty was hired in February 2024 after stints at Tesla and Panasonic, and is widely respected in the industry. The LFP cells made by Ultium are expected to be used in the updated 2026 Chevrolet Bolt EV, which GM should reveal within two to three months. It will go into production in a Kansas plant before the end this year. For its first two years, it will have to use LFP cells imported from another LG plant—potentially one in South Korea. Those imports let GM get inexpensive iron-phosphate batteries onto US roads a full three years before its next cell chemistry, called LMR, which it says costs no more than LFP, but has higher energy density. Thus far, all GM EVs after the 2017-2023 Chevrolet Bolt EV have used nickel-manganese-cobalt-aluminum (NMCA) cells. Those hold the most energy in a given volume, but are also priciest due to their nickel and cobalt content. Delays in production of the Ultium modules holding those cells pushed out deliveries of GM's EV lineup by 12 to 18 months, from late 2022 to early 2024. (GM EV sales have risen steadily for three quarters, suggesting those troubles might be in the past.) This May, Ultium announced a second cell chemistry, which it calls “lithium manganese-rich” or LMR. Those vehicles from Cadillac, Chevrolet, and GMC use gargantuan battery packs of 109 to 205 kilowatt-hours. The first LMR cells will come off a pilot line in 2027; full volume production is slated for 2028 at a plant Ultium hasn't disclosed. That applies, at least, to those produced outside China; the various models it builds in China have long included LFP chemistries, the dominant chemistry in that country. Much of the intellectual property around LFP chemistries is owned by Chinese firms, which has caused trouble for Ford as it tries to add LFP cells for future EV models. A GM spokesperson told WIRED that no intellectual property for the LFP cells it will produce with partner LG Energy Solution is owned by any Chinese entity. GM would not specify the cell format of its imminent LFP cells, nor would it comment on the module that will hold them. While North American car shoppers will experience the new LFP cells in future EVs from General Motors' Chevrolet brand, and possibly others, US production also benefits the other partner in Ultium. GM's cross-town rival Ford is also working toward getting its own LFP plant built and into production in Marshall, Michigan, through its Blue Oval battery unit. That plant, however, has faced opposition both from area residents and state and national politicians due to Ford's deal to license the intellectual property for the cells from the world's highest-volume EV cell maker, China's Contemporary Amperex Technology, or CATL. Ford too has said it would use LMR cells in future EVs “within this decade,” in a late April LinkedIn post from Charles Poon, its global director of electrified propulsion engineering, published.

These things will keep happening until it is no longer socially acceptable to advocate for the creation of data collection programs that are a necessary precondition. For any dataset you collect, think about how it can be miss-used. Clearly we all need to be thinking much more deeply on these issues. In many respects, the attitude of "we'll fix this one day" is exactly why we don't think deeply about these issues. Client-side scanning was proposed only a short while ago, and you can still read the insane amount of apologists on this site who think that unmitigated data collection can be a good thing if you trust the good Samaritan doing it: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28068741It will take an utter catastrophe before the deregulation bloc sees what's at stake.

People making parallels I feel have been inaccurate, as the parallels right now are much closer to Europe's 1933 happenings, and people act like 1945's happenings is what will happen the very next dayNot sure what to make of that, just noticing that these particular "resistances" didn't have a prior allegory to watch, and made these choices eventually, and still how late into the story we know that these things occurred Not sure what to make of that, just noticing that these particular "resistances" didn't have a prior allegory to watch, and made these choices eventually, and still how late into the story we know that these things occurred The root issue here is that the government is no longer able or willing to control and bind their own law enforcement agencies. Agreed that this program was a bad idea, but the wider issue that law enforcement agencies can and do wantonly disregard direct orders from the state. This needs to be met with swift repercussions for both the individuals that participated, as well as the agencies that allowed it. As an example, the Feds can round up marijuana users in California, if they like. They can't require California's law enforcement to help. As someone who works with sensitive healthcare data, I can tell you that the mere existence of a dataset doesn't guarantee its misuse, nor it does it absolve anyone who interacts with that data of responsibility for proper stewardship.Yes, you are right that we should think carefully before creating a sensitive dataset. If we insist on creating such a dataset, the people involved must put in place guardrails for stewardship of those datasets. But the stewards of that data, past, present, and future, also share responsibility.Of course if the incentive structures don't line up as is the case with law enforcement in the US, then all of that is out the window.Anyway, what you have written implies that we need not think about accountability for those who misuse of datasets after they are created, which is clearly absurd as I and anyone else familiar with healthcare data can tell you.

It generated a generational backlash against the left as petty crime and visible homelessness rose.To the extent police reform has historically worked, it's been by rebooting a police department. In San Francisco specifically, crime also increased due to police officers quietly going on strike against policies they disagreed with. Now that police officers are actually doing their jobs again, shockingly, crime is rapidly falling.What has actually increased is sensationalist coverage in the media, which you're right, has created a significant political backlash. If I recall correctly it was the DA refusing to prosecute just about anything. I moved here in 2013 and their non-enforcement practices were already legendary. Blaming Chesa for being in office for like 10 months in 2019-2020 is a hell of a cop out (pun intended).Even if it were true, it wouldn't in any way excuse the police for choosing not to do the job they're paid to do.

Defund the police was a marquee policy and messaging failure that underlined why radical minorities capturing the Democratic Party cause it to lose elections. What does that have to do with "defund the police"? Bail money doesn't go into their pockets. In New York they were one and the same. I remember dropping into a leftist conference in Philadelphia years ago where several folks who would become the face of post-Covid police reform were there, including Boudin. As a NY resident: lol.I don't doubt you'll find activists espousing both "defund the police" and "end cash bail" policies at the same time. That doesn't make them the same policy. I don't doubt you'll find activists espousing both "defund the police" and "end cash bail" policies at the same time. That doesn't make them the same policy. And they both generated a backlash, one against messaging (because it was too stupid to implement) and one against policy (because it created more visible crime). Police forces across the US have never seen higher funding rates. All the more reason to reduce their funding! As another commenter posted, its about not allowing the creation of the data set in the first place.We really need everyone in this country to go read "Nothing to Hide" by Daniel Solove, because thats how this crazy shit gets through in the first place: innocuous citizens go "Sure, I got nothing to hide" We really need everyone in this country to go read "Nothing to Hide" by Daniel Solove, because thats how this crazy shit gets through in the first place: innocuous citizens go "Sure, I got nothing to hide" Yes, this is an argument for not giving them more authority than necessary, but it's also an argument for holding them accountable when they do act out of bounds.To this point, any law that gives power to government officials also needs to have explicit and painful consequences for abuse of those powers. Civilians who break the law face punishment and penalties, but government employees are almost never held to account. Civilians who break the law face punishment and penalties, but government employees are almost never held to account. There are systems that are intended to hold these groups accountable, and we need to keep pressing until they do, because throwing up our hands and just saying "Boys will be boys" ain't cutting it. They can shoot and kill you for basically any reason. SCOTUS, even with more liberal justices, have repeatedly said they are shielded from 'official capacities', and that they have absolutely no requirement of protecting and serving. I'm genuinely curious for data on whether these data have been helpful with property crime in San Francisco and Oakland. One or two cops locked up for it can also work wonders. But somehow the western world has come to believe that lots of pretty laws with no consequences for transgressions is a wonderful thing. You have to prove they knowingly caused the harm. You have to quantify the harm in monetary terms. Then you can sue them for actual damages + attorneys' fees. While a minority of rabid Anarchists might agree with you, the vast majority of people in Denmark happen to really like our police force.This is largely an American problem. Don't blame it on "the western world". Don't blame it on "the western world". By breaking a different one?I mean, yeah, it's predictable. I could pour BILLIONS into social programs and we'll still have sociopaths ghost riding or sitting on their phones doing 45 in a 30 zone. These cameras have been the last line of defense. Sidenote: As per the article, this is already illegal and was a mis-step on the part of SFPD and CHP searching OPD's database (OPD didn't give ICE anything). Don't be angry at the people building them for good. I could go into my car right now and plow through a bunch of people. I'd make queries public with a short delay, including with a unique identifier for the cop initiating the query. This article is literally what would happen anyway if your pet policy was enacted. Hopefully that article would drive public opinion enough for change to happen.This is the system working. Won't that likely victimize people who are presumed innocent of crimes until convicted? I am angry because the same people who've argued for years against the kinds of education systems that teach actual social systemic thinking and who've called me naive and cynical for suggesting their pretty toy is going to get people killed are now throwing up their hands and saying "how could we have known? I think we lost sight of that in the last couple decades, or figured it wasn't our problem. And the chickens have come home to roost. It can also be used to curb-stomp someone to death.Can't we build the curb and forbid curb-stomping at the same time? Flock built a surveillance data repository with convenient sharing mechanisms. Someone then used those mechanisms as designed for their intended purpose. The cops - public servants, in theory - then blatantly violated that law. A populace with deep and wide skills can be a collective action threat.A bunch of dead eyed screen addicts are just Wall-E background characters.We'll end up manual workers for the rich through state violence (happening right now to Latinos to free up jobs).

There is something in common though: that very dangerous belief that lying and ignoring the law is justified by the end goal. Even their own statistics (https://www.ice.gov/statistics) show that a small minority have ever been convicted (and I would assume that most of those convictions would not be very serious crimes) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_PlanThe Holocaust involved quite a bit of large-scale deportation to concentration camps.https://www.theholocaustexplained.org/how-and-why/how/deport...> In the autumn of 1941, approximately 338,000 Jews remained in Greater Germany. Until this point, Hitler had been reluctant to deport Jews in the German Reich until the war was over because of a fear of resistance and retaliation from the German population. This pressure culminated in Hitler ordering the deportation of all Jews still in the Greater German Reich and Protectorate between 15-17 September 1941.

My local police department just recently got a grant for these and is in the process of setting them up, and I'm working with a number of local technologists and activists to shut it down. We are showing up at every police commission meeting and every city council meeting and keeping actively engaged with local press. I spent almost three hours yesterday having coffee with a police commissioner and I have meeting requests from a number of other local officials. There are similar efforts ongoing in other cities across the U.S.An interesting one to keep an eye on is Cedar Rapids, which includes a neat teardown of one of the devices: https://eyesoffcr.org/blog/blog-8.htmlImmediately after setting up the system -- before all of the devices were even fully online -- our local PD began sharing access with departments in non-sanctuary states.

The type of crime common here is nearly impossible to address without technological assistance. The criminals know this and are just incredibly brazen about it. They'll finish the job with people watching and recording because they know there's no way for them to be caught. People get followed home and held up in their driveway. One guy was killed a block from where I was standing for knocking on the window of a getaway car of some guys stealing another car in broad daylight.Leaving aside broader and more fundamental fixes for crime, which are much longer term projects, the only near-term thing that actually reduces this kind of crime is arrest and conviction rates. In SF, drones have helped reduced car break-ins, because they've actually caught some crews. Oakland doesn't have drones that I know of, but Flock cameras have enabled enough tracking for police to sometimes actually find these people quickly, even several miles away, and make an arrest.Those are just the plain facts of the situation. It's understandable that people want some kind of solution here. Without at least starting from that understanding, it'll be very difficult to convince people that a solution that is having a positive impact already is not worth the other costs and risks.And to me, this is the core conflict at a really high level: the economic and societal fixes for crime are usually opposed by the same people who abuse these kind of surveillance systems for authoritarian purposes.

Example: Alabama was the last state to remove its ban on interracial marriage from its statutes in 2000, though this was largely symbolic as interracial marriage was legalized nationwide by the Supreme Court's ruling in Loving v. Virginia in 1967.There is probably a specific federal law enforcement authority that may or may not be in conflict with the state law.

Programmers should have been able to read the privacy-destroying tea leaves a decade ago. Governments will collect all the data they are permitted to collect without a harsh public response, and they will always have a 'good' reason -- just ask them! The problem is these datasets exist at all, thereby reducing humans to numbers. There should be clear consent required  without coercion for any data collection -- a necessarily very high bar.Unauthorized collection of personal data (i.e. without explicit consent not tied to any benefit bait) should be a federal crime and the organizational leadership should always be held to account. Otherwise we are just always complaining after the fact and it will keep happening.That said, good luck getting any government in this world to go along without a revolution.

Actually it was worse than that - they helped people illegally cross the border, even flew them in on the taxpayer dime. This is why we have President Trump today. If you wanna do something about it then help turn the surveillance spotlight back at them: https://app.copdb.org/ Second, the page barely mentions ice, title is begging for clicks.> “We take privacy seriously… You cannot legally use it to rob a bank, though. But you can't buy one at Wal Mart, and be trusted to only pull that trigger in situations when the uses of that system are legal! We don't sell them to consumers because the anticipated and obvious outcomes are harmful.Flock Safety generated a treasure trove of highly sensitive data.

National Collegiate Athletic Association https://www.oyez.org/cases/2017/16-476 While the states obviously aren't fully sovereign, the federated structure of our country explicitly grants them limited sovereignty that is innate and not in any way derived or subject to the federal authority. Thus the ability of the federal government to commandeer state governments to its own ends is rather limited and needs to be explicitly spelled out (e.g. National Guard can be federalized, but State Defense Forces cannot). The law exists for a reason, I encourage you to imagine what that might be. South Dakota v. Dole held that things like the drinking age can only be tied to related items. Road maintenance in exchange for road rules passes muster, and interstate highways is about as "interstate commerce" as you can probably get.I'm not prepared to consider the Tenth extinct just yet. Things like drinking age work because the two parties largely agree on it. I'm not prepared to consider the Tenth extinct just yet.

If California was an independent nation, it would rank as the fourth largest economy in the world in nominal terms, behind Germany and ahead of Japan."

Just look how the cartel-affiliated MJ farm gets busted and the media calls it "strawberry pickers that put food on our table." That kind of media bias is scary and I don't understand how people overlook it. Yeah, I'd rather we not terrorize the nation and build a national goon squad with a larger budget than most national militaries. I'd rather that goon squad not be unidentifiable and masked. And if we're willing to spend $100+ billion on a law enforcement program, I'd rather it be increasing police wages and firing bad cops and hiring/properly training new cops.I'd rather not spend $100B on LEO at all, frankly.There are other ways to crack down on immigration than ramping up the surveillance and police state.edit: I am disappointed that the responder ignored the six points I made, all of which could be discussed, and instead went for a hollow whatabout.

The only way that could be a purer distillation of abstract whataboutism would be to remove the last lingering traces of specificity, yielding: "[They] do [it] too! Rather, other California police departments searched Oakland's system on behalf of federal counterparts more than 200 times — providing reasons such as “FBI investigation” for the searches — which appears to mirror a strategy first reported by 404 Media, in which federal agencies that don't have contracts with Flock turn to local police for backdoor access. Only in the most lawyer bullshit word gymnastics could you arrive at the conclusion there is nothing to see here. https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/2023-dle-06.pdf> Accordingly, SB 34 does not permit California LEAs to share ALPR information with private entities or out-of-state or federal agencies, including out-of-state and federal law enforcement agencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scaringe moved about 4 million in shares and 6 million in options to his ex-wife, Meagan Scaringe, on July 9 as part of the settlement, the filing shows. At Rivian's current stock price, those shares and options could be worth roughly $130 million, though they have varying strike prices that would affect the total return if sold. Scaringe owned more than 15 million shares of Class A stock and nearly 8 million Class B shares when the company submitted its annual proxy report April 29. In an official statement emailed to TechCrunch, a spokesperson said “RJ and Meagan finalized their divorce. The settlement comes at a pivotal time for Rivian. That vehicle won't go on sale until the first half of 2026. The ownership structure of Rivian has shifted since its IPO in 2021. At that time, Amazon and Ford were among the largest stakeholders. Today, Ford is essentially out and Volkswagen Group has emerged as a major player. In late 2024, Rivian entered into a joint venture valued at $5.8 billion with Volkswagen focused on software and electrical architecture. Rivian has provided technology and employees to the joint venture, while Volkswagen has largely contributed money in the form of share purchases and convertible debt. That's enough to give Amazon the most voting power of any single shareholder: 13.3%. (Ford and T. Rowe Price also used to be major shareholders after the IPO, but have since sold down their stakes.) But he had a 7.6% share of the voting power, thanks in part to the Class B stock, which comes with 10 votes per share. (Rivian's Class A stock only comes with 1 vote per share.) Unlike many high-profile tech founders, Scaringe never had a tremendous amount of voting power post-IPO. As those fully vest, his ownership stake and voting power could go back up. Records obtained from Orange County Superior Court show that he filed for divorce in October 2023, with his ex-wife agreeing to separate in another filing one month later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite various rumors and even an alleged leak, there was no “one more thing” teasing a tri-folding phone at Samsung's Unpacked event last week, where the tech company announced the impressively thin Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7 with an edge-to-edge cover screen, and two stylish Galaxy Watch 8 smartwatches. But the tri-fold phone is real and it's coming soon. Android Authority shared the below video and several images and animations, mined from the latest version of Samsung's One UI 8 software, showing off what it believes is Samsung's tri-fold phone. I'll have a review for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 on Gizmodo this week, but it's safe to say that Samsung has finally created the book-style foldable it set out to make in 2019. The Z Fold 7 is basically as thin and light as a Galaxy S25 Ultra and has the top-notch performance and cameras you'd expect from a flagship phone—features you can't cheap out on when you're asking $2,000 for the device. With the Z Fold now virtually perfect, it's the right time for Samsung to look at even bolder phone form factors. A tri-fold phone with two folds instead of one, which allows for an even larger tablet-sized screen when unfolded, would be a first for Samsung and play catch up to Huawei's Mate XT Ultimate. Like all of Huawei's phones, the Mate XT Ultimate is not available in the U.S. because of Chinese restrictions, which is a problem that Samsung wouldn't have. Huawei's Mate XT Ultimate carries a 3,499 euros starting price (roughly $4,000 at today's exchange rate). Releasing a tri-fold phone won't be without its own challenges. More folds gets you the biggest screen you can fold up into your pocket, but it also requires bigger and heavier batteries and thickness balloons with all the folds. Still, it's good to see Samsung hasn't lost all of its fight after giving in and making all of its bar-style phones essentially look like iPhone bricks. I'd love to see Samsung come back and wallop its competitors instead of phoning things in year in and year out. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A group of researchers has discovered a new attack called GPUHammer that can flip bits in the memory of NVIDIA GPUs, quietly corrupting AI models and causing serious damage, without ever touching the actual code or data input. Regardless, if you're using a card with GDDR6 memory, this is worth paying attention to It's not just theoretical either, as they ran it on a real NVIDIA RTX A6000, using a technique that repeatedly hammers memory cells until one nearby flips, messing with whatever's stored there. It's been around for a while in the world of CPUs and RAM. Until now, this was mostly a concern for DDR4 system memory, but GPUHammer proves it can happen on GDDR6 VRAM too, which is what powers many modern NVIDIA cards, especially in AI and workstation workloads. This is a serious cause for concern, at least in specific situations. The researchers showed that even with some safeguards in place, they could cause multiple bit flips across several memory banks. In one case, this completely broke a trained AI model, making it essentially useless. The scary part is that it doesn't require access to your data. As mentioned, the attack was tested on an RTX A6000, but the risk applies to a wide range of Ampere, Ada, Hopper, and Turing GPUs, especially those used in workstations and servers. However, if you're someone just sitting at home worried about their personal setup, this isn't the kind of attack you'd see targeting individual gamers or home PCs. It's more relevant to shared GPU environments like cloud gaming servers, AI training clusters, or VDI setups where multiple users run workloads on the same hardware. That being said, the core idea that memory on a GPU can be tampered with silently is something the entire industry needs to take seriously, especially as more games, apps, and services start leaning on AI. NVIDIA has responded with a simple but important recommendation: turn on ECC (Error Correction Code) if your GPU supports it. ECC is a feature that adds redundancy to memory so it can detect and fix errors like these bit flips. Keep in mind, enabling ECC does come with a small trade-off—around 10% slower performance for machine learning tasks, and about 6–6.5% less usable VRAM. But for serious AI work with peace of mind, that's worth it. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. Attacks like GPUHammer don't just crash systems or cause glitches. They tamper with the integrity of AI itself, affecting how models behave or make decisions. And because it all happens at the hardware level, these changes are nearly invisible unless you know exactly what to look for. In regulated industries like healthcare, finance, or autonomous driving, that could cause serious problems—wrong decisions, security failures, even legal consequences. As GPUs continue to evolve beyond gaming into AI, creative work, and productivity, so do the risks.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators. This fits in perfectly with that,” says Gopakumar Gopinathan, a senior advisor on power system technologies at the California Independent System Operator—known as the CAISO and pronounced KAI-so. But we haven't seen many examples of it being used in our industry.” At the DTECH Midwest utility industry summit in Minneapolis on July 15, CAISO is set to announce a deal to run a pilot program using new AI software called Genie, from the energy-services giant OATI. The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators and comes with the potential to autonomously make decisions about key functions on the grid, a switch that might resemble going from uniformed traffic officers to sensor-equipped stoplights. Today, CAISO engineers scan outage reports for keywords about maintenance that's planned or in the works, read through the notes, and then load each item into the grid software system to run calculations on how a downed line or transformer might affect power supply. “Even if it takes you less than a minute to scan one on average, when you amplify that over 200 or 300 outages, it adds up,” says Abhimanyu Thakur, OATI's vice president of platforms, visualization, and analytics. “Then different departments are doing it for their own respective keywords. If CAISO finds that Genie produces reliable, more efficient data analyses for managing outages, Gopinathan says, the operator may consider automating more functions on the grid. “After a few rounds of testing, I think we'll have an idea about what is the right time to call it successful or not,” he says. In Nebraska, a publicly owned utility deftly tackles the challenges of delivering on reliability, affordability, and sustainability. “These organizations are carved up for people working on very specific, specialized tasks and using their own proprietary tools that they've developed over time,” says Doying, now a vice president at the consultancy Grid Strategies. “To the extent that some of these new AI tools are able to draw from data across different areas of an organization and conduct more sophisticated analysis, that's only helpful for grid operators.” Last year, a Department of Energy report found that AI had potential to speed up studies on grid capacity and transmission, improve weather forecasting to help predict how much energy wind and solar plants would produce at a given time, and optimize planning for electric-vehicle charging networks. Another report by the energy department's Loan Programs Office concluded that adding more “advanced” technology such as sensors to various pieces of equipment will generate data that can enable AI to do much more over time. In April, the PJM Interconnection—the nation's largest grid system, spanning 13 states along the densely populated mid-Atlantic and Eastern Seaboard—took a big step toward embracing AI by inking a deal with Google to use its Tapestry software to improve regional planning and speed up grid connections for new power generators. Australia offers an example of what the future may look like. In New South Wales, where grid sensors and smart technology are more widely deployed, AI software rolled out in February is now predicting the production and flow of electricity from rooftop solar units across the state and automatically adjusting how much power from those panels can enter the grid. Until now, much of the discussion around AI and energy has focused on the electricity demands of AI data centers (check out MIT Technology Review's Power Hungry series for more on this). “We've been talking a lot about what the grid can do for AI and not nearly as much about what AI can do for the grid,” says Charles Hua, a coauthor of one of last year's Energy Department reports who now serves executive director of PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for improving the affordability and reliability of US grids. “Right now, this is more limited to our outage management system. Genie isn't talking to our other parts yet,” he says. The emissions from individual AI text, image, and video queries seem small—until you add up what the industry isn't tracking and consider where it's heading next. The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Tech giants are looking for more energy, but building new reactors takes time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There are frozen water molecules on comets, moons, exoplanets, and in your drink as you cool off from the summer heat. The internal structure of Earth's ice is a cosmological oddity. Its molecules are arranged in geometric structures, usually hexagons that repeat each other. Ice on Earth forms this way due to the temperature and pressure of the our planet: water here freezes slowly, and this allows its molecules to arrange themselves into crystals. But ice that forms in space is different because of the conditions—the water exists in a vacuum and is subject to extreme temperatures. Not fully understanding the dynamics of amorphous ice in space has knock-on effects. For instance, not knowing exactly how space water freezes makes it difficult to estimate the proportion of water in other solar systems. Researchers are therefore studying space ice to gain a better understanding of how frozen water behaves away from Earth. Ice samples from comets, asteroids, and other solar system debris would be helpful, but until these can be captured, scientists are trying to understand space ice with computer models and simulations of ice on Earth. The paper theorizes it is likely made up of structured fragments—crystallized regions, as on Earth, but only about 3 nanometers wide—surrounded by chaos. To reach this conclusion, the team first ran computer models of water molecules subjected to temperature changes at different rates, simulating the creation of ice in space. They then compared this with the results of lab experiments to produce actual amorphous ice. Water vapor was passed over an extremely cold slab to become ice, with no liquid state occurring in between, a process similar to what happens in a planetary system at birth. A partially amorphous material was produced, whose structure most closely matched a simulation from the models that comprised 20 percent crystalline material and 80 percent amorphous ice. Knowing the structure of space ice is important for interrogating the speculative idea of panspermia, a hypothesis that life on Earth originated through compounds or “seeds” of life arriving on our planet from space. If space ice is amorphous and of low density, then building blocks for life could potentially have been carried inside.
