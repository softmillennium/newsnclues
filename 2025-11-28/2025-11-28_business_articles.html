Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame has said some of the world's largest AI companies are exaggerating how long their Nvidia chips will last to pad their short-term profits. Now, one hedge fund boss has warned that those chips could make themselves obsolete. Greg Jensen, the co-chief investor of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, told the "In Good Company" podcast this week that the "depreciation schedule is probably going to be quite fast, and you hope it has to be in a sense." Jensen explained there's a "resource grab" in AI as companies compete for scarce land, energy, microchips, and scientists, and tech bosses are hoping AI itself can help. He resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence. Since then, he has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, closed his hedge fund to outside cash, launched a Substack to share his research, and disclosed he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and another AI darling, Palantir. Burry has taken aim at the AI giants for dragging out depreciation from around three years to six years or longer, pointing out that Nvidia is releasing new chips faster and faster, so the current generation will likely lose value more quickly. "The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes, as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in graphics chips with accelerating planned obsolescence," he wrote on Substack this week. Instead, Jensen said, Nvidia is scrambling to create its own ecosystem of buyers who won't develop their own chips, in an attempt to stop Alphabet from owning the entire AI "stack." "They're like Standard Oil in the Gilded Age, trying to create monopolistic control on things," Jensen said about Nvidia. Jensen also said the AI investment boom isn't a typical capital cycle, as bosses such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman believe they're in a race to develop a supreme intelligence, and are willing to spend whatever it takes to win.</p>

Stock futures trading was halted this morning after a data center "cooling issue" took down several Chicago Mercantile Exchange services. Individual stocks were still trading before the bell, while the CME said futures indexes and options trading would open fully at 8:30 a.m. But the three major indexes are still on pace to end November's trading month — which ends with today's closing bell — in the red. The Dow and S&P 500 are poised to snap six-month winning streaks, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to see its first negative month in eight. Black Friday was once considered the biggest in-person shopping day of the year, drawing huge crowds to stores in search of bargains. But while millions are still expected to partake in the occasion, it's not what it used to be. Alphabet has been a notable exception to the recent tech downturn. Shares of the Google parent have surged more than 13% this month as Wall Street sees the company as an AI leader. Alphabet began the month by announcing its latest tensor processing units, or TPUs, called Ironwood. Last week, the company launched its latest AI model, Gemini 3, which caught positive attention from Silicon Valley heavyweights. But experts told CNBC's Jennifer Elias that Alphabet's lead in the competitive AI market is marginal and could be hard to hold onto. CNBC's Morning Squawk recaps the biggest stories investors should know before the stock market opens, every weekday morning. Alibaba's AI-powered smart glasses went on sale yesterday. With its new wearable tech offering, the Chinese tech company is going up against major players — namely Meta, which unveiled its smart glasses with Ray Ban in September. Meanwhile, Counterpoint Research found Apple is poised to ship more smartphones than Samsung this year for the first time in 14 years. Apple is also poised to boast a larger market share, driven by strong iPhone 17 sales. American shoppers are increasingly looking to South Korea for their cosmetics. NielsenIQ found U.S. sales of so-called "K-beauty" products are slated to surge more than 37% this year to above $2 billion. Retailers ranging from beauty product hubs Ulta and Sephora to big-box chains Walmart and Costco are jumping on the trend. On top of that, Olive Young — aka the "Sephora of Seoul" — is opening its first U.S. store in Los Angeles next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan has returned safely to Abuja after being trapped in Guinea-Bissau during a sudden military takeover that disrupted the country's electoral process. Jonathan, who led the West African Elders Forum Observation Mission, arrived at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport late on Thursday, November 27, where supporters and senior government officials received him. Their work was still underway when soldiers seized power on Wednesday, suspended the vote, and shut the country's borders. Ministry spokesperson Kimiebi Ebienfa said, “Former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is very safe and out of Guinea-Bissau. The move has heightened regional concerns, given West Africa's recent wave of coups and political instability. In a statement, Ebienfa said the government “in the strongest possible terms, condemns this act of military insurrection which undermines the democratic progress, constitutional order, and stability not only of Guinea Bissau but of the entire West African sub region.” He added that the coup “represents a blatant violation” of ECOWAS principles that forbid unconstitutional changes of government. Nigeria called for the immediate restoration of constitutional rule, the safety of detainees, and respect for democratic institutions. The return of Jonathan offered relief in Abuja, although regional leaders are bracing for yet another diplomatic crisis in an already fragile neighbourhood.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Italian defense company Leonardo on Thursday unveiled plans for an AI-powered shield for cities and critical infrastructure, adding to Europe's push to ramp up sovereign defense capabilities amid rising geopolitical tensions. The system, dubbed the "Michelangelo Dome" in a nod to Israel's Iron Dome and U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for a "Golden Dome," will integrate multiple defense systems to detect and neutralize threats from sea to air including missile attacks and drone swarms. Leonardo's shares were marginally higher Thursday and is up around 77% since January, amid a year of steep rises for defense stocks across Europe as the region's governments have hiked defense spending. Leonardo's dome will be built on what CEO Roberto Cingolani called an "open architecture" system meaning it can operate alongside any country's defense systems. "In a world where threats evolve rapidly and become ever more complex — and where defending is costlier than attacking — defense must innovate, anticipate and embrace international cooperation," said Cingolani, during an event on Thursday evening. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC earlier on Thursday that the protocols to exchange data between countries and teams on the battlefield were still "still quite limited," adding it could take a decade to build out Europe's "digital battlefield." European governments have rapidly committed to increased defense spending as the U.S., a key ally for the bloc, has previously threatened to reduce financial support in the region. In May the EU announced a 150 billion euro ($173.5 million) programme to provide long-term loans to member states for defense procurement and industrial capacity. Leonardo's unveiling of its new dome system is part of a sector wide move from leading defense primes that's seeing them shift "investment from standalone hardware to integrated command architectures," Loredana Muharremi, equity analyst at Morningstar told CNBC. "Modern warfare is won by the network that can integrate every platform into one decision cycle," she said. Risks to Leonardo's dome system include execution delays and "dependency on European procurement cycles," Meghan Welch, managing director at Brown Gibbons Lang & Company told CNBC. European primes are also increasingly competing with an emerging class of defense tech startups in the region. German AI drone startup Helsing raised 600 million euros and doubled its valuation to 12 billion euros in June, the Financial Times reported. Quantum Systems, which also develops autonomous defense tech, announced Friday it has tripled its valuation to above 3 billion euros after a 180 million euro raise. We want to hear from you.

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Richard Detty, a 58-year-old ride-hailing driver for Uber and Lyft in Honolulu. Business Insider verified Detty's earnings through screenshots he provided of his payments. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. A Lyft spokesperson told Business Insider that "ensuring driver success is vital to our mission, and we're continually looking to increase driver pay in smart, deliberate ways." For example, the company has pledged that drivers will make at least 70% of the weekly rider fares after external fees, and has recently started paying drivers for the time they wait for a rider, starting after one minute. An Uber spokesperson said, "We're committed to policies that support flexible work and sustainable earnings without reducing opportunities or raising costs for riders." My main business is selling products from Hawaii, such as mochi crunch cookies, on Amazon. Tourism is a big industry here, and there are plenty of rides to take. I often drive between the airport, Waikiki, Pearl Harbor, and other places that tourists want to go. I feel safer driving here than on the mainland, where you never know who you're going to pick up. I can't tell you how many times I've picked up riders with wet bathing suits at the beach and had to dry out my seats before my next ride. When I was in college here in 1991, I drove a cab part-time two or three times a week. When I first started driving for the apps here, that same trip would've paid $18. I wouldn't mind some of these rates if Uber and Lyft provided me a car. But I'm now responsible for all the costs. I have to handle all my maintenance, and if my car breaks down, I'm out of luck. I've paid more than $4 a gallon for gas at Costco, and I've seen milk here for around $8 a gallon. The base rate for rideshare drivers needs to go up here. When I moved back to Hawaii eight years ago, Lyft and Uber advertised that drivers could make up to $35 an hour. That was very easy to do at the time. Now, they advertise that drivers make $27 an hour, yet if anything, the fares I've seen seem to have gone up in that time. For me, it's been one pay cut after another. In 2022, I worked full-time for Lyft and Uber. I did it for 10 months because I wanted to save money to invest in my Amazon business. I found that doing this full-time wasn't livable, so I went back to doing it as a side hustle. I think Uber and Lyft count on that: It seems like they want people to be part-time drivers. We need laws similar to those that gig workers in Minneapolis or Seattle have, which promise a minimum wage and provide other protections. I could make a decent living getting paid like that. That's close to double what I make. We need a pay rate that's fair. So many costs that have gone up. Do you have a story to share about Uber or other gig work?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has publicly called on its China unit to help restore supply chain operations, warning in an open letter that customers across industries are reporting "imminent production outages." Nexperia's Dutch unit said Thursday that its open letter followed "repeated attempts to establish direct communication through conventional channels" but did not have "any meaningful response." The letter marks the latest twist in a long-running saga that has threatened global automotive supply chains and stoked a bitter battle between Amsterdam and Beijing over technology transfer. "We welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment to facilitate the resumption of exports from Nexperia's Chinese facility and that of our subcontractors, enabling the continued flow of our products to global markets," Nexperia's Dutch unit said in the letter. "Nevertheless, customers across industries are still reporting imminent production stoppages. This situation cannot persist," they added. In a statement, Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's Chinese parent company, said on Friday that the Dutch unit's open letter contained "a large number of misleading and untrue allegations." "Combined with the recent series of actions by the Dutch government and Nexperia B.V., we believe their true intention is to buy time for Nexperia B.V. to construct a 'de-China-ized' supply chain and permanently strip Wingtech of its shareholder rights," Wingtech said. The chips are relatively low-tech and inexpensive but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. The situation began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia. Beijing responded by moving to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. In an apparent reprieve last week, however, the Dutch government said it had suspended its state intervention at Nexperia following talks with Chinese authorities. It was thought at the time that this could bring an end to the dispute and pave the way for a restoration of normal supply chains. Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said it remains unclear how long the situation will last. "The imposed measures to seize the Dutch Nexperia subsidiary have been lifted, but there are still talks ongoing about restoring the corporate structure and relation with parent company Wingtech," Luman told CNBC by email. "It's not only about supplies of finished chips, it's also about wafer supplies from Europe to the Chinese entity," Luman said, adding that companies including Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages. "In recent weeks, the German automotive industry has largely been able to keep production stable through intensive efforts," a VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email. "However, the disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts caused by political intervention have not been fundamentally resolved. ING's Luman said the Nexperia situation is somewhat comparable to China's rare earth export controls. And comparable to the rare earths, it's not fully transparent which buyer is able to qualify for which chip supplies," Luman said. — CNBC's Annika Kim Constantino contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading gradually resumed after coming to a standstill on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday, as a cooling issue at one of its data centers impacted traders across the globe. Stock futures and options trading reopened fully at 8:30 a.m. ET, with other services gradually being restored. Bonds and metals resumed trading after a pause, according to FactSet data, while individual stocks were still trading the premarket. "All CME Group markets are open and trading," a CME Group spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Earlier, representatives for CME Group had told CNBC markets were halted due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, adding that it may take some time for moves in the impacted contracts to be seen once the outage is resolved. ET, around 90 minutes after its subsidiary BrokerTec EU markets resumed trading. Earlier, a spokesperson for Dallas, Texas-headquartered CyrusOne told CNBC the company was actively responding to a cooling system issue at its CHI1 data center facility in the Chicago area, which had impacted customers including CME Group. "On November 27, our CHI1 facility experienced a chiller plant failure affecting multiple cooling units," they said in an email. "Our engineering teams, along with specialized mechanical contractors, are on-site working to restore full cooling capacity. We have successfully restarted several chillers at limited capacity and have deployed temporary cooling equipment to supplement our permanent systems." CyrusOne's representative said the firm was in direct contact with all affected customers, and its teams were "working around the clock to restore normal operations as quickly and safely as possible." "We apologize for any disruption this has caused and appreciate the patience of our customers as we work toward full resolution," they added. "It appears as though they are gradually starting to restore some operations," he said. "All told this could have been much worse." Emir Syazwan, a futures trader at Ninefold Trading Co. based in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, told CNBC on Friday that he had been on the phone to his broker "throughout the afternoon" local time as the CME outage dragged on. Whether it will create "lasting distortions" in markets depends on how fast the issue can be resolved, he added. "It's inconvenient, but it's not unprecedented, although this kind of event may materially alter market structure or price discovery," he said. "Current price action already reflects markets being affected: the markets have been relatively flat and trading in a very tight range since 26 November, Wednesday, around ~10 PM EST. Back in 2014, technical issues shut down some trading on the CME's Globex electronic system, impacting agricultural contracts. Last year, trading of equities, bonds and exchange-traded funds was also temporarily halted in Switzerland after stock exchange SIX had problems disseminating data. Syazwan's own trades have not been impacted, he told CNBC. — CNBC's Lisa Kailai Han and Matt Ward-Perkins contributed to this article.

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country. Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips. This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. "Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud  computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month. While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export. "We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers," JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. "We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned." Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip. Baidu's chip push comes as Chinese tech giants this month said they're seeing supply shortages. Tencent said this month that its 2025 capital expenditure would be lower than initially anticipated. "It is not a reflection of our change in AI strategy ... It is indeed a change in terms of the AI chip availability," Lau said. Part of this shortage has been driven by global demand and resulting bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain. But China's effective block of Nvidia chips has also reduced the supply. Chinese tech firms have tried to mitigate the shortage by using stockpiled chips, as well as trying to make their AI models more efficient to do more with the semiconductors they have. Meanwhile, China has its own challenges with manufacturing because its biggest chipmaker SMIC, is unable to compete on the scale and technology with leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That makes it hard for the China to manufacture enough domestic chips to fill the shortfall. Like their U.S. counterparts, Chinese tech companies have continually reported strong demand for AI. "We see that customer demand for AI is and remains very strong. In fact, we are not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand … in terms of the pace at which we can deploy new servers," Alibaba's Wu said this week. "Baidu's chip push is both a necessity and an opportunity. It's a necessity, because Chinese platforms can no longer assume a steady diet of US GPUs; opportunity, because there's now a semi‑captive, multi‑billion‑dollar domestic market for AI hardware that is compliant with both US export rules and Beijing's self‑reliance agenda," Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC. "If Baidu can ship competitive Kunlun generations on time, it doesn't just solve its own supply problem — it becomes a strategic supplier to the rest of China's AI industry."

The internet helped unknown writers turn blogging into a career. Now, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai believes vibe coding will similarly make new careers more accessible to non-tech workers. "It's making coding so much more enjoyable," Pichai said, as people can easily experiment with building apps and websites with no prior coding knowledge. From HR professionals to accountants, an increasing number of non-technical workers are using AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Replit to vibe-code their own apps. Pichai said vibe coding gives workers a leg up in being able to visualize ideas directly, even if they aren't proficient enough in coding to do so. "In the past, you would have described it," he said. In some cases, vibe coding can present opportunities within tech companies themselves. Meta's product managers have been vibe-coding prototype apps and showing them to Mark Zuckerberg. At Google, Pichai said there's been a "sharp increase" in people submitting their first CLs, or changelists — code changes that address specific features or bugs. As the vibe coding market grows at breakneck speed, there are some potential risks to handing over the act of coding to AI. "I can't wait to see what other people in the world come up with it."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you're lucky enough to be up for renewal on your phone plan, Black Friday is the perfect time to do it. Both major cell service providers and smaller MVNOs are dropping their prices to commemorate the holiday, making it the perfect time to lock in a great rate. T-Mobile's Black Friday deal is one of them, giving shoppers a chance to get free iPhones, Samsung Galaxy devices, and more. Although T-Mobile's sale was previously limited to bulk plan purchases earlier this month, newcomers can now get a free Apple or Samsung bundle with eligible trade-ins on an Experience Beyond Plan during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Luckily, the condition doesn't matter to them, so long as you have a qualifying device. If you happen to be shopping for new phones across your family, or just prefer a different promotion, you can also kick off T-Mobile's other Black Friday deals by heading to their appropriate landing pages. T-Mobile's Black Friday bundle deals are an excellent way to upgrade your entire suite of devices, featuring the latest Apple and Samsung phone, tablet, and smartwatch technology in the promotion. The brand's Experience Beyond plan also offers the most bells and whistles for top-tier support, including unlimited mobile hot spot, unlimited data, and free streaming service subscriptions to Apple TV Plus, Hulu, and Netflix Standard. If you've never dabbled in this type of deal, it means that you'll still be billed monthly for the devices, but you'll receive the same amount as credit off your phone bill. It locks you into T-Mobile service for two years, but at least you'll have a complete setup of great tech. For more early holiday savings, check out our Black Friday deals coverage.
