                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Although the road so far has been a bit bumpy following Netflix's recent reveal that the hit CW series of yesteryear would soon take its leave from the streamer, we're officially back in business thanks to Prime Video. As part of the platform's upcoming December releases, the Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki-led fan-favorite series will join its extensive catalogue, giving subscribers a new shot at watching all 15 seasons. This news will come as a deep sigh of relief to anyone who considers Supernatural to be their comfort show, as with its Netflix departure, it was looking like there would be no way to stream the entire series. But, now it will just live where other projects from the show's creator, Eric Kripke, have found a home, like The Boys and its hit spin-off Gen V. Over nearly two decades, audiences tagged along with paranormal investigators Dean (Ackles) and Sam Winchester (Padalecki) on their journey to hunt as many of hell's baddies as possible. Along with the two brothers, a slew of other memorable characters helped make the show the fan-favorite that it became, thanks to performances from Misha Collins, Jim Beaver, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Mark Sheppard, Ruth Connell, DJ Qualls, Felicia Day, and more. While there may not be any immediate plans to bring Supernatural back to a TV screen near you, a new graphic novel continues the Winchesters' travels and rounds out parts of the story that never made the series. Additionally, Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins will all join forces in the upcoming fifth and final season of Kripke's series, The Boys, during which Ackles will reprise his role as Soldier Boy from the show's third season. As of right now, further details about what eccentric and larger-than-life personalities Padalecki and Collins will take on are being kept under wraps, but, with Season 5 expected to arrive next year, we'll be keeping our eyes out for any further information. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>During his first official foreign trip, Pope Leo on Friday toured the remains of an ancient basilica submerged in Lake Iznik, believed to be the site where the Council of Nicaea convened in 325 CE. A map circulated widely on the social media platform X on Thursday showed western Turkey annexed by Greece and Istanbul portrayed as an “independent ecumenicity”, a reference to the ecumenical patriarchate based in the city. “Turkey is being squeezed into a triangle,” one user wrote while sharing the map in Greek. The Pope arrived in Ankara on Thursday and was welcomed with a military guard of honor, as he is also the Vatican's head of state. Türkiye, Heybeliada Ruhban Okulu- Kanal İstanbul - Ekümeniklik üçgeni arasına sıkıştırılmak isteniyor. Papanın ziyaretini ve Rum Patrikanesi faaliyetlerini bu bağlamda değerlendirin.2022'de Yunan haber organlarından Pentapostagma'nın paylaştığı harita...Mesele gayet açıktır. “This is utterly disgraceful,” said Gokhan Avci, a retired Turkish military officer in a post that is now not accessible. “Did Iznik become the Vatican without us knowing?” asked Sabahat Akkiraz, a popular left-leaning folk singer. Former Turkish Admiral Cihat Yayci, known for his Eurasianist views, took the criticism further. “The Pope's arrival in Iznik on November 28 is no coincidence. Journalist Erdem Atay, another prominent secularist-nationalist voice, also claimed that the visit could lead Christians to demand land from Turkey. What will you give - Heybeli Island, Imbros, or Tenedos? “They're coming to form a Crusader front, an invasion attempt!” Both Yayci and Atay claimed that similar “Vatican demands” had been rejected by Ottoman sultans and later by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey. A Turkish official familiar with Vatican affairs dismissed those claims, noting that the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been formally divided since the Great Schism of 1054. “Before that, no Pope had ever met with the Patriarch of Istanbul.” Selcuk Erenerol, spokesperson for the Turkish Orthodox Church, said Pope Leo should not be allowed to use the title “ecumenical”. “Even Turkish Christians see the danger and are objecting,” he claimed. “The Pope organising a ceremony in his capacity as a head of state in Istanbul and Iznik goes against the principle of secularism enshrined in our constitution,” added Cemil Kilinc, a nationalist theologian. Some see it as an opportunity to present Turkey as a country where the world's oldest churches can freely operate and commemorate their shared heritage. Others worry about the backlash fuelled by conspiracy theories spreading online among both nationalist and some conservative groups. US Vice President JD Vance had planned to join the Pope's visit but cancelled at the last minute, a move that eased concerns among Turkish officials, who feared his participation would fuel even more speculation. Only England and Wales jurisdiction apply in all legal matters.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A joint study between the Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, Georgia) and the Goddard Space Flight Center at NASA (Greenbelt, Maryland) analyzed a suite of meteoritic and terrestrial samples and systematically compared the molecular distribution of their organic contents using 2D gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (⁠⁠GC x GC-HR-TOF-MS). Hypothesizing that meteorite samples can be distinguished from terrestrial rocks by differences in the distributions of their organic compounds, this research led to a paper published in PNAS Nexus (1). Future sample return missions—such as NASA's Mars Sample Return (MSR) and JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX)—aim to bring samples from the Martian system back to Earth, including material from environments that may once have harbored life. Included in these samples will be carbonaceous chondrites, which are a primitive and organically rich class of meteorites that represent the oldest solid materials in the Solar System obtainable for scientific analysis. The soluble organic compounds contained in these meteorites provide evidence of abiotic chemical reactions which existed before the beginning of life as we know it (5-7). “Determining whether organic molecules in planetary samples originate from biological or nonbiological processes,” the authors wrote in their article, “is central to the search for life beyond Earth. To deconvolute the resulting large dataset which resulted from their analysis, the team developed LifeTracer, a computational framework for processing and downstream machine learning (ML) analysis of mass spectrometry data. LifeTracer identified an unbiased set of discriminative features across sample types, which enabled classification based on their organic distributions, without relying on the presence or absence of known biosignatures. However, scientists cannot rely on single organic molecules to determine whether extraterrestrial organics come from life or non-life, as many of these compounds appear in both. Therefore, overall molecular patterns are compared, which can act as biosignatures. As Martian samples already contain complex mixtures from multiple sources, advanced multivariate tools like LifeTracer—supported by machine learning and expert analysis—will be crucial for assessing whether any patterns resemble known biological or abiotic signatures, especially as Mars sample return missions progress (1).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is tipped to replace his struggling successor, Arne Slot Speculation that Arne Slot is on the cusp of the Liverpool sack is starting to reach fever pitch in the wake of two sources explaining why a dramatic return to Anfield for Jurgen Klopp is ON – but it seems they only want the legendary coach back in an interim capacity with a major move planned for a Champions League-winning coach as a long-term successor. The 2025/26 campaign could not have gone much worse for Slot, having overseen nine defeats in his last 12 games. Their current run of form is the worst seen in 71 years at Anfield; little wonder that speculation that Slot faces the sack is gathering pace. And with journalist Marcel Reif, writing in BILD, claiming that Klopp is ‘hovering over Anfield like a UFO' in relation to his recent admission that a Liverpool return is possible on the Diary of a CEO podcast, talk of the 58-year-old's return to the club is starting to gather serious pace… 🔴 Liverpool fans unanimously pick next boss as Carragher drops Klopp bombshell when discussing Slot All of Liverpool would carry him back on their shoulders. And it would be negligent if they didn't try to bring Klopp back. I don't know what it's like being Global Head of Soccer and whether you ever start to wonder, ‘Is this really me?' Bayern Munich's honorary president Uli Hoeness recently claimed Klopp will soon return to management and does not see him staying i his role as Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull in the long term. “And I don't think that will be a good model in the long run. With Klopp seemingly only seen as a temporary solution at Liverpool, The Sun claims that FSG have ambitiously set their sights on appointing PSG coach Luis Enrique as the long-term successor. That swashbuckling style of football dazzled Slot and was thought to be hugely influential as he set about his own summer transfer business, recruiting not just a new-look frontline, but in adding a pair of attack-minded full-backs to his mix. Ultimately, though, that gamble has backfired, and Slot now presides over an almost intolerable situation that sees his position at Anfield hanging by a thread. Elsewhere, another report claims FSG have drawn up a three-man shortlist of potential successors, two of whom are currently impressing in the Premier League and another who has been making waves in Germany. Meanwhile, Slot has been told in no uncertain terms that he needs to immediately drop two underperforming players if he is to have any hope of keeping his job. With the Dutchman now under intense pressure, our writers have debated his future at Anfield and having answered the question ‘ will Slot still be in charge of Liverpool by Christmas?‘ On the transfer front, Liverpool have a confirmed and genuine interest in signing Antoine Semenyo, though a transfer insider now firmly believes any move to bring the player to Anfield may be frozen until the summer amid a big concern aired by Slot. Sunderland manager Regis Le Bris is understood to be keen on a reunion with the 26-year-old, but Newcastle and Aston Villa are also interested in a January deal</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A secretive Fort Bragg operation that specializes in influencing people's thoughts has released a hypnotic recruitment video that is laced with hidden meanings and strange images. The 1:17-second clip, posted Nov. 19 on social media, is a string of baffling clips, including old cartoons, masked figures hiding in plain sight and a group of people staring blankly at the viewer over the phrase: “We are everywhere.” “There is another force applied in combat that we generally don't think of as a weapon of war. That weapon is words,” the video says. As of Nov. 26, the video has racked up more than 15,000 views on Facebook and hundreds of comments and reactions, many noting it “goes hard” with subliminal messages. At one point, the phrase “anything we touch is a weapon” flashes and fades. Great little nuggets of information for us,” Nidia Law posted on Facebook. “A lot of crumb drops in this one,” TheJason wrote on Instagram. “I think y'all have so much fun at work! Would love to be on the other side of this ‘fog show',” Leigh Eschew said on Instagram. The U.S. Army noted in a 2024 article that the ideal candidate for psychological operations is “very cerebral and analytical,” which means different types of recruitment methods are required. The group's recruitment videos are infrequent and tend to cause a stir due to the unusual content. “The art of PSYOP relies on persuasion rather than physical force. The tools of the trade are logic, fear, desire and other mental factors used to evoke specific emotions, attitudes and behaviors,” according to a U.S. Army report. It is based out of Fort Bragg – one of the largest military complexes in the world – and home of the 82nd Airborne and U.S. Army Special Operations Command. 1st Anon Psyops Division Ghost Army 2nd Civilian Psyops with PepeThis is almost like it is a message to all the Anons out there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links." Supernatural movies are a category all their own. They can be comedies, thrillers, horror flicks, or even romances. What sets them apart from other out-there genres—say, fantasy or sci-fi—is simple: the otherworldly element arrives in our world. Fantasy often builds entirely new worlds; sci-fi takes us into the future or outer space. Supernatural films, by contrast, bring the unexplainable into ordinary life. Culturally, these movies endure because they tap into a general curiosity about what's lurking beyond our grasp. They entertain, yes, but they also remind us that the universe is bigger, stranger, and far less orderly than we pretend. Ash Williams fights for survival as objects animate, limbs are possessed, and the woods themselves seem alive. Sam Raimi's low-budget creativity turns gore into spectacle, balancing horror with absurdity. The film's legacy is manic and chaotic. In suburban California, the Freeling family's new home comes with unexpected roommates: ghosts. Phones ring by themselves, furniture levitates, and the youngest daughter disappears into another dimension. Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg blend family drama with supernatural dread, creating a haunting domestic horror.</p>

One day, her mom called and asked if she was interested in seeing a psychic. They had pre-booked five spaces, but one of the friends was unable to make it. The following night, she went to her mom's house. When it was her turn, she started chatting with the psychic but tried not to give too much information about herself. But then, the psychic said that there was a third child. She was quite far along and had to be rushed into lifesaving surgery. Ashlin thought the psychic might be referring to this baby. The psychic asked if she knew someone named Jack, but Ashlin did not. Sign up for Chip Chick's newsletter and get stories like this delivered to your inbox. Ashlin rushed over immediately, thinking her mom was having health issues. That's when their dad revealed he had a son. Later, when Ashlin asked her mom how the topic had even come up, she told her that it was all because of the psychic. She brought up what the psychic said to Ashlin during dinner with the family, causing Ashlin's dad to look like he had seen a ghost. Ashlin's dad didn't believe the psychic story and thought one of his work colleagues snitched on him. Ashlin doesn't know if the psychic's powers were actually real, but she believes this was all meant to happen; otherwise, they wouldn't have found out about the secret family until her father had gone to his grave.
