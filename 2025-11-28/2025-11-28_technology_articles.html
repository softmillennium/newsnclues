                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There's a lot of shopping you can do this weekend, but these Black Friday vacuum cleaner deals are ones you shouldn't skip if you need any kind of cleaning upgrade. Changing to a stick vacuum hugely improved my life after moving to a three-story home, but all kinds of vacuum types can turn your life around. Never have time to vacuum or mop? Over lugging your upright vacuum around the house? Trust me, a good stick vacuum is worth investing in. Here are all of our favorite vacuum cleaner Black Friday deals we've spotted so far. If you're shopping for more deals, don't miss our stories on the Best Black Friday Deals, Best Apple Black Friday Deals, Best Amazon Device Black Friday Deals, and our Black Friday liveblog, where you can find us blogging all weekend long about our favorite deals we see. This is last season's robot vacuum, and it's at a better price while still packing plenty of features we like to see. Shopping for an older model is WIRED reviewer Adrienne So's advice to get a good robot vacuum without paying four figures. The X10 Pro Omni's mop has downward pressure to actually scrub floors, and it packs a self-emptying bin and a good camera navigation system. If you're looking for more of a deal, our favorite basic and affordable vacuum is even cheaper than usual right now. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So was impressed by the offerings of this little robot. It has powerful suction for the price and good navigation, and it does come with a little charging base that works better than our last basic pick. If you're looking for a good but affordable stick vacuum, the PowerClean FurFinder is my top pick in our guide to the Best Cordless Vacuums. I'm a stick vac fanatic after moving to a three-story townhouse (never let another upright grace my closets or stairs, please), and this one has everything I want: Nice power! Looking for a stick vacuum and mop in one? Dyson's V15 is our favorite overall of the Dyson lineup, but you can get the Submarine version to add onto a mop head. If you're looking for something really powerful for pet hair, the Gen5 Detect is Dyson's current top-of-the-line stick vacuum (though new ones are due out next year) and our top pick for a pet hair vacuum. It does an impressive job, and it always pulls up more cat hair than I expected to be there for how often I try to vacuum. It has spots on it to hold its two accessories, so you don't have to keep track of those separately. It's designed with vehicles in mind, if you can't tell by the name, but you should be able to use this anywhere you'd want to use a handheld vacuum, from stairs to indoor couch cushions to your vehicles. It's an affordable way to get into the Dyson ecosystem, and a good add-on if you don't need an entirely new vacuum. Power up with unlimited access to WIRED.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After what's felt like years of waiting, hoping, and speculating, earlier this year, Lego finally confirmed it would be boldly going forward with a Star Trek set that has become the centerpiece of the brick-maker's annual Thanksgiving celebrations. Lego's first foray into Star Trek, the Enterprise-D from The Next Generation, is a fascinating tribute to the legendary series while also being an extremely compelling build experience for diehard Lego fans, packed with fun techniques to maintain Star Trek‘s famously smooth-lined starship design in the world of Lego. io9 recently received a review copy of the Enterprise from Lego, so we're here to take you inside and see what makes it so good—and why we hope it means it's the first of many. Clocking in at 3,600 pieces, the Lego Enterprise-D is a pretty sizeable model, resulting in a replica of the Galaxy-class starship and a sturdy display stand to pose it mid-flight on that measures around 23.5″ from fore to aft and 10.5″ tall (aided by the fact the ship is held at an upwards angle on its stand). Given the nature of the Enterprise-D's design, once you get going, there are a lot of similar techniques repeated over and over again, so if you're a familiar builder, you can go pretty quickly and even duplicate some steps to speed up the process. Overall, though, if you're taking things leisurely, you can be done in 9-10 hours… or around 12 episodes of Deep Space Nine, if you're like me and like to put something on while you're building (sorry TNG fans, but I'd recently just restarted a rewatch and decided to continue that rather than put on a more thematically appropriate bit of background noise! Even though the focus of the set is the ship replica rather than a playset environment, it would be a crime if Lego's first Trek set didn't go all in on minifigures. Thankfully, the Enterprise-D comes with nine minifigures to faithfully recreate the bridge crew you know and love: Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf, La Forge, Data, Dr. Crusher, and Wesley Crusher in his famous jumper. Joining them to round out the set is a welcome but slightly oddball choice in Guinan, hostess of the Enterprise lounge Ten Forward, but she, like Wesley, breaks up the sea of similar Starfleet uniforms with some lovely unique elements to recreate her fashionable wardrobe. Each minifigure comes with an accessory, some more unique than others, even if they're all appropriate. Picard naturally comes with a teacup, Guinan has a green bottle of something from Ten Forward (it's never explicitly noted what it is, but it seems like a nod to the Aldebaran whiskey Data offers Scotty in “Relics”), Data gets Spot the cat, and Geordi comes with an engineering kit. Perhaps the least interesting ones are ironically the most typically Star Trek: Worf gets a handheld phaser, which is cleverly constructed with a wedge piece and a handle, at least, while Deanna and Beverly get a PADD and medical tricorder… both of which are just printed 1×2 tiles. Which are fine and probably the best Lego could do at minifigure scale, but just kind of boring. Building a Lego model out of a ship like the Enterprise-D is a risky endeavor, given its peculiar shaping and weight distribution, on top of the fact that, well, it's mostly grey. But Lego puts a lot of interesting techniques in throughout the build to not only effectively capture the curvature and shaping of the Galaxy-class but also to keep your fingers busy and not have things blur into a long series of similar patterns being used to build similar-looking, similar-colored pieces. While the repeating can be a bit, well, repetitive, there are enough interesting techniques used for experienced builders and enough simple patterning for Trek fans who might be embarking on their first-ever Lego build of this scale. Even as someone who is on the record on the D being far from my favorite Enterprise design, I couldn't help but be charmed at just how well Lego managed to bring it faithfully to life. Alas, this is going to be the sticking point for a lot of Star Trek fans. At $400, the Enterprise-D may not be quite so eye-watering as some of Lego's other recent set prices, but it's still a big ask, and especially difficult considering it's the first time (and potentially last) the company has tackled Star Trek. You're definitely getting something that feels worth the price in terms of size and scope, but it's not hard to wonder if Lego should've started out at a smaller scale or with different ideas beyond ship replicas to test the waters and see if Star Trek could become just as enduring a Lego series as Star Wars has, if the alternative was a very pricey one-off. It's undeniable that as a build experience and as a replica of one of the series' most famous starships, the Enterprise-D is a Star Trek and Lego fan's dream: it looks great, it's a fun, big build, and it's got a great collection of minifigures that feels complete in the way that, if this is it, at least you got everything you'd want. But it's equally undeniable that a lot of Star Trek fans and a lot of Lego fans are going to be put off by Lego's decision to go big as it did here to justify asking such a high price, in an age where the company's products feel like they're only getting pricier and pricier. There's a lot more value in the Enterprise-D compared to some of 2025's other big-ticket sets, sure, but $400 is still $400. If there was some kind of indication from Lego that this wouldn't be it and that there would be more, smaller-scoped sets, it might be an easier pill to swallow, knowing Trek fans can wait and see what else the company does if they don't want to throw down this much cash in one go. Even as great a set as it is, it's a tough sell to anyone but some of the most diehard Star Trek fans without some Ferengi-level justification to your wallet. Check out when to expect the latest Marvel, Star Wars, and Star Trek releases, what's next for the DC Universe on film and TV, and everything you need to know about the future of Doctor Who. Jackson Lanzing, Collin Kelly, and Heather Antos sit down with io9 to talk about bringing Captain Kirk back from the grave, and more, in 'The Last Starship'. 'Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves' duo Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley's film is the latest in a long line of 'Star Trek' movie projects. Just in time for next Black History Month, 'Star Trek' is doing another what-if comic that takes Uhura back to the Civil Rights Movement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>GeekWire chronicles the Pacific Northwest startup scene. Less than five minutes after meeting with Todd Humphrey at a Seattle coffee shop, the longtime tech exec is already sizing up the customer. He quickly assesses how coffee drinkers interact with each other and their technology devices, and wonders why they've come to this particular location. Humphrey has spent decades focused on using technology to enhance the customer experience  — from his early days at Kobo working on e-reader services, co-founding healthcare startup League, a CEO stint at project management company LiquidPlanner, and more recently as an exec with the Seattle Kraken, where he was senior vice president of innovation and fan experience. Humphrey left the NHL franchise earlier this year to embark on a new adventure: Highmark Sports Group, his own consultancy aimed at helping sports teams, leagues, and companies boost their operations. He's a senior advisor for the Seattle Torrent, the new women's pro hockey team that plays its first-ever home game tonight at Climate Pledge Arena. He's also working with the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. We recently caught up with Humphrey to learn more about his approach to helping organizations improve their customer experiences and how to balance new technologies like artificial intelligence with essential human touches. The interview was edited for clarity and brevity. GeekWire: Todd, thanks for speaking with us. How are you thinking about technology and the customer experience in 2025? You'd show up, you'd walk in, it would smell like stale beer and popcorn, and there'd be peanuts on the floor. The in-venue fan experience has totally been revamped. Technology plays a huge part of that. Once they walk through the doors, you're thinking about lines. There's a huge opportunity for other teams and organizations to really rethink their experience. It's when you go to a concert, when you go to the Hockey Hall of Fame — what does that feel like? How do we turn it into a more of a holistic, overall experience beyond the time you spend in the building?” GeekWire: How do you thread the needle of incorporating technology and automation — but also focusing on the human elements of an experience? At the same time, I don't want to see teams and leagues and companies get too hung up on the tech, because I think little things like the human interactions matter. If those interactions are awesome, your event is off to a really good start. I think that training the people who work there to greet people and engage with people and look them in the eye and get to know who they are — it's a huge advantage. Sometimes it doesn't work as well. And I'd miss that interaction with the cashiers. They've seen my kids grow up over the years. There's a lot to be said for that. As much as technology is awesome and ChatGPT tells us all the answers, people still like human interaction. And when I see an usher at Climate Pledge Arena high-fiving a Kraken fan during a celebration, it just warms my heart, because that's what it's all about. But on the other side of that, because there's so much bent toward technology, I think live events, concerts, games, theater — all the places where people can gather are going to be more important. GeekWire: What advice do you have for startup leaders who may not be leading a sports franchise, but still interact with customers and want to improve their experiences? Humphrey: More companies need to take their customer experience and work backwards. But at the end of the day, you as a company, as a leadership group, have to pick your lane.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Meesho, an Indian e-commerce rival to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, is set to launch a roughly $606 million IPO marked by token sell-downs from early backers and no sales from big names such as SoftBank and Prosus, signalling investor conviction in India's booming online retail market at a time when tech shareholders globally have been cashing out at listings. Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing. Some of Meesho's early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders. It has since carved out a fast-growing niche with a low-cost model tailored to India's price-sensitive consumers and small merchants — an approach that has increasingly pressured larger rivals Amazon and Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based company uses a commission-light model, earning primarily from logistics fees, advertising, and other services, while charging commissions on products sold through its separate Meesho Mall channel. Meesho reported revenue from operations of ₹55.78 billion (about $624.0 million) for the six months ended September 30, up from ₹43.11 billion (around $482.0 million) a year earlier, per its prospectus. However, its losses widened, with Meesho posting a restated loss before tax of ₹4.33 billion (around $48.4 million) for the September 2025 half-year, compared with ₹0.24 billion (about $2.7 million) a year earlier. Meesho also uses a sprawling creator network for product discovery, with more than 50,000 active content creators generating at least one placed order through their content over the past year. “If you look at the value-focused bucket, here, you are trying to appeal to mass market consumers selling all kinds of products and categories in a marketplace business model, which tends to be asset light,” Aatrey told reporters during Meesho's press conference on Friday. Meesho also sees the IPO improving its ability to attract talent and strengthening confidence across its wider ecosystem, CFO Dhiresh Bansal told TechCrunch. He said a public listing boosts the company's brand with job candidates — including those coming from big tech firms — and has a positive knock-on effect on consumers, sellers and logistics partners by reinforcing Meesho's governance standards.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's the best time of year to buy a new smartphone. I review dozens and dozens of handsets every year, and I exclusively recommend you buy them unlocked—don't be beholden to a carrier! But the sticker shock of a new phone can be scary; these Black Friday phone deals can help ease the burden on your wallet. Whether you want a folding flip phone, a super-slim Galaxy Z Fold, or the latest magnetic Google Pixel 10, you'll find your next smartphone upgrade in this list. Read our Absolute Best Black Friday Deals roundup for more. Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is seeing healthy discounts this Black Friday, probably because its successors are right around the corner—the Galaxy S26 series is expected to be announced in January. The S25 is the smallest, the S25+ gets a few extra perks plus a bigger screen and better battery life, but it's the Galaxy S25 Ultra that really steps things up, with a dual telephoto camera system, integrated S Pen stylus, and a beefy battery. Read our Best Samsung Phones guide for more details about each of these devices. One of my favorite parts of Google's new Pixel 10 series (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is that they're the first flagship Android phones with Qi2 magnetic wireless charging. That means, just like MagSafe iPhones, you can attach magnetic accessories and enjoy faster wireless charging. Better yet, these are the first Android phones to support AirDrop with iPhones, Macs, and iPads. Read our Best Pixel Phones guide for more info. This is the smartphone most people looking for a new handset should buy. If you're not married to a particular camp or brand, the Google Pixel 9a (9/10, WIRED Recommends) strikes the best balance between features and price, and this sale makes that even better. The Galaxy Z Fold7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite booklike folding phone this year—it's so amazingly slim that what used to be a chunky device now feels kind of like a candy bar phone. These devices are still annoyingly expensive, but this Black Friday sale makes the prices a little more palatable. Read our Best Folding Phones guide for more options. If you're really interested in the idea of a folding flip phone, then might I suggest Motorola's Razr Ultra (8/10, WIRED Recommends)? Take your current phone today and fold it in half—OK, don't actually do that, but that's kind of what it's like to use this style of smartphone. Right now, the Razr Ultra is the best in this category, with a fresh design, good performance, surprisingly great cameras, and a functional external display. There's also the cheaper Razr 2025, which doesn't have as good performance or a camera system, but is still an incredible value, especially on sale. Read our Best Motorola Phones guide for more. Are you a very cool and smart person? This is an incredible deal on a phone that delivers surprisingly smooth performance, not to mention a bright and sharp screen, and an integrated stylus. And you get 256 GB of storage to boot. Read our Best Cheap Phones guide for more options. It's not flashy, but the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is a perfectly serviceable Android phone that should only be purchased at this $175 discount. Seriously, it's not worth the MSRP because you can usually find a Galaxy S25 on sale for close to that price. You're getting a solid triple-camera system with a 3X optical zoom sensor, smooth performance, and day-long battery life, plus all the usual flagship extras like Qi2 Ready wireless charging and IP68 water resistance. It'll still get seven years of software updates, too. Prefer Pixel phones but want a folding phone? This Pixel 10 Pro Fold (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is pretty much your only option. I have to say, having Qi2 magnets in a folding phone is very nice. The fun Glyph Matrix display on the back offers up notifications and can even be used to play rock, paper, scissors. It's a quirky device, but performance is slick, the cameras are solid, there's 256 GB of storage, and good battery life. It's not the best value from a price perspective, but that might not matter if you're head over heels about how it looks. But the latest and greatest isn't on sale, and the OnePlus 13 is still a very good smartphone with good battery life, extremely fast charging, and a decent camera system tuned by Hasselblad (this partnership is effectively over in the OnePlus 15). We typically don't recommend carrier devices because it means you're getting a locked phone, but most people upgrade through their carrier.

I've never cared more about my sleep in my life than during the month-plus that I've worn the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic. But when sleep was added to the devices, I largely ignored it. But it still requires you to put in the work. Most fitness trackers these days try to do it all and, honestly, most of them fall short on that task. Yes, the Ring 4 Ceramic does cram every body metric possible into its tiny device and accompanying app. And yet, somehow, it does so in a way that I am at least a little bit less bothered about than I had been in the past. I've also decided that of all the options currently out there to track my health—smartwatches, straps, etc.—a smart ring is by far superior. The Oura Ring, which originally debuted exactly a decade ago after a successful Kickstarter campaign, is currently in its fourth iteration, which came out over the summer. In October, the company also debuted its ceramic version of the Oura 4, which is made up of high-performance zirconia ceramic, which is a material known for its durability and light weight. The new Oura Ring 4 Ceramic comes in four colors: Tide, Petal, Cloud, and Midnight. With older models, users had issues with the colors (a mix of silvers and golds) fading or chipping over time; ceramic has no such issues. And while I'm only going on my second month, my Tide-colored Oura is still just as vibrant as day one. You also need a subscription for the Oura Ring, which is $6 a month (you can also pay $70 upfront for the whole year). If you don't want to pay that monthly fee, the smart ring still works and you will still get certain data, including sleep analysis, a readiness score, and an activity tracker. I'm not generally a big ring person, but I honestly found the Ring 4 Ceramic to be pleasantly snug and cozy on my finger. I often alternated between wearing it on my middle or index finger. Comfort is a huge component of health and fitness trackers, and it's one that doesn't get talked about enough when reviewing these products. If the goal is to wear them 24/7, then they have to be comfortable, and it's worth trying on a bunch of different types—smartwatches, straps, smart rings—to figure out which one works for you and your lifestyle. In testing, mine has lasted a full 7 days multiple times. It's available in a wide variety of sizes—4 to 15—which is even more than the smart ring's previous iteration. The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic uses infrared LEDs to measure blood oxygen during sleep. All of those sensors mean that the Ring 4 Ceramic has the ability to track a huge swath of data, but the key is how it spits all that out into a usable form. It also breaks sleep down into smaller details like total sleep versus time in bed and gives you a sleep efficiency percentage, which is how much of your time in bed you actually spent sleeping. It knows when you are doomscrolling or tossing and turning with the Sunday scaries. The Ring 4 Ceramic takes all of this, along with your nighttime resting heart rate, and calculates a sleep score. This is where health optimization can get somewhat addictive, and I'm absolutely prone to it. The tracker also provides a daily “Readiness” score, which it calculates using an algorithm that takes into account your resting heart rate, heart rate variability, any significant body temperature fluctuations, as well as your respiratory rate and sleep. Again, anything 85 or higher is optimal, and I've been getting a lot of scores in the 90s, which makes me proud of my mind, body, and spirit, honestly. It also provides a daily activity goal, which you can set yourself, and it's nice to hit that goal each day. Similar to its competitor Whoop, the Ring 4 also provides a daily stress analysis. Luckily for you all, I tested the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic during the month of October and November, which is peak fall cold season. The smart ring has an algorithm built into it called the Symptom Radar, which essentially uses changes in skin temperature, respiratory rate, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability to detect if something is off in your system. I got a cold in mid-October, which honestly came on pretty suddenly. She sneezed into my face multiple times (so cute) and then on Thursday morning, I woke up with that dreaded scratchy lump in my throat, which continued to get worse and then better over the course of that next week and a half. The Ring 4 Ceramic didn't detect any shifts from my baseline on Tuesday or Wednesday, or even Thursday, when I woke up feeling off. But once my cold was full-blown, the app did note that both my body temperature and resting heart rate were elevated, and wanted to know what was up. That cold was fairly mild, and came on quickly, so I do wonder if I had had something worse, like the flu or covid, if it would have detected it a bit earlier. I also wonder if I keep wearing the Ring 4 Ceramic for longer, would it get better at knowing what's normal and what's not for me? I still think that the best period tracker is a pen and paper (or a dedicated note in your notes app). Oura's new cycle insights and fertility feature, which was unveiled at the end of October by the company (I had been using it since the start of my testing in early October) requires 60 nights of data in order to make accurate predictions. In order to really assess whether it's working well or not, I'd want to give the Ring 4 Ceramic another couple of months after that, too. To predict your period, the tracker collects body temperature readings over a long period of time (two months or more) and uses that in addition to an algorithm to predict when your next cycle might arrive and when you might be ovulating. There are also a slew of integrations that you can use with the Ring 4, including Headspace, Strava, Natural Cycles, and even Stelo, which is a continuous glucose monitor. Connecting it to the smart ring allows users to see their glucose levels in the Oura app, which shows how factors like meal choices, sleep, and activity impact their glucose levels. Oura's newest partnership, as of late October, is with Quest Diagnostics, the blood testing company. For an additional yearly membership fee of $100, users can get a comprehensive blood panel, though it's not available in every state. However, like I've written about in the past when reviewing similar products such as the Whoop and Polar Loop, how much of this data is that useful? I've been a health tracking user for years now, and I've found that the key question you have to ask yourself when deciding whether you want to spend a couple of hundred dollars or more on these devices is: what are you trying to get from these devices? Is it better sleep, less stress, increased energy and activity? These devices can do it all, to a degree, and perhaps Oura can do it the best, but it still comes down to how much work you are personally willing to put into making your health better. Govee's lights are an easy, but very spendy way to do it. The Abxylute 3D One is a handheld that tries so many things, and not all of them work. Whether you're on Team iPhone or Android, like flat phones or foldables, we've found the best phones released this year.

Judging by the trailer they made it all quite humorous. Also, making spacecraft shielding and even furniture out of this stuff? They power themselves with light but still need to be made out of something! Are they also hoping these fungus like to eat lunar regolith? Where is the fucking biomass meant to come from?? I must be crazy, or they all are. If I understand the linked NASA press releases correctly, they are talking about using a mix of regolith, cyanobacteria and fungi as part of the outer shell of a habitat. And because fungi don't form from nothing you add cyanobacteria that create "fungus food" (presumably some sugar) from water and CO2 (I'm sure you need to add a bit more than that, but that might be beyond the scope of a press release)This really has nothing to do with radiation-absorbing fungi at all, except for one remark how the melanin in radiation-eating fungi could provide further shielding. This really has nothing to do with radiation-absorbing fungi at all, except for one remark how the melanin in radiation-eating fungi could provide further shielding. In principle if fungi could somehow concentrate enough fissionable material (say uranium), you could get something like the Oklo reactor going, but it would have to be a truly gigantic, probably unphysical amount of fungi to have access to that much environmental uranium in the first place and it would then have to be concentrated very strongly to get any measurable effect. You won't see anything at all if you just move a few atoms a few mm, so it would need to have very long range hyphae. You also need it to be basically one huge organism in order to collect the uranium to one place - billions of small fungi just doing a few square inches each won't work. It's unlikely the fungus could survive to become so huge on only the promise of fractionally higher future radiation, so it would need to eat something else too.And then it would decay into daughter isotopes that don't further benefit from the concentration so it might not help a lot anyway if you're looking for cleanup. Plus you've covered your cleanup site in, presumably, millions of tonnes of fungus which might or might not be an improvement.

Plus you've covered your cleanup site in, presumably, millions of tonnes of fungus which might or might not be an improvement. You're talking about a fungus creating essentially a nuclear reactor inside of its cells, and creating it out of fuel that's not good enough to make a nuclear reactor in the first place (it at one time was, but now it's a mess of decay products and nonsense).Reactors also take a certain amount of mass. You can't just squish two tiny microgram particles together and hope to get anything going. Reactors also take a certain amount of mass. You can't just squish two tiny microgram particles together and hope to get anything going. Would probably require a lot more time than it would have, however, considering the relatively low amounts of radioisotopes in todays world (due to the halflife of most of them, and the age of our planet).Several billion years ago it could have been a thing though!

Most life has evolved some sort of mechanism to control it, but sometimes it doesn't work right.If such a fungus existed and we had enough radioactive material lying around for it to survive, I'd expect the occasional random meltdown to occur.Notably, this happened due to pure natural causes anyway a couple billion years ago!

Notably, this happened due to pure natural causes anyway a couple billion years ago! The good news is radiation detectors are insanely sensitive so you can map where the hotspots are and mitigate much of the risk using exclusion zones and / or various cleanup techniques to collect the radioactive material so it can be safety stored. It has not actually been proven that this fungus gets energy from the radiation itself. They simply observe it growing faster in the presence of radiation which could be caused by any number of other things. There just isn't that much radioactive waste to clean up! A radiotropic fungus that's in TFA can't meaningfully affect the rate at which nuclear decay is happening. What it can do, supposedly, is to harvest the energy that the nuclear decay is releasing; normally there's too much energy for an organism to safely handle.At the risk of vastly oversimplifying, you can't plug your phone into high voltage transmission lines. These fungi are using melanin to moderate the extra energy, stepping it down into a range that's useful (or at least minimally harmful).

The world rejoices as this fungus is perfect for cleaning up nuclear waste products, until we realize that it evolved to function outside of Chernobyl and begins to eat everything it can reach. Mankind launches into a desperate struggle for survival as the fungus lays waste to large swathes of land.

E.g. the energy that would be released if you took pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and combined it into 1 gram of water. But the fungi takes in water from the environment to grow, it does not make it's own water from pure hydrogen, and it certainly does not generate any free energy from growing larger. With some margin for error in my understanding, since I'm not a chemist (but neither are you, and neither is the chatbot).> It was really just food for thought.It was more poison than food, since you just parroted randomly generated misinformation from the chatbot and passed it of as authentic insight. > It was really just food for thought.It was more poison than food, since you just parroted randomly generated misinformation from the chatbot and passed it of as authentic insight.

No, the elephants foot isn't a point source at its surface.To use an extreme example going from 1m away from the sun to 100m away from the sun doesn't result in a 10,000x drop off in energy density. But i focused on the 10% mentioned.That said time could be factored out if you did everything properly. That said time could be factored out if you did everything properly. E.g.

It includes all the usual high energy radiations such as Gamma, X-rays, high energy UV, alpha, beta, neutron et al. HN high energy physicists can correct me, sounds like it is not any particular category of the harmful radiation from a nuclear disaster, it is all of them.

My guts tell me that using the melanin as a shield against gamma radiation has a negligible effect, if any at all. But how about the theory that systems to clean up smashed up proteins from UV light is also good to clean up smashed up proteins from gamma radiation?And one of the parts of that system, or upregulated with that system, is melanin.</p>

Govee makes smart lights for almost any situation you could imagine, from A19 RGB bulbs to light-up LED sticks meant to stand up in corners to netted string lights that let you paint your hedges with pixel art. You can make your home a total Lisa Frank fever dream using this company's products. One new entry in its vast catalog is the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism. It's a modular set of soffit lights with tri-color lamps that you can use to accent your home's roofline and illuminate walkways around it, or to spray your walls with obnoxiously vibrant gradients of color, Homeowners Association busybodies be damned. Govee's Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism is a fun, colorful way to light the outside of your house, but it's hard to justify the cost. It seems like there are a million smart soffit lights available from countless alphabet soup brands on Amazon, ranging from the very cheap to the fairly expensive. The reason you may have heard of Govee and not, say, Letianpai or Poofzy is that Govee is a real company with an app that's actually nice to use. Also, thanks to the Matter protocol, most of its newer lights are compatible with every major smart home platform, which doesn't hurt. After a week of testing the Lights Prism on my garage, I've found them to be responsive, reliable, and even fun to use. That's a problem because without an extension cable, I couldn't make them wrap around my garage without doubling the lights back on themselves. It would've helped if Govee had added a splitter, as I could have sent one segment in one direction, and the rest of them in the other. Unlike all of those generic soffit lights I mentioned, Govee's RGB lamps can blast three colors at once, each at different brightness levels, making for much more nuanced—or potentially garish!—lighting. Combined, they all make the full light cone that you see when all are illuminated, but each of their beams points in a different direction and, with only one or two of the LEDs lit, can be used as a spotlight of sorts. I could see turning off most of the lights at night but keeping specific beams shining on doorways and windows. Ignoring the triple LED thing, Govee's Lights Prism makes for good ground illumination, at least from eight feet up on my garage's soffits. The big thing that I imagine will keep most people away from these lights is the price: starting at $540 for a 100-foot kit, they are expensive. Sure, it would cost potentially thousands of dollars for a fully integrated soffit lighting setup if you factor in professional installation, but you can get similar lights to these for less. Even Govee's own Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro, which use single LED lamps, are $100 cheaper for the same length of lighting. And if I wanted to spend more money, I don't think I'd be tempted enough by the triple LEDs of Govee's lights not to just get the cheaper Festavia Permanent Outdoor String Lights from Philips Hue, a company generally known for its high-quality and long-lasting products. After all, even the Hue bulbs I bought nearly a decade ago work as well now as the day I bought them. Govee's known for its fancy lighting effects, and the Lights Prism is no slouch here. The Govee app is fat with options for different looping effects—you can go with premade ones, roll your own looping effects and light gradient combinations, choose from effects made by other Govee users, and more. Unsurprisingly, you can also ask AI to make mediocre effects. The plethora of premade ones fit into categories like “Festival,” “Soothing,” or “Universe.” They might be as simple as a gentle pulsing light or be more complex, with the individual LEDs of the lamps winking and flashing. There are also some licensed effects, like for Zootopia 2, but you'd need Govee's net-style lighting to actually get any benefit from them. Govee's effects really shine with the three-light lamps as they allow for more detailed gradients, or for the individual lights of each lamp to flash on and off in a more lively display than you might get with single light sources. The onboard mic is more precise but susceptible to other noises screwing it up, while syncing using your smartphone's microphone introduces so much latency the effect might as well be totally random. I could see using the music effects for a backyard karaoke party or something. But I would never subject my neighbors to what amounts to a Temu version of those Christmas light shows that go viral every year when some stage lighting professional goes hog wild with Disney soundtracks or whatever. Also, Matter-certified devices are required to function even when your internet goes down. So, if you're savvy enough to have the Lights Prism on your local network but closed off to the broader internet, they're still controllable. All that said, you won't be able to ditch the Govee app if you want to do anything more complicated than turning the lights on and off or setting the whole string's brightness or color at once. Matter just doesn't support that granularity, and none of the major smart home platforms has any sort of easy, built-in support for lighting effects. The Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism is a very slick alternative to more invasive, integrated installations that would require professionals to cut holes in your soffit and install lights that they then wire up directly to your home. And with three LEDs per lamp, it makes for much more detailed lighting effects than just about any of the other permanent string lights on the market right now. Sure, the Lights Prism is cheaper than those professional installations I just mentioned, but the physical product just doesn't feel like it's worth its at-least-$540 price. That's hard to get over, especially when Philips Hue has a cheaper version of this concept, minus the triple-LED gimmick. Still, the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism are very neat, they work with all major smart home platforms, and I wouldn't be sad if I owned them. So it's a good thing that Govee never keeps its products at their street price for long, especially around the holiday season, when prices plummet as everyone competes for your gift-giving dollars. If you're in the market for fancy outdoor smart lights and you see a really good deal on the Lights Prism—I mean cheaper-than-Hue good—go for it. Maybe you don't need a smartwatch for your health and fitness-tracking needs, after all. The Abxylute 3D One is a handheld that tries so many things, and not all of them work. The latest Nest Doorbell is great hardware plagued by a bad subscription approach.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Whether you like it or not, Black Friday is here. For Black Friday, Best Buy has really solid tech deals on some of our favorite products we've tested and reviewed, ranging from laptops and gaming mice to cordless vacuums. For more great discounts, check out our Best Black Friday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. Updated November 28: We've added the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones, Google Pixel 10 smartphone, and TP-Link Deco BE67 mesh system. The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least). The JBL Flip 7 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a Bluetooth speaker that has it all. As our A/V reviewer Ryan Waniata says, “JBL's Flip strikes the perfect compromise between mobility and sound quality, offering clean detail with plenty of punch.” Waniata also praises the durability of the Flip 7, which is important in a Bluetooth speaker meant to be used outdoors. There are tons of different color options to match your vibe, and it gets up to 16 hours of battery life. Everyone wants a cordless Dyson vacuum, but they tend to be exorbitantly expensive. It's still not cheap, but at $300 off, this is as good a deal as we've seen on this vacuum. The V15 Detect is our vacuum expert's favorite Dyson. In her testing, Nena Farrell says she was impressed by how much dust and dirt it sucked up from her carpet, as well as from hard floors. That's overkill for most people, but if you have severe allergies (or have friends or family that do), the Dyson V15 Detect can actually verify what you're picking up. OLED TVs might be the best TVs you can buy, but if you're shopping for a TV under $1,000 like most people are, the TCL QM6K QLED (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is what you should be eyeing. It's a 4K mini-LED screen, and our TV reviewers call it “a versatile display that does just about everything well, from naturalistic colors to rich black levels and impressive clarity.” It's not the brightest TV in the world, but it does come with a 144-Hz refresh rate for gaming and a smart Google TV interface for your streaming needs. There are screen options ranging from 55 inches up to 98 inches, all of which are on sale ahead of Black Friday, with the happy-medium 65-inch model starting at $500. Most people aren't using the wireless charging on their iPhone to its full extent. Picking up a MagSafe power bank is a great way to do that, and this one from Anker is our favorite. We also like that it comes with a built-in kickstand and a helpful LED light on the side that tells you how much charge is left. Bags of processing power can silence even the loudest sounds around you, and the included microphones are excellent for Zoom calls. One of the biggest upgrades you can make to your remote work setup is a solid USB hub or laptop docking station. Most laptops don't have enough ports, especially not if you're trying to connect multiple, high-resolution monitors. The plug-and-play nature of this is super helpful, too, as you can have all of your peripherals and accessories connected via USB-C. While you could just go out and buy any old USB hub, the Satechi Dual Dock Stand has some secrets up its sleeve. First off, it's designed to prop up your laptop slightly with its wedge shape. My favorite feature, though, is the built-in storage slot. The best part is the price, which is down to $105, a new low at Best Buy for Black Friday. And while I wouldn't say this laptop is worth $1,000, it's an absolute steal for $550. The Zenbook A14's calling card is its weight of just 2.16 pounds. That makes it an ideal travel companion to lug across campus or on airplanes. Unlike ultra-light laptops in the past, the Zenbook A14 doesn't have any major compromises in battery life, performance, or keyboard. It even has an OLED screen, as so many Asus laptops do. This is a great price for the base iPad. But a cheaper iPad is only so good if it's limited by its software. But with the iPadOS 26 update, you're also getting a better iPad than ever before. With a more accurate cursor and resizable windows, the iPad is now more like a MacBook than ever before. Multitasking on an iPad has always been a nightmare, but now that you can pull up multiple windows side by side and resize them to your heart's content. But the 2025 Moto G Stylus is not only the best Moto G phone you can buy, it also has a lot of high-end features, such as a large 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate. These earbuds came out a couple of years ago, but they remain some of the best you can buy. When they came out, Sony's fifth-generation of high-end wireless earbuds were trimmed down to around 25 percent smaller and 20 percent lighter than the previous generation. You also get two extra full charges from the case, for a total of up to 36 hours of listening. That all makes it the best pair of earbuds for traveling in particular. You can't go wrong with Google's brand-new Pixel 10. The smartest of the best Android phones, it boasts genuinely useful AI features, like Call Screen and Now Playing. There's also an excellent, versatile, triple-camera system that includes a 5X optical zoom for capturing action from afar. Within its Odyssey lineup, there's now just about every size and form factor of monitor you can imagine. It's $250 off the full price ahead of Black Friday, down now to $650. You can't expect a laptop this cheap to be without compromises. It's not bright enough, and the colors look off. With RAM prices skyrocketing, just buying a prebuilt gaming desktop feels like an increasingly smart move, especially at this price. The Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop is down to just $1,225, coming with an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti, Intel Core Ultra 7 265F, 32 GB of memory, and 1 TB of storage. That's cheaper than Dell's own price for that configuration, but I wouldn't recommend buying this particular model, as it comes with only a 500-watt power supply. While that's enough power for the RTX 5060 Ti, you'll be limited from upgrading to any GPUs more powerful in the future. Before buying, I'd also recommend comparing prices with Dell.com, as it has some strong deals on particular configurations, such as this RTX 5070 Ti model for just $1,000. If you play MMOs, you know how useful it is to map various actions to buttons on your keyboard or mouse. Well, this gaming mouse from Corsair gives you a ton of options to customize your gameplay. There are 12 reprogrammable side buttons, but the mouse also has a high 33,000-dpi optical sensor and 1,000-Hz polling for low input lag and high responsiveness. It can connect via a 2.4-GHz dongle instead of Bluetooth, too. Everyone could use faster and more reliable Wi-Fi, right? You'll get lightning-fast speeds on the 6-GHz band at close range.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It kinda looks like DOOM ported to the Atari Battlezone wireframe arcade games era. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The seminal 1993 FPS has looked better, and also a lot worse, but this version, using the KiCad renderer, certainly has a retro style we appreciate. In addition to marveling over this combination of EDA, CAD, and DOOM, our hearts are warmed by the dev's assertion that “every frame creates a legitimate PCB design that could theoretically be fabricated.” Don't expect to do anything with the PCB, other than hang it on your wall or use it as a table mat, though. Ayles explains that KiDOOM provides triple mode rendering for different use-cases, with three parallel visualizations, and every frame traverses a six-stage pipeline. Luckily, for fluidity, the dev noticed that “DOOM's engine already calculates visible geometry as vectors. PCB traces ARE vectors.” Thus, for speed and efficiency, “Instead of 64,000 pixels, we need 100-300 line segments.” Several key optimizations were done in the pipeline to enable pretty smooth gameplay on a modern computer. There are also four important KiCad settings that need to be tweaked by those wanting to give KiDOOM a spin – otherwise, you will have an experience that is “2-5x worse.” Those interested are encouraged to try KiDOOM for themselves, and Ayles provides a walkthrough of preparatory steps to get up and running. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. As for performance, it looks like our intrepid dev had access to an M1 MacBook Pro, which could deliver 15-25fps in this game port. An “i7 + RTX 3050 Ti” could push the frame rate to between 18-28fps. We aren't sure whether throwing more CPU and GPU power at KiDOOM will pay off in a linear fashion, or other bottlenecks will make themselves known. But if you try it on an RTX 5090 or RX 9070 XT, or one of the other best GPUs for gaming in 2025, please let us know!

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. At the ICC Global CEO Summit in Beijing, China Semiconductor Industry Association vice chairman Wei Shaojun claimed that a new domestically designed AI processor using mature 14nm logic and 18nm DRAM nodes can match the performance of Nvidia's current 4nm chips. Wei pitched the design as a potentially disruptive shift away from U.S. dependency, calling it central to China's AI strategy, but fell short of disclosing any specific technical details, hinting that he would “leave some suspense” for now, DigiTimes reports. He said the system's power efficiency reaches 2 TFLOPS per watt, with a claimed total throughput of 120 TFLOPS, which is much higher than Nvidia's A100 GPUs. Wei added that the chip is part of a fully domestic supply chain effort and will be formally disclosed in detail later this year. The ultimate goal, he said, is to sidestep Western supply chain constraints, cut costs, and decouple China's AI development from U.S. vendors at both the hardware and software levels. This technique differs from traditional package-on-package or chiplet interconnects, in that it allows extremely dense, low-latency, high-bandwidth connections between dies. Unlike wire bonding or organic interposers, hybrid bonding directly fuses copper-to-copper contacts between wafers or die surfaces at the micron scale, supporting much higher interconnect density and thermal performance. He said software-defined logic further boosts efficiency by allowing compute units to be dynamically mapped and configured for AI-specific workloads. It also implies a significant advantage over CPU-bound systems like Intel Xeon, which Wei said remain less efficient for large model training. He stopped short of naming which Chinese firms are building silicon around this model, but past Chinese state media coverage has identified national champions such as Cambricon, Loongson, and Biren as players developing GPGPU-class accelerators. Cambricon in particular has previously discussed near-memory architectures and filed patents related to logic-in-memory compute. Wei devoted a significant part of his address to outlining how he sees the entrenchment of CUDA as a vulnerability in the global AI industry. He argued that the early compatibility between large AI models and Nvidia's GPGPU architecture created a cycle of increasing architectural dependency. Over time, software was designed for CUDA and Nvidia optimized its hardware for deep learning workloads, leading to what Wei called a "deep pit" of mutual dependence between model developers and GPU vendors. He claimed that this dynamic leaves alternative architectures — such as domestic AI chips incompatible with CUDA — with almost no route to widespread adoption, regardless of theoretical performance. In his view, if China becomes similarly locked into this ecosystem, it will effectively lose sovereignty over its AI trajectory. Wei is clearly not alone in this line of thought. Chinese companies such as Cambricon and Huawei have advanced CUDA alternatives and software abstraction layers in parallel with domestic AI hardware, with state-aligned investment efforts backing broader ecosystem development. He said China's goal is to “abandon U.S. technology routes” and build a domestic AI technology stack that is resilient to supply chain shocks and regulatory constraints. In response, the company introduced modified, lower-performance chips, which were also eventually restricted. Today, now that Nvidia has no market share left in China, domestic companies rely on legacy hardware or workarounds using second-tier accelerators and the grey market. The claims made at ICC raise questions that cannot yet be answered without detailed benchmarks and independent testing. While hybrid bonding is an established technology, the real-world performance of a full stack built on 14nm logic and 18nm DRAM remains to be seen. Thermal dissipation in 3D stacks is still a major concern, particularly when logic and memory are in close proximity, and airflow is limited. Hybrid bonding also requires very high manufacturing precision and wafer alignment. China's domestic foundries, including SMIC, are known to have strong 14nm-class production lines, but hybrid bonding at scale for logic-memory stacks would be a new capability. Breaking Nvidia's lock on the model training ecosystem also requires not just raw performance parity, but broad software support and capable developers. Even if China succeeds in building a functionally equivalent AI processor, adoption will remain limited without tooling and integration into PyTorch or TensorFlow workflows. Still, with EUV lithography out of reach and GAA transistor designs still years away for domestic fabs, architectural innovation and packaging integration may be China's most viable path to short-term competitiveness in high-performance AI workloads. Wei indicated that more technical details would be shared in future disclosures, but did not confirm whether working silicon had been produced.

Playing PC games on inappropriate displays looks like it is becoming a trend in late 2025. Instead, Smilly recorded themselves enjoying a bit of Minecraft using a printer as their sole viewport into the famously blocky game's universe. Above, you can see and hear that Smilly isn't having the happiest time in Minecraft, via his high contrast paper-spooled view of the game world. The receipt printer provides surprisingly rapid updates, which is a welcome feature for any gaming "display." But it isn't the ‘refresh rate', which we'd hazard is around 0.5 frames per second, that seems to be frustrating the YouTuber. Occasionally, audio clues help give the video gaming fan an idea of what is going on, but such clues are fleeting at best. Mid-video clip, Smilly seems to be settling more comfortably into the black and white super-contrasty world he is adventuring within. Switching to his inventory view shows… an unrecognizable shape surrounded by a murky gray nothingness.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft is doing a holdup on users to force them to upgrade threatening on their security if they don't, as they will not provide anymore important security update. But, from the user point of view, the migration will give you nothing special except crap that they didn't ask for, like having AI everything. it's legitimate for their stopping of security updates. However, this is only true if there is no more security updates to _any_ version of windows 10. So there is an effective path to just give those same updates to all version of windows, and it is "free" (as in, it did not take extra dev time to create).Therefore, this is deliberate on microsoft's part to force more upgrades to windows 11. This should be considered anti-consumer practice, and the consumer protection groups ought to latch on and sue microsoft for this.For consumers themselves, i always advise them that the time to move is now.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Defense tech startup Anduril Industries has faced numerous setbacks during testing of its autonomous weapons systems, according to new reporting by the WSJ. Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems. Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril's only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine's SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. Every weekday and Sunday, you can get the best of TechCrunch's coverage.
