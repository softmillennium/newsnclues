“This project is not going to happen,” the president of the Haida nation promised.

First Nations groups backed by environmental and conservationist allies in Canada are denouncing a pipeline and tanker infrastructure agreement announced Thursday between Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, calling the deal a betrayal and promising to fight against its implementation tooth and nail.

“We will use every tool in our toolbox to ensure that this pipeline does not go ahead,” said Heiltsuk Nation Chief Marilyn Slett in response to the Carney-Smith deal that would bring tens of millions of barrels of tar sands oil from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia for export by building new pipeline and lifting a moratorium against oil tankers operating in fragile British Columbia coastal water.

While Carney, who argues that the pipeline is in Canada's economic interest, had vowed to secure the support of First Nations before finalizing any agreement with the Alberta, furious reactions to the deal made it clear that promise was not met.

Xhaaidlagha Gwaayaai, the president of the Haida nation, was emphatic: “This project is not going to happen.”

The agreement, according to the New York Times, is part of Carney's “plan to curb Canada's trade dependence on the United States, swings Canadian policy away from measures meant to fight climate change to focus instead on growing the oil and gas industry.”

In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) “loudly” voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith.

“This MOU is nothing less than a high risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. “By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC's coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.”

Slett, who serves as secretary-treasurer of the UBCIC, said the agreement “was negotiated without the involvement of the very Nations who would shoulder those risks, and to suggest ‘Indigenous co-ownership' of a pipeline while ignoring the clear opposition of Coastal First Nations is unacceptable.”

Avi Lewis, running for the leadership of the progressive New Democratic Party (NDP) in upcoming elections, decried the agreement as a failure of historic proportions.

“Carney's deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,” said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. “We need power lines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.”

Carney's deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built.We need powerlines, not pipelines. Our path is through climate leadership & building good jobs in the clean economy.

In response to the deal, the minister of Canadian culture, Steven Guilbeault, who formerly served as environment minister under the previous Liberal administration, resigned in protest.

“Despite this difficult economic context, I remain one of those for whom environmental issues must remain front and center,” Guilbeault said in a statement.

“Over the past few months, several elements of the climate action plan I worked on as Minister of the Environment have been, or are about to be, dismantled,” he said. “In my view, these measures remain essential to our climate action plan.”

David Eby, the premier of British Columbia who opposes the new pipeline into his province and was not included in the discussions between Carney and Smith, echoed those who said the project is more dead than alive, despite the MOU, calling it a potential “energy vampire” that would distracts from better energy solutions that don't carry all the baggage of this proposed project.

“With all of the variables that have yet to be fulfilled — no proponent, no route, no money, no First Nations support — that it cannot draw limited federal resources, limited Indigenous governance resources, limited provincial resources away from the real projects that will employ people,” Eby added.

Keith Brooks, the programs director at Environmental Defence, decried the deal as “worse than we had anticipated” and “a gift to the oil industry and Alberta Premier Smith, at the expense of practically everyone else.”

“Filling this pipeline and expansion would require more oil sands mining, leading to more carbon pollution, more tailings, and worse impacts for communities near the tar sands,” warned Brooks. “The pipeline to BC would have to cross some of the most challenging terrain in Canada. The impacts of construction would be severe, and the impacts of a spill, devastating.”

Jessica Green, a professor at the University of Toronto with a focus on environmental politics, equated the “reckless” deal to a “climate dumpster fire” and called the push for more tar sands pipelines in Canada “the energy equivalent [of] investing in VHS tapes in 2025.”

At least the United States under President Donald Trump, she added, “has the cojones to say it doesn't give a shit about climate” while Carney, despite the contents of the deal with Alberta, “is still pretending that Canada does.”

As Trump cracks down on political speech, independent media is increasingly necessary.

Frank-Walter Steinmeier travels to Basque town for remembrance ceremony marking ‘terrible crimes' of 1937

Eighty-eight years after Luftwaffe pilots took part in the most infamous atrocity of the Spanish civil war, Germany's president has visited the Basque town of Guernica to honour the victims of the Nazi bombing and to urge that the “terrible crimes” committed there are never forgotten.

Hundreds of civilians were killed and hundreds more injured on 26 April 1937 when planes from the German Condor Legion, operating alongside aircraft from fascist Italy, spent hours bombing Guernica on market day. Adolf Hitler had loaned the Luftwaffe unit to Gen Francisco Franco's nationalist forces to help them in their coup against the republican government, and to allow Nazi Germany's pilots to practise the blitzkrieg tactics they would later use in the second world war.

The destruction of Guernica, which would become a template for the aerial bombardment of civilians, was immortalised by Pablo Picasso in the huge monochrome canvas that bears the town's name.

On Friday, Frank-Walter Steinmeier became the first German head of state to travel to Guernica, where he joined King Felipe VI of Spain in a remembrance ceremony held in a cemetery in the town and laid a wreath for the victims. The pair then visited Guernica's Museum of Peace, where they met two survivors of the attack, Crucita Etxabe and María del Carmen Aguirre.

Steinmeier, who is on a state visit to Spain, used a speech earlier this week to address the bombing and its legacy.

“Germans committed terrible crimes in Guernica,” the president told guests at a banquet in Madrid on Wednesday.

“On 26 April 1937, the feared Condor Legion bombed the city, razing it to the ground. Hundreds of defenceless children, women and men lost their lives in appalling, agonising ways. The terror, pain and grief is felt to this day by many Basque families.”

Steinmeier, who visited the Reina Sofía museum in Madrid to see Picasso's Guernica for himself, said the artist's warning against remaining indifferent in the face of conflict and suffering “has lost none of its urgency”.

He added: “It is very important to me, and I am consciously addressing this sentence to my compatriots in Germany, that we do not forget what happened back then. This crime was committed by Germans. Guernica serves as a warning – a call to stand up for peace, freedom and the preservation of human rights. We want to live up to that, now and in the future.”

His words came three decades after Germany's then president, Roman Herzog, said he wished “to confront the past and … explicitly admit to the culpable involvement of German pilots”.

Guernica's mayor, José María Gorroño, who had hailed the visit as “a day that will go down in the town's history”, used the occasion to repeat calls for Picasso's masterpiece to be moved from the Reina Sofía to the place that inspired it.

In an interview with Cadena Ser radio on Thursday, Gorroño said the Spanish state owed a “moral debt to the victims of the bombing”, adding: “Picasso's Guernica should come to Guernica. It's a worldwide peace icon. The victims need this tribute.”

Meanwhile, the Basque regional president, Imanol Pradales, has called for the Spanish state to follow Germany's lead in confronting its role in the bombing of Guernica.

“No one has any doubts that the current Spanish state is very different from that one,” he told the Basque parliament last week. “It's just about affirming truth and justice, and its actions should spring from a commitment to freedom and democracy. We're asking nothing more, and nothing less, from the Spanish state than what the German president is doing.”

Many students are torn between leaving to continue their education or staying in Gaza to rebuild what Israel destroyed.

This story was originally published at Prism.

Haya Abu Hjeer graduated with a degree in computer science in Gaza in 2023 and had dreamed of pursuing a master's degree. But then, Israel launched its genocide on Gaza, destroying or damaging all 12 universities within the Gaza Strip by May 2024, and killing hundreds of university students and academics. 

On July 9, 2024, Abu Hjeer earned a chance to keep pursuing a brighter future: She was accepted for a scholarship at the University of Tuscia in Italy to study artificial intelligence and archival science. She never imagined that the road to college would be paved with such pain; only days after her acceptance, Abu Hjeer's father and brother were killed in an Israeli attack while they searched for a bag of flour during the famine.

“It was the hardest decision of my life … to leave my mother broken like that,” Abu Hjeer, who is now in Italy, told Prism in a phone interview. “But I felt I had to continue for everyone who's gone.”

As they fight to survive amid the ruins of Gaza, some students have received scholarships to pursue higher education in European and Arab countries and have been evacuated through border crossings closed to most others.

At first glance, the scholarships appear to be a necessary humanitarian gesture. But behind them lies a difficult question, one that touches not only on education, but also on the future of Palestinian existence itself: Are these scholarships a path to survival, or the beginning of a new wave of migration that will drain Gaza of its youth and talent?

“Scholarships for Gazan students and academics are both a lifeline and a paradox,” Wesam Amer, former dean of the Faculty of Communication and Languages at Gaza University, who is now a visiting professor at the University of Cambridge, told Prism in a written response. “On one hand, they offer vital opportunities to continue learning after everything has been destroyed. On the other, they risk turning education into a pathway of forced academic exile.”

Gaza's entire educational infrastructure has nearly collapsed since the start of the genocide. By July 2024, education had been disrupted for more than 625,000 children after about 93% of school buildings sustained some damage from Israeli attacks, and about 85% required full reconstruction or significant rehabilitation before they would be usable, according to the 2024 Occupied Palestinian Territories Education Cluster report. Between Oct. 7, 2023, and Sept. 2, 2025, Israel killed 17,237 students and 741 teachers, according to the Cluster's 2025 snapshot.

These figures are not just statistics; they represent a generation deprived of its right to learn, and a society stripped of one of its foundations for survival. Amid this violence and destruction, international scholarships have become one of the few remaining pathways for Palestinian students in Gaza to continue their education.

For Abu Hjeer, that harrowing journey started when she saw a Facebook post about a scholarship at the University of Tuscia, part of the Italian Universities for Palestinian Students program, a government initiative run by the Conference of Italian University Rectors, which this year offered scholarships to 35 Palestinian students from Gaza and the West Bank.

After receiving her acceptance, Abu Hjeer wrote daily to the Italian Consulate in Jerusalem, urging officials there to speed up the evacuation process, so she could escape the genocide with a chance of survival like dozens of other students with foreign scholarships. By late September, the long-awaited call came: Students were to leave at 2 a.m. from a gathering point in southern Gaza, Abu Hjeer recalled.

Dozens of students and their families gathered, preparing for evacuation to Italy, Russia, Belgium, the U.K., and Germany, coordinated by foreign missions and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Accompanied by Red Cross staff and several foreigners, the students boarded buses with a heavy mix of fear and hope.

At Bani Suhaila, a town east of Khan Younis, an Israeli armored vehicle blocked their way and aimed rocket-propelled grenade launchers at them, throwing everyone into panic. The Red Cross withdrew under army orders, leaving the convoy stranded for hours, Abu Hjeer said.

They eventually moved toward the Kerem Shalom crossing, where they were detained and searched. Israeli female soldiers confiscated their small bags and placed their official papers into black garbage bags, Abu Hjeer said. 

After a long, exhausting wait, they were allowed to cross through Israel into Jordan. They stayed at the border for seven hours before being transferred to the Italian Hospital in Amman, and from there, flown to Italy aboard a military aircraft—a six-hour journey with no rest.

Abu Hjeer has started her first semester at the University of Tuscia, studying Italian in preparation for her new specialization in artificial intelligence. She is trying to rebuild her future on the ruins of a pain that remains alive in her memory.

“I never imagined studying away from Gaza,” Abu Hjeer said, “but maybe education is the only thing that can bring our lives back after everything that's been shattered.”

Behind the humanitarian image lies an ongoing academic debate over the meaning and limits of solidarity in a colonial context.

While some see these programs as a chance for academic survival, others fear they may contribute to Gaza's intellectual depletion, especially amid the blockade and absence of a reconstruction plan or reintegration strategy. 

“We study and live here, but our minds are there. The scholarship saved my life, but it stole me from my homeland,” said one international student who did not want to be named due to safety concerns.

Amer said the attack on education is not just about destruction.

“It's the erasure of a people, their culture, and their future,” he said. He pointed to the bombing of all of the universities in Gaza. Al-Israa University was turned into a military base and later leveled to the ground. “This systematic assault on education—what many call scholasticide …  it's the deliberate silencing of a nation's capacity to think, to remember, and to rebuild.”

After serving as dean at Gaza University, Amer was evacuated through Egypt and Germany before the Rafah border was closed in May 2024.

“Leaving Gaza was not liberation at all. For me, it was just survival,” he said. “Living abroad feels like psycho-cide: carrying the constant weight of fear and guilt for loved ones still trapped under bombardment and famine, while trying to continue living and working.”

Several countries have launched emergency programs to evacuate and support Palestinian students.

In Italy, the University Corridors for Refugees program evacuated a group of students and researchers through Jordan to Italian universities as part of a broader scholarship initiative.

In the U.K., several students from Gaza were hosted under fully funded scholarships, including programs such as Chevening.

Other examples include the Universities of Cagliari and Sassari in Sardinia, which offered 10 scholarships worth 12,000 euros, or about $13,800, each to students from Gaza; the Ireland-Palestine Scholarship Programme; and the France Excellence initiative.

Yet despite this solidarity, the struggle to obtain visas and exit permits continues to be a daily battle fought amid blackouts, blockades, and bureaucracy.

The Palestine Education Cluster of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that hundreds of students granted scholarships abroad remain trapped between borders and visa delays, or lost their documents due to destruction or university shutdowns. Even those accepted often saw their opportunities canceled because of bureaucratic delays.

But some academics warn that these efforts may become symbolic gestures that ease international pressure without addressing the root problem: the destruction of Gaza's educational infrastructure.

Amer said that Gaza needs more than just scholarships for some students. 

“What Gaza needs is not individual rescue but collective reconstruction—a ‘de-scholasticide' movement. That means… restoring education inside Gaza, not draining its talents abroad,” he said. “Palestinian universities need strategic rebuilding, not short-term relief. … This isn't charity—it's justice. 

Universities are the backbone of any future Palestine,” he added. “Supporting them means protecting the right to learn, to think, to exist.”

A report by the Arab Center Washington, D.C., noted that “The US academy must reckon with the reality that offering scholarships to students from Gaza, in lieu of divestment, months into Israel's genocidal war is too little, too late.”

Many academics within Gaza have expressed a desire to remain in Palestine and reaffirmed calls for a focus on rebuilding scholarship. 

“We reaffirm our collective determination to remain on our land and to resume teaching, study, and research in Gaza, at our own Palestinian universities, at the earliest opportunity,” a group of dozens of scholars and administrators wrote in an open letter published in Al Jazeera. “We call upon our friends and colleagues around the world to resist the ongoing campaign of scholasticide in occupied Palestine, to work alongside us in rebuilding our demolished universities, and to refuse all plans seeking to bypass, erase, or weaken the integrity of our academic institutions.”

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla quits as MP after being accused of recruiting 17 men who are trapped in war-torn Ukraine

A daughter of the former South African president Jacob Zuma has resigned as an MP, after being accused of tricking 17 South African men into fighting for Russia in Ukraine by telling them they were travelling to Russia to train as bodyguards for the Zumas' uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party.

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, 43, the most visible and active in politics of her siblings, volunteered to resign and step back from public roles while cooperating with a police investigation and working to bring the men home, the MK chair, Nkosinathi Nhleko, said at a press conference in Durban.

Magasela Mzobe, another MK official, told reporters: “As far as we know, the resignation has got nothing to do with admission of guilt or the organisation finding her guilty,” adding that MK party had not been involved with the group of men who ended up trapped on the frontline of the war in Ukraine.

On 22 November another of Zuma's daughters, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube, filed a police report alleging that her sister Zuma-Sambudla and two others, Siphokazi Xuma and Blessing Khoza, had recruited the men, including eight of their family members. Zuma-Mncube did not suggest a motive for her sister's alleged recruiting in the statement she made to police.

Zuma-Sambudla then filed an affidavit of her own, claiming she was “a victim of deception, misrepresentation and manipulation” by Khoza after the men were recruited for what she had believed was a legitimate paramilitary training course.

Zuma-Sambudla said she went to Russia herself for a month of the training, in excerpts from her statement to police published by local media: “I experienced only non-combat, controlled activities. I was never exposed to combat, never deployed.”

She claimed that she had “shared information innocently” with others, who then volunteered to go to Russia themselves. She added: “I would not, under any circumstances, knowingly expose my own family or any other person to harm.”

The South African outlet News24 said it had received videos from three of the men trapped in Ukraine, in which they alleged Zuma-Sambudla persuaded them to sign contracts in Russian that they did not understand and said she would spend a year in Russia training alongside them.

Zuma, MK party's president, was at the press conference but did not speak. The 83-year-old has been married six times and currently has four wives and more than 20 children. Polygamy is recognised in South Africa via a law governing “customary” marriages.

Zuma was ousted as South Africa's president in 2018, after being accused of directing a period of huge corruption known as “state capture”, allegations he has always denied. He founded MK party in December 2023, winning 14.6% of the vote in the 2024 national elections.

On Tuesday, police confirmed they were investigating, after receiving both affidavits. Zuma-Sambudla did not return calls and messages seeking comment. Khoza and Xuma could not be reached for comment.

On 6 November the office of South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said it was investigating how the men became trapped in eastern Ukraine and was working to bring them home, after receiving “distress calls for assistance”.

The men “were lured to join mercenary forces involved in the Ukraine-Russia war under the pretext of lucrative employment contracts”, it said, noting that South Africans were not permitted to assist or fight for foreign militaries without government authorisation.

Zuma-Sambudla has consistently posted her support for Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, online. “We Love You Both LOUDLY And UNAPOLOGETICALLY So … I'll Drink To That” she posted on X, then Twitter, with a photo of her father and Putin making a toast, on 22 February 2022, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. In May, she posted on X: “I Stand With Russia,” alongside photos of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, although it was not clear if she had taken the photos herself or when they were taken.

South Africa's African National Congress party, which forced Zuma to stand down as president in 2018, has long been close to Russia after the Soviet Union supported its struggle against apartheid. South Africa's government, whose foreign policy is still controlled by the ANC although it is now in a coalition, has refrained from criticising Russia for invading Ukraine. It has tried to present itself as a neutral arbiter in the search for a peace deal.

Zuma-Sambudla is on trial on charges of inciting violence in posts on X, during deadly riots that erupted in 2021 when her father was sent to jail for contempt of court. She has denied the allegations.

Andriy Yermak, head of the President's Office, submitted his resignation following searches by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) at his premises earlier on Nov. 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced.

Yermak is being investigated by the NABU in a case involving state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom, the biggest corruption investigation during Zelensky's presidency. Eight suspects have been charged in the Energoatom case, and Timur Mindich, a close associate of the president, is allegedly the ringleader.

"There will be a reset of the President's Office," Zelensky said. "Andriy Yermak, the head of the President's Office, has submitted his resignation. I am grateful to Andriy for always presenting Ukraine's position in the negotiation track exactly as it needed to be." 

Zelensky said he wanted to "avoid rumors and speculation."

"As for the new head of the (President's) Office, tomorrow I will hold consultations with those who could lead this institution," he added.

A decree on Yermak's dismissal has been published on the official website of the President's Office.

Zelensky also commented on who would represent Ukraine instead of Yermak, who was appointed to lead a delegation in the U.S.-Ukraine talks in Switzerland on Nov. 23.

He said that the Ukrainian delegation in the peace talks would include the secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, the head of the General Staff, the Foreign Ministry, and intelligence officials. 

Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, is also under investigation in the Energoatom corruption case, but has not been charged so far. 

Two other officials implicated in the corruption scandal, Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, were fired on Nov. 19. They have not been charged yet. 

Zelensky said that he expected new energy and justice ministers to be appointed soon. 

"The current ministers must be assessed in a way that allows for clear conclusions about whether they are capable of meeting the challenges of both this winter and this war," he added. 

Ukrainska Pravda reported on Nov. 24, citing its sources, that Yermak is implicated in the corruption scandal, and investigators refer to him as "Ali Baba."

Ukraine's chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko said earlier in November that, according to investigators, "Ali Baba is holding meetings and assigning tasks to law enforcement agencies to ensure they persecute NABU detectives and anti-corruption prosecutors."

One of the luxury houses near Kyiv financed through the Energoatom corruption scheme was meant for Yermak, a law enforcement source told the Kyiv Independent. 

The President's Office did not respond to requests for comment. 

Appointed in 2020, Yermak has gathered unprecedented influence within the Ukrainian government. Despite long-standing criticism, Zelensky previously said he trusted Yermak and dismissed claims that the latter wielded excessive power.


"I'm a bit disappointed that Yermak has not been charged yet — I hope that's temporary."
    

"Yermak is a powerful manager. I respect him for his results. He does what I tell him to do, and he carries out these tasks," Zelensky said in an interview with Bloomberg last year.

Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a lawmaker from the opposition Holos party, told the Kyiv Independent that the move is a clearly positive step, saying it addresses two main issues. 

"The first issue is updating state governance, which, especially in the absence of elections, has been widely discussed," he said. "The second is an appropriate response to the level of scandal that arose in connection with the Mindich case."

"There is no one within the system or outside it who sees this as a negative step, only positive."

Zheleznyak added that the country would not be weakened by Yermak's departure if Zelensky, together with parliament and the government, quickly forms a new team.

When asked who might replace Yermak, Zheleznyak said four candidates are being discussed: Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, and Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal. 

In his view, Shmyhal would be the most suitable choice for the role.

Inna Sovsun, another lawmaker from the Holos party, said the resignation came as a surprise despite long-standing calls for it.

"Frankly, this resignation was unexpected," she said. "It was desired, even dreamed of, but still unexpected. We remember the president saying he would dismiss Yermak only if there was evidence of his involvement in corruption schemes."

"So now there is a question of what ultimately prompted the president to act." 

Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, called the resignation a positive step but said it must be followed by real accountability.

"I'm a bit disappointed that Yermak has not been charged yet — I hope that's temporary," she said. "By dismissing Yermak, Zelensky chose to stand with the people rather than with his corrupt inner circle."

Lawmakers from Zelensky's Servant of the People party also welcomed the decision.

"It's the right decision by both Yermak, who tendered his resignation, and the president, who had accepted the resignation," Oleksandr Merezhko, a top lawmaker from Zelensky's party, told the Kyiv Independent

He added that the next chief of staff may come from outside the current presidential team.

"I don't know who might be the new chief of staff — it might be someone from outside the President's Office, because the president wants to reshuffle it," he said.

Mykyta Poturaiev, another lawmaker from Zelensky's party, said the president ultimately made the only responsible choice.

"Yermak staying in his chair could definitely lead us to bad consequences on the international arena and to a deepening of our domestic social crisis," he told the Kyiv Independent.  

Poturaiev added that the focus should not be on Yermak's replacement but on dismantling the system he built. The real issue, he said, lies in the governance model Yermak designed. 

Even "a saint," he said, could be put into the role and "in two months or half a year, this saint person can transform into a devil," noting that "Lucifer started as an angel."

Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, lawmaker from the Holos party, said he does not believe the decision came too late.

"We can thank the president for this difficult but timely decision," he added. 

On the international stage, Guillaume Mercier, a spokesperson for the European Commission, said Brussels was closely monitoring the developments unfolding in Kyiv.

"We have seen the news about today's searches by NABU and SAPO and the resignation of the head of the President's Office. We understand investigations are ongoing," he told the Kyiv Independent.

Mercier stressed that the anti-corruption drive remains central to Ukraine's EU bid, noting that accession requires "continuous efforts to guarantee a strong capacity to combat corruption and the respect for the rule of law."

Good morning.

Donald Trump has said he will “permanently pause migration from all third world countries”, a day after two national guard members were shot in Washington DC in an attack that authorities suspect was carried out by an Afghan national.

The president said his administration would “end all federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens” and remove “anyone who is not a net asset to the United States”. It was unclear how he would carry out such a pause, as his previous attempts have been challenged by the courts and Congress.

Trump's social media post followed his announcement of the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of two guard members shot in the attack close to the White House on Wednesday.

Authorities suspect the shooting was carried out by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the US in September 2021 after the country's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. He was granted asylum in April this year, under the Trump administration, Reuters reported.

What do we know about the other guard member? Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life, according to the president.

What does Trump mean by ‘third world'? He did not identify the countries he intended to target or specify what he meant by the phrase.

US regulators say they are taking “very seriously” allegations that top banks may have facilitated Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activity, as they faced calls to investigate executives, including the former Barclays boss Jes Staley.

In correspondence seen by the Guardian, officials from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currencyand the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said they had reviewed a letter from the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, which raised concerns over bankers' alleged support for the convicted child sex offender Epstein.

What has Warren said about Staley? She said he allegedly protected Epstein's access to the banking system while working at JP Morgan in the early 2000s.

The death toll from the Hong Kong apartment complex fire that began on Wednesday has risen to 128, with about 200 missing, officials have said, as rescue efforts ended.

Fire crews combed the complex for survivors after the blaze swept through seven of its eight towers in one of the city's deadliest fires. The inferno at the site, which housed more than 4,600 people, began during building renovations. The authorities said they believed a highly flammable styrofoam found in every elevator window fuelled the intensity of the fire.

What do we know about the missing people? About 200 people remain unaccounted for, including 89 unidentified bodies. Officials said the fire was extinguished but they needed to wait for the towers to cool before entering, as some areas remained above 392F (200C). Investigators estimate it will take three to four weeks to gather the evidence.

A Palestinian-American 16-year-old was released on Thursday after spending nine months in an Israeli jail, after soldiers took him from his home in the West Bank during a night raid when he was 15.

The Canadian minister of culture has quit the cabinet over Mark Carney's controversial oil pipeline deal, saying Indigenous nations were not consulted and warning of “major environmental impacts”.

Israel is still committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza despite last month's ceasefire, Amnesty International has said, citing its restriction of supplies and essential services.

Venezuela has banned six international airlines, accusing them of “state terrorism”, as tensions with the US escalate.

Small tweaks to the tone of the political content fed to users of X over one week can drive political polarization by an amount that would have historically taken at least three years, research has found. An experiment to measure the power of Elon Musk's platform to drive division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were slightly boosted, Democrats and Republicans experienced a significant increase in their unfavourable feelings towards the other.

In the run-up to the release of Blue Moon, their 11th movie together, Ethan Hawke and Richard Linklater sat down and talked about the legacy of Philip Seymour Hoffman, having a healthy partnership, and how playing the lyricist Lorenz Hart – who was 5ft and bald – gave Hawke a different outlook on the world.

Climate deniers claim more people die of extreme cold than extreme heat – and so argue that inaction on global heating is the correct course, though this position ignores the myriad other climate impacts, from flooding and fires to crop failures. George Monbiot set out to discover whether the claim about extreme cold is true – and found there were huge gaps in our data from most of the world's hottest countries.

The Guardian music critic Alexis Petridis describes himself as not being a listener “who requires music to be melodic or rhythmically straightforward”. And yet a real appreciation of free jazz had long remained out of grasp for him – so he set out on a journey into the world of a much-reviled genre. He describes Machine Gun by the Peter Brötzmann Octet as “furious and completely unremitting, like a bomb that won't stop going off for the best part of an hour”.

RFK Jr signed order withdrawing rule that would mandate testing for the cancer-linked toxin in talc-based makeup

The Food and Drug Administration is poised to kill a proposed rule that would require testing for toxic asbestos in talc-based cosmetics, a problem that has been linked to cancer.

Talc is widely used, including in cosmetics, food, medication and personal care products. The order was signed by health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, leader of the “Make America healthy again” (Maha) movement.

A stated cornerstone of the movement, which helped propel Donald Trump to office, is to help eliminate toxins like asbestos from food, medicine and personal care products. The move has shocked health campaigners

“Nothing could make America less healthy than having a cancer causing product in cosmetics,” said Scott Faber, vice-president of government affairs with the Environmental Working Group non-profit, which has lobbied for stricter regulations around talc. “It's hard to understand why we would revoke a rule that simply requires companies to test for asbestos.”

The FDA did not immediately post a press release announcing the move, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in a legal notice posted to the federal registry, the agency wrote that the decision was in response to comments it received about potential “unintended consequences” for companies that produce drugs, which suggests drugmakers were opposed to testing.

“Good cause exists to withdraw the proposed rule at this time,” the notice states.

Asbestos is a group of six naturally occurring fibrous minerals used to make products resist heat, fire and electricity. No safe level of exposure is considered safe, and it is banned in more than 50 countries. The substance is a known human carcinogen linked to an estimated 40,000 deaths annually.

Cosmetic companies have known since the 1950s that talc can be contaminated with asbestos, Faber said, but the public was not alerted in the early 1970s. Despite this, the industry persuaded the FDA to allow companies to rely on testing methods that can detect some, but not all, asbestos fibers.

Asbestos contamination has been regularly found in some talc-based cosmetics, including baby powder, which was disproportionately used by Black women. Personal care giant Johnson & Johnson discontinued US talc-based baby powder sales in 2020 amid mounting public pressure and nearly 38,000 lawsuits.

The company has so far paid out billions of dollars in settlements, and proposed another $6.5bn settlement for a class lawsuit alleging that it knowingly poisoned consumers. About 3,000 women in the UK last month took a case to the nation's high court that alleges Johnson & Johnson poisoned them.

Despite its high toxicity, clear dangers and widespread use, regulating it has been a tortuous process. An initial 1989 EPA ban on its use in most products was quickly overturned by a court, and efforts to pass similar bans have failed over the decades.

Joe Biden's EPA proposed a ban that was finalized late last year, but the Trump administration moved to withdraw it before reversing course in July.

The Cosmetics Modernization Act of 2022 included provisions that requires testing of talc-based cosmetics. The Biden administration began implementing the rule, but the Trump administration is now poised to kill it.

In its notice, the FDA said it was acting on Maha priorities in a complex area: “We are withdrawing the proposed rule to reconsider best means of addressing the issues covered by the proposed rule and broader principles to reduce exposure to asbestos, and to ensure that any standardized testing method requirements for detecting asbestos in talc-containing cosmetic products help protect users of talc-containing cosmetic products from harmful exposure to asbestos.”

Referring to RFK Jr, Faber said: “It's tragic that a person who has used most of his career to protect people from cancer doing this.”

            An Israeli military operation on a Syrian village Friday morning turned into the deadliest attack by a foreign nation on Syria since the ouster of former dictator Bashar al-Assad last year.
    


            At least 13 people were killed and 24 were injured after Israeli forces infiltrated the Beit Jinn village in southern Syria to capture two members of Jama'a Islamiya, a Lebanese Islamist militant group. The Israeli military said in a statement that the two members of the militant group were planning future attacks on Israel.
    


            The incident turned deadly after clashes broke out, the Israeli military said in a statement. Six Israeli troops were wounded, including three seriously injured, while the two militants were captured and taken back to Israel, the statement added.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released bodycam footage of the nighttime raid, including what they called “face-to-face” combat during the encounter. The footage shows the chaotic moments as Israeli troops fire bursts of gunfire across a village road.
    


            Syria's Foreign Ministry said Israel launched a “savage and deliberate bombardment” that killed women and children after residents of the village “confronted” the Israeli soldiers.
    


            Five members of one Syrian family were killed in the Israeli attack, the medical director of al-Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus told Syria's state news agency. The attack also triggered “large-scale displacement” into neighboring areas after residents fled the bombardment, Syria's Foreign Ministry added.
    


Israeli strikes left Syria ‘stunned' and makes normalization ‘difficult,' Syrian foreign minister says



            After the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad last year, Israel occupied a number of villages in southern Syria, expressing distrust of the Islamist rebels led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. The Israeli government launched a series of air strikes and military incursions targeting Assad's military infrastructure and weaponry in an attempt to render them unusable to the Islamist rebels.
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also ordered his military to intervene in southern Syria to protect the Druze minority after clashes broke out in July between forces loyal to Syria's new government and members of the religious sect.
    


            Friday's attack was part of “ongoing routine operations in the area over recent months,” the IDF said.
    


            Israel's military interventions into Syria has added pressure on the new government of Al-Sharaa, who had expressed several times a desire to maintain peace with Israel as he attempts to rebuild Syria, devastated after more than a decade of civil war.
    


            The two nations held unprecedented direct talks on several occasions over the past year to discuss security arrangements, yet no permanent agreement has been reached so far.
    


            Al-Sharaa became the first Syrian President to visit the White House in Washington this month.

One of Russia's most prominent opposition figures is visiting Canada next week, hoping to push Ottawa to open its doors to Russian dissidents who are at risk of being deported from the United States and back into the arms of the Vladimir Putin's security services.

The lobbying mission by Ilya Yashin, one of Mr. Putin's loudest critics, is a follow-up to a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney that was published in September.

Russian dissidents ask Canada to take in colleagues facing deportation in the U.S.

That plea called on Canada to offer asylum to anti-war Russians being held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centres ahead of their expected deportation back to Russia. The letter was written by Mr. Yashin, along with fellow opposition leaders Yulia Navalnaya and Vladimir Kara-Murza.

Mr. Yashin said Mr. Carney's office hadn't formally replied to the letter, which was first published in The Globe and Mail on Sept. 3, though other Canadian officials had since reached out regarding the issue. The 42-year-old – who was released from a Russian prison last year after spending two years there for criticizing the invasion of Ukraine – was nonetheless optimistic about his three-day trip to Ottawa.

Mr. Yashin will be accompanied by Natalia Arno, president of the Free Russia Foundation, a Washington-based non-profit organization. The pair will hold meetings with MPs and senators, as well as Global Affairs Canada.

“I know it's a difficult request. We knew we wouldn't just write the letter, and they would reply ‘Yes of course!' It's a political process, a political question,” Mr. Yashin said in a video interview from his home in exile in Berlin. 

He nonetheless hoped the Canadian government would grasp the urgency of the situation. “Many people are in detention centres, many have already received their decisions, and could now be deported at any moment.”

Mr. Kara-Murza plans to separately raise the issue when he travels to Canada in the coming months to receive the honourary citizenship he received while he was also in jail for speaking out against the war in Ukraine. Mr. Kara-Murza told The Globe he would press “the need for Canada to use its strong voice in international affairs, including within the G7 and the OSCE, to defend democratic principles that the U.S. government in its current form sadly no longer defends.”

Mr. Yashin, a longtime anti-Putin activist and former Moscow city councillor, and Mr. Kara-Murza, a former aide to the assassinated opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, were both released from prison in August, 2024, as part of a Cold War-style prisoner exchange between Russia and the U.S. 

The Russian dissident who didn't want to leave Putin's jail

Ms. Navalnaya, meanwhile, is the widow of Alexey Navalny, who was Mr. Putin's most prominent critic until he was found dead in his prison cell in February, 2024, in what many Russians believe was another political murder.

The trio have since emerged as the de facto leaders of Russia's opposition in exile, amid a harsh Kremlin crackdown on almost all forms of dissent inside the country.

The September letter called for Canada to assist “several hundred opposition-minded Russians” who were in danger of being deported from the U.S. However, Ms. Arno said the opposition was now focused on getting Ottawa to open a special immigration channel for a list of 30 well-known anti-Putin activists.

“There are, I would say, over 1,000 Russians in ICE detention, if not more, but we cannot vouch for all of them. But we can vouch for those who are core activists, journalists and human rights defenders,” she said.

Two planeloads of Russian nationals – carrying more than 80 people total – flew from the U.S. to Moscow over the summer. Some were detained upon arrival. 

While Ms. Arno said there had since been a pause in such mass deportation flights, it may only have been a function of the 43-day U.S. government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. 

Alexei Navalny's prison diaries show 10 days of soul-searching with zero regrets

Ms. Arno said the Free Russia Foundation, which maintains an office in Kyiv, was also pushing for Canada to assist Ukrainian nationals being held in ICE detention and at risk of being deported back to a country that has been at war since Mr. Putin launched his invasion almost four years ago.

After the meetings in Ottawa, Mr. Yashin plans to visit Montreal and Toronto, where he will meet with members of the Russian-Canadian diaspora and urge them to do more to oppose Mr. Putin and his war.

“People can engage in different forms of political activism. Some can go to protests. Some can donate money to buy generators for Ukraine. Some can volunteer with opposition organizations,” said Mr. Yashin, who has organized a series of similar meetings with the Russian diaspora around Europe since his release from prison. 

“I want these groups of Russian diaspora, from different cities around the world, to become one movement – a movement against the war in Ukraine, a movement for Russia to become a free, peaceful and democratic country.”

            One of Ukraine's most influential political operators and a close aide of President Volodymyr Zelensky has resigned, hours after anti-corruption agencies raided his home – a major crisis as Kyiv faces new pressure from the US to accept a peace deal to end the war with Russia.
    


            Officially the chief of staff to the president, Andriy Yermak has often been seen as Ukraine's second most powerful man. He has been leading the Ukrainian delegation during recent talks in Geneva with Washington.
    


            Yermak's resignation, which was announced by Zelensky on Friday, complicates Kyiv's position going into crucial peace negotiations with the United States.
    


            “I want no one to have any questions about Ukraine today. Therefore, today we have the following internal decisions. First, there will be a reboot of the Office of the President of Ukraine. The head of the office, Andriy Yermak, has written a letter of resignation,” Zelensky said in his daily TV address.
    


            Yermak did not immediately issue a public statement. He confirmed earlier on Friday that the raid was going on, saying on Telegram that he was “fully cooperating” with the authorities.
    


            “The investigators are not encountering any obstacles. They have been given full access to the apartment, and my lawyers are on site, interacting with law enforcement officials,” he said.
    


            Both of Ukraine's two main anti-corruption bodies, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO), were involved in the searches, according to a statement released by the agencies on Friday.
    


            The statement did not disclose the reason for the raids, but the raid comes just two weeks after the two agencies announced a sweeping investigation into an alleged kickback scheme concerning Ukraine's critical energy infrastructure.
    


            The scandal has already taken down two of Zelensky's ministers and embroiled a former business associate from his days in the entertainment industry.
    


            But the latest development is particularly awkward for Zelensky given Yermak's recent elevation to the top of Ukraine's negotiating team.
    


            It is unclear who will take Yermak's spot in the next rounds of the negotiations, expected as early as the next few days. Announcing the resignation, Zelensky said he would be speaking to possible candidates to take up the chief of staff post on Saturday.
    


Energy scandal spells trouble for Zelensky as Ukrainians face another winter of power cuts



            The Ukrainian leader said the delegation that will be meeting the US team will include the Chief of the General Staff, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, and Ukraine's intelligence services.
    


            Talks with the United States have been difficult. Last week, the Trump administration came up with a 28-point peace plan that largely reflected Russia's extensive wishlist, including demands for Ukraine to give up territory, reduce its army and be barred from joining NATO.
    


            Ukrainian and European officials strongly opposed that version of the peace plan and Yermak's delegation managed to convince the US to revise it.
    


            More talks have been scheduled for the coming days. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he was expecting a US delegation to arrive to Moscow early next week, while Zelensky said the Ukrainian team was also set to meet the Americans.
    


            Russia said it was monitoring developments following Yermak's resignation.
    


            “What we see is that the corruption scandal and uncertainty, political uncertainty, that is caused by this scandal is growing and growing very fast day by day. One can hardly now make a prognosis on what is going to happen next,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN on Friday.
    


            “We are watching very carefully the situation, while of course pursuing our own goals by continuing the special military operation and then continuing to be open for negotiations and getting prepared for meeting with (US envoy Steve) Witkoff,” Peskov added.
    


            While some US officials, including President Donald Trump, have touted great progress being made this week, any chances of a swift breakthrough appear slim, especially after Putin indicated on Thursday that he is unwilling to budge from his maximalist demands.
    


            Ukraine has long been seen as one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, a major obstacle to its aspirations to join the European Union.
    


            The EU has made it clear to Kyiv that it must implement strong anti-graft measures if it wants to become a member and the Biden administration urged the Ukrainian government to do more to root out corruption in 2023.



            Fighting rampant government corruption was also Zelensky's main campaign pledge ahead of the 2019 election. A former comedian who played Ukraine's president on a hit TV show, Zelensky had zero political experience before his victory – but he tapped into voters' dismay on the issue.
    


            During the war, Zelensky has fired a slew of senior Ukrainian officials over corruption allegations, and his government has instigated anti-corruption measures, including the National Anti-Corruption Strategy.
    


            International organizations, including the EU, the United Nations and the G7 group of leading industrialized nations have previously praised Zelensky's government for its anti-corruption efforts, including the fact that even the country's top officials are no longer beyond the reach of law enforcement.
    


            Asked about the latest developments on Friday, Paula Pinho, the spokesperson for the European Commission, said the investigations “show that the anti-corruption bodies in Ukraine are doing their work.”
    


            But Zelensky's decision earlier this year to fast-track a new law that granted oversight of the NABU and SAPO agencies to the prosecutor general, a politically appointed figure, was seen as a series misstep.
    


            Criticised by anti-corruption watchdogs at home and abroad, as well as the EU, the move sparked Ukraine's first anti-government protests since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. The public anger forced Zelensky to quickly reverse track and restore the agencies' independence.
    


            But that episode, coupled with the recent allegations wielded against some of Zelensky's closest allies, including his former business partner Timur Mindich, his former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and now Yermak, are putting more pressure on the Ukrainian leader at a time when he is facing difficult negotiations with the US and Russia.

Editor's note: Andriy Yermak later submitted his resignation, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. 

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said on Nov. 28 that it was conducting searches at the premises of President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak. 

Yermak is being investigated by the NABU in a corruption case involving state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom, the biggest corruption investigation during Zelensky's presidency. Eight suspects have been charged in the Energoatom case, and Timur Mindich, a close associate of the president, is allegedly the ringleader.

"Today, the NABU and SAPO are indeed carrying out procedural actions at my home," Yermak wrote on Telegram. "The investigators are facing no obstacles. They have been given full access to the apartment, and my lawyers are present on site and are cooperating with law enforcement. I am providing full cooperation on my part."

The President's Office and Zelensky's press service did not respond to requests for comment. 

Ukrainian media outlet Dzerkalo Tyzhnia reported, citing its sources, that Yermak's office on Bankova Street in Kyiv and his apartment were being searched. 

Yermak has faced calls to resign amid the corruption scandal. 

Despite the backlash, Zelensky has refused to dismiss Yermak. Moreover, he appointed him to lead a Ukrainian delegation in the U.S.-Ukraine talks in Switzerland on Nov. 23 after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a controversial peace plan heavily skewed in Russia's favor. 

Experts told the Kyiv Independent that, by sending Yermak as a negotiator, Zelensky sought to protect him from investigators. 

One of the luxury houses near Kyiv financed through the Energoatom corruption scheme was meant for Yermak, a law enforcement source told the Kyiv Independent. The President's Office did not respond to requests for comment.

Suspects in the Energoatom case have given money to ex-Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov for the construction of high-end houses near Kyiv, the Bihus.info investigative journalism project reported on Nov. 12, citing audio tapes released by the NABU. 

Dzerkalo Tyzhnia reported, citing its sources, that the NABU was preparing charges against Yermak in the episode involving the luxury houses.

Meanwhile, a law enforcement source told the Kyiv Independent that Yermak had not been charged yet, and the searches were still continuing. 

Ukrainska Pravda also reported on Nov. 24, citing its sources, that Yermak is implicated in the corruption scandal, and investigators refer to him as "Ali Baba." 

Ukraine's chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko said earlier in November that, according to investigators, "Ali Baba is holding meetings and assigning tasks to law enforcement agencies to ensure they persecute NABU detectives and anti-corruption prosecutors." 

Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, said that "usually searches are conducted right before charges are presented to possible suspects."

"So therefore we can expect today or very soon charges against Andriy Yermak," she told the Kyiv Independent. 

A lawmaker from Zelensky's Servant of the People party said that "there hasn't really been much of a reaction" in the party so far. 

"Most people seemed to understand everything already," the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Kyiv Independent. "For the most part, there's silence. Only a few individuals have taken note of recent events. Some might be in shock."

The lawmaker also said that "some may have hoped there would be no further fallout, thinking that (Yermak's) appointment as head of the peace delegation meant the end of the story."

"But it turns out that this is only the beginning," he added. 

The lawmaker said that Yermak "should have been dismissed a long time ago.”

“Right now, this all looks bad in the eyes of our European partners, the source said. "It looks as if the president is protecting his friends. Instead of getting ahead of the situation and distancing himself, he appointed him as the head of the negotiating delegation.”

He also argued that Ukraine's political system is "now moving toward the worst-case scenario" and that Yermak's resignation "could lead to the collapse of the entire power structure, since everything has been held together by the head of the President's Office.”

Yaroslav Zheleznyak, a lawmaker from the opposition Holos party, said that “the president certainly should fire (Yermak).”

“I think that it will certainly change the way Zelensky rules the country," he added. "But it's good news." 

Zheleznyak also said that he expects protests and that he hopes "public support is totally on the side of the NABU and SAPO (Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office)." 

Inna Sovsun, a lawmaker from Holos, said that the searches undermine Yermak's authority amid the peace negotiations.

"Until this issue is resolved, he's a weak representative of Ukraine during the negotiations, and that's what I'm most afraid of," she added. "So he should at least be removed as the top negotiator, because that weakens his image in the negotiations.”

Yaroslav Yuschyshyn, another Holos lawmaker, said that two scenarios are possible: either the NABU and SAPO will conduct searches and bring charges without any obstacles, or the authorities will thwart the anti-corruption agencies and exacerbate the political crisis.

"In the first scenario, we have a chance to present ourselves as a European country that has corruption but is actively fighting it," he said. "In the second, the consequences will be much more difficult: public and international disappointment, and, as a result, complications in cooperation with the global community and a further decline in trust in the authorities."

Anastasia Radina, head of parliament's law enforcement committee representing Zelensky's party, said that the NABU and SAPO should "be allowed to do their job without any pushback from other law enforcement (agencies)." 

"I'm happy to see anti-corruption institutions actually able to do such an investigation," she told the Kyiv Independent. "As shocked as we might be, I think it's also important to stress that we finally have these anti-corruption institutions able to probe into people regardless of their position and political standing. This is something Ukraine didn't have 10 years ago." 

Oleksiy Honcharenko, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party, said that Yermak should be suspended after the searches and fired if he is charged. 

"These are tectonic shifts in our current political system because Yermak plays a crucial role there," he added. "He's not the main beneficiary in all this — Zelensky is. But Yermak is his key ally in running everything."

Donald Trump said the United States would suspend migration from what he called “third world countries”, a day after an Afghan national allegedly shot two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died and Andrew Wolfe, 24, was critically injured in the ambush-style shooting just yards from the White House on Wednesday.

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover,” Mr Trump wrote in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday evening.

Mr Trump did not identify any countries by name or explain what he meant by “third world countries.”

The US president has repeatedly expressed his fury over the targeted attack, calling it a “heinous assault” while placing blame on the Biden administration.

Authorities have charged suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old former special forces commander from Afghanistan, who came to the US in 2021 as part of a resettlement programme, over the shooting.

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,” he said on his social media platform, Truth Social.

Mr Trump said he would end all federal benefits and subsidies for “non-citizens”, adding he would “denaturalise migrants who undermine domestic tranquillity” and deport any foreign national deemed a public charge, security risk, or “non-compatible with Western civilization.”

Mr Trump's plan to suspend migrants from “third world countries” comes after the US paused immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely on Wednesday.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services, which oversees US immigration, said in a post on social media: “Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”

When Kabul fell to the Taliban, Mr Lakanwal was evacuated to the United States through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era programme, arriving in Washington state on September 8 2021.

Most of the 190,000 Afghans who arrived under the programme were allowed to enter and remain in the US for two years.

Mr Lakanwal was initially sponsored by a local faith organisation and worked low-paid jobs as his immigration case worked its way through the system.

His two-year parole expired in mid-2024, leaving him undocumented and he applied for asylum that December, claiming he feared Taliban reprisals.

After vetting, the Trump administration granted him asylum and a work permit in April this year.Nearly 24,000 Afghan soldiers and their families were secretly offered asylum in Britain after being caught up in the most serious data breach in history.

Described as “the most expensive email in history”, it led the Government to earmark £7bn to relocate Afghan refugees to Britain over the course of five years, to protect them from possible reprisals from the Taliban.

Sex offenders, corrupt officials and people imprisoned under the US-led coalition are also among those who have been accepted for resettlement in the UK in an apparent failure of vetting procedures.

Mr Trump's angry post, which finished by wishing Americans a happy Thanksgiving, marked an escalation in the anti-migrant policies of his second term dominated by a mass deportation campaign.

“These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations,” Mr Trump said on Thursday.

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday his administration will “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” following the death of a National Guard member in an attack near the White House.

The comments mark a further escalation of migration measures Trump has ordered since the shooting on Wednesday that investigators say was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the U.S. in 2021 under a resettlement program.

One National Guard member shot in D.C. has died, Trump says

Trump did not identify any countries by name or explain what he meant by third-world countries or “permanently pause.” He said the plan would include cases approved under former President Joe Biden's administration.

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,” he said on his social media platform, Truth Social.

Trump said he would end all federal benefits and subsidies for “non-citizens,” adding he would “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility” and deport any foreign national deemed a public charge, security risk, or “non-compatible with Western civilization.”

White House and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

UN agencies appealed to Washington to continue allowing asylum seekers access to the country and to be given due process.

“We expect all countries, including the United States, to honour their commitments under the 1953 Refugee Convention,” Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general, told Reuters.

UN human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.”

A National Guard member died on Thursday after being shot near the White House in an ambush that investigators say was carried out by an Afghan national.

Trump's remarks followed the death on Thursday of National Guard member Sarah Beckstrom, 20, who was shot in the ambush. Fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life,” Trump said.

Earlier, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under Biden's administration and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries.

The alleged gunman, identified by officials as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file seen by Reuters.

He entered the U.S. in a resettlement program set up by Biden after the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021 that led to the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and the country's takeover by the Taliban.

In a separate post prior to his “permanently pause” announcement, Trump claimed that hundreds of thousands of people poured into the U.S. totally “unvetted and unchecked” during what he described as the “horrendous” airlift from Afghanistan.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services on Wednesday stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely.

Trump indicated that his administration's goals are aimed at significantly reducing “illegal and disruptive populations,” suggesting that measures would be taken to achieve this outcome.

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”

Even though Lakanwal was in the country legally, the incident bolsters Trump's immigration agenda. Cracking down on both legal and illegal immigration has been a key focus of his presidency, and this case gave him an opportunity to broaden the debate beyond legality to include stricter vetting of immigrants.

Trump has already deployed additional immigration officers to major U.S. cities to achieve record deportation levels, including many long-term residents and individuals with no criminal record.

Over two-thirds of the roughly 53,000 people arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained as of Nov. 15 had no criminal convictions, according to ICE statistics.

PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) — The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago retracted comments where she asserted that no U.S. Marines were currently in the twin-island nation — a development that comes as the U.S. government seeks allies amid ongoing strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and beyond.

Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar told reporters Thursday that U.S. Marines were at the airport on the island of Tobago working on its radar, runway and road just days after she said they had left.

“They will help us to improve our surveillance and the intelligence of the radars for the narco-traffickers in our waters and outside our waters,” she said, without providing details.

Trinidad and Tobago's attorney general, and the ministers of defense and homeland security did not immediately return messages seeking comment on Friday.

It was not clear if the U.S. government plans to use the radar that they're working on at the Tobago airport.

It also wasn't clear whether they were installing a new radar or upgrading the current one.

Persad-Bissessar met Wednesday with Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. President Donald Trump's primary military adviser, who traveled to Trinidad and Tobago.

A day after the visit, Persad-Bissessar told reporters that Trinidad had not been asked to be a base for any attack against Venezuela, and that Venezuela was not mentioned in recent conversations with the U.S.




Officials in Tobago have confirmed that at least one U.S. military plane recently touched down on the island, saying it was for the purpose of refueling.

Earlier this year, the U.S. approached the eastern Caribbean island of Grenada asking if they could install a temporary radar at its main international airport, but officials there have not said whether they would authorize such a move.

Grenada, like Trinidad and Tobago, is located close to Venezuela, with some experts saying that the ongoing U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean, the largest in generations, is a tactic to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to resign.

Earlier this week, the president of the Dominican Republic, Luis Abinader, announced that he would allow the U.S. government temporary access to restricted areas at an air base and at the Caribbean country's main international airport to help the U.S. in its ongoing fight against drug trafficking. He made the announcement with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side.

The U.S. strikes that began in early September have killed at least 83 people.

NEW YORK (AP) — Black Friday no longer tempts people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs, but the annual sales event still brings more shoppers into stores than any day of the year and rules as the U.S. retail industry's unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.

This year's kickoff arrived as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday. 

Despite the economic uncertainty, shoppers went hunting Friday morning for the deals that retailers traditionally have reserved for the day after Thanksgiving.

At Macy's Herald Square flagship store in New York City, customers who streamed in soon after the store opened at 6 a.m. found for deep discounts on clothes, shoes, linens and cosmetics. The footwear department had products selling for 40% to 50%. 

Nicholas Menasche, 19, from Queens, New York, shopped with his mother for shoes and clothing, and planned to head next to Best Buy for video games. Menasche, an intern at a bank, said he expected to spend around $1,200 this year on his holiday shopping, roughly the same amount as last year.

“It's a great tradition,” he said. “The stores are open really early.” 

Veronica Nam, 68, headed to the shoe department to buy Nike sneakers for her husband after spending $256 on Lacoste bedding that she estimated cost half the regular price. 




Nam said she thought Black Friday had the best holiday deals but that she would wait until after Christmas to finish buying gifts for other relatives. She said it was hard to know when to find the best prices given the unpredictability of President Donald Trump 's wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods and several years of inflation. 

“Food is very expensive,“ she said.

Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect.

“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said this week of shoppers' moods heading into Black Friday. 

While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers.

Market research firm Circana said that 40% of all general merchandise sold in September saw a price increase of at least 5% compared with the first four months of the year. Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. 

Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, foot traffic in recent weeks surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, said Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer.

“We're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” Renslow said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”

The growth in online sales also has been robust so far. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 23, U.S. consumers spent $79.7 billion, or 7.5% more than a year earlier, according to web tracking and analysis platform Adobe Analytics. They spent another $6.4  billion online on Thanksgiving Day, a  5.3% increase over last year, while taking advantage of better than expected deals, the firm said.

“Clearly, there's uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn't seem like it's changing how they are showing up for this season.”

According to Adobe Analytics, Thanksgiving Day was the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods, but Black Friday is the best time to buy TVs, toys and appliances online. Cyber Monday, however, should be the best time to buy apparel and computers.

Venezuelan leader urges troops to defend "every inch" of the nation from outside threats (Associated Press video.)

Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro delivered a defiant address in Caracas earlier this week, brandishing a sword and warning supporters to prepare for confrontation with what he called "imperialist aggression" as President Donald Trump said the United States will "very soon" begin stopping suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers on land.

Maduro appeared at a mass rally in the capital holding the sword of Simón Bolívar, the 19th-century independence leader regarded as the liberator of much of South America. Maduro told supporters that the country was facing a decisive moment. 

The Associated Press reported him saying that, "For anyone, whether civilian, politician, military, or police. Let no one make excuses. Failure is not an option. The homeland demands it! Our greatest effort and sacrifice. And with (Simon) Bolívar, I come to say that if the homeland demands it, the homeland will have our lives, if necessary," he declared while raising Bolívar's sword.

Maduro framed the situation as a struggle against what he described as external threats, urging Venezuelans to mobilize against any foreign aggression.

The address came as tensions have risen following months of U.S. maritime strikes that Washington says targeted vessels used by drug traffickers. 

Reuters has reported that more than 80 people have been killed since September, and a separate Reuters report on Friday detailed heightened surveillance and security crackdowns in coastal communities where the strikes occurred.

Speaking on Thanksgiving to U.S. service members, Trump said the United States will expand its efforts from sea interdiction to land operations. "In recent weeks, you've been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many. Of course, there aren't too many coming in by sea anymore. Have you probably noticed that?" Trump said.

He added that maritime operations have already stopped an estimated 85% of drugs arriving by sea. "You probably noticed that now people aren't wanting to be delivering by sea, and we'll be starting to stop them by land also. The land is easier, but that's going to start very soon."

Trump said traffickers are responsible for "hundreds of thousands of people a year" dying from the "poisons" brought into the United States. "We warn them, stop sending poison to our country," he said.

Earlier this month, Trump said he had not ruled out sending U.S. troops to Venezuela as part of the administration's crackdown on criminal networks tied to senior figures in Caracas. "No, I don't rule out that, I don't rule out anything," he said. 

He also left room for talks. "We may be having some conversations with Maduro, and we'll see how that turns out. They would like to talk," Trump told reporters over the weekend.

Since early September, U.S. strikes across the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have destroyed dozens of vessels. U.S. officials say many were linked to Venezuelan and Colombian criminal groups.

Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) dismissed President Donald Trump, who called the Minnesota Democrat  “retarded” for questioning his mental fitness.

“Release the MRI results,” Walz wrote on X shortly after midnight on Friday morning.

Walz's post was a reference to Trump's recent annual physical exam.

Walz was responding to a Thanksgiving post from Trump in which the president outlined his opposition to further migration from “third-world countries” and also made a jab at Walz. The president was making an argument for how the United States can be “just plain stupid when it comes to immigration.”

“As an example, hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great state of Minnesota,” Trump wrote. “The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both.”

In October, Trump “received preventative health screenings and immunizations, including annual influenza and updated COVID-19 boost vaccinations,” according to his physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella. Among these screenings was a magnetic resonance imaging exam. Trump told reporters earlier this month that “getting an MRI is very standard.”

“What, you think I shouldn't have it? Other people get it,” Trump said at the time. “I had an MRI. The doctor said it was the best result he has ever seen as a doctor.”

Trump is battling reports of declining health, which he largely dismisses by pointing to his cognitive test results. When an outlet hinted at signs of fatigue in Trump earlier this week, he acknowledged that he is not immune to the effects of aging.

“There will be a day when I run low on Energy, it happens to everyone, but with a PERFECT PHYSICAL EXAM AND A COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE TEST (“That was aced”) JUST RECENTLY TAKEN, it certainly is not now!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

The Washington Examiner contacted the White House for comment.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Charges against the man accused of shooting two National Guard members have been upgraded to first-degree murder after one of the soldiers died, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia announced Friday.

Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24 were hospitalized in critical condition after the Wednesday afternoon shooting near the White House. Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died.

U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro's office said the charges against Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, now include one count of first-degree murder, three counts of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence and two counts of assault with intent to kill while armed.

Beckstrom and Wolfe were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting mission that federalized the D.C. police force. The president has also deployed National Guard members to Democratic-run cities — from Chicago to Los Angeles — to assist with his mass deportation efforts.

Trump called the shooting a “terrorist attack” and criticized the Biden administration for enabling Afghans who worked with U.S. forces during the Afghanistan War to enter the U.S. The president has said he wants to “permanently pause migration” from poorer nations and expel millions of immigrants from the country. 

In an interview on Fox News, Pirro said there are “many charges to come” beyond the upgraded murder charge. She said her heart goes out to the family of Beckstrom, who volunteered to serve and “ended up being shot ambush-style on the cold streets of Washington, D.C., by an individual who will now be charged with murder in the first degree.”

Pirro declined to discuss the suspect's motive, saying officials have been working around the clock on that question. Investigators are continuing to execute warrants in the state of Washington, where Lakanwal lived, and other parts of the country, she said.




Wolfe remains in “very critical condition,” West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said Friday. He ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom's death

“These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,” Morrisey said. “Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.”

Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said. Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but his asylum was approved under the Trump administration, #AfghanEvac said in a statement.

Lakanwal has been living in Bellingham, Washington, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord, Kristina Widman. 

Lakanwal had briefly worked as an independent contractor for Amazon Flex, which allows people to use their own cars to deliver packages, a company spokesperson shared with The Associated Press. Lakanwal delivered packages from the end of July to the end of August and hadn't been active since. 

Mohammad Sherzad, a neighbor of Lakanwal's in Bellingham, told the AP in a phone interview Friday that Lakanwal was polite, quiet and spoke very little English. 

Sherzad said he attended the same mosque as Lakanwal and had heard from other members that Lakanwal was struggling to find work. Some of his children attended the same school as Lakanwal's children, Sherzad said.

“He was so quiet and the kids were so polite, they were so playful. But we didn't see anything bad about him. He was looking OK,” Sherzad said. Sherzad said Lakanwal “disappeared” about two weeks ago. 

In his address to the troops Thursday, Trump said that Lakanwal “went cuckoo. I mean, he went nuts.” 

People who knew Lakanwal say he served in a CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before immigrating to the United States. Lakanwal worked in one of the special Zero Units in the southern province of Kandahar, according to a resident of the eastern Afghan province of Khost who identified himself as Lakanwal's cousin. He said Lakanwal was originally from the province and that his brother had worked in the unit as well. 

The cousin spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. He said Lakanwal had started out working as a security guard for the unit in 2012 and was later promoted to become a team leader and a GPS specialist. A former official from the unit, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said Lakanwal's brother was a platoon leader.

Zero Units were paramilitary units manned by Afghans but backed by the CIA that also served in front-line fighting with CIA paramilitary officers. Activists had attributed abuses to the units. They played a key role in the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, providing security around Kabul International Airport as the Americans and withdrew from the country.

Beckstrom had enlisted in 2023, the same year she graduated high school, and served with distinction as a military police officer with the 863rd Military Police Company, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. 

“She exemplified leadership, dedication, and professionalism,” the statement said, adding that Beckstrom “volunteered to serve as part of Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful, helping to ensure the safety and security of our nation's capital.” 

The president called Beckstrom an “incredible person, outstanding in every single way.” 

On Wednesday night, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who had entered under the Biden administration initiative that brought roughly 76,000 people to the country, many of whom had worked as interpreters and translators. 

The program has faced intense scrutiny from Trump and others over allegations of gaps in the vetting process, even as advocates say there was extensive vetting and the program offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Joseph Edlow said in a statement that the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 “high-risk” countries “to the maximum degree possible.”

Edlow didn't name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns.

President Donald Trump said that one of the two West Virginia National Guard members shot by an Afghan national near the White House had died.

President Donald Trump says he wants to “permanently pause migration” from poorer nations and is promising to seek to expel millions of immigrants from the United States by revoking their legal status. He is blaming immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages as part of “social dysfunction” in America and demanding “REVERSE MIGRATION.”

His most severe social media post against immigration since returning to the Oval Office in January came after two National Guard members were shot while patrolling the streets of the nation's capital under his orders. One died and the other is in critical condition. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, announced Friday that charges against the suspect had been upgraded to first-degree murder.

Since the shooting not far from the White House, administration officials have pledged to reexamine millions of legal immigrants, building on a 10-month campaign to reduce the immigrant population. In a lengthy social media post late Thursday, the Republican president asserted that millions of people born outside the U.S. and now living in the country bore a large share of the blame for America's societal ills.

Here's what to know:








Mohammad Sherzad, a neighbor of Lakanwal's in Bellingham, Washington, told The Associated Press in a phone interview Friday that Lakanwal was polite, quiet and spoke very little English.

Sherzad said he attended the same mosque as Lakanwal and had heard from other members that Lakanwal was struggling to find work. Some of his children attended the same school as Lakanwal's children, Sherzad said.

“He was so quiet and the kids were so polite, they were so playful. But we didn't see anything bad about him. He was looking OK,” Sherzad said. Sherzad said Lakanwal “disappeared” about two weeks ago.

Beckstrom enlisted in 2023, the same year she graduated high school, and served with distinction as a military police officer with the 863rd Military Police Company, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement.

“She exemplified leadership, dedication, and professionalism,” the statement said, adding that Beckstrom “volunteered to serve as part of Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful, helping to ensure the safety and security of our nation's capital.”

Trump called Beckstrom an “incredible person, outstanding in every single way.”

Soon after Wednesday's shooting, Trump said he would send 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. It's not clear where the additional troops would come from.

As of early November, the D.C. National Guard had the largest number on the ground, with 949 members. In addition to West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama also had forces in the capital early this month.

A federal judge last week ordered an end to the Guard deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal.

Video reviewed by investigators showed Lakanwal “came around the corner” on Wednesday afternoon and immediately started firing at the troops, according to Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant D.C. police chief.

Troops ran over and held down the shooter, Carroll said, and he was taken into custody. Authorities believe he was the only gunman.

Carroll said that it was not clear whether one of the Guard members or a law enforcement officer shot Lakanwal.

The suspect's wounds were not believed to be life-threatening, one of the officials said.

Beckstrom, 20, and Wolfe, 24, were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard to the nation's capital as part of Trump's crime-fighting mission that involved taking over the local police department. There were nearly 2,200 Guard members from various states in D.C. for the mission.

Both Beckstrom and Wolfe were on orders in Washington since August, according to the West Virginia National Guard.

Beckstrom, a resident of Summersville, West Virginia, had volunteered for the operation “to ensure the safety and security of our nation's capital,” the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. She had graduated from Webster County High School in June 2023, and enlisted with the guard that month, serving “with distinction” as a military police officer, the guard said.

Wolfe, who is from Martinsburg, West Virginia, entered service in February 2019. He had graduated from Musselman High School as part of the Class of 2019, said Karla Troppman, a spokesperson for Berkeley County Schools in West Virginia.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued a proclamation requesting that all West Virginians observe a statewide moment of silence or prayer at 2:15 p.m. Friday to honor Wolfe and Beckstrom.

He also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom's death. 

Wolfe serves with the 167th Force Support Squadron and Beckstrom served with the 863rd Military Police Company, the governor said in a news release. 

“These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,” Morrisey said. “Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.”

In an interview on Fox News, Pirro said there are “many charges to come” beyond the upgraded murder charge. 

She said her heart goes out to the family of Beckstrom, who volunteered to serve and “ended up being shot ambush-style on the cold streets of Washington, D.C., by an individual who will now be charged with murder in the first degree.”

Pirro declined to discuss the suspect's motive, saying officials have been working around the clock on that question. Investigators are continuing to execute warrants in the state of Washington and other parts of the country, she said.

She said Wolfe remains in critical condition and that “we still have hope.”

“We are doing everything we can to assist his family and to make sure that they have everything they need during this difficult time for them,” Pirro said.

Lakanwal, 29, had worked in a special CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before emigrating from Afghanistan, according to two sources who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, and #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the two-decade war.

He entered the U.S. in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden administration program that evacuated and resettled tens of thousands of Afghans after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country, officials said.

Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but his asylum was approved under the Trump administration, #AfghanEvac said in a statement.

Supporters have said there was extensive vetting and the program offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals.

Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, announced Friday that charges against a man who authorities say shot two National Guard members have been upgraded to first-degree murder.

The announcement comes after the death of one of the soldiers.

Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were hospitalized in critical condition after Wednesday afternoon's shooting and Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died.

As of Thursday morning, Rahmanullah Lakanwal faced charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence, but Pirro suggested that the charges would be upgraded to first-degree murder if the victims did not survive.

Pirro said that Lakanwal drove across the country to launch an “ambush-style” attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. He initially faced charges of assault with intent to kill while armed and possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Pirro said that “it's too soon to say” what the suspect's motives were.

People who work with refugees are worried that those who fled dangerous situations to start again in America will face backlash after authorities say an Afghan national shot two National Guard soldiers this week, killing one of them.

Many Afghans living in the U.S. are afraid to leave their houses, fearing they'll be swept up by immigration officials or attacked with hate speech, said Shawn VanDiver, president of the San Diego-based group #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the two-decade war.

“They're terrified. It's insane,” VanDiver told The Associated Press Thursday. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. He doesn't represent all Afghans. He represents himself.”

The fugitive Virginia high school football coach who disappeared amid an alleged child pornography investigation has had his profile scrubbed from the school's website. 

On Tuesday, authorities announced that they have obtained 10 warrants to charge Travis L. Turner, 46, with five counts of possession of child pornography and five counts of using a computer to solicit a minor. 

The investigation remains ongoing, with authorities adding that additional charges are pending. 

Turner was first reported missing as officers with the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation's Wytheville Field Office were en route to his Appalachia home to speak with him about the investigation on Friday, Nov. 21, according to authorities. Officials had visited Turner's home one day prior, and were returning only to speak with him and not make any arrests, police said.

Police have launched an extensive search across Wise County utilizing drones, K-9 units and foot patrols. He was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt, sweatpants and glasses, according to Virginia's missing person database. 

Just days after the investigation was announced and following Turner's disappearance, Union High School appeared to have scrubbed the football coach's profile from the online staff directory, according to ABC 7. 

Upon searching Turner's last name on the site, the only ‘Turner' listed as an employee is his eldest son, Bailey, who works as a physical education teacher, the Daily Mail reported.

In a previous statement, a spokesperson for Wise County Public Schools confirmed that a staff member employed by the district had been placed on administrative leave pending review of an external allegation. However, the statement did not identify the staff member involved or mention the charges filed against Turner. 

"A staff member has been placed on administrative leave with pay while an external agency reviews an allegation that was reported to the division," Superintendent Mike Goforth said in a statement at the time. "This is standard procedure and is not a determination of wrongdoing."

In an updated statement released later in the week, the school district acknowledged that law enforcement has since filed charges against the staff member who was already placed on leave.

"The individual remains on leave and is not permitted on school property or to have contact with students," Goforth said. "The division will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as this process moves forward. Because this is an active legal matter involving personnel, the division cannot comment further."

Wise County Public Schools did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment regarding Turner's current employment status. 

The allegations against Turner are not the first to uproot the Virginia high school community.

In 2023, Timothy Lee Meador, a teacher and coach at the same school, pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent liberties with a child and served one year and three months in prison, ABC 7 reported. 

The two men's employment at the school reportedly overlapped, but details regarding which sport Meador coached remain unclear. 

In light of the charges filed against Turner, his wife, Leslie Caudill Turner, has spoken out to deny the accusations after her husband was charged, telling The Daily Mail that "none of that is true."

"He's a good dad and a good husband, and we want him home. That's it," she said. "I don't know anything. I don't know anything. I'm sorry."

Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett weighs in on the death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner aboard a cruise ship and the FBI's investigation.

A relative of Anna Kepner, who died onboard a Carnival Cruise ship in early November, says the teenager "fought for her life" amid reports that her death was ruled a homicide.

18-year-old Anna was found dead while she was onboard the Carnival Horizon on Nov. 7 during a family vacation. Her death was ruled a homicide by "mechanical asphyxiation," according to ABC News, but authorities haven't announced a suspect or person of interest. The FBI is investigating Anna's death.

Relatives said Anna was found dead inside her room aboard the Carnival Horizon, which she shared with her stepbrother.

Krystal Wright, Anna's aunt, told Fox 35 Orlando she believes the 18-year-old cheerleader fought back.

"I know Anna fought. I know she fought for her life, so it's rough. It's rough," Wright said.

Anna's aunt said she's frustrated that there's still no arrest, despite the death reportedly being ruled a homicide.

"We don't understand why, if the boy is a suspect, why has he not been charged yet? What's happening there?" Wright asked. "It's turmoil. We're just sitting here waiting."

While authorities haven't announced any criminal charges, stepmother Shauntel Kepner revealed that Anna's 16-year-old stepbrother has been eyed as a suspect. She made the claim in a court filing amid a legal battle with her ex-husband Thomas Hudson.

Anna's 15-year-old ex-boyfriend recalled an instance where the stepbrother allegedly tried to get on top of her during a FaceTime call.

"When I was on FaceTime with her, and she was lying down, and her brother tried to go on top of her," the ex-boyfriend said.

The ex-boyfriend reported the incident to Anna's parents, saying she had previously complained about being "uncomfortable" around her stepbrother. Anna's ex-boyfriend said he'd be on the cruise had they not broken up.

In a court filing, Christopher Kepner, Anna's father, told People that "I want him to face the consequences … I will be fighting to make sure that does happen."

"He was the only one that was in the room, and the FBI has an ongoing investigation in which they will have to provide the evidence to say that he did do it or did not do this," Kepner said. "And I would've never thought that any of this would've happened."

            The origins of domestic cats — centuries before they conquered the world's sofas and internet memes — have long been murky. Now, ancient DNA is helping to fill in the blanks, and the findings shake up the traditional story.
    


            Archaeologists had thought that cats and humans began living with one another around 9,500 years ago in the Levant, which today includes parts of the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean, at the beginning of the Neolithic era when humans started growing crops.
    


            Stores of grain attracted rodents, which in turn enticed wildcats, and humans found it useful to keep those mouse catchers around, leading to the cats' eventual domestication. The oldest known cat remains in the archaeological record date from a burial in Cyprus from that time period.
    


            However, new analysis of genetic information recovered from cat skeletal remains at archaeological sites across Europe, the Middle East and Asia suggests that the domestic cats familiar today have far more recent origins and were not the first felines to live alongside humans.
    


            “We started to interrogate the bones that are ascribed to domestic cats that go back to 10,000 years and find which actually have the same genomes as the modern cat population that now dominates,” said Greger Larson, a professor in the school of archaeology at England's University of Oxford. Larson coauthored two papers resulting from the research that published Thursday.
    


            “It then completely undermines that narrative,” Larson said.
    


A Europe-focused study published in the journal Science examined 87 ancient and modern cat genomes and found that the domestic cat, which has the scientific name Felis catus, originated in North Africa, rather than the Levant as previously thought. Its ancestors were closely related to the African wildcat, or Felis lybica lybica.
    


            The cats established the gene pool of the modern domestic cat and appeared to spread around Europe with the rise of the Roman Empire about 2,000 years ago, the study noted.
    


            By the year 730, the domestic cat had arrived in China, likely hitching a ride in trading caravans along the Silk Road, according to a second study published in the journal Cell Genomics. It analyzed DNA from 22 felid bones unearthed in China over the past 5,000 years.
    


            Before then, an entirely different species of feline unrelated to the domestic cat or its ancestor lived alongside humans from at least 5,400 years ago until AD 150, the researchers discovered. Known scientifically as Prionailurus bengalensis, or the leopard cat, its remains — found previously at seven archaeological sites in China — were identified in the new analysis.
    


            Native to Asia, Prionailurus bengalensis is a small wildcat that does not naturally interbreed with Felis species. But beginning in the 1980s, modern cat breeders interbred the two to produce the Bengal cat, according to the study.
    


            The leopard cat's relationship with humans was historically “commensal” — the two benefited from one another — but it never became fully domesticated despite living alongside people for more than 3,500 years, said Shu-jin Luo, a senior author of the China-focused study and a researcher at Peking University's School of Life Sciences in Beijing. People benefited from the wild felines' mouse-catching skills, while the cats had a ready supply of rodents to eat — but there was likely never any deliberate control over the leopard cat population.
    


            “The human-leopard cat commensal relationship eventually ended, and leopard cats returned to their natural habitats, living today as our elusive and hidden neighbors,” Luo said.
    


            One hypothesis for why the leopard cat never ended up fully domesticated stems from its reputation for preying on chickens as well as rodents, unlike domestic cats that are better at catching mice. In Chinese folklore, the leopard cat is known as the “chicken-catching tiger,” a reference to its appetite for poultry, Luo explained.
    


            “After the Han Dynasty, the rise and change in poultry farming practices — from free ranging to cage-based systems — likely escalated human–leopard cat conflict,” Luo said via email. “Their strong tendency to prey on chickens, and to overkill in confined spaces, would have made leopard cats increasingly unwelcome around human settlements.”
    


            The disappearance of leopard cats from human settlements coincided with the turbulent centuries between the fall of China's Han dynasty in AD 220 and the rise of the Tang dynasty in AD 618, when a colder, drier period reduced agricultural output, disrupting the leopard cat's niche, Luo said.
    


            “This does not imply that leopard cats went extinct; rather, they simply retreated from human settlements and continued to persist in their natural forest habitats,” she added.
    


            The new environments that emerged in agricultural communities such as China meant changing relationships with lots of different animals, including wildcats, said William Taylor, assistant professor and curator of archaeology at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, who studies the domestication of animals. He wasn't involved in the research.
    


            “I think it's very cool to see these DNA studies help trace how the story of cats of Europe and Asia — this ubiquitous little critter that many folks take for granted — takes us back to the first trade routes like the Silk Roads that were built on travel by animals like horse, donkey, and camel.”
    


            The﻿ new findings that trace the origins of the domestic cat to North Africa are perhaps not surprising, said Jonathan Losos, a professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis.
    


            Cats play an important role in the iconography of ancient Egypt, he noted in a commentary published alongside the Science study. Tomb walls depict cats as family members wearing collars, earrings and necklaces; eating from dishes; and sitting under chairs.
    


            However, it isn't clear whether the land of the pharaohs was where the entire domestication process occurred, or if it was simply the finishing school where mice catchers became household companions, Losos wrote.

            The Europe-focused study found that the cats at archaeological sites earlier than 200 BC were genetically identifiable as European wildcats of the species Felis silvestris, not domestic cats, even though their skeletons were difficult to tell apart. It is still possible that the wildcats lived among humans, Losos noted, as kittens of wildcat species can be relatively easily tamed.
    


            The work to untangle the history of cats is ongoing, and Losos noted a lack of archaeological samples from North Africa and southwest Asia means the domestic cat's origin story is far from complete.
    


            “Ever sphinx-like, cats give up their secrets grudgingly,” he added. “Yet more ancient DNA is needed to unravel these mysteries of long ago.”

JOHANNESBURG (AP) — A daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma has resigned as a lawmaker, her party said Friday, after coming under police investigation for allegedly tricking 17 men into joining a Russian mercenary group fighting in the Ukraine war.

Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla had served as a lawmaker since June 2024 for the MK Party, an opposition party led by her father. Jacob Zuma created the party in 2023 following his expulsion from South Africa's then-ruling African National Congress.

Police say they are investigating any role Zuma-Sambudla played in luring the South Africans to Russia after they ended up on the front lines of the conflict in Ukraine.

The South African government said early this month it had received distress calls from 17 South African men, aged 20 to 39, who said they were trapped in Ukraine's war-torn eastern Donbas region. When they left South Africa, they thought they were going to take up lucrative employment contracts, the government said. 

According to police, an affidavit submitted by Zuma-Sambudla's half-sister, Nkosazana Bonganini Zuma-Mncube, alleged that Zuma-Sambudla and two other people tricked the South Africans into fighting in the war by promising to provide them with security training in Russia. The identities of the other two people were unclear.

The affidavit alleges the South Africans were handed over to a Russian mercenary group and forced to fight in the war. It also says that eight of the 17 men were members of Zuma-Sambudla's and Zuma-Mncube's extended family. 




The South African foreign ministry and police are working with international law enforcement organizations to bring the men home, according to the parliamentary committee on foreign relations.

Nkosinathi Nhleko, the national chairman of the MK party, announced Zuma-Sambudla's resignation during a press briefing on Friday. He said that Zuma-Sambudla had provided party officials with a report regarding the alleged involvement of young South Africans in military operations in Ukraine. 

However, he did not disclose any details, citing the “sensitivity” of the situation. He also denied the party had any involvement in sending the South Africans to Russia. He said the party would engage with the men's families and “support them in their efforts for the return of these young people.”

Zuma-Sambudla is currently on trial on unrelated charges relating to deadly anti-government riots in South Africa in 2021. She has pleaded not guilty to inciting violence through social media posts.

President Donald Trump said that the United States will “permanently pause” all immigration from “third-world countries” and pursue a policy of “reverse migration” in response to the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. 

Trump's social media post on immigration followed his announcement of the death of Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two guard members shot in the attack close to the White House on Wednesday. Beckstrom, a National Guard member from West Virginia, was 20 years old.

Federal officials have said that Wednesday's attack on the two troops near the White House was carried out by an Afghan national, Rahmanulla Lakanwal, who worked with a CIA-backed group during the U.S. war in Afghanistan. Records indicate that Lakanwal entered the U.S. in September 2021 following the evacuation from Afghanistan. 

Trump posted shortly after the announcement of Beckstrom's death that his administration would take steps to deport foreign nationals who are “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

“I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or who is incapable of loving our Country,” Trump posted.

Trump also said that “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.” 

When asked about which countries constituted “third-world” in light of Trump's announcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement referred the Washington Examiner to the 19 countries listed in Trump's June Executive Order restricting the entry of foreign nationals from dangerous countries. That list includes Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, and Venezuela, among others.

The president also said he would “end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country” and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.” 

Exactly how this would be carried out is unclear, as it is likely to receive significant pushback from the courts and Congress.

Trump on Thursday afternoon also directed the federal agency that oversees legal immigration into the U.S. to conduct reviews of green card holders from the 19 countries of concern. 

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow posted on X Thursday that the president directed him to conduct “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”

“The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration's reckless resettlement policies,” wrote Edlow.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McCaughlin said in a statement that Lakanwal was paroled into the US by the Biden Administration. Following a court settlement in September 2023, USCIS was bound to adjudicate all Afghan asylum claims on an expedited basis.

Records indicate that Lakanwal was granted asylum this April, but McCaughlin said that, regardless of his asylum status, he would not have been removed from the country because of his parole status. 

“Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” McCaughlin said in the statement. “The Trump Administration is also reviewing all asylum cases approved under the Biden Administration, which failed to vet these applicants on a massive scale.”

The Washington Examiner contacted the White House for more details.

President Donald Trump said that one of the two West Virginia National Guard members shot by an Afghan national near the White House had died.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump says he wants to “permanently pause migration” from poorer nations and is promising to seek to expel millions of immigrants from the United States by revoking their legal status. He is blaming immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages as part of “social dysfunction” in America and demanding “REVERSE MIGRATION.”

His most severe social media post against immigration since returning to the Oval Office in January came after the shooting Wednesday of two National Guard members who were patrolling the streets of the nation's capital under his orders. One died and the other is in critical condition.

A 29-year-old Afghan national who worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War is facing charges. The suspect came to the U.S. as part of a program to resettle those who had helped American troops after U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. 

Trump's threat to stop immigration would be a serious blow to a nation that has long defined itself as welcoming immigrants.

Since the shooting not far from the White House, administration officials have pledged to reexamine millions of legal immigrants, building on a 10-month campaign to reduce the immigrant population. In a lengthy social media post late Thursday, the Republican president asserted that millions of people born outside the U.S. and now living in the country bore a large share of the blame for America's societal ills.

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. “Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won't be here for long!”

Trump was elected on a promise to crack down on illegal migration, and raids and deportations undertaken by his administration have disrupted communities across the country. Construction sites and schools have been frequent targets. The prospect of more deportations could be economically dangerous as America's foreign-born workers account for nearly 31 million jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.




The president said on Truth Social that “most” foreign-born U.S. residents “are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels” as he blamed them for crime across the country that is predominantly committed by U.S. citizens.

There are roughly 50 million foreign-born residents in the U.S., and multiple studies have found that immigrants are generally less likely to commit crimes than are people who were born in the country.

The perception that immigration breeds crime “continues to falter under the weight of the evidence,” according to a review of academic literature last year in the Annual Review of Criminology. 

“With few exceptions, studies conducted at both the aggregate and individual levels demonstrate that high concentrations of immigrants are not associated with increased levels of crime and delinquency across neighborhoods and cities in the United States,” it said.

A study by economists initially released in 2023 found immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. Immigrants have been imprisoned at lower rates for 150 years, the study found, adding to past research undermining Trump's claims.

Trump seemed to have little interest in a policy debate in his post, which the White House, on its own rapid response social media account, called “one of the most important messages ever released by President Trump.”

He pledged to “terminate” millions of admissions to the country made during the term of his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden. He also wants to end federal benefits and subsidies for those who are not U.S. citizens, denaturalize people “who undermine domestic tranquility” and deport foreign nationals deemed “non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

Trump claimed immigrants from Somalia were “completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota” as he used a dated slur for intellectually disabled people to demean that state's governor, Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year.

On Wednesday night, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who had entered under the Biden administration. On Thursday, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 “high-risk” countries “to the maximum degree possible.”

Edlow did not name the countries. But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns.

The shooting of the two National Guard members appeared to trigger Trump's anger over immigrants, yet he did not specifically refer to the event in his social media post.

The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, is accused of driving across the country to the District of Columbia and shooting two West Virginia National Guard members, Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. Beckstrom died on Thursday; Wolfe is in critical condition.

The suspect, currently in custody, was also shot and had wounds that were not believed to be life-threatening.

Trump was asked by a reporter Thursday if he blamed the shootings on all Afghans who came to the U.S. 

“No, but we've had a lot of problems with Afghans,” the president said.

            Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Friday to shore up Hungary's energy supplies and discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine.
    


            Having spurned chances to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, Hungary was facing a violent economic shock after the Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil producers. Before the sanctions were announced, Orbán had warned that, without energy imports from Russia, Hungary's economy would be brought “to its knees.”
    


            But Orbán, a hard-right populist and a darling of the MAGA movement, was spared that shock after US President Donald Trump granted Hungary a one-year exemption from the sanctions, saying it had been “difficult” for his ally to wean the country off Russian oil since it is landlocked.
    


            “We recently travelled to Washington to secure Hungary's exemption from the American sanctions on Russian energy: we succeeded. Now we must take the next step, guaranteeing that deliveries to Hungary continue without interruption,” Orbán wrote on social media Friday.
    


            “This is why I am going to Russia today: to make sure Hungary's energy supply remains secure and affordable this winter and in the year ahead,” he added.
    


            Although Trump, explaining why he was considering granting Hungary an exemption, said it had been “very difficult for him (Orbán) to get the oil and gas from other areas” since “they don't have ports,” analysts have disputed this reasoning.
    


            After Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, European Union countries moved to slash Russian energy imports in a bid to deplete the Kremlin's war chest. However, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Central European nations – were given an exemption from a ban on importing Russian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Moscow.
    


            While the Czech Republic has since phased out Russian crude oil, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. Russian crude oil made up 86% of all Hungarian purchases of crude in 2024, up from 61% pre-invasion. So far this year, 92% of Hungary's crude oil imports have been from Russia.
    


            Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to a report in May from the Center for the Study of Democracy and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.
    


            Isaac Levi, an analyst at CREA, told CNN earlier this month that the latest US exemption is a “terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over €1 billion ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin's war chest.”
    


            He said the Trump administration's rationale for the exemption was not credible, since the Czech Republic, another landlocked country, no longer imports Russian crude oil and has lower fuel prices at the pump than Hungary. “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin's war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” Levi said.
    


            During Friday's meeting in Moscow, Orbán and Putin also discussed recent US-led efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Putin did not rule out Friday the possibility of a summit in Budapest with Trump, Russian state media reported.
    


            Putin and Trump had agreed in October to meet in the Hungarian capital to discuss ending the conflict, but those plans were swiftly shelved, with Trump saying he did not want the talks to be a waste of time.

New York prosecutors say they've busted up a sophisticated porch pirate ring in which the alleged thieves hacked into tracking information that investigators say led them to high-value packages as soon as they were delivered.

"The conspirators seemed to be waiting for the packages," Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney told reporters this week.

With the holiday shopping season underway, he is urging shoppers to be aware of when their packages are expected to be delivered and to bring them inside right away.

The investigation spanned from October 2023 to February 2025 and resulted in a sweeping indictment announced this week.

In at least one case, they didn't even wait for the packages to be dropped off — with surveillance video showing a group of crooks rushing a driver as he walked across a busy street with a package of 15 Samsung tablets, then jumping into a waiting getaway car. In another incident, the thieves allegedly followed a homeowner into her house after she brought a package inside, so they could steal it, Tierney said.

Other incidents, caught on home security cameras, show thieves swiping packages minutes after FedEx delivery drivers dropped them off.

The group was so prolific, the DA said, that law enforcement noticed an uptick in porch piracy crimes. The ring is also accused of having packages shipped to "fictitious" individuals at other addresses, just so they could be stolen, Tierney said.

FedEx said in a statement that the entire shipping industry is working "proactively" with law enforcement to combat the rise in sophistication among thieves.

Most of the suspects are from New York City. One is from Yonkers, and another is from Valley Stream, in Nassau County. They are accused of targeting working-class and wealthy communities in Suffolk County, a suburban area that covers the eastern half of Long Island.

They allegedly hacked into data that held FedEx shipping info for devices from Verizon and AT&T and monitored deliveries before stealing them, Tierney said. Exactly how the information was accessed is still under investigation. 

Prosecutors identified the alleged ringleader as 29-year-old Bronx resident Andricson Jerez. He and 13 accused accomplices face 50 felony charges altogether.

The ring is accused of using insider information to home in on packages with smartphones and other valuable electronics inside.

"Most incidents (and all charged) involved residents who legitimately ordered phones," a spokesperson for Tierney's office told Fox News Digital. "The defendants would obtain the tracking information for the legitimately ordered phones and steal the package from the destination almost simultaneously with the delivery. However, we also have evidence that at least one of the runners was using a stolen identity and placing orders with that stolen identification."

The operation included a half-dozen "runners," who are accused of traveling out to the suburbs to steal packages. Tierney's office identified them as Wandy Almanzar Liranzo, 35, Jackson Suazo, 30, Alvaro Alvarez Fermin, no age given, Leonel Tejeda Reynoso, 32, Felipe Batista, 22, and Luger Guerrero, 26.

Jerez had four alleged "lieutenants" who acted as transporters of the stolen goods, according to prosecutors. They were identified as Luis Marte Tavares, 34, Eugenio Valencia, 35, Raimond Cabrera de Leon, 32, and Juan Baez, 48.

That group is accused of delivering stolen goods from the stash house to three other alleged conspirators, identified as Fawaz Hameed, a 35-year-old who owns the Manhattan electronics store, Anzar Ali, 57, and Eddie Zaibak, 28.

They allegedly stole the goods, brought them to a stash house in the Bronx and sold some of them at a storefront on Broadway in Manhattan, a few blocks south of Herald Square. Jerez allegedly sold other stolen goods in bulk to wholesalers in the U.S. and abroad.

While executing a search warrant at the Bronx hideout, police recovered 200 new phones and more than $100,000 worth of other goods, according to the district attorney's office. Images investigators took inside the building show dozens of new phones piled up, still in their packaging.

Jerez faces similar charges in New Jersey, according to prosecutors, and the ring was allegedly operating up and down the East Coast. He was released on $75,000 bond.

Jerez, Marte Tavares and Cabrera de Leon are also facing federal charges.

Reynoso remains jailed on $50,000 bail. Fermin was arrested in New Jersey last year and later placed in ICE custody, where he accepted voluntary departure in July, prosecutors said.

The other suspects have been placed on supervised release and had to surrender their passports. Some of them were freed without bail because their charges are ineligible under New York law.

Experts have a few other recommendations for keeping your holiday packages secure, including home security cameras, scheduling deliveries for when you know you'll be at home, keeping in touch with your neighbors or even having packages delivered to your job if you won't be home during the day.

According to an annual theft report from Security.org, one in four Americans has been the victim of porch piracy, and thieves have stolen more than $8 billion worth of merchandise nationwide in the past year.

From Trader Joe's totes to Starbucks Bearista cups, low-end items carry more meaning in the affordability era.

A cuddly animal wearing a beanie should not incite violence. And yet, this is what occurred in some Starbucks shops earlier this month after the coffee chain released a limited line of teddy bear-shaped tumblers as a part of their holiday merchandise.

The “Bearista” cup, which was originally sold in South Korea and retails for $30, is reportedly sold out across Starbucks locations in the United States — but not before customers hassled baristas and tussled with each other in line to get their hands on one. Stories of frustrated Starbucks fans standing in long lines at the crack of dawn and accusing employees of hogging the cups made headlines and went viral on TikTok. Starbucks apologized to customers for the frenzy but stopped short of confirming whether they would restock the cups.

For now, these glass critters are being sold on eBay, sometimes for exorbitant prices. Meanwhile, shoppers who managed to procure the Bearista cup in store are posting their wins.

The Bearista cup is just the latest entry on a list of seemingly random but extremely hard-to-get merchandise that's gone viral this year, from Labubus to Owala water bottles to Trader Joe's micro tote bags. That certain low-cost novelty items can attract huge lines isn't exactly new. (Cabbage Patch Kids and Beanie Babies are canonical examples.) What's new is the extent to which these relatively cheap trinkets have become status symbols and an innovative way to distinguish oneself.

Status symbols are traditionally thought of as expensive luxury items that indicate one's class. But in a time when affordability is driving the political conversation, young consumers are finding alternative ways to convey their social stature. It isn't a flex anymore to splurge on a designer bag or an expensive car. Status can be earned by getting your hands on something rare, even if it only costs 30 bucks. Even wealthy people are embracing these less glitzy but in-the-know signifiers.

In the case of all these conspicuous or wearable commodities, the goal is to invest and partake in the online attention economy.

While some of the hottest items of the year have necessitated elaborate hunts or long wait times, this isn't always intentional on the brand's part. Many companies use artificial scarcity as a marketing tactic, partaking in seasonal or limited product drops to boost sales, while others may not anticipate the initial demand of new products and run out of supply, according to Tara Sinclair, head of the economics department at George Washington University. In any case, these shortages lend themselves to social media content that sparks intrigue and turns the purchasing of these products into full-blown experiences.

On TikTok and YouTube, the search to find a special-edition Stanley cup or a Dubai chocolate bar has become its own subgenre. Users post trips to their local grocers or big box stores where they scour the aisles, either successfully or unsuccessfully, for the latest trendy purchase. Others have filmed themselves going dumpster diving behind stores. In some cases, recorded confrontations between especially committed customers, and even theft of these items, have helped these products generate buzz. Much of the conversation around Stanley cups and Labubus, for example, was about the outsized emotional reactions people seem to have to them, adding a mysterious value to these products.

Given that these products are not financially out of reach for working and middle-class consumers, the thrill of attaining these items seems largely wrapped up in beating your competition, whether through time, dedication, or pure luck.

That said, these items still signal a level of financial privilege. (A $30 mug is more expensive than the paper cup that you usually get with your coffee at Starbucks.) And the amount of time and energy spent scavenging these items “is a way of signaling being part of a club,” says Sinclair.

“When we think about products of scarcity, there's typically two ways that we pay for them, money or our time,” she says. “Spending time scouring a store is not so different from spending your money on it because you could, otherwise, potentially be working and earning money during that time.”

Even so, it's notable that our idea of status symbols is expanding to include a variety of low-end and easily collectible things. For a generation riddled with economic anxiety and navigating a slimming job market, it feels appropriate that cost-friendly items are suddenly carrying a lot more esteem.

This fits into a larger trend of Gen Z spending on so-called “affordable luxuries,” that some have theorized as a recession indicator. To many, the current craze around these low-cost products seems like a re-treading of the “lipstick effect,” a term that dates back to the 2001 recession. At the time, Estée Lauder chair Leonard Lauder noted that the company had experienced a rise in lipstick sales, inspiring a theory that says consumers are less likely to spend on expensive, luxury goods in the midst of an economic crisis, instead opting for cheap indulgences. After all, luxury spending is slowing down and could continue this trajectory for a while.

But Silvia Bellezza, associate professor of business at Columbia University, isn't totally convinced that Gen Z's obsession with trinkets and tumblers is primarily a response to harsh economic times, given that people are always falling for these novelty items. These alternative status symbols could also be driven by an interest in acquiring taste or “cultural capital.”

Bellezza has found that “traditional markers of superiority,” like cars and designer clothes, become too mainstream and diluted when they are mass-produced. This leads to consumers, including affluent people, finding more clever and original ways to distinguish themselves.

“Mixing and matching high and low is a very clever way to stand out and show that you're even superior to engaging in all the traditional high-status products, and you can dictate your own fashion,” says Bellezza.

This would probably explain why celebrities and billionaires alike are incorporating Lababus and canvas totes into their high fashion wear. Plus, she says consumers want to be seen with items that can only be perceived and understood by a certain subset of people, a behavior referred to as “horizontal signaling.” A Trader Joe's tote, for example, is mostly understood as a trendy fashion item and not just a utility bag to a specific group of young, very online urbanites.

Given that social media is such an integral part of Gen Z's shopping experiences, it's only natural that owning status symbols is more about achieving social clout than signaling actual currency. Waiting in line, fighting crowds, and tracking down these affordable items may be extremely inconvenient, but it's suitable for a cohort with an uncertain financial future. In the meantime, why not rack up views?

NEW YORK (AP) — Black Friday no longer tempts people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs, but the annual sales event still brings more shoppers into stores than any day of the year and rules as the U.S. retail industry's unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.

This year's kickoff arrived as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday. 

Despite the economic uncertainty, shoppers went hunting Friday morning for the deals that retailers traditionally have reserved for the day after Thanksgiving.

At Macy's Herald Square flagship store in New York City, customers who streamed in soon after the store opened at 6 a.m. found for deep discounts on clothes, shoes, linens and cosmetics. The footwear department had products selling for 40% to 50%. 

Nicholas Menasche, 19, from Queens, New York, shopped with his mother for shoes and clothing, and planned to head next to Best Buy for video games. Menasche, an intern at a bank, said he expected to spend around $1,200 this year on his holiday shopping, roughly the same amount as last year.

“It's a great tradition,” he said. “The stores are open really early.” 

Veronica Nam, 68, headed to the shoe department to buy Nike sneakers for her husband after spending $256 on Lacoste bedding that she estimated cost half the regular price. 




Nam said she thought Black Friday had the best holiday deals but that she would wait until after Christmas to finish buying gifts for other relatives. She said it was hard to know when to find the best prices given the unpredictability of President Donald Trump 's wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods and several years of inflation. 

“Food is very expensive,“ she said.

Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect.

“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said this week of shoppers' moods heading into Black Friday. 

While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the Trump administration's volatile tariff policies. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers.

Market research firm Circana said that 40% of all general merchandise sold in September saw a price increase of at least 5% compared with the first four months of the year. Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. 

Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, foot traffic in recent weeks surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, said Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer.

“We're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” Renslow said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”

The growth in online sales also has been robust so far. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 23, U.S. consumers spent $79.7 billion, or 7.5% more than a year earlier, according to web tracking and analysis platform Adobe Analytics. They spent another $6.4  billion online on Thanksgiving Day, a  5.3% increase over last year, while taking advantage of better than expected deals, the firm said.

“Clearly, there's uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn't seem like it's changing how they are showing up for this season.”

According to Adobe Analytics, Thanksgiving Day was the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods, but Black Friday is the best time to buy TVs, toys and appliances online. Cyber Monday, however, should be the best time to buy apparel and computers.

Broadcaster Piers Morgan invited white nationalist Nick Fuentes for a future appearance on his program.

Fuentes splintered the Republican Party after conservative commentator Tucker Carlson interviewed him. Some believed Carlson should not have platformed Fuentes, who is known for espousing antisemitic views.

Noting Fuentes' annoyance with Morgan for not previously having him on, the broadcaster decided to make good on the invitation and extended it on Thursday.

“Fair enough, maybe it's time we had a chat. So give me a call or a direct message, if that's your thing, and we'll do the interview. Nick Fuentes, let's see how you get on,” he said in a video message posted on X.

Fuentes appeared to accept the invitation in a reply to the video. “Let's set it up, looking forward to it,” he wrote on X.

If Morgan interviews Fuentes, it would be the next in a series of media appearances for the controversial right-wing figure. He's coming off several interviews on the podcast circuit, including with Carlson.

Carlson's interview has about 6.5 million views on YouTube and introduced the 27-year-old to his about 5 million subscriber base. The interview gave Fuentes one of his largest audiences yet.

Fuentes has about a million followers on X and nearly 550,000 on Rumble. He's one of the most popular right-wing personalities in the public's view.

But many didn't believe Carlson should have had Fuentes on his show, accusing the former Fox News host of platforming someone who has praised Hitler, to his audience.

“I spoke briefly with Tucker about that, and I think it's a responsibility. He has a lot of listeners, and I think giving Nick Fuentes that platform is a big mistake,” Johnson said.

“It's not just antisemitic, it's openly racist, it's violent — things you can't even repeat on the House floor,” Johnson said. “We should not be giving a platform to amplify those views. And I think that's important for us to say.”

Johnson's comments signaled a break with President Donald Trump, who said that “you can't tell” Carlson who to interview.

Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts also defended Carlson for the interview, but received backlash within his organization for doing so. Some left their positions, including a board member, citing Roberts's response to Carlson's interview with Fuentes.

The party's reaction to Fuentes has made him more relevant in recent times. Morgan's interview with him could add to the controversy.

While the pair didn't focus on Fuentes, Morgan sat down with Carlson for an interview, which was released on Wednesday. The interview focused on free speech and the “f” word surrounding gay people.

Carlson prodded Morgan to say the word, but he hesitated. He later said it, but acknowledged that using the word would offend people. Fuentes is known for testing the bounds of free speech, using slurs openly on his show and spouting controversial takes.

West Virginia National Guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom has died from her injuries after she and another soldier were shot Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced.

She was 20. Her father, Gary Beckstrom, previously said she wasn't expected to recover and had a mortal injury.

“I must unfortunately tell you that just seconds before I went on right now, I heard that Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected young, magnificent person, started service in June of 2023 outstanding in every way. She's just passed away,” Trump said Thursday evening.

“She's no longer with us. She's looking down at us right now. Her parents are with her. It's just happened. She was savagely attacked. She's dead, not with us. Incredible person, outstanding in every single way, in every department, that's horrible,” he added.

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey confirmed that she had died. “Sarah served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation. She answered the call to serve, stepped forward willingly, and carried out her mission with the strength and character that define the very best of the West Virginia National Guard,” he wrote in a post on X.

“Today, we honor her bravery and her sacrifice as we mourn the loss of a young woman who gave everything she had in defense of others. We will forever hold her family, her friends, and her fellow Guardsmen in our prayers as they grieve what no family should ever have to bear,” he added.

The New York Times spoke with her father, Gary, and a former boyfriend, Adam Carr. 

“I'm holding her hand right now,” Gary Beckstrom told the outlet earlier. “She has a mortal wound. It's not going to be a recovery.”

Carr said Beckstrom was “caring and tenderhearted.” He also said she enjoyed nature, road trips and spending time with her family. “As long as she was with people who cared about her, she was having a good time,” he said.

He added that she wasn't excited to go to the nation's capital initially because of people who did not want the National Guard there. She then grew fond of spending time in D.C., wandering museums and memorials.

The other soldier, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life. 

The pair were allegedly ambushed with a revolver by Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal near the Farragut West metro station before he was subdued.

ALLEGED NATIONAL GUARDSMEN SHOOTER CAME UP ‘CLEAN ON ALL CHECKS'

With Beckstrom's death, the Department of Justice is expected to pursue first-degree murder charges against Lakanwal, among other charges. In a post on X, Attorney General Pamela Bondi suggested she will seek the death penalty.

“Devastated,” Bondi posted. “Please pray for Sarah's family. America will never forget her courage. There WILL BE JUSTICE for Sarah. Continue to pray for Andrew. Thank you to President Trump — the death penalty is back.”

Beckstrom was deployed to D.C. in August as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on crime in the city. She appears to be one of the first National Guard soldiers who have been mortally wounded in the city.

Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame has said some of the world's largest AI companies are exaggerating how long their Nvidia chips will last to pad their short-term profits. Now, one hedge fund boss has warned that those chips could make themselves obsolete.

Greg Jensen, the co-chief investor of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, told the "In Good Company" podcast this week that the "depreciation schedule is probably going to be quite fast, and you hope it has to be in a sense."

Jensen explained there's a "resource grab" in AI as companies compete for scarce land, energy, microchips, and scientists, and tech bosses are hoping AI itself can help.

"One of the things they have to do is figure out how to make the chips more efficient, make the energy more efficient, and they're trying to use AI to do those things," he said.

Jensen predicted that some of the scientific advances that will "depreciate the current assets will come from those assets themselves," as "AI will generate better ways to do this."

Burry shot to fame after his massive bet against the US housing bubble was immortalized in the book "The Big Short," and a movie adaptation starring actor Christian Bale as Burry.

He resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence. Since then, he has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, closed his hedge fund to outside cash, launched a Substack to share his research, and disclosed he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and another AI darling, Palantir.

Burry has taken aim at the AI giants for dragging out depreciation from around three years to six years or longer, pointing out that Nvidia is releasing new chips faster and faster, so the current generation will likely lose value more quickly.

"The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes, as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in graphics chips with accelerating planned obsolescence," he wrote on Substack this week.

The investor has also called out the sprawling web of "give-and-take deals" between AI companies.

Jensen said those aren't a product of "normal bubble dynamics" — companies juicing their financials to justify their lofty valuations — as "Nvidia can get as much revenue as it wants" given the immense demand for its chips.

Instead, Jensen said, Nvidia is scrambling to create its own ecosystem of buyers who won't develop their own chips, in an attempt to stop Alphabet from owning the entire AI "stack."

"They're like Standard Oil in the Gilded Age, trying to create monopolistic control on things," Jensen said about Nvidia. He added that "everybody's got to lock up who do I partner with, where am I going to get my chips and power — and if I don't do it, I'm going to die."

Jensen also said the AI investment boom isn't a typical capital cycle, as bosses such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman believe they're in a race to develop a supreme intelligence, and are willing to spend whatever it takes to win.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

Stock futures trading was halted this morning after a data center "cooling issue" took down several Chicago Mercantile Exchange services. Individual stocks were still trading before the bell, while the CME said futures indexes and options trading would open fully at 8:30 a.m. Follow live markets updates here. 

The stock market has rebounded during the holiday-shortened trading week. But the three major indexes are still on pace to end November's trading month — which ends with today's closing bell — in the red. The Dow and S&P 500 are poised to snap six-month winning streaks, while the Nasdaq Composite is on track to see its first negative month in eight. 

Today's trading session ends early at 1 p.m. ET. 

Black Friday was once considered the biggest in-person shopping day of the year, drawing huge crowds to stores in search of bargains. But while millions are still expected to partake in the occasion, it's not what it used to be.

Here's what to know:

Alphabet has been a notable exception to the recent tech downturn. Shares of the Google parent have surged more than 13% this month as Wall Street sees the company as an AI leader.

Alphabet began the month by announcing its latest tensor processing units, or TPUs, called Ironwood. Last week, the company launched its latest AI model, Gemini 3, which caught positive attention from Silicon Valley heavyweights.

Shares of the stock are now up close to 70% this year, making it the best-performer within megacap tech. But experts told CNBC's Jennifer Elias that Alphabet's lead in the competitive AI market is marginal and could be hard to hold onto.

The Alphabet-Nvidia AI race isn't the only tech rivalry that has heated up in recent days.

Alibaba's AI-powered smart glasses went on sale yesterday. With its new wearable tech offering, the Chinese tech company is going up against major players — namely Meta, which unveiled its smart glasses with Ray Ban in September.

Meanwhile, Counterpoint Research found Apple is poised to ship more smartphones than Samsung this year for the first time in 14 years. Apple is also poised to boast a larger market share, driven by strong iPhone 17 sales.

American shoppers are increasingly looking to South Korea for their cosmetics. NielsenIQ found U.S. sales of so-called "K-beauty" products are slated to surge more than 37% this year to above $2 billion.

Retailers ranging from beauty product hubs Ulta and Sephora to big-box chains Walmart and Costco are jumping on the trend. On top of that, Olive Young — aka the "Sephora of Seoul" — is opening its first U.S. store in Los Angeles next year.

Here are some stories worth circling back to over the weekend:

Business Insider Edition 

Former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan has returned safely to Abuja after being trapped in Guinea-Bissau during a sudden military takeover that disrupted the country's electoral process.


        Jonathan, who led the West African Elders Forum Observation Mission, arrived at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport late on Thursday, November 27, where supporters and senior government officials received him.
    


        Jonathan and his team were in Guinea-Bissau to monitor presidential and parliamentary elections alongside officials from the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States.
    


        Their work was still underway when soldiers seized power on Wednesday, suspended the vote, and shut the country's borders.
    


        The unexpected development raised concerns for the safety of election observers, including the former president.
    


        Nigeria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs later confirmed that Jonathan and members of his delegation had been evacuated.
    


        Ministry spokesperson Kimiebi Ebienfa said, “Former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is very safe and out of Guinea-Bissau. He left with a special flight with members of his delegation, including Ibm Chambas.”



        Guinea-Bissau's military leadership announced that it had taken “total control” of the country following the coup.
    


        General Denis N'Canha, who heads the presidential military office, said a unified command drawn from all branches of the armed forces would lead the nation until further notice.
    


        The officers also arrested President Umaro Embalo, who had been seen as the frontrunner in the suspended election.
    


        A day after the takeover, the army named its chief of staff, General Horta N'Tam, as the transitional leader for one year.
    


        The move has heightened regional concerns, given West Africa's recent wave of coups and political instability.
    


        In a statement, Ebienfa said the government “in the strongest possible terms, condemns this act of military insurrection which undermines the democratic progress, constitutional order, and stability not only of Guinea Bissau but of the entire West African sub region.”



        He added that the coup “represents a blatant violation” of ECOWAS principles that forbid unconstitutional changes of government.



        Nigeria called for the immediate restoration of constitutional rule, the safety of detainees, and respect for democratic institutions.
    


        The return of Jonathan offered relief in Abuja, although regional leaders are bracing for yet another diplomatic crisis in an already fragile neighbourhood.

Italian defense company Leonardo on Thursday unveiled plans for an AI-powered shield for cities and critical infrastructure, adding to Europe's push to ramp up sovereign defense capabilities amid rising geopolitical tensions.

The system, dubbed the "Michelangelo Dome" in a nod to Israel's Iron Dome and U.S. President Donald Trump's plans for a "Golden Dome," will integrate multiple defense systems to detect and neutralize threats from sea to air including missile attacks and drone swarms.

Leonardo's shares were marginally higher Thursday and is up around 77% since January, amid a year of steep rises for defense stocks across Europe as the region's governments have hiked defense spending. 

The UK's BAE Systems rose 42.7% since the start of 2025, Germany's Rheinmetall 148.9% and France's Thales 63.8%.

Leonardo's dome will be built on what CEO Roberto Cingolani called an "open architecture" system meaning it can operate alongside any country's defense systems.

"In a world where threats evolve rapidly and become ever more complex — and where defending is costlier than attacking — defense must innovate, anticipate and embrace international cooperation," said Cingolani, during an event on Thursday evening.

The company is targeting the project being fully operational by the end of the decade.

Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told CNBC earlier on Thursday that the protocols to exchange data between countries and teams on the battlefield were still "still quite limited," adding it could take a decade to build out Europe's "digital battlefield."

European governments have rapidly committed to increased defense spending as the U.S., a key ally for the bloc, has previously threatened to reduce financial support in the region. 

In May the EU announced a 150 billion euro ($173.5 million) programme to provide long-term loans to member states for defense procurement and industrial capacity. NATO members also committed to increasing defense and security spending to 5% by 2035 in June.

Leonardo's unveiling of its new dome system is part of a sector wide move from leading defense primes that's seeing them shift "investment from standalone hardware to integrated command architectures," Loredana Muharremi, equity analyst at Morningstar told CNBC. 

"Modern warfare is won by the network that can integrate every platform into one decision cycle," she said. "The winners will be the contractors that own the network layer, not the metal, which capture recurring upgrades and scale."

Risks to Leonardo's dome system include execution delays and "dependency on European procurement cycles," Meghan Welch, managing director at Brown Gibbons Lang & Company told CNBC.

European primes are also increasingly competing with an emerging class of defense tech startups in the region.

German AI drone startup Helsing raised 600 million euros and doubled its valuation to 12 billion euros in June, the Financial Times reported. Quantum Systems, which also develops autonomous defense tech, announced Friday it has tripled its valuation to above 3 billion euros after a 180 million euro raise.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Richard Detty, a 58-year-old ride-hailing driver for Uber and Lyft in Honolulu. Business Insider verified Detty's earnings through screenshots he provided of his payments. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

A Lyft spokesperson told Business Insider that "ensuring driver success is vital to our mission, and we're continually looking to increase driver pay in smart, deliberate ways." For example, the company has pledged that drivers will make at least 70% of the weekly rider fares after external fees, and has recently started paying drivers for the time they wait for a rider, starting after one minute.

An Uber spokesperson said, "We're committed to policies that support flexible work and sustainable earnings without reducing opportunities or raising costs for riders." Most Uber drivers drive for the app part-time, the spokesperson said.

Rideshare is my side hustle.

I grew up on Kauai, Hawaii, and spent years on the US mainland. In 2017, I moved to Honolulu. My main business is selling products from Hawaii, such as mochi crunch cookies, on Amazon. When I'm not doing that, I drive for Lyft and Uber.

Tourism is a big industry here, and there are plenty of rides to take. I often drive between the airport, Waikiki, Pearl Harbor, and other places that tourists want to go. I feel safer driving here than on the mainland, where you never know who you're going to pick up.

There are also some unique challenges. I can't tell you how many times I've picked up riders with wet bathing suits at the beach and had to dry out my seats before my next ride.

When I was in college here in 1991, I drove a cab part-time two or three times a week. I would give the guy who ran the taxi yard $35, and I could drive from six at night to six in the morning. I paid for the gas, but the taxi company covered everything else, including maintenance.

Back then, a ride from Waikiki to the Honolulu airport paid up to $25. Now, Lyft and Uber are offering me up to $12 as the base rate for the same ride. When I first started driving for the apps here, that same trip would've paid $18. Without tips, I'm dead in the water.

I wouldn't mind some of these rates if Uber and Lyft provided me a car. But I'm now responsible for all the costs. I have to handle all my maintenance, and if my car breaks down, I'm out of luck.

What makes the pay harder to shoulder is that Hawaii is an expensive place to live. Everything costs more here than on the mainland because everything has to be shipped here. I've paid more than $4 a gallon for gas at Costco, and I've seen milk here for around $8 a gallon. The base rate for rideshare drivers needs to go up here.

When I moved back to Hawaii eight years ago, Lyft and Uber advertised that drivers could make up to $35 an hour. That was very easy to do at the time.

Now, they advertise that drivers make $27 an hour, yet if anything, the fares I've seen seem to have gone up in that time. Where did the other $8 go? For me, it's been one pay cut after another.

In 2022, I worked full-time for Lyft and Uber. I did it for 10 months because I wanted to save money to invest in my Amazon business.

Around that time, I started to notice that the payments I got were falling. I found that doing this full-time wasn't livable, so I went back to doing it as a side hustle. I drove 30 and 40 hours a week and put close to 1,000 miles on my car each week.

The only thing that keeps me coming back to Uber and Lyft is the flexibility. I can go in and out when I want. I think Uber and Lyft count on that: It seems like they want people to be part-time drivers.

I'm lobbying the Honolulu city council, the mayor, and the state legislature to do something about the pay situation for ride-hailing drivers. We need laws similar to those that gig workers in Minneapolis or Seattle have, which promise a minimum wage and provide other protections. I could make a decent living getting paid like that. In Minneapolis, drivers are being paid at least $1.28 a mile and $0.31 a minute. That's close to double what I make.

We need a pay rate that's fair. So many costs that have gone up. We need to be able to make a living.

Dutch chipmaker Nexperia has publicly called on its China unit to help restore supply chain operations, warning in an open letter that customers across industries are reporting "imminent production outages."

Nexperia's Dutch unit said Thursday that its open letter followed "repeated attempts to establish direct communication through conventional channels" but did not have "any meaningful response."

The letter marks the latest twist in a long-running saga that has threatened global automotive supply chains and stoked a bitter battle between Amsterdam and Beijing over technology transfer. 

"We welcomed the Chinese authorities' commitment to facilitate the resumption of exports from Nexperia's Chinese facility and that of our subcontractors, enabling the continued flow of our products to global markets," Nexperia's Dutch unit said in the letter.

"Nevertheless, customers across industries are still reporting imminent production stoppages. This situation cannot persist," they added. The group called on the leadership of Nexperia's entities in China to take steps to restore the  established supply flows without delay.

In a statement, Wingtech Technology, Nexperia's Chinese parent company, said on Friday that the Dutch unit's open letter contained "a large number of misleading and untrue allegations."

It said the "unlawful deprivation of Wingtech's control and shareholder rights over Nexperia" was the root cause of the ongoing supply chain chaos.

"Combined with the recent series of actions by the Dutch government and Nexperia B.V., we believe their true intention is to buy time for Nexperia B.V. to construct a 'de-China-ized' supply chain and permanently strip Wingtech of its shareholder rights," Wingtech said.

Nexperia manufactures billions of so-called foundation chips — transistors, diodes and power management components — that are produced in Europe, assembled and tested in China, and then re-exported to customers in Europe and elsewhere. 

The chips are relatively low-tech and inexpensive but are needed in almost every device that uses electricity. In cars, those chips are used to connect the battery to motors, for lights and sensors, for braking systems, airbag controllers, entertainment systems and electric windows. 

The situation began in September, when the Dutch government invoked a Cold War-era law to effectively take control of Nexperia. The highly unusual move was reportedly made after the U.S. raised security concerns. 

Beijing responded by moving to block its products from leaving China, which, in turn, raised the alarm among global automakers as they faced shortages of the chipmaker's components. 

In an apparent reprieve last week, however, the Dutch government said it had suspended its state intervention at Nexperia following talks with Chinese authorities. It was thought at the time that this could bring an end to the dispute and pave the way for a restoration of normal supply chains.  

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, said it remains unclear how long the situation will last.

"The imposed measures to seize the Dutch Nexperia subsidiary have been lifted, but there are still talks ongoing about restoring the corporate structure and relation with parent company Wingtech," Luman told CNBC by email.

"It's not only about supplies of finished chips, it's also about wafer supplies from Europe to the Chinese entity," Luman said, adding that companies including Japan's Nissan and German auto supplier Bosch are among the firms to have warned about looming shortages.

A spokesperson for the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz Group and BMW among hundreds of others, warned of elevated risks to supply, "particularly for the first quarter" of 2026.

"In recent weeks, the German automotive industry has largely been able to keep production stable through intensive efforts," a VDA spokesperson told CNBC by email. 

"However, the disruptions in the supply chain for Nexperia parts caused by political intervention have not been fundamentally resolved. Component availability remains uncertain," they added. 

ING's Luman said the Nexperia situation is somewhat comparable to China's rare earth export controls.

"The Chinese position appears strong again as European manufacturers are dependent on the supplies. And comparable to the rare earths, it's not fully transparent which buyer is able to qualify for which chip supplies," Luman said.

Trading gradually resumed after coming to a standstill on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday, as a cooling issue at one of its data centers impacted traders across the globe. 

Stock futures and options trading reopened fully at 8:30 a.m. ET, with other services gradually being restored. Bonds and metals resumed trading after a pause, according to FactSet data, while individual stocks were still trading the premarket.

"All CME Group markets are open and trading," a CME Group spokesperson said in an emailed statement. 

Earlier, representatives for CME Group had told CNBC markets were halted due to a cooling issue at CyrusOne data centers, adding that it may take some time for moves in the impacted contracts to be seen once the outage is resolved. 

Globex futures and options markets, foreign exchange platform EBS markets and BMD markets were all impacted. EBS markets reopened at 7 a.m. ET, around 90 minutes after its subsidiary BrokerTec EU markets resumed trading.

The CME — the largest exchange operator in the world by market value — trades futures and options across various asset classes, including agricultural commodities, energy, metals and equities. 

Earlier, a spokesperson for Dallas, Texas-headquartered CyrusOne told CNBC the company was actively responding to a cooling system issue at its CHI1 data center facility in the Chicago area, which had impacted customers including CME Group. 

"On November 27, our CHI1 facility experienced a chiller plant failure affecting multiple cooling units," they said in an email. "Our engineering teams, along with specialized mechanical contractors, are on-site working to restore full cooling capacity. We have successfully restarted several chillers at limited capacity and have deployed temporary cooling equipment to supplement our permanent systems."

CyrusOne's representative said the firm was in direct contact with all affected customers, and its teams were "working around the clock to restore normal operations as quickly and safely as possible."

"We apologize for any disruption this has caused and appreciate the patience of our customers as we work toward full resolution," they added. 

Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth, told CNBC it was fortunate the outage had come on one of the slowest trading days of the year in the U.S., just after Thanksgiving. 

"It appears as though they are gradually starting to restore some operations," he said. "All told this could have been much worse."

Emir Syazwan, a futures trader at Ninefold Trading Co. based in Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, told CNBC on Friday that he had been on the phone to his broker "throughout the afternoon" local time as the CME outage dragged on. 

Given the timing of the outage — at the end of the week, just after a major U.S. holiday and in the early hours of the morning for American traders — Syazwan said those trading in the Asian or European session would be more directly impacted. 

Whether it will create "lasting distortions" in markets depends on how fast the issue can be resolved, he added. 

"It's inconvenient, but it's not unprecedented, although this kind of event may materially alter market structure or price discovery," he said. "Current price action already reflects markets being affected: the markets have been relatively flat and trading in a very tight range since 26 November, Wednesday, around ~10 PM EST. And until the issue is resolved, I would expect that behaviour and price action to continue."

It's not the first time the CME has had to shut down electronic trade. Back in 2014, technical issues shut down some trading on the CME's Globex electronic system, impacting agricultural contracts. 

Last year, trading of equities, bonds and exchange-traded funds was also temporarily halted in Switzerland after stock exchange SIX had problems disseminating data. 

Syazwan's own trades have not been impacted, he told CNBC.

"I had already anticipated the major markets — especially the U.S. indices — to consolidate until the start of next year, so I went on early holiday at the beginning of the month," he said.

In this article

Tech giant Baidu is emerging as one of China's key artificial intelligence chip players, positioning itself as a challenger to Huawei as both look to fill the void left by industry leader Nvidia being kept out of the country. 

Best-known as China's biggest search business, Baidu has in recent years refocused its business around driverless cars and AI, including a majority-owned subsidiary, Kunlunxin, which designs chips.

Several analysts have upgraded their outlook on Baidu's stock over the past few weeks, citing the semiconductor business and forecasting the unit will gain more domestic orders.

This month, Baidu laid out a five-year roadmap for its Kunlun AI chips, beginning with the M100 in 2026 and the M300 in 2027. The company already uses a mix of its self-developed chips in its data centers to run its ERNIE AI models, as well as Nvidia products. 

Baidu makes money by selling its chips to third parties building data centers as well as renting out computing capacity via its cloud. It has sought to position itself as a so-called "full stack" AI offering with infrastructure made up of chips, servers and data centers, as well as AI models and applications.

And the chip business appears to be gaining traction. Earlier this year, Kunlunxin won orders from suppliers to China Mobile, one of the country's biggest mobile carriers.

"Kunlunxin has emerged as a leading domestic AI chip developer, focusing on high- performance AI chips for large language model (LLM) training and inference, cloud  computing, and telecom and enterprise workloads," analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a note this month.

While Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely regarded as the most advanced chips for training and running AI, the company has been blocked by the U.S. government from selling its top-end product to China. Beijing has also reportedly been persuading local tech companies not to buy the H20, a less powerful Nvidia chip designed for the Chinese market and greenlit for export.

With Huawei — the leading player through its massive clusters of chips — out of the picture, analysts are suggesting Baidu will fill the void and its chip business is set for explosive growth.

"We believe domestic demand for AI compute in China remains intense, and hyperscalers are increasingly sourcing from local solution providers," JPMorgan said in a note on Sunday. "We view Kunlun AI chip as one of the best positioned."

The investment bank analysts forecast Baidu chips sales to increase six-fold to reach 8 billion Chinese yuan ($1.1 billion) in 2026.

Analysts at Macquarie estimate that Baidu's Kunlun chip unit could be valued at about $28 billion. 

Baidu is not alone among China's tech giants when it comes to self-developed semiconductors. CNBC reported in August that Alibaba is also developing its next-generation AI chip. 

Baidu's chip push comes as Chinese tech giants this month said they're seeing supply shortages.

Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibab, said that "the supply side is going to be a relatively large bottleneck" over the next two-to-three years, referring to components and chips required to build data centers. 

Tencent said this month that its 2025 capital expenditure would be lower than initially anticipated. But Tencent President Martin Lau said this this was not because of a lack of demand, but more a shortage of available chips to spend the money on. 

"It is not a reflection of our change in AI strategy ... It is indeed a change in terms of the AI chip availability," Lau said. 

Part of this shortage has been driven by global demand and resulting bottlenecks in the semiconductor supply chain. But China's effective block of Nvidia chips has also reduced the supply.

Chinese tech firms have tried to mitigate the shortage by using stockpiled chips, as well as trying to make their AI models more efficient to do more with the semiconductors they have.

Meanwhile, China has its own challenges with manufacturing because its biggest chipmaker SMIC, is unable to compete on the scale and technology with leaders like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. That makes it hard for the China to manufacture enough domestic chips to fill the shortfall. 

Like their U.S. counterparts, Chinese tech companies have continually reported strong demand for AI. 

"We see that customer demand for AI is and remains very strong. In fact, we are not even able to keep pace with the growth in customer demand … in terms of the pace at which we can deploy new servers," Alibaba's Wu said this week. 

That gives Baidu an opportunity in China.

"Baidu's chip push is both a necessity and an opportunity. It's a necessity, because Chinese platforms can no longer assume a steady diet of US GPUs; opportunity, because there's now a semi‑captive, multi‑billion‑dollar domestic market for AI hardware that is compliant with both US export rules and Beijing's self‑reliance agenda," Nick Patience, practice lead for AI at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.

"If Baidu can ship competitive Kunlun generations on time, it doesn't just solve its own supply problem — it becomes a strategic supplier to the rest of China's AI industry."

Two Nordic mining companies at the heart of Europe's push to achieve resource security are taking novel — albeit very different — approaches. One is pursuing the concept of an "invisible mine," while the other is taking on one of the world's most radical relocation projects.

It forms part of a strategic shift for the European Union. Under its forthcoming "RESourceEU" initiative, the 27-nation bloc intends to step up its efforts to secure access to domestic sources of critical raw materials in both the short- and long-term. 

The plan, which intends to boost investment in strategic projects, is designed to help break China's long-held mineral dominance.

Alf Reistad, CEO of mining firm Rare Earths Norway, told CNBC that there's been a clear shift in terms of how both domestic and EU policymakers are thinking about mineral supply chains.  

"What we see now is really a sense of urgency. Everybody is speaking about the need for actions," Reistad told CNBC by video call. "It is really the time to act now. We have always said that we are too early until we are too late." 

In June last year, Rare Earths Norway announced the discovery of Europe's largest known rare earths deposit, reflecting what was seen as a watershed moment in the region's pursuit of strategic autonomy.  

It's estimated that the firm's Fen Carbonatite Complex, situated in the small industrial town of Ulefoss in southern Norway, contains 8.8 million metric tons of total rare earth oxides (TREOs). 

Notably, roughly 1.5 million tons of these TREOs are thought to contain highly prized magnet-related rare earths, such as neodymium and praseodymium. These are critical components for a range of modern technologies, from electric vehicles and wind turbines to robotics and defense applications. 

Rare Earths Norway said it is currently in close cooperation with the local municipality and national authorities over a zoning plan and hopes to present a prefeasibility study by the end of the year. 

Ultimately, however, it faces a long road ahead to deliver on its rare earths potential. The company is targeting the delivery of rare earths to market by the first half of the 2030s. 

To help reach these targets, Rare Earths Norway has been lobbying for domestic and EU policymakers to consider fast-track permitting and price guarantees, saying such measures will be pivotal to its success.  

Reistad compared the firm's push to deliver on its resource potential to participating in the Enhanced Games, a controversial event that allows athletes to take banned performance enhancing drugs under medical supervision.

"If you look now at what you see with China and the U.S., they are competing in a kind of Enhanced Games, and it's not possible for us to compete at all if we have no security," Reistad said.

"You see that the actions that have been made by [U.S. President Donald] Trump. He has been fast and bold. So, if there is no level playing field then it will not be possible to come true with this project," he added. 

A spokesperson for the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, told CNBC that the bloc has a "clear vision" to ensure the secure and sustainable access to raw materials. By 2030, the bloc wants to extract 10%, process 40% and recycle 25% of what it consumes each year. 

The EU is also aiming to limit reliance on any single external supplier to 65%.

To develop its discovery, Rare Earths Norway is planning to extract rare earths from its Fen site using an "invisible mine" concept to avoid surface disruption and environmental impact. 

This concept involves drilling a long, narrow tunnel diagonally beneath the village of Ulefoss and backfilling extracted voids with waste materials. 

"It's important that people on top of the deposit are safe," Reistad said, who compared the concept to that of a "Kinder Egg." 

"So, if you have seen in the project by LKAB in Kiruna, they have to move the town. We need to prevent that, and its approximately 300 properties on top of the deposit and a lot of people living there," he added. 

Reistad said the company has had "very good" dialogue with the people living on top of the rare earths deposit. Early community surveys have reportedly shown strong local support for the project, alongside some concerns about stability and waste management. 

Swedish state-owned mining firm LKAB, which operates far above the Arctic Circle in the city of Kiruna, is taking a completely different approach to Europe's growing appetite for raw materials.  

The company announced in January 2023 what was then considered to be Europe's largest known deposit of rare earths, describing the discovery as "good news" for Sweden, Europe and the climate.

The discovery of the so-called Per Geijer deposit sits in close proximity to the world's largest underground iron ore mine. Indeed, it is LKAB's plans to expand its iron ore mine that has prompted the move of thousands of city residents to a brand-new city center. 

The extensive urban relocation project received international attention in August, when workers successfully moved a 113-year-old wooden church five kilometers (3 miles) down the road over the course of two days.  

Later that same month, LKAB announced that 6,000 more people and approximately 2,700 homes would be affected by the relocation. The transformation is estimated to come at a cost of 22.5 billion Swedish kronor ($2.4 billion).

Niklas Johansson, senior vice president of public affairs and external relations at LKAB, said the relocation is not related to the rare earths discovery, but rather the firm's sprawling iron ore mine.

Like Rare Earths Norway, LKAB's Johansson said the company is currently in discussion with European lawmakers to ensure that it will be economically viable to develop its resources. 

"We've already got the material up to the ground. That's all been paid for by the iron ore. Still, it's not a given that this is a business case. It looks like it is for us at the moment, but it's not something that you'd say, 'oh it's a no brainer, just run for it,'" Johansson told CNBC by telephone.

"I also tell them that if it looks like this for us, who has most of the infrastructure and everything in place, how do you think it will look for others in Europe?"

Anthony Heron, deputy editor of the Arctic Institute think tank, said the projects overseen by Rare Earths Norway and LKAB are "strategically significant" because they represent some of the most credible paths to reduce Europe's near total dependence on imported rare earths, especially from China.

"Estimates suggest the Norwegian Fen deposit could cover a sizeable share of future EU demand for rare earth minerals, and the exploration of Arctic deposits has been framed by analysts as pillars of Europe's emerging 'mineral sovereignty' agenda," Heron told CNBC by email. 

"That aligns the Arctic squarely with the EU Critical Raw Materials Act, which has set targets for a minimum share of extraction to take place within Europe," he added.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday announced sweeping plans to tighten immigration rules, including a suspension on migration from "Third World Countries" and cancellation of all federal benefits and subsidies to "noncitizens" in the country.

In a pair of Truth Social posts late Thursday night, Trump said he would "permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover," without specifying what would be considered a "third world" country. The term loosely referred to countries with higher poverty rates and economic instability.

The president said he would also terminate "millions" of admissions under his predecessor Joe Biden and remove "anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country."

Trump added he plans to end all federal benefits and subsidies for noncitizens, "denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility," and deport any foreign national he described as a "public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization."

His comments came after two National Guard members were shot near the White House on Wednesday, one of whom died from her injuries a day later. Investigators said the attack was carried out by an Afghan national.

Hours after the shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Joseph Edlow said in a post on X that the agency would review every immigrant holding a Green Card from a "country of concern."

The agency also announced the immediate and indefinite suspension of all immigration requests involving Afghan nationals.

Trump has pursued an aggressive immigration agenda since returning to the White House earlier this year. In June, he announced a broad travel ban covering immigrants from 19 countries, including Afghanistan.

Vince Nguyen, a 39-year-old entrepreneur based in Vietnam, spends a few hundreds almost every month traveling to other countries to play pickleball.

The sport, which began as a pastime after injuring himself in American football, has since become central to his lifestyle, as he plays it for two to four hours almost daily.

Since he picked up the sport two years ago, Nguyen has played leisurely in Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and Canada. Next month, he is planning to head to China for an upcoming tournament.

He says he forks out a few hundreds on round-trip flights to Taiwan or Malaysia for tournaments and leisure play with friends. Additionally, he pays the court fees, ranging from $4 to $8 for open play, and about $38 a night for hotels. In total, the trips cost him between $386 to $772. 

However, he spends almost $1,000 when traveling to Canada, where flights and indoor courts are pricier than in Asia.

"I like to spend a week ... playing a few times, checking out different courts, going to different restaurants," he said. 

Nguyen believes traveling to play pickleball makes a difference as "every country has a little bit different style" in playing the game, and he is not alone. He is one of the many millennials that are fueling a rising trend in travel: sports tourism. 

According to Hilton's 2026 Trends Report, which polled over 14,000 travelers across 14 countries, about 67% of millennials have planned a trip for events related to their interests, including sports, wellness and concerts. 

In the U.S. alone, millennials are 80% more likely to plan a vacation for tennis and 87% for pickleball, according to a survey by online travel agency Priceline on travel trends in 2025. 

And there are no signs of the sports tourism slowing down. The sports tourism industry is already a $707.29 billion market and is forecasted to nearly triple by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights.

Europe leads the market with a valuation of $248.23 billion last year. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific has been marked the fastest-growing region, anticipated to be worth $149.50 billion in 2025.

Sports tourism in Asia-Pacific is projected to have a compound annual growth rate of 17.85% from 2025 to 2032.  

Another millenial, 35-year-old Nirbhay Handa who is based in Singapore, also travels abroad for tennis.

"I'll go to a tennis camp in Phuket … when I travel to Dubai and Abu Dhabi I have a tennis coach that I just go and play with in the evenings after work," he said. "I think this makes me better at work, because I'm in a better mood. I'm not irritated," the entrepreneur said.

He takes about six tennis trips a year including ones for business, spending around $200 a week on sessions in Dubai. 

Handa said that the sport is more than a hobby to him. "It just became very therapeutic, and it put me on to some good habits … not drinking till late on Friday … giving up social smoking completely," he added. 

He makes it a point to play a game of tennis when he's abroad for leisure or business.

Tennis, which he deems "good for your soul," not only helps him unwind but also fulfils his social life.

"It does a little bit of what going out to a pub would do for a lot of people, you know, which is meeting people, meeting your friends over a drink," he said, but "I feel like I can do that at the tennis court." 

Mike Goldys, who lives in Florida, travels to surf overseas with a goal of playing in as many different surf parks as possible. The 39-year-old has logged 140 hours so far across 26 cities in 10 countries.

"Each surf park … is very unique for me. I … just can't get enough of it, he said. "I want to keep checking them off and seeing what this one was like in this state."

"I rarely go back to the same wave pool twice," he added. 

Goldys has spent $18,500 on surf sessions alone, budgeting $6000 to $10,000 per trip depending on flights and accommodation, he said. He also sets aside money for photography and videography to share on social platforms.

As a social media strategist at a non-profit organization, he takes one to two weeks off for surfing trips — only tending to work matters for emergencies.

"When you pay to surf in a wave pool you're guaranteed waves that they're really powerful and like good shape… a way to accelerate progress," he said. "[It's] very quick for someone who doesn't have the perfect waves all the time" near his residence in Florida.

At $170 an hour, surf parks aren't cheap. But Goldys insist they're worth it.   

"As long as it doesn't put you in a bad position afterwards financially," he said.

The internet helped unknown writers turn blogging into a career. YouTube did the same for content creation. Now, Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai believes vibe coding will similarly make new careers more accessible to non-tech workers.

Pichai made the comparison in a recent Google for Developers podcast interview with Logan Kilpatrick, who runs Google's AI Studio.

"It's making coding so much more enjoyable," Pichai said, as people can easily experiment with building apps and websites with no prior coding knowledge. "Things are getting more approachable, it's getting exciting again, and the amazing thing is, it's only going to get better."

From HR professionals to accountants, an increasing number of non-technical workers are using AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Replit to vibe-code their own apps.

Pichai said vibe coding gives workers a leg up in being able to visualize ideas directly, even if they aren't proficient enough in coding to do so. "In the past, you would have described it," he said. "Now, maybe you're kind of vibe coding it a little bit and showing it to people."

In some cases, vibe coding can present opportunities within tech companies themselves. Meta's product managers have been vibe-coding prototype apps and showing them to Mark Zuckerberg. At Google, Pichai said there's been a "sharp increase" in people submitting their first CLs, or changelists — code changes that address specific features or bugs.

As the vibe coding market grows at breakneck speed, there are some potential risks to handing over the act of coding to AI.

"I'm not working on large codebases where you really have to get it right, the security has to be there," he said. "Those people should weigh in."

As of now, developers say that vibe coding is best for low-stakes experimentation and not any core software that could be prone to breaches.

Pichai said that as the technology improves, vibe coding will only become more impressive — and a big part of the tech future.

"It's both amazing to see, and it's the worst it'll ever be," he said. "I can't wait to see what other people in the world come up with it."

If you're lucky enough to be up for renewal on your phone plan, Black Friday is the perfect time to do it. Both major cell service providers and smaller MVNOs are dropping their prices to commemorate the holiday, making it the perfect time to lock in a great rate. T-Mobile's Black Friday deal is one of them, giving shoppers a chance to get free iPhones, Samsung Galaxy devices, and more.

Although T-Mobile's sale was previously limited to bulk plan purchases earlier this month, newcomers can now get a free Apple or Samsung bundle with eligible trade-ins on an Experience Beyond Plan during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Costs are paid via 24 monthly bill credits. The freebies include an iPhone 17 Pro, iPad A16, and Apple Watch SE for Apple customers, or a Galaxy Z Flip 7, Galaxy Tab S10 FE, Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and Galaxy Buds 3 FE for Samsung shoppers.

If you're hoping to score a free device bundle from T-Mobile, you'll need an eligible phone trade-in. Luckily, the condition doesn't matter to them, so long as you have a qualifying device. Here are the steps to follow:

If you happen to be shopping for new phones across your family, or just prefer a different promotion, you can also kick off T-Mobile's other Black Friday deals by heading to their appropriate landing pages.

When it comes to getting a free phone, it's hard not to love it. T-Mobile's Black Friday bundle deals are an excellent way to upgrade your entire suite of devices, featuring the latest Apple and Samsung phone, tablet, and smartwatch technology in the promotion. The brand's Experience Beyond plan also offers the most bells and whistles for top-tier support, including unlimited mobile hot spot, unlimited data, and free streaming service subscriptions to Apple TV Plus, Hulu, and Netflix Standard.

For the bundle sale, be prepared to receive the amount for the phone, tablet, and smartwatch over 24 monthly bill credits. If you've never dabbled in this type of deal, it means that you'll still be billed monthly for the devices, but you'll receive the same amount as credit off your phone bill. It locks you into T-Mobile service for two years, but at least you'll have a complete setup of great tech.

A National Guard member died on Thursday after being shot near the White House in an ambush that investigators say was carried out by an Afghan national, an attack President Donald Trump blamed on Biden-era immigration vetting failures as he ordered a sweeping review of asylum cases.

Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds and her fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was "fighting for his life," Trump said, as investigators conducted what officials said was a terrorism probe after Wednesday's shooting.

The FBI searched multiple properties in a widening investigation, including a home in Washington state linked to the suspect, who officials said was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the U.S. in 2021 under a resettlement program.

Agents seized numerous electronic devices from the residence of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, and interviewed his relatives, FBI Director Kash Patel told a news conference.

U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., Jeanine Pirro said the suspect drove cross-country and then ambushed the Guard members while they were patrolling near the White House on Wednesday afternoon.

"I want to express the anguish and the horror of our entire nation that the terrorist attack yesterday in our nation's capital, in which a savage monster gunned down two service members in the West Virginia National Guard, who were deployed as part of the DC Task Force," Trump said in a Thanksgiving call with U.S. military service members.

Casting blame on the administration of his White House predecessor, President Joe Biden, Trump said the alleged gunman, who he described as having gone "cuckoo," was among thousands of Afghans who came in unvetted as the U.S. carried out a chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He provided no evidence to support his assertion.

Trump said the suspect's "atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country."

Armed with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, the gunman shot the two National Guard members before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops. He was in the hospital in serious condition, Trump said.

"My baby girl has passed to glory," Gary Beckstrom, father of the National Guard member who died, wrote on social media, adding that his family was grappling with a "horrible tragedy." Trump later spoke by phone to Beckstrom's parents, a White House official said.

The alleged assailant, who lived in Washington state with his wife and five children, appeared to have acted alone, said Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department.

Asked whether he was planning to deport the suspect's wife and five children who live in Washington state, Trump said, "We're looking at the whole situation with family."

The program under which the suspect entered the U.S., which allowed in more than 70,000 Afghan nationals, according to a congressional report, was designed with vetting procedures, including by U.S. counter-terrorism and intelligence agencies. But the large scale and rushed nature of the evacuations led critics to say the background checks were inefficient.

Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News the U.S. government planned to bring terrorism charges against the gunman and seek a sentence of life in prison "at a minimum." Following the death of the National Guard member, she suggested she would seek the death penalty.

At the press conference, Patel described the shootings as a "heinous act of terrorism," but neither he nor Pirro offered a possible motive.

Speaking to reporters, Trump echoed Pirro and Patel's accusations that the Biden administration was to blame for policies they said allowed the Afghan immigrant into the U.S., but they also offered no evidence to support their assertions

The alleged gunman was granted asylum this year under Trump, according to a U.S. government file on him seen by Reuters.

Trump did not dispute that, but told reporters, "When it comes to asylum, when they're flown in, it's very hard to get them out. No matter how you want to do it, it's very hard to get them out, but we're going to be getting them all out now."

The incident may give Trump, who has made cracking down on both legal and illegal immigration a centerpiece of his presidency, an opening to argue that even legal pathways like asylum pose security risks for Americans.

Less than 24 hours after the shooting, Trump officials began ordering widespread reviews of immigration policies.

The Trump administration was launching a review of all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration as well as Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries, Department of Homeland Security officials said.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement that Lakanwal had worked with CIA-backed local units in Afghanistan, but gave no further details.

The New York Times, citing unnamed officials, identified the CIA-backed force as a Zero Unit, trained and supported by the U.S. spy agency in the southern province of Kandahar.

The units comprised a paramilitary group trained to conduct night raids and clandestine missions during the U.S. war in Afghanistan and, with thousands of members, had officially become part of the Afghan intelligence service by the time the U.S. withdrew its troops, the Times said.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, Lakanwal entered the U.S. in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control after the U.S. withdrawal there.

"The Biden Administration justified bringing the alleged shooter to the United States in September 2021 due to his prior work with the U.S. Government," Ratcliffe said in a statement. "This individual - and so many others - should have never been allowed to come here."

A Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 this year, three months after Trump took office. Lakanwal, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.

The two Guard members from West Virginia were part of a militarized law enforcement mission ordered by Trump in August and challenged in court by Washington, D.C., officials.

Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Friday as U.S. stock futures stayed flat over Thanksgiving Day, leaving the Nasdaq Composite on track to end a seven-month winning streak.

Traders in Asia will parse fresh economic data, including Tokyo's inflation print, a leading indicator of Japan's broader price trends.

Headline inflation in Japan's capital eased to 2.7% in October from 2.8% the month before. Core inflation, which strips out prices of fresh food but includes energy prices, came in at 2.8%, slightly higher than the 2.7% expected by economists polled by Reuters. This was above the central bank's 2% target, boosting the case for a near-term rate hike.

Investors will also watch India's GDP for its fiscal second quarter through September, later in the day.

Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.17% to 50,253.91, while the broad-based Topix was 0.29% higher to end at 3,378.44. Both Japanese indexes marked their third day of gains.

South Korea's Kospi was down 1.51% and closed at 3,926.59, and the small-cap Kosdaq gained 3.71% and finished at 912.67.

Enchem, a battery materials maker listed on the Kosdaq, surged by over 16% after South Korean media reported it had won an order from Chinese battery maker Contemporary Amperex Technology Limited, or CATL. 

LG Energy Solution slipped over 6.8%, making it the largest loser on the Kospi after parent LG Chem said it would pare its stake to about 70% from its current level of almost 80%, in order to improve shareholder returns.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was marginally lower, closing at 8,614.1.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index dropped 0.34% finishing at 25,858.89, while the mainland Chinese CSI 300 rose 0.25% to end at 4,526.67. 

Shares of property developer China Vanke gained 1.12% in Hong Kong after falling to an all-time low.

India's Nifty 50 was flat, and the BSE Sensex index climbed 0.1%.

Overnight in the U.S., all three major indexes were little changed. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose just 10 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq-100 futures traded just above the flatline.

Stocks are on pace for a losing month when trading resumes on Friday. A pullback in tech stocks has weighed on the major averages in November, as doubt swirled around the future profitability of AI companies.

Yet some investors are hopeful that this month's slide will signal a year-end rally for the major averages, as they step in to buy stocks that have been unduly punished at more attractive valuations.

U.S. markets were closed Thursday for Thanksgiving Day. The stock market will close early at 1 p.m. ET on Friday.

Oops, something went wrong

Stablecoin issuer Tether is halting its Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay.

The firm, which issues USDT, the third biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, said it made the decision to leave the South American country due to high energy costs.

Local media reported that El Salvador-based Tether had confirmed to Uruguay's Ministry of Labor and Social Security that it was laying off 30 of its 38 employees in the country. The firm also confirmed the exit to Cointelegraph.

Tether did not immediately respond to Decrypt's questions.

Back in September, local media reported that Tether—which in October reported $10 billion in profit for the first three quarters of 2025—was in a dispute with Uruguay's government-owned power company UTE over a $5 million debt. 

Tether issues USDT—the most-traded digital coin in the crypto world, and the third-biggest digital asset with a $184.4 billion market cap. 

The token is dubbed a digital dollar: It is backed by reserves, according to Tether, that keep it at a 1:1 par with the US dollar. Cantor Fitzgerald, previously headed up by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's, currently custodies billions of dollars in assets that back Tether. 

S&P Downgrades Tether's USDT Stability to 'Weak' Due to Bitcoin Backing Concerns

Traders in the crypto world can use USDT to quickly enter and exit digital transactions like Bitcoin buys. 

But Tether also wants to be the world's biggest Bitcoin miner, according to its CEO Paolo Ardoino. 

South American countries have been eyed up by Bitcoin miners due to their cheap energy. The crypto mining industry requires huge data centers full of expensive computers that use large amounts of electricity to process transactions on the blockchain and mint new tokens. 

Tether is making further inroads into Latin America after relocating to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador in January. The company bought a majority stake in South American agricultural firm Adecoagro in March.

Oops, something went wrong

Crypto-related equities like BitMine Immersion Technologies and leading Bitcoin miners CleanSpark and Riot Platforms are strongly positive amid crypto market rebounds sending Bitcoin above $92,000 earlier Friday and Ethereum back over $3,000. 

Shares in BitMine (BMNR), the leading Ethereum treasury firm, are up 4.47% today and more than 27% over the last 5 trading days, now changing hands at $33.16.

The firm, which is chaired by outspoken investor Tom Lee, has remained bullish on the second-largest crypto asset, consistently adding to its coffers despite ETH's more than 38% drawdown from its August all-time high. BitMine holds over $11 billion worth of Ethereum.

CleanSpark (CLSK) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are up even more, jumping 12.27% and 7.8%, respectively since Friday's opening bell. The pair have posted even larger gains over the last five days, highlighted by CleanSpark's move of more than 54% during that time. 

That move though has only helped diminish some of its monthly losses, with shares of CLSK still down around 21% during that time, changing hands at $15.10.

The roller coaster ride comes just a few weeks after the Bitcoin mining firm upsized a convertible notes offering to $1.15 billion, with nearly half earmarked for share buybacks at an average price of $15.03. 

Shares in other Bitcoin miners, like Bitfarms (BITF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) are both up more than 5% on Friday as well. 

Myriad Moves: Predictors Turn Bullish on Bitcoin Rebounding to $100K

The pair are among a growing list of Bitcoin miners planning to play a pivotal role in AI compute, with Bitfarms aiming to completely transition away from Bitcoin mining throughout 2026-2027 after posting a $46 million loss in Q3. 

Cipher Mining shares jumped 22% earlier this month after it announced a $5.5 billion, 15-year lease agreement to provide space and power for Amazon Web Services and AI workloads. CIFR shares are now up more than 500% in the last six months. 

Further down the list, shares of MARA Holdings (MARA) and HIVE Digital Technologies have jumped 5% and 6% respectively on Friday. 

But it's not just miners enjoying a Friday green session. Digital asset treasuries that have seen their shares slide of late are getting a nice reprieve. 

'Improving Risk Sentiment' Driving Bitcoin's $90K Retest: QCP

Alongside BitMine, shares in SharpLink Gaming, Forward Industries, and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) are all green. However, shares in the trio have lost 22%, 43%, and 37% respectively in the last month. 

Odds of a December rate cut have improved of late, with predictors on Myriad—a prediction market operated by Decrypt's parent company, Dastan—giving about 85% odds that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 25 bps, perhaps creating near-term catalysts for all markets. 

As such, Bitcoin and Ethereum have jumped 7% and 9.4% over the last week, respectively. BTC was recently changing hands at $90,868, while ETH trades at $3,047.

Bitcoin dominance has dropped to the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level, falling to 59% and continuing a decline that began in early November, potentially signaling the start of an altcoin rotation as the leading cryptocurrency's market share pulls back from recent highs.

The pullback in Bitcoin dominance follows a rejection at a major resistance zone, with the current level representing a key technical threshold that traders monitor for market rotation signals.

Bitcoin dominance tracks the cryptocurrency's market capitalization relative to the broader crypto market. A decline in this metric typically indicates liquidity shifting away from Bitcoin toward alternative digital assets.

The current retreat to the 23.6% Fibonacci level suggests early-stage rotation into altcoins, as lower dominance levels historically correlate with increased investment flows into non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies.

Oops, something went wrong

While doom was permeating markets last week, crypto participants are a bit more cheerful with the passing of Thanksgiving and the beginnings of a market rally.

Bitcoin has jumped 7.4% in the last 7 days, reclaiming $91,000, but still sitting nearly 28% off its August all-time high. Where's it headed next? Predictors on Myriad are starting to lean bullish. 

We'll look at just how bullish while investigating some of Myriad's top markets this week.

(Disclaimer: Myriad Markets is a product of Decrypt's parent company, Dastan.)

Market Open: November 5 Market Close: Open until resolution Volume: $19.9K Link: See the latest odds on the "Bitcoin's next move: Pump to $100K or dump to $69K?" market on Myriad

Bitcoin's near-term fate remains one of the most popular markets among Myriad predictors. This time, predictors are asked whether the top crypto asset's next move will be a pump to $100K or dump to $69K. 

BTC has been steadily gaining ground after a slide and liquidations sent it briefly below $82,000. After a 10% weekly rebound, predictors are leaning bullish, giving odds of a pump to $100,000 around a 74% chance as of Friday morning. 

That marks around a 24% increase in odds for the pump since the market was created. Analysts have cited waning institutional interest and the uncertainty of Federal Reserve policy as reasons for the fall—but have we reached selling exhaustion?

Experts like Tom Lee, Chairman of BitMine Immersion Technologies, think the market has merely been resetting since the record-breaking $19 billion liquidations on October 10, and that BTC may still be in line for a new high before year-end. 

Strategy's Michael Saylor is predictably bullish for a year-end run, as well, saying last month that $150,000 is still in play before January.

Monero and Zcash Diverge in Double-Digit Weekly Swing as Privacy Coins Rotate

Odds are shifting back in favor of a December rate cut, potentially offering a near-term catalyst as well. 

Bitcoin will need to jump 9.8% to tip $100,000 once more. It will need to drop more than 24% to pay off more bearish predictors that think a drop to $69,000 is in store. 

What's Next? The FOMC meeting will take place on December 9-10, with odds of a rate cut improving to around 84%, according to Myriad predictors. 

Market Open: November 25 Market Close: Open until resolution Volume: $702 Link: See the latest odds on the "Will Brian Armstrong appear on the first episode of UpOnly?"   market on Myriad

Coinbase recently spent around $400 million to acquire Echo, a crypto fundraising platform founded by pseudonymous crypto personality Cobie, whose real name is Jordan Fish. 

Part of the deal included a $25 million purchase of the UpOnly NFT, a token that granted the purchaser the rights to another season of the popular crypto podcast UpOnly, which stars Fish and another pseudonymous crypto personality, LedgerStatus.

The purchase comes with a few conditions, including the right for the UpOnly co-hosts to choose the guests of the show—though according to the NFT, they might “ask for some suggestions” if they like the purchaser. 

Since Fish has been playing the role of Coinbase customer support on X, some may infer that he is on good enough terms with the NFT purchaser and acquirer of his firm. But is his newly created professional relationship enough to summon Brian Armstrong on the first episode of the UpOnly return?

That's what predictors on Myriad are tasked with deciding. As of Friday morning, odds stand at nearly 60% “no,” with predictors leaning against preferential treatment that would thrust the Coinbase CEO into the guest seat for the first episode. 

Fish has said that the show will commence when they've figured out all eight guests, but early guest ideas from the Echo founder did not include Armstrong. 

Is that because it's a given? Predictors think not. 

What's Next? No timetable for the show's return has been announced.

Market Open: July 4 Market Close: December 31 Volume: $27.8K Link: See the latest odds on the "Will Revolut announce its own stablecoin?"  market on Myriad

Neobank giant Revolut has been cozying up with crypto lately, integrating Polygon to power stablecoin payments and remittances, and securing a Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license from the Cyprus securities regulator. 

The firm, which recently raised at around a $75 billion valuation, has offered crypto trading since as early as 2017 and this summer was rumored to be considering the launch of its own stablecoin. 

Since that time, predictors on Myriad have been asked whether or not the firm will announce one by the end of the year.

In July, predictors briefly favored the chances of Revolut announcing a stablecoin launch. But for the bulk of the market's existence, odds were strongly against the European fintech firm revealing a fiat-backed token, averaging around 75% “no,” until early October when odds moved to around a coinflip. 

Reasons for a strong odds move are not immediately apparent, but around the time of the move, the firm did gain approval to establish a bank in Colombia, where it said it aims to offer a “portfolio of innovative financial products.” 

Neobank Revolut Boosts Valuation to $75 Billion Ahead of Potential Stablecoin Launch

But since that time, the market has slid back to favor no stablecoin announcement. 

That's despite the MiCA announcement, after which a lawyer that specializes in crypto regulation in the EU told Decrypt the launch of a Revolut stablecoin by 2026 was a “plausible” development. 

But it becomes less plausible every day as the calendar turns, with predictors sliding odds another 4% this week to 86% “no.” 

What's Next? This market will close for predictions four hours before the year end.

 Shares of U.S. chipmaker Intel were leading the S&P higher as stocks edged upward on a holiday-shortened Black Friday session expected to be light on trading volume and corporate news.


 All three of the major indexes were modestly higher, led by the blue-chip Dow, in late-morning trading. It's an abridged day for traders after yesterday's holiday break: The stock market closes at 1 p.m., while the bond market is set to close an hour later. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's action here.)


 Intel (INTC) was the biggest mover, on a percentage basis, on the S&P 500 in either direction, rising about 8%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) was the biggest decliner, slipping close to 3%.


 A few consumer-focused companies were among the top movers on Black Friday, a vital in-store and online shopping day. Brown-Forman (BF.A, BF.B), known for Jack Daniel's whiskeys and Herradura tequilas, among other things, was up 1.5%, while athletic apparel company Lululemon (LULU) was more than 2% higher. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY), which reported its latest quarterly financial results earlier this week, was more than 1% lower.


 Some high-profile stocks associated with the AI buildout were in the red today. Nvidia (NVDA) was recently down 1.8%, while Oracle (ORCL) was off 2.2%. Both companies' shares were among the bigger decliners in the S&P 500. Broadly speaking, Big Tech was creeping upward: The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) was recently up 0.3%.


 Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) were recently up nearly 4%. Cathie Wood's ARK funds have reported purchases of the stock this week; the price of Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $92,000 as the leading cryptocurrency extended its bounce off recent lows. Bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) was up 2.4%.

The Australian government has introduced a bill to regulate digital asset platforms, requiring them to hold financial services licenses. This move toward regulatory clarity is a green light for the industry, indicating that crypto is becoming a permanent fixture in the global financial system. 

However, investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy, with DeepSnitch AI becoming the top choice for a project that will deliver immediate gains. Its presale has already delivered over 65% profits to those who joined early after raising over $609,000. 

Australia's Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino introduced the Corporations Amendment (Digital Assets Framework) Bill 2025 to the House of Representatives. This legislation is a step in bringing the crypto industry under the umbrella of existing financial services laws. 

The main requirement of the bill is that crypto companies, including exchanges and custody providers, must obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL) to operate within the country.

Mulino explained the necessity of this regulation during his address. “Across the world, digital assets are reshaping finance,” he told the House.  The bill aims to provide a structured environment for digital asset platforms, ensuring consumer protection while fostering a stable ecosystem for growth.

While regulators build frameworks, the market is still bearish, with investors trying to recover from Bitcoin bleeding. In the middle of this, DeepSnitch AI gives power back to the average investor. It is among the best altcoins to buy if you see serious gains. 

If you have not heard of it before, the SnitchFeed AI agent actively tracks whale movements and sentiment shifts. SnitchScan is live as a concept, designed to be a “bear-proof” scam filter that audits contracts for risk before you invest. 

Staking is also live, offering a dynamic, uncapped APY that has already attracted significant participation. The dashboard is operational. Look at Fartcoin: it delivered a staggering 1,600% gain purely as a meme coin.

Now, imagine DeepSnitch AI that has that same viral marketing energy (a 30% marketing allocation) combined with essential, high-demand utility. That's why joining the presale now, with a launch planned by January, is the best choice for smart investors. 

Fartcoin increased by more than 19% in the last seven days and outperformed the general market. This project, which has already delivered massive gains from its lows, proves that the market has an appetite for viral narratives.

Technical analysts predict that by 2027, FARTCOIN could trade between $1.48 and $1.75, with an average of $1.52. This bullish outlook suggests that despite being a “joke” coin, it is still among the best altcoins to buy. 

However, for new investors, the massive 1600% move has already happened. 

0G (0G) is another undervalued altcoin showing promise. It has risen 3.80% in the last week, outperforming the general market. As a smart contract platform, it is positioning itself as a competitor in a crowded field.

While the sentiment is bearish, the long-term price prediction is incredibly bullish. Analysts forecast a 152% rise to $3.04 by late 2030. This suggests that while short-term volatility is high, the project has strong fundamental value to be among the best altcoins to buy.

Australia's new bill confirms that crypto is here to stay. While established meme coins like Fartcoin have had their 1600% moment, the real opportunity lies in finding the next breakout star. DeepSnitch AI offers the perfect combination: the viral potential of a meme coin backed by the “live utility” of a serious AI platform. 

With over $609,000 raised and a January launch planned, this is one of the best altcoins to buy for those seeking exponential growth in 2026.

Visit the official DeepSnitch AI website, join the Telegram, and follow on X (Twitter) for the latest updates.

DeepSnitch AI is one of the best altcoins to buy because it offers asymmetric upside. It is a low-cap presale in the AI sector. 

While specific ChatGPT crypto predictions vary, AI models generally favor sectors with high growth potential. The altcoin forecast 2026 shows tokens like DeepSnitch AI are the best options for anyone who wants a chance at massive gains.

The January launch creates immediate urgency. Once the token hits public exchanges, the massive price gains begin. Investors looking for the best altcoins to buy at the absolute floor need to act during the presale to secure the best possible entry point.

Simple Proof, the bitcoin-based document timestamping company, recently announced official partnerships with El Salvador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Environment to protect

government records using the Bitcoin blockchain technology. The announcement was made during the Bitcoin Histórico conference at the National Theatre in San Salvador, where CEO Carlos Toriello presented alongside OpenTimestamps creator and Bitcoin Core Contributor Peter Todd.

The collaboration marks El Salvador's continued leadership in applying Bitcoin technology beyond financial applications. Both ministries have begun registering official documents on the Bitcoin blockchain, with verified records now publicly accessible through dedicated government portals.

“Bitcoin is not just digital money — it's also a clock that no one controls. This allows us to certify with precision the exact moment a document was created, guaranteeing its authenticity and protecting the country's history forever… We're helping ensure that the country's history is preserved intact and can be verified directly on Bitcoin, without intermediaries,” said Carlos Toriello, CEO of Simple Proof, in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. 

The company has had multiple successful pilot programs in the past, including one in Screven County, Georgia, in the United States and another in Guatemala, where it had a direct influence on the 2023 elections. 

This deployment builds on Simple Proof's previous work in El Salvador, where CUBO+ program graduation certificates became the first public documents in the country registered via the Bitcoin blockchain. 

The Ministry of Environment's timestamped documents, including national reports and public files, are available at blockchain.ambiente.gob.sv. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs offers verification of institutional reports and records at rree.gob.sv/logros-y-memorias. 

Peter Todd, creator of OpenTimestamps, the platform and protocol used in part to time-stamp critical data on the Bitcoin blockchain, said in the press release that, “With a single transaction, we can protect millions of documents without congesting the network or altering its monetary function,” noting that the system stores only cryptographic hashes rather than actual documents on Bitcoin.

The project positions El Salvador as a global reference for using blockchain technology in government

information management, strengthening the transparency and public trust of democratic institutions and processes, by eliminating the possibility of document tampering.

Bitcoin has surged following a steep sell-off earlier this month, climbing as traders brace for a major BlackRock update.

The bitcoin price has topped $90,000 per bitcoin after dropping to $80,000, soaring  despite JPMorgan sounding the alarm over a looming threat to bitcoin-buying behemoth Strategy.

Now, as traders bet on a December Federal Reserve game-changer, a report has revealed bitcoin has made a sudden return in China, defying a 2021 ban that tanked the bitcoin price.

Bitcoin miners have returned to China in recent months, tempted by cheap electricity and data center boom, according to a Reuters report citing data from Hashrate Index that found China made up 14% of the global bitcoin mining market at the end of October.

“The resurgence of mining activity in China is one of the most important signals the market has seen in years,” Patrick Gruhn, chief executive of crypto market infrastructure company Perpetuals.com, told the newswire, adding “even hints of China's policy easing could act as a tailwind for bitcoin's narrative as a global, state-resilient asset.”

Bitcoin and crypto trading, as well as the mining of cryptocurrency using high-powered computers to secure crypto networks in exchange for newly minted coins, remains illegal in mainland China following a 2021 ban.

“Despite Beijing's 2021 ban, bitcoin mining in China is quietly reviving, fueled by cheap electricity, surplus power, and new data centres in regions like Xinjiang,” analysts with Tagus Capital wrote in an emailed note.

“Small and large miners are resuming operations as bitcoin prices ‘broadly' rise, boosting profitability, while mining rig sales and network metrics confirm growing activity. Subtle local policy shifts, economic incentives, and overbuilt infrastructure support the rebound, with China now controlling 21% of global mining capacity. This resurgence demonstrates how financial incentives can override regulatory barriers, influencing global bitcoin supply and stabilising network activity.”

Earlier this month, U.S. president Donald Trump warned China is trying to take on the U.S. as the world's “capital of crypto.”

"I don't want to have somebody else have crypto and have China be number one in the world in crypto," Trump told CBS's 60 Minutes.

“Because in crypto it's a kind of an industry where basically you're going to have number one and you're not gonna have a number two. And right now we're number one by a long shot. I want to keep it that way. The same way we're number one with AI, we're number one with crypto."

                    Friday, 28 Nov 2025

(Reuters) -Fresh turbulence in the crypto market is weighing on shares of companies that stockpile bitcoin and other tokens on their balance sheets, stoking concerns over stress in the niche but fast-growing sector.

Buoyed by U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance and inspired by the meteoric success of Michael Saylor's Strategy, the number of publicly traded companies investing in cryptocurrencies in the hopes they will appreciate has boomed this year.

However, concerns over a potential AI bubble and uncertainty over the path of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts have weighed on risk assets lately, pushing bitcoin this month to its lowest level since April and sending many of these "digital asset treasury" or DAT companies wobbling.

At least 15 bitcoin treasury companies were trading below the net asset value of their tokens as of Friday, according to data from crypto publication The Block.

With DATs holding 4% of all bitcoin, 3.1% of all ether and 0.8% of all solana, their fortunes could have major implications for coin prices, Standard Chartered analysts wrote in a September note, adding they expected consolidation in the space.

DAT executives say their success will be rooted in their ability to make smart investing decisions, and many are seeking new ways to generate income. 

Here's a look at the performance of some of the most popular and high-profile DATs. 

BITCOIN TREASURY

Shares of bitcoin DATs, the most prevalent type, have fallen substantially from their 2025 highs. Michael Saylor's Strategy - which pioneered corporate bitcoin hoarding, spawning dozens of copycats that have saturated the market - has dropped almost 36% in November alone.  

ETHER STRATEGY

As the bitcoin DAT sector became overcrowded, new entrants have diversified into other coins including ether, with firms like Bitmine and Sharplink Gaming leading the charge into ether. 

Their shares spiked earlier this year when they announced their stockpiling plans, but are now well off their 2025 highs. 

Unlike bitcoin DATs, which rely solely on price appreciation, ether can be used in "staking", a process in which ether holders help secure and validate blockchain transactions in return for rewards, often paid in more ether. That means ether DATs have other means for generating and gathering ether tokens.

SOLANA AND OTHER ALTCOINS

Several companies have also broadened their holdings to include "altcoins" such as solana and Ripple's XRP.

Small companies have also started to dip into more thinly traded volatile tokens in a bid to boost their profits, creating more potential volatility risk for their share price.

ALT5 Sigma, for example, is a company that started a DAT strategy hoarding the Trump family's cryptocurrency venture, World Liberty Financial.

South Africa's central bank has decided not to proceed with a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC) for now. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) concluded that the country has no immediate need for a CBDC despite years of research. Instead, it plans to focus on strengthening the national payment system and improving access for non-bank financial participants.

The SARB confirmed that a retail CBDC is technically feasible but unnecessary at present. It believes that ongoing payment reforms will deliver faster and broader financial inclusion in the near term. The bank will direct resources toward modernizing payment infrastructure and expanding participation within the existing financial ecosystem.

The central bank emphasized that current upgrades aim to enhance settlement efficiency and inclusivity. It sees this approach as a more practical step toward strengthening digital finance. The SARB wants to ensure that any future CBDC aligns with national policy goals and regulatory frameworks.

The decision follows a global trend where many central banks are reassessing the urgency of retail digital currencies. While several countries continue pilot projects, few have achieved broad adoption. The SARB prefers a measured path over rapid implementation.

Although South Africa will not issue a retail CBDC soon, the central bank maintains flexibility for future adoption. It recognizes that a CBDC could eventually ensure continued public access to central bank money in a digital age. It insists that such a system must match cash in affordability ease of use, privacy and offline capability.

The SARB's studies found that financial inclusion remains a key challenge, with about 16% of adults still unbanked. It believes that strengthening digital payments through reforms will achieve better outcomes in the short term. It plans to monitor international progress and adjust its stance when necessary.

The central bank's position paper highlighted that future demand for a CBDC could arise as technology and consumer needs evolve. It aims to balance innovation with financial stability. This balanced approach will ensure readiness for digital transformation when the timing proves appropriate.

The SARB will now deepen its exploration of wholesale CBDC applications. These efforts will assess how digital currencies can improve settlement systems and cross-border transactions. The findings are expected to guide future decisions regarding a broader CBDC rollout.

The bank has warned that unregulated crypto assets and stablecoins pose growing financial risks. It is developing new regulations with the National Treasury to strengthen oversight and prevent misuse. The Financial Sector Conduct Authority has already begun licensing crypto service providers.

Global experience has shown mixed results in retail CBDC implementation. Nigeria, Jamaica and The Bahamas have launched digital currencies but seen limited adoption. In this context, South Africa's cautious strategy reflects its focus on practical reforms that enhance financial stability and digital efficiency.

The initiative represents the first-ever attempt to introduce tokenized deposits into real estate payment workflows in Japan—a sector long burdened by paper-based procedures and slow settlement times.

The pilot combines Shinoken Group's real estate expertise with DeCurret DCP's blockchain infrastructure to test improvements in settlement efficiency, cost reduction, and automation.

Traditional real estate transactions in Japan often involve high-value transfers, multiple intermediaries, and lengthy processing times. By incorporating DCJPY, the companies aim to enable instant settlement for transactions involving security tokens, NFTs, and other digitized assets.

Unlike typical stablecoins, DCJPY is a tokenized representation of actual bank deposits, making it a fully regulated digital currency issued by a licensed financial institution.

Key characteristics include:

In an August 2024 review, the Bank of Japan noted that tokenized deposits align well with the current monetary system and highlighted their advantages in tamper resistance and operational resilience.

Japan Post Bank, one of Japan's largest financial institutions with approximately USD 1.27 trillion (¥190 trillion) in deposits, is advancing a broad digital transformation strategy. The institution plans to begin full-scale deployment of tokenized deposit services by fiscal year 2026.

DeCurret DCP has already collaborated with partners such as GMO Aozora Net Bank to test blockchain-based settlement for digital bonds and environmental value certificates. The new real estate pilot could significantly accelerate blockchain adoption in Japan's financial infrastructure.

Looking ahead, the companies may explore interoperability with public blockchains such as Ethereum, as well as synergies with broader digital assets including Bitcoin.

South Africa's central bank has cooled expectations for a retail central bank digital currency, saying the country does not face an urgent need to launch one and should focus instead on upgrading the existing payments system.

Key Takeaways:

In a research paper published Thursday, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) said a consumer-facing CBDC is technically possible but not necessary in the near term.

The bank argued that current reforms aimed at improving the national payments rails, adding faster settlement, and widening participation by non-bank providers offer a more practical route to better financial access for now.

“While the SARB does not currently advocate for the implementation of a retail CBDC, it will continue to monitor developments and will remain prepared to act should the need arise,” the paper said.

Rather than pursuing a digital rand for everyday use, the central bank plans to focus on wholesale applications of digital currency and on boosting the efficiency of cross-border payments.

The move reflects a view that targeted infrastructure upgrades could deliver benefits sooner than a broad consumer rollout that would require new legal, technical and operational frameworks.

SARB's researchers also tested whether a retail CBDC would solve gaps in the country's payments network and found mixed results.

About 16% of adults remain unbanked, but the bank said a digital currency would need to match or beat cash on key features such as offline use, universal acceptance, ease of use, privacy and low cost to make a meaningful dent in that number.

Drawing on years of research, technical experimentation and stakeholder engagement, the SARB finds that ‒ while a… pic.twitter.com/hCAMGAHOdP

The paper landed as the central bank issued fresh warnings about crypto assets and stablecoins.

In a separate report this week, SARB flagged the sector as a growing risk to technology-led finance and cautioned that digital tokens could be used to route money around the country's exchange controls, which govern capital flows.

Globally, the CBDC push remains uneven.

Only three countries, including Nigeria, Jamaica, and The Bahamas, have fully launched digital currencies, while dozens of others are running pilots or are in development or research phases, according to the Atlantic Council's tracker.

In contrast, the United States is seeking to shelve its CBDC work under the Trump administration.

In July, the US House narrowly passed a key procedural vote, clearing the path for final decisions on three major crypto bills: the GENIUS stablecoin bill, the CLARITY Act, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act.

In September, House Republicans moved to combine the measure banning the Federal Reserve from creating a CBDC with the CLARITY Act.

However, the CLARITY Act has not been signed into law, but is still under consideration in the Senate. The bill requires passage by both the Senate and the House, and then presidential approval, before it can be enacted.

Researchers Dr. Adrienne Chan and Professor Ian Wong of Aston University examined how antiseizure medications are used around the world.

Growing Access to Seizure Medicines and New Safety Concerns

A study conducted with support from the World Health Organization has revealed that although more people in low- and middle-income countries are gaining access to antiseizure medications, these treatments are not always being used in ways that protect patient safety.

Dr. Adrienne Chan and Professor Ian Wong examined antiseizure medication trends across 73 countries from 2012 to 2022. They note that the increasing availability of these medicines suggests progress in access to essential neurological treatments. However, they also found that valproate remains the most commonly used option, even though it can lead to birth defects and neurodevelopmental issues when taken during pregnancy. Reported problems include spina bifida, cleft palate, and a range of intellectual, communication, behavior and memory disorders.

WHO Flags Valproate as a Major Global Risk

The World Health Organization (WHO) includes valproate on its list of "essential medicines." Despite this, the agency advises against its use for women and girls who could become pregnant because of the potential for birth defects. WHO has identified disorders linked to prenatal valproate exposure as a serious worldwide concern.

Uneven Global Progress in Safe Prescribing

The study's authors say there is an urgent need for widespread education to ensure that healthcare providers understand the risks and can offer safer alternatives when appropriate. In many higher-income countries, stricter regulations and pregnancy prevention programs have led to declines in valproate use. In other regions where newer antiseizure therapies remain too costly or difficult to obtain, valproate is still prescribed more often.

The WHO commissioned this research to support its broader goal of promoting safe, fair, and consistent access to essential neurological medicines around the world.

Next Steps to Protect Patients and Future Children

The study relied on sales data from each participating country. The researchers state that further work is needed to examine how these medicines are being used within specific populations and to assess whether safety guidelines are actually being followed. This will help clarify how often these drugs are being prescribed to women of childbearing age and what risks this may pose to unborn children.

Dr. Chan said:

"Our findings show that access to antiseizure medicines is expanding globally, which is good news for patients who previously had little or no treatment options. But the continued widespread use of valproate in some parts of the world is concerning, given its known risks during pregnancy. Greater global alignment on safe prescribing and education is urgently needed to protect future generations."

Graphene is a remarkable form of carbon, built from a single layer of tightly connected atoms that is only one atom thick. Despite its thinness, it is highly stable and conducts electricity extremely well. Because of these qualities, graphene is considered a "miracle material" and is already being explored for flexible electronic screens, highly sensitive sensors, advanced batteries, and next-generation solar cells.

A new study led by the University of Göttingen, in collaboration with teams in Braunschweig, Bremen, and Fribourg, shows that graphene may be capable of even more. For the first time, scientists have directly observed "Floquet effects" in graphene. This finding settles a long-running scientific question: Floquet engineering, a technique in which light pulses precisely modify the properties of a material, can also function in metallic and semi-metallic quantum materials such as graphene. The research appears in Nature Physics.

Direct Evidence of Floquet States in Graphene

To probe these effects, the team used femtosecond momentum microscopy, a method that allows researchers to capture extremely fast changes in electronic behavior. The graphene samples were illuminated with rapid bursts of light and then examined with a delayed pulse to follow how the electrons responded over ultrashort timescales.

"Our measurements clearly prove that 'Floquet effects' occur in the photoemission spectrum of graphene," says Dr. Marco Merboldt of the University of Göttingen, the study's first author. "This makes it clear that Floquet engineering actually works in these systems -- and the potential of this discovery is huge." Their results demonstrate that Floquet engineering is effective in a wide range of materials. This brings scientists closer to the ability to shape quantum materials with specific characteristics using laser pulses within extremely short intervals.

Light-Controlled Quantum Materials for Future Technologies

Being able to tune materials with such precision could lay the groundwork for future electronics, computers, and highly advanced sensors. Professor Marcel Reutzel, who led the project in Göttingen together with Professor Stefan Mathias, explains: "Our results open up new ways of controlling electronic states in quantum materials with light. This could lead to technologies in which electrons are manipulated in a targeted and controlled manner."

Reutzel continues: "What is particularly exciting is that this also enables us to investigate topological properties. These are special, very stable properties which have great potential for developing reliable quantum computers or new sensors for the future."

This research was supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG) through Göttingen University's Collaborative Research Centre "Control of Energy Conversion at Atomic Scales."

 Some of the ancient buildings, located along China's mountaintop rivers, dated back to as far as 2800 B.C.E., with others were remnants of the country's dynasties.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Nestled in the mountains outside of Yulin, China, are 573 previously undiscovered stone fortress settlements, some dating as far back as 2800 B.C.E.

According to a report from the Global Times, Yulin's cultural heritage and archaeology team spent six years surveying China's Shaanxi Province to locate the sites, some from the Yangshao period starting in 2800 B.C.E., others from the Shang Dynasty (1600 to 1046 B.C.E.), and still another group of settlements dating to the Zhou Dynasty (1046 to 221 B.C.E.).

The stone fortresses were located along rivers, which is how researchers were able to locate them. The team followed water system maps into the field, both in person and with aerial mapping, to locate and examine the sites. The highly defensive, stone-enclosed areas were sometimes settled next to what the team labeled as ordinary settlements without stone walls. 

Ma Mingzhi, head of the research team, told the outlet there was a clear relationship in the clusters between the stone-wall sites and those without. The non-fortified sites were often smaller than the settlements with the stone walls, indicating that the stone fortresses were the key draws for others to gather at the location. 

Some of the finds were quite complex. Mingzhi said that all 573 of the locations ranged in size and with that came unique layouts and shifting construction techniques. Some fortresses were small and rudimentary in construction, while others, typically the newer builds, featured complex interior layouts and more advanced building capabilities. No matter the site, though, Mingzhi said there was a distinct social hierarchy visible within the sites. 

The idea of building a walled settlement was common thousands of years ago. Doing so near a source of water was pretty much a necessity. Last year, archaeologists located a walled city in the northern Saudi Arabian desert that was likely home to 500 people as far back as 2,400 B.C.E., part of a growing urban complex with a sophisticated social hierarchy. Any time there's multiple people in one place social hierarchy can enter the fray. In China, that seemingly occurred at least 573 times just in the Yulin area alone.

Mingzhi believes that the discovery of the 500-plus fortresses now opens a world of exploration in how prehistoric settlements in China expanded and changed over time. The new finds will help researchers trace the movement of society and culture, including the study of defensive architecture and community planning.

CBD is already used by many people for issues such as chronic pain, nausea, and inflammation. A new analysis suggests that dogs might also experience some of these benefits. Researchers in the US examined information from the Dog Aging Project to better understand the characteristics, health patterns, and behavior of dogs that received CBD or hemp supplements. Their findings were published in Frontiers in Veterinary Science.

"Behaviorally, dogs given CBD products for multiple years are initially more aggressive compared to dogs not receiving those products, but their aggression becomes less intense over time," said senior author Dr. Maxwell Leung, an assistant professor and the director of Cannabis Analytics, Safety and Health Initiative at Arizona State University.

"This long-term behavioral change highlights the potential of CBD as a therapy for canine behavioral issues," added co-author Dr. Julia Albright, an associate professor at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Tennessee.

Large-Scale Study Tracks CBD Use in U.S. Companion Dogs

This research represents the most extensive effort so far to investigate CBD use among pet dogs in the US. The team relied on the Dog Aging Project, a long-term community science initiative in which owners provide yearly updates on their pets' diet, lifestyle, health, and living conditions. A total of 47,355 dogs were included, with data collected through annual surveys between 2019 and 2023.

Owners detailed how often their dogs consumed CBD or hemp products. Frequent users received a supplement every day, while infrequent users were given supplements less often than once a day. Owners could also indicate that their dogs had never been given CBD.

Who Receives CBD? Age, Health Conditions, and Household Patterns

Clear patterns emerged when the researchers examined which dogs were most likely to be given CBD. "In our sample, 7.3% of the companion dogs in the US have been given CBD and hemp products," said Leung. Of these, 2,759 dogs (5.8%) were frequent users. Dogs receiving the supplements tended to be older; on average, they were three years older than dogs that did not receive CBD.

Several health issues were linked to higher CBD use. The strongest association was seen in dogs with dementia (18.2%), followed by those with osteoarthritis joint problems (12.5%) and those diagnosed with cancer (10%).

Dogs living in states where human medical cannabis is legal were also more likely to receive CBD. This may reflect how owners' attitudes toward cannabis influence their decisions for their pets. Male dogs were given CBD more often, with a 9% higher likelihood than female dogs. However, activity levels did not differ significantly between dogs that used CBD and those that did not.

Behavioral Changes Suggest a Gradual Calming Effect

The study also documented behavioral differences. Dogs that received CBD for extended periods were described as having lower-than-average aggression levels compared to dogs with no CBD use. This pattern suggests that CBD could play a role in reducing aggressive behaviors. Other behavioral traits, such as agitation or anxiety, did not show the same association. "Most canine aggression is related to underlying stress or anxiety -- a fight or flight response that kicks in. It is unclear why only aggression but not other types of anxious or agitated behaviors seemed to be improved with CBD treatment," Albright said.

Research Gaps, Safety Concerns, and the Need for Better Data

The team noted that the study did not explore the biological reasons behind these behavioral shifts, and controlled research will be necessary to confirm CBD's calming potential. They also pointed out several limitations in the available data, including possible owner bias and the lack of detailed information about CBD dosage, product formulations, administration methods, and sources. "At this point, we do not have a complete picture about the behavioral treatment plan," Albright pointed out.

Owners considering CBD for their dogs should purchase reliable products and be cautious with dosing, since CBD can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal upset and diarrhea.

According to the team, this study provides an early framework for examining how CBD might help address health and behavior problems in older dogs, as well as in humans with similar concerns. "There are many similarities in how CBD can benefit dogs and humans medically," Leung concluded.

Need extra power? Look no further than Black Friday to find the lowest prices of the year on a new power station. These battery-based devices are great to have on hand for charging devices on outdoor adventures or powering appliances during an emergency. Jackery, one of the most recognizable names in this category, is offering discounts of up to 60 percent off during this sales holiday with some of the best offers we've seen this year.

Power Stations are eco-friendly alternatives to traditional fuel-powered generators, loved for their lack of emissions—you can place one anywhere inside your home without the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning—and their virtually silent operation won't have the neighbors complaining about the noise. They also deliver clean, stable power that won't harm sensitive devices like TVs or laptops.  

When we tested power stations, we found that this Jackery Explorer 300 Plus was “light enough for us to carry in a backpack over a short hike through the trails in our tester's backyard, yet still powerful enough that we could use it to make a protein shake in a blender.” Meanwhile, we also ranked the more powerful Jackery Explorer 1000 V2 as our best overall in our roundup of solar-powered generators. Both are on sale for Black Friday and Cyber Monday at record-low prices. 

If any of the deals are calling you, this is the best time to buy. Using third-party price trackers to verify our research, almost all of the deals we found are the lowest prices of the year, or at least match the lowest prices. Some are even beating the prices we saw on Amazon's Prime Day in July and Big Deal Days in October. You may see these prices again at various points throughout the year, but there's no guarantee of when, and we predict they won't go lower.

This new compact power station drops to $132 for Black Friday, and with 200 watts of output power, which is a lot more power than a cheaper, basic power bank. With USB-A and USB-C ports, you can charge up to four devices at once, and you can recharge the station using an optional solar panel.

Though an older model, our research shows that the Black Friday price matches the all-time lowest price ever seen for this compact power station, which can deliver AC power to small appliances or devices from two outlets, as well as DC power to recharge digital devices.

This was our test editors' pick in our guide to solar-compatible power stations (i.e., solar generators). It offers 1,000 watts of output power with three AC outlets, two USB-C ports (one 30-watt and one 100-watt), a 12-volt car port, and one standard 18-watt USB-A outlet. It's also being offered at a new, all-time low price.

At 56 percent off, this is one of the deepest Black Friday discounts we found on a Jackery bundle, which combines a 2,000-watt power station with two 200-watt solar panels that can fully recharge it in around 6 hours in ideal conditions.

With 3,000 watts of output and a 30-amp connection, this power station is ideal for powering a parked recreational vehicle or providing backup power for a few 12-volt circuits in the home. Plus, you can recharge it using the bundled portable solar panels.

This Explorer 2000 Plus bundle includes everything you need to set up a proper home backup system that connects to your home electrical system, including a manual transfer switch, an extra battery that doubles the power station's capacity, and a set of two 200-watt solar panels for recharging the system.

This large portable power station can be connected to a second one in parallel to double the capacity of your backup system from 3,600 watts to 7,200 watts. Plus, you can easily roll it to different parts of the house to deliver electricity to any room that needs it.

Over $600 off for Black Friday, this bundle combines a 3,600-watt portable power station with an extra battery that doubles its power output to 7,200 watts, plus a set of solar panels to recharge it using the sun's rays. 

This 7,200-watt power station offers true whole-home backup with 120-volt and 240-volt output for high-powered devices like electric dryers and water pumps. This bundle includes a 500-watt foldable solar panel for eco-friendly recharging. 

This bundle brings true automatic home backup with the inclusion of a smart transfer switch that can detect power outages and automatically switch critical circuits to emergency power safely. And it's on sale for 38 percent off for Black Friday.

Samsung, TCL, and Hisense are three of the most popular TV brands, and all of them have solid holiday deals. Our TV expert shares how he'd pick which brand to go with on Black Friday.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Black Friday is always a good time to buy a new TV. By this point in the year, every brand has released all of its latest models, and you'll find many of them ready and waiting with prices slashed. You can save some money, and you're less likely to compromise on size or display technology when it's time to replace your old set. 

I've tested TVs for years (and written plenty of stories about deals), so I know that TCL, Hisense, and Samsung are three brands many folks will be looking at this Black Friday and Cyber Monday. All three are known for  making a wide range of models, including budget-conscious mini-LED and QLED TVs, and high-end  OLED TVs that offer incredible fidelity, but at a higher average price.

Count up all of the sales across all three brands, and you're going to find dozens of deals. Frankly, there are too many to dig through on the busiest shopping weekend of the year. To help you cut that time down, I've come up with a few pointers to help you figure out when to look at each brand, and highlighted some of the best deals in a few specific contexts. Let me show what I've learned after testing TVs across many price points throughout the year: I can help you make sure you're looking in the right place, for the right kind of Black Friday TV deal. 

Hisense and TCL are two of my favorite TV brands, in part, because their designs always offer tremendous value. I've consistently recommended both the Hisense U8 and the TCL QM8K throughout the year and into the holiday season. Both are great bargains, even at full price, delivering amazing picture quality, powerful sound, and abundant connectivity features.

And ahead of Black Friday, they're both already on sale: You can snag a 55-inch Hisense U8 for less than $700. That's 30 percent below retail. If you're looking for a bigger screen, the TCL 75-inch QM8K is $600 off, matching or handily beating the prices of rivals with smaller screens. 

If you're looking to bring home a high-end TV with the best possible image quality, Samsung makes some of the best OLED and hybrid QD-OLED TVs. They're worth every penny, even at full price, because of their tremendous color saturation, sharp contrast, and intense brightness. They feature anti-glare screens as well, making them perfect for rooms with lots of windows where direct sunlight can make the screen hard to see. 

Heading into Black Friday, the very large, very pricey 77-inch Samsung S90F OLED is 36 percent off at Amazon. The more manageable 65-inch version is down 30 percent, bringing its price below $1,400 — a very reasonable price for a large, high-end OLED.

The S85F OLED by Samsung is a more affordable OLED TV option with lower peak brightness and no anti-reflective screen coating. With a 29 percent discount, the price has dropped just below $1,000.

Finally, the flagship S95 OLED is quite expensive, even on sale, but the 65-inch model is almost 25 percent off. 

If you have a budget of around $500 to $600 for your next TV, both TCL and Hisense have more great options, but I would start by looking at the Hisense U7. There's a particularly sweet deal right now on the 55-inch model: It's 42 percent off, bringing the price down from over $900 to just over $500.

If you're a Frame-style TV fan, there's also a really great deal on HiSense's home decor-friendly CanvasTV from Amazon. At 35 percent below retail, this is the most affordable way to bring home that style of set.

Finally, if you are looking to spend less than $400, the 55-inch TCL QM6K  is 34 percent off for the holidays, which definitely deserves your attention. Its picture quality is a step below the Hisense U7, but it is even more cost-effective. Frankly, any 65-inch TV you can get for less than $500 is worth a look. And this one's pretty nice.

Africa's forests and woody savannas have historically acted as a carbon sink, removing atmospheric carbon and storing it as biomass. However, our novel analysis reveals a critical transition from a carbon sink to a carbon source between 2010 and 2017. Using new high-resolution satellite-derived biomass maps, validated with field plots and machine learning techniques, we quantified the aboveground biomass stocks across African biomes over a decade. Between 2007 and 2010, the continent gained 439 ± 66 Tg yr⁻1 of aboveground biomass, but from 2010 to 2015 biomass declined by − 132 ± 20 Tg yr-1 and from 2015 to 2017 this decline continued with a loss of − 41 ± 6 Tg yr-1, primarily driven by deforestation in tropical moist broadleaf forests. Gains in savanna biomass partially offset these losses, likely due to shrub encroachment. Our findings underline the urgent need for implementing policies to halt global deforestation as required by the Glasgow Leaders Declaration to close the global emissions gap. The current ongoing revisions of Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement need to be even more ambitious to compensate for the ongoing loss of natural carbon sinks.

Africa's ecosystems play a pivotal role in the global carbon cycle, contributing approximately 20% of global carbon removals through terrestrial net primary production, 40% of the world's carbon emissions from biomass burning and 20% of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation1. Carbon removals occur in forests and woody savannas through photosynthesis, while carbon emissions are largely driven by fire during forest cover loss, shifting cultivation, agricultural burning and fuelwood burning (~0.4 Pg C y-1 for Africa)2. Biomass burning in savannas mainly burns perennial herbaceous plant matter, which does not add significantly to net carbon emissions but is thought to accelerate the carbon cycle by reducing carbon turnover times3.

Despite their critical importance, Africa's forests and savannas face increasing pressures from anthropogenic and natural disturbances, leading to a decline in their carbon sequestration potential. Understanding these dynamics is essential for addressing the goals of the Paris Agreement and devising effective climate mitigation strategies.

While previous studies have mapped African biomass and carbon stocks, they are limited by coarse spatial resolutions, temporal gaps, or methodological inconsistencies. Notably, the sparse availability of field-based data has hampered precise assessments of biomass changes at fine spatial scales. Recent advancements in satellite remote sensing, such as the GEDI LiDAR and ALOS PALSAR radar systems, combined with more powerful machine learning models, offer an unprecedented opportunity to bridge these knowledge gaps.

Previous studies have estimated the extent of African forests, including mosaics of forests and woodlands, as between 638.2 and 836.8 million ha4. These forests contain large carbon stocks in the form of aboveground woody biomass, in the range from 85 to 129 Pg5,6,7,8,9. African tropical forests have an average aboveground biomass density over 396 Mg ha-1, but this can be as high as 429 Mg ha-1 in some areas of the Congo Basin10. This far exceeds the carbon stock density in savannas with an average aboveground biomass density of 45 Mg ha-111, although savannas cover a much larger total area4, making forests and savannas the most relevant biomes for understanding the total carbon stocks stored in aboveground woody biomass (Fig. 1).

Warmer colours indicate higher point density, and the black solid line corresponds to the 1:1 line (i.e. perfect agreement).

The quantitative nature of carbon dynamics of African ecosystems remains subject to scientific debate due to the sparse observation network1,3. Bombelli et al.3 estimated that sub-Saharan Africa is a net carbon sink of between 0.16 - 1 Pg C yr-1, depending on the data source used. Bombelli et al.3 also concluded that biogeochemical process models give an “unrealistically large sink” between 1.3 and 3.9 Pg C yr-1 (average of 3.23 Pg C yr-1). Even the direction of the carbon fluxes in Africa is controversial. Some recent studies indicate that the African carbon sink is declining16, while other studies conclude that it is in a near-zero steady-state2, or even that it has already transitioned to a carbon source17,18. A more recent assessment of the African greenhouse gas budget in REgional Carbon Cycle Assessment and Processes 1 (RECCAP1)19 concluded that Africa's carbon sink capacity is decreasing and net ecosystem exchange switched from a small sink of -0.61 ± 0.58 PgC yr-1 to a small source in RECCAP2 at +0.16 (CI=[-0.52;1.36]) PgC yr-1. In this context, the role of forest degradation20, i.e. the partial loss of aboveground tree biomass from a forest, and total forest cover loss, as well as their interannual variability are major uncertainties in the African carbon cycle1.

The rationale of this study was to analyse new satellite-based maps of aboveground biomass stocks at unprecedented high spatial resolution and to use the biomass dynamics inferred from these maps to test whether forest biomass stocks in Africa have switched from a net sink into a net source.

Earth observation from satellites combined with field-plot-based national forest inventories provides spatially explicit estimates of key terrestrial carbon pools and their changes over time. In Africa, field plots are scarce. Because of the correlation between forest canopy height, aboveground woody biomass and aboveground carbon stock, satellite-derived forest canopy height maps are the best option for large-scale mapping. Spaceborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) transmits polarised light from a pulsed laser to measure the distance to the Earth's surface. Spaceborne LiDAR missions such as ICESAT21 and GEDI22 allow the estimation of canopy height from the vertical profile of returned laser light to the sensor. These datasets can be used to train empirical and machine learning models, in combination with other datasets such as optical multispectral imagery, digital elevation models, or maps of radar backscatter, in order to map aboveground biomass density across the tropics, including tropical Africa, e.g. for a single year5,6 and for different years to estimate biomass (and carbon) gains and losses using coarse spatial resolution images9,17,23,24,25. However, the resolution of these aboveground biomass density maps is too coarse to relate them to drivers of disturbances, such as forest cover loss and forest degradation26.

Because deforestation and forest degradation occur on relatively fine spatial scales, more reliable estimates of aboveground biomass density across Africa and its annual gains and losses can only be quantified at high spatial resolution. This is the route to improving our quantitative knowledge of the African terrestrial carbon cycle and estimating carbon emissions and removals more reliably.

Our analysis of aboveground woody biomass density derived from Earth observation over a time period of 11 years reveals the spatial distribution and temporal trends of biomass gains and losses for all forests and woody savannas in Africa. Fig. 1a shows a map of aboveground woody biomass density for the year 2017. Tropical Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands are by far the largest biome by area with an average aboveground biomass density of 32 Mg ha-1, while Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests cover a much smaller area with much higher biomass density (Fig. 1b,c). An accuracy assessment against an extensive set of field plot measurements gave a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.70, a Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) of 74.2 Mg ha-1, a Relative Root Mean Square Difference (Rel. RMSD) of 33%, and a Mean Bias Difference (MBD) of 8 Mg ha-1, but the higher aboveground biomass densities tended to be overestimated (Fig. 1d). A further comparison with airborne LiDAR-based biomass estimates for 2015 and 2016 (Fig. 1e) showed that the aboveground woody biomass map is unbiased even at higher biomass levels (R2 = 0.85, RMSD = 47.7 Mg ha-1, Rel. RMSD = 48%, MBD = 0 Mg ha-1), though these results may be overoptimistic, due to the spatial proximity to the training data. While both validation approaches suggest there may be potential underestimations beyond 350 Mg/ha (Table S4a), this is a common issue in remote sensing derived AGBD maps. Quantifying AGBD in dense forests is still challenging and AGBD remote sensing retrieval algorithms suffer from large uncertainties at high AGBD27.

From 2007 to 2010, Africa gained 439 ± 66 Tg yr-1 (0.37% yr-1) net aboveground woody biomass. However, between 2010 and 2015 the continent lost -132 ± 20 Tg yr-1 or -0.11% yr-1 biomass. Between 2015 and 2017 the average net aboveground biomass change decreased to a loss rate of -41 ± 6 Tg yr-1 or -0.03% yr-1 (Fig. 2a). These results indicate that Africa's forests have transitioned from a net sink of aboveground biomass to a net source over that time period. We now investigate where that switch has taken place.

Spaceborne L-band radar data are not available between 2011 and 2014, and so the net annual AGB stock change could not be calculated for that time period.

Note that Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests and Tropical Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands have a much larger scale on the \(y\)- axis. Error bars indicate the 95% confidence intervals. (c) The map shows cumulative Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD) net gains (green) and losses (purple) from 2007 to 2017. The map is aggregated to 300 m pixel size for visualization purposes. Only AGB maps from 2007 to 2010 and from 2015 to 2017 were used to generate this map due to the lack of L-band SAR imagery from 2011 to 2014 (See Methods section). The upper right inset shows biomass loss due to forest cover loss occurring around settlements, rivers and roads in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while the lower-left inset is a forest plantation area in South Africa showing clearcuts and newly planted forest. The histograms on the horizontal and vertical axes show AGBD net changes averaged by 1 degree of longitude and latitude, respectively.

The recent aboveground biomass losses in Africa are mostly driven by losses in the Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests biome over this period. This is partly offset by biomass gains in the savanna biome from 2015 to 2017 (Fig. 2b). These gains are plausibly explained by enhanced shrub encroachment due to the carbon fertilisation effect of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, which has been shown to alter the competition between trees and grasses in savannas in favour of trees28. The Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests biome gained +192 Tg yr-1 aboveground biomass in the period 2007 to 2010. This changed to a biomass loss of -70 Tg yr-1 between 2010–2015, and an even greater biomass loss of − 154 Tg yr-1 between 2015 and 2017. The observed biomass losses for 2007 to 2017 can be explained by a significant increase in forest cover loss rates during the last decade in Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and some West African countries29.

The map also shows in blue shaded boxes the location of the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) datasets used. The background map shows the major terrestrial biomes according to Dinerstein et al.14. (b) The inlet map shows the number of GEDI footprints within 5° grid cells across Africa; in total there were approximately 1.8 million footprints. Both maps were designed in ArcGIS.

The largest cumulative aboveground biomass gains took place in the Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests biome of the Congo basin in areas within Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the Republic of Congo (Fig. 2). The majority of the Tropical Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands biome shows cumulative aboveground biomass gains across Africa, although between 2010 and 2015, it exhibited a cumulative loss.

These results provide fresh evidence from the new aboveground biomass dataset presented here that Africa's forests have switched from a net sink of carbon to a net source after 2010.

Previous studies have led to contradictory insights into whether Africa's ecosystems are a net sink or a net source of carbon. This study provides the first continent-wide, high-resolution assessment of aboveground woody biomass changes in Africa over a decade, revealing a significant transition from a carbon sink to a source between 2010 and 2017. Our analysis, based on satellite-derived aboveground biomass maps validated with field data, highlights the escalating impact of deforestation in tropical moist broadleaf forests as a primary driver of biomass loss. We acknowledge that satellite-derived AGBD has some limitations due to the saturation at high AGBD ranges. However, there are two facts that give us confidence in our conclusions. First, we have adopted a rigorous uncertainty analysis approach and the 95% confidence intervals of the net changes in AGBD shown in Fig. 2 indicate that we can claim with high confidence that the transition from a carbon sink to a source is real. The confidence intervals do not overlap. Second, Table 1 and Figure S7 show that the AGBD values in our study are reasonably similar to independent country-level statistics reported by FAO. For example, for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which contains by far the most of the African AGB, the deviation of our estimate from the FAO estimate is only 11%. Furthermore, as most deforestation occurs in the dense moist broadleaf forests where biomass is high, the underestimations we detect beyond 350 Mg/ha suggest that our analysis may not reflect the full impacts of forest loss on carbon emissions and that the reversal from sink to source we suggest may be even more pronounced than what we report here. While gains in savanna regions, potentially due to shrub encroachment, partially mitigated these losses, they are insufficient to reverse the overall trend.

Our study focuses on aboveground woody biomass stock and its changes, as this is the only pool that is persistent over long time periods and that we can realistically quantify using remote sensing techniques. Although also persistent, soil carbon stocks cannot be estimated with any confidence from remote sensing. At continental and biome scale, we consider carbon fluxes from woody debris and litter as short-term (annual turnover time), with no substantial dampening or enhancing effects on ecosystem-level carbon fluxes.

The implications of this shift are profound. Africa's forests and woodlands have historically served as a carbon sink. Now, they are contributing to widening the global greenhouse gas emissions gap that needs to be filled to stay within the goals of the Paris Agreement. The significance of this finding to global climate policies and the current revision of the Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement is that even more greenhouse gas emission reductions are needed than was the case before this natural carbon sink shut down. Our findings underline the urgent need for strengthened conservation policies, improved forest governance, and targeted restoration initiatives, such as REDD+. The fine-scale spatial and temporal insights provided in this study can support policymakers and scientists in prioritizing interventions to halt biomass loss and enhance carbon sequestration.

New insights into the geographical regions where significant biomass changes have occurred are also presented. The biomass maps at continental and biome scales were validated with a large independent dataset of field plot data and LiDAR-based estimates of aboveground biomass density (Supplementary Material). The fine spatial resolution allowed us to account for the trends in biomass loss associated with forest disturbances as small as one hectare, which was not possible until recently9,17,31,32.

Total aboveground biomass stocks of African forests and woodlands are estimated at of 118 Pg biomass, which equates to approximately 59 Pg carbon. These overall values are consistent with previous estimates using independent datasets, e.g. 113 Pg5, 111 Pg9, 116 Pg8, and 129 Pg6 biomass stocks, but it is higher than the estimates provided by Santoro et al.31 and Avitabile et al.7 (85 Pg and 96 Pg, respectively). The latter two studies excluded some areas with woody aboveground biomass by applying a spatial forest mask to exclude several woody vegetated areas, such as savannas, that did not fit their specific forest definitions, while our estimates include all woody vegetation in the tropical forest and savanna biomes with a percentage tree cover above 1%.

The aboveground biomass estimates presented here, and other Earth observation-based studies disagree with official biomass statistics for some countries at national level as reported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) (Table 1). These differences are most likely also the consequence of using different national forest definitions33,34 leading to substantial differences in the reported total national forest area.

The pantropical and continental AGBD maps products derived by Saatchi et al.5, Baccini et al.6, Avitabile et al.7, Bouvet et al.35 present spatial resolutions from 25 m to 1 km, and reported Rel. RMSD = 33%, RMSD = 39 Mg/ha, RMSD = 87–90 Mg/ha, and RMSD = 17–19 Mg/ha for Africa, respectively. However, the later African AGBD 25m pixel map is constrained to AGBD levels below 100 Mg ha-1. Only the global map from Santoro et al.31 presents the same spatial resolution as the current study (i.e. 100m pixel size) but reports larger errors with Rel. RMSD = 57–73% for tropical and subtropical regions compared to this study's Rel. RMSD = 33–40%.

The mean annual net aboveground biomass change shows gains of +57 ± 9 Tg yr-1 for the period 2007 to 2017. However, analysing the gains and losses for different time periods, an annual net gain of +439 ± 66 Tg yr-1 is found in the earlier time period from 2007 to 2010, followed by a net loss of -106 ± 16 Tg yr-1 from 2011 to 2017. This indicates a rapid acceleration of aboveground biomass losses in Africa, which is driven by increasing biomass loss rates in the Tropical Moist Broadleaf Forests.

The evidence presented here suggests that Africa's forests and woodlands have switched from a net carbon sink into a net source because of increased biomass losses due to human activities and natural disturbances. This finding is consistent with growing forest loss rates in Africa from 2010 onwards as reported by FAO36, and the increasing forest cover loss rates based on satellite observations from 2012 to 2013 onwards by Hansen et al.29. FAO36 statistics on increasing annual harvested roundwood from 277 million m3 in 1961 up to 768 million m3 by 2017 also confirm these forest losses. The observed trends may be further exacerbated in the future by population growth in Africa37, the increasing export demand particularly from Asia38, and the resulting pressure on natural resources (agricultural expansion for commodity crop, timber and fuelwood). The long-term persistence of these trends will depend on local governance and whether resources are used sustainably.

The results provide further independent evidence of a shift in forest functioning from a carbon sink to a source around this time period, which is consistent with recent studies of all pantropical regions19,35,39,40.

A comprehensive assessment of the terrestrial greenhouse gas budget of Africa found that most studies agree that Africa is a small sink of carbon on an annual scale, with an average value of − 0.61 ± 0.58 Pg C yr−14. The net loss of aboveground woody biomass from 2011 to 2017 of − 106 ± 16 Tg yr-1 observed here (weighted mean) may well tip the overall carbon budget into a net source overall when considering all carbon pools and fluxes.

The world needs to step up efforts to protect the substantial carbon stocks in Africa's aboveground woody biomass and restore lost forest areas to counter the climate crisis, as agreed in the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests and Land Use41 at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to halt net deforestation by 2030. The world otherwise risks losing an important carbon sink needed to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. Reversing biomass losses in Africa requires actions in the political, economic and societal spheres, to promote capacity building42, improve forest governance43, implement financial incentives through the REDD+ initiative44, and facilitate technological infrastructure, such as satellite-enabled forest alert systems to halt illegal logging such as those deployed in Kenya45. Restoration initiatives such as AFR10046 and Restor47 will also be needed.

Future research should explore the underlying drivers of regional variability in biomass dynamics and assess the potential of emerging technologies for near-real-time monitoring of forest disturbances and strengthening forest governance.

Assessing forest aboveground biomass dynamics over long time periods and at continental to global scale requires reference observations such as forest inventory field plots in combination with satellite Earth observation. To overcome the low availability and quality of reference data, we used the spaceborne Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) onboard the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat)48, which operated from 2003 to 2010 and acquired millions of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) footprints, providing measurements of canopy height and other biophysical metrics relating to canopy structure that are highly correlated with aboveground biomass49. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) LiDAR instrument22 onboard the International Space Station that commenced operation in 2019 uses similar technology to the GLAS/ICESat instrument but with smaller footprints and much denser coverage (narrower spacing between footprint locations along the orbit), providing a dense network of training and validation data on forest canopy height.

Based on a machine learning algorithm, L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter image mosaics acquired by ALOS PALSAR-1/PALSAR-248 and optical multispectral Landsat-derived percent tree cover maps29 were used as joint predictors to extend the canopy height obtained from GEDI to canopy height maps across the whole of Africa. Regional maps of aboveground biomass density derived from airborne LiDAR over a range of biomes in Africa were then used to derive an empirical model that estimates aboveground biomass density as a function of canopy height. The LiDAR-based aboveground biomass footprint estimates from LiDAR were used to train the machine learning model. The model was then used to produce annual Africa-wide maps of aboveground biomass density and its standard deviation (SD) at 100 m pixel spacing for the period 2007 to 2017. The maps were validated using a large independent dataset of field plot measurements across the continent. The aboveground biomass density maps and associated standard deviations were used to estimate the African aboveground woody biomass stock and its annual changes (with confidence intervals based on the uncertainty characterization described in Supplementary Materials) with the aim of contributing to improvement of carbon inventories, understanding trends, and testing whether the aboveground biomass change rate has increased, reduced or changed sign over the period 2007-2017.

Spaceborne LiDAR from GEDI. The GEDI L2B Canopy Cover and Vertical Profile Metrics product (version 1), available from the NASA/USGS Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center50, was collected from April 2019 to June 2019 (Fig. 3a). The LiDAR metrics estimated by this product are representative of a 25 m diameter footprint on the ground. Version 1 of the product has a geolocation error of approximately 15-20 m, so can be difficult to use with moderate spatial resolution imagery such as Sentinel-1/-2 or Landsat (i.e. 10-30 m spatial resolution pixels).

Airborne laser scanning (ALS). This study uses gridded LiDAR-derived aboveground biomass density maps based on airborne LiDAR acquired in 2016 at 4 different sites in Gabon (Lope, Mabounie, Mondah, and Rabi)51,52, and in 2015-16 at 2 sites in Kenya (Taita Hills and Maktau)53,54. The canopy height to AGBD model was developed using 50% of the pixels from these datasets, while the remaining 50% were used to validate the aboveground biomass product.

Field plot data of aboveground biomass density. We collated a dataset consisting of 10,837 aboveground biomass density reference field plots across Africa (see Table S2 in supplementary material) to be used as an independent validation dataset for the 2017 map (Fig. 3). The assessment was limited to 2017 due to the lack of re-measured plot data. Field plots were measured in different years, mainly between 2000 and 2017, with the vast majority before 2010. The plot data are from different national forest inventories and research projects, so have various plot designs, sizes and shapes. Since most of the plots do not have accurate spatial coordinates due to licensing restrictions, we cannot use them directly to validate the 100 m resolution pixel maps. Instead, we followed the approach described by Santoro et al.31 and Araza et al.15 in which the plot values were first adjusted to minimize the temporal and areal mismatches between the plot and map estimates of aboveground biomass density. The adjustment was necessary because of the uneven spatial distribution of the reference samples, the variety of plot sizes used, variations in field survey methods, and used allometric equations to estimate biomass of the plots55. The plots were mostly smaller than 1 ha and often represented only a small fraction of the area covered by a 1 ha biomass map pixel. To reduce the effect of random errors caused by different resolutions of the reference dataset and the biomass map, we aggregated the map and the plot data to 0.1° grid cells15. This procedure yielded 463 grid cells with reference aboveground biomass density values for validation (Fig. 3b). The standard deviation associated with each of these values was estimated by accounting for the principal plot measurement error sources (as described in Araza et al.15).

ALOS PALSAR/ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 radar image mosaics. JAXA's annual mosaics of L-band SAR HH and HV polarised backscatter (γ0) were based on ALOS PALSAR from 2007 to 2010 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 from 2015 to 201756,57. No mosaics are available for 2011 to 2014. The PALSAR-2 mosaics for 2018 to 2020 are available, but the pre-processing and geolocation approaches are different from the previous mosaics, so they were excluded from this analysis. The mosaics are a calibrated, 16-look, re-projected, orthorectified and slope-corrected product with 25 m pixel spacing, to which a de-striping process has been applied22,31,33. The PALSAR and PALSAR-2 mosaics were normalised to reduce artefacts and to ensure temporal consistency of the radar backscatter signal, allowing the same trained model to be used for the whole time series. Artefacts in the mosaics usually result from changes in moisture conditions between image acquisitions, which affects the backscatter, or appear in the pre-processing due to inadequate calibration and/or topographic corrections. We followed a similar approach to that described in58, but instead of superpixels used a circular moving window 100 pixels in diameter (~2,000 ha). This normalises the PALSAR/PALSAR-2 imagery to a common baseline based on the mean and standard deviation of backscatter of the PALSAR mosaics (2007-2010). Implicit in this procedure is the assumption that continuous changes with scale larger than 2,000 hectares did not occur from year to year. Normalizing the images at this large scale also tends to ensure that local changes due to disturbances and vegetation growth are preserved. The analysis used both HH and HV polarisations and two additional metrics, the Cross-polarisation Ratio (CpR = HH⁄HV) and the Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI = (HH–HV)⁄(HH+HV))59.

Percent tree cover data. A 30 m Landsat-based map product of percent tree canopy cover for the year 2000 and annual tree cover loss estimates for the period from 2000 to 201729 was used to generate annual percent tree cover maps for each year. For the year 2007, all pixels detected as forest cover loss were set as 0% percent tree cover, while pixels detected as having forest cover loss in previous years (i.e. from 2000 to 2006) were set to “no data”, as we have no information on regrowth after the disturbance. The canopy height and aboveground biomass predictions for these “no data” pixels were performed using only PALSAR as a predictor variable (see Modelling Framework). We repeated this process for all the years within our study period (2007-2010 and 2015-2017). PALSAR data and Landsat percent tree cover datasets were mosaicked and co-registered to generate two stacks of predictor datasets, with 50 m and 100 m pixel spacing, respectively. Woody vegetated areas were defined as pixels with equal or above 1% tree cover.

GEDI footprint selection and clustering. We used the maximum footprint height in a footprint, provided by the GEDI L2B footprint product, as reference canopy height metric, but performed a filtering process to select only the highest quality footprints for training and validation purposes. Coverage footprints were excluded due to their lack of laser light penetration in dense forests and only footprints acquired by the full power beams were used. Only night acquisitions (solar elevation < 0°) with a beam sensitivity greater than 95% were retained. Low quality footprints, as indicated by the L2B quality assurance layers, were discarded, as were footprints with canopy height above the 99.9th percentile of the initial set. The Copernicus Global Land Cover dataset60 was used to exclude footprints in non-vegetated classes. We used the 11 forest classes and the shrubland class for this purpose60. After the filtering, approximately 1.8 million footprints were available, distributed across the African continent (Fig. 3). The GEDI footprints were grouped into 4-footprint clusters along the track direction, in each of which the top canopy height values (RH100) were averaged to correct for sampling and geolocation errors. This provided the main reference data for training and validating our canopy height model. The average by cluster increases the sampled area of our reference unit from 0.05 ha (1 footprint) to 0.2 ha (4 footprints) and has been demonstrated to increase accuracy when training models with spaceborne LiDAR footprints6. The larger sampled area helps to average out various errors typical of small sampling units (e.g. small inventory plots), such as sampling error and geolocation error. Only clusters with 4 consecutive footprints were used.

Canopy height modelling. We used a non-parametric machine learning Random Forests (RF) regression algorithm61, following the same framework as in62 and 63, to generate a canopy height model (CHM) and its associated error at pixel level using PALSAR/PALSAR-2 radar backscatter and Landsat Percent Tree Cover for the same years as predictors. We used 100 trees for each RF model run. Generation of the canopy height model uses two different resolutions (Fig. 4): (i) Remote sensing signatures were extracted from the four 50 m pixels that overlap the 0.2 ha area corresponding to each cluster of four GEDI footprints and averaged; these four pixels are equivalent to the area of 1 ha. (ii) The model training and the prediction output are at 1 ha pixel size, i.e. 100 m by 100 m.

Modelling scheme following the 2-scale approach showing the connection between GEDI footprint clusters and EO datasets in geographical space, their relationship in modelling space, and the model output in geographical space. Pixel signatures values from the Earth observation predictors (% Tree Cover, PalSAR HH and HV, CpR and RFDI) and GEDI top canopy heights are averaged for each cluster before training the random forest (RF) model.

The conversion from 50 m to 100 m was needed because geolocation errors in the GEDI footprint products (15–20 m for version 1 and around 10 m for version 2) prevent small (< 50 m) pixels being adequately matched to single GEDI footprints. Additionally, as with small forest inventory plots, a large tree within the footprint biases the canopy height and makes the value unrepresentative of the canopy height within 1 ha. This two-scale scheme follows Saatchi et al.5 and Baccini et al.6, and aims to average out these errors by combining several footprints. We assume that 4 footprints located within 1 ha (four 50m x 50m pixels) are more representative of the actual canopy height than 1 or 2 footprints located within a 100 m pixel.

The GEDI canopy height dataset was randomly partitioned into 2 datasets: 10% for training the CHM model (36,944 GEDI clusters) and the remaining 90% (328,243 clusters) for independent validation. Training was performed within a jack-knife/k-fold framework in which the training reference data (10% of the original dataset) were spatially partitioned into k subsamples with k = 10. The jack-knife / k-fold allocation was applied spatially to avoid over-optimistic accuracy metrics due to the possible spatial autocorrelation of the training data64. We used a very large dataset for independent validation (i.e., 90% of the original dataset) to avoid a large proportion of the validation dataset being autocorrelated with the training data. Hence, we divided our training dataset (36,944 GEDI clusters) over the whole of Africa into 10 regions with approximately the same number of footprint clusters. A single spatial subsample was kept aside as the validation data for testing the RF model, while the remaining k-1 spatial subsamples were used as training data. The cross-validation process was then repeated k times. Thus, 10 canopy height maps were generated. The mean value of all 10 predictions for each pixel was then used as the final canopy height estimate, and their standard deviation as the prediction error. We also propagated the GEDI footprint height measurement error, the sampling error and the error arising from the temporal difference between GEDI footprints and the satellite imagery to estimate the total error of our canopy height maps (see Supplementary Material).

We trained 2 different random forest (RF) models to predict canopy height. The first one (main model) used annual percent tree cover and SAR backscatter data, while the second one only used SAR backscatter data. Our main canopy height model uses L-band PALSAR/PALSAR-2 radar imagery together with the Landsat percent tree cover product. This model was applied for all pixels from the year 2000 to the given year that were undisturbed according to Hansen et al.29. However, for the pixels detected as disturbed (i.e., forest cover loss), a second canopy height model based only on PALSAR/PALSAR-2 was fitted and used for the years after the disturbance, as this is better suited to detecting any recovery (the Landsat Percent Tree Cover product assumes no regrowth after a forest loss event).

Conversion of canopy height to aboveground woody biomass density. We developed a single empirical linear model to estimate the square root of aboveground biomass density as a function of canopy height. The model was based on six airborne LiDAR aboveground biomass density maps covering closed-canopy moist tropical forest, mangrove, montane forest, drylands and open savannas (see supplementary material).

The square root of AGBD is derived to reduce heteroscedasticity65. Conversion to AGBD requires correction of the inherent negative bias in the square root transformation66 using the ratio estimator proposed by Snowdon et al.67:

Boveground biomass density change analysis. For a given pixel, we identified a significant biomass loss between times t1 and t2 if AGBDt1–SDt1 > AGBDt2 + SDt2, while there is a significant biomass gain if AGBDt1 + SDt1 < AGBDt2–SDt2, where the AGBD values at t1 and t2 are AGBDt1 and AGBDt2 respectively, and their corresponding SD values are SDt1 and SDt2. Changes between consecutive years were considered significant when the error bounds on the estimates of AGBD at the two times did not overlap, otherwise the measured change was considered insignificant. For pixels showing a significant annual gain or loss, we calculated the cumulative significant change over the time series. If this was negative at the end of the period (i.e. 2017), we accepted it as significant biomass loss, and assign this loss value to the year with the highest loss (when significant loss is detected in two or more consecutive pairs of images). Biomass losses usually result from forest cover loss events, but could also arise from other causes, such as natural or anthropogenic fires. A similar approach was taken to biomass gains. However, small gains and losses are hard to detect using this method, and biomass gains were very scarce in forest areas with high aboveground biomass density (i.e. mature forest). Either change is negligible in such areas due to a balance between mortality and growth, or it simply cannot be detected due to insufficient sensitivity of the Earth observation signal when biomass is high.

For pixels that were undisturbed (i.e. with positive cumulative significant biomass change or non-significant biomass change), the slope of the temporal linear regression for the given time period was used to represent the average rate of vegetation growth or progressive loss. We calculated the long-term Sen's slope68 and only accepted significant slopes (p < 0.05). Additionally, we followed Xu et al.24 in assuming that biomass gain cannot be properly measured once aboveground biomass density exceeds a certain level, as evidenced by the steep increase in the standard deviation of our estimates for high aboveground biomass density (Fig. S5). Thus, for undisturbed pixels with aboveground biomass density above 50 Mg ha-1 we used the IPCC aboveground biomass density growth factors for mature forest69.

Once all the significant changes across the time-series were identified, we generated a new aboveground biomass density dataset using the aboveground biomass density map from 2017 as reference (the year used to train the model, equation1), and then rolled only the significant changes back to 2007 to generate a consistent temporal dataset.

Biome-level AGB quantification: We used terrestrial biomes as spatial units to calculate regional AGB statistics. Biomes are not strictly defined by the physical land cover types (e.g. forests, shrublands etc.), but rather a complex combination of climate and vegetation conditions70. While biome extents may be dynamic, due to gains and losses in woody vegetation across landscapes, alongside changes in regional climatic conditions, to our knowledge, there is no data product that accounts for land cover dynamics to delineate biomes on an annual basis. We therefore used the most up-to-date static product available, the Ecoregions2017 Resolve biome map14 and assumed that biome extents have not significantly changed over the study period. Quantifying woody aboveground biomass losses / gains is itself an indicator of biomass changes in forests and shrublands.

Over the past ten years, emergency departments have seen a steady rise in patients seeking help for abdominal pain and episodes of intense or long-lasting vomiting. What these cases often share is chronic cannabis use.

Until last month, clinicians lacked a standardized way to document this condition. They now have a diagnostic code for "cannabis hyperemesis syndrome," a gastrointestinal disorder that begins within 24 hours of the most recent cannabis use and can continue for several days. People who experience it typically face these symptoms three or four times each year.

New ICD Code Helps Clinicians Identify Cannabis Hyperemesis

On Oct. 1, the World Health Organization added a formal entry for the condition to its International Classification of Diseases manual (ICD-10, currently). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also incorporated the new code, R11.16, into U.S. diagnostic systems.

This update offers several benefits. Clinicians can now document the syndrome with a single, specific billing code instead of relying on multiple, less precise ones. Having the code appear in a patient's medical record also helps providers recognize repeat episodes during future visits.

An important gain is improved data reliability. Investigators such as Beatriz Carlini can now track cases more accurately and look for patterns that were previously difficult to identify.

"It helps us count and monitor these cases," said Carlini, a research associate professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine who studies adverse health effects of cannabis use. "In studying addiction and other public health concerns, we have three sources of data: what clinicians tell us, what people in the communities tell us, and what health records tell us. A new code for cannabis hyperemesis syndrome will supply important hard evidence on cannabis-adverse events, which physicians tell us is a growing problem."

Limited Awareness Contributes to Delayed Diagnosis

Although hospitals are seeing more patients with these symptoms, many providers are still unfamiliar with the condition because it has only recently been defined.

"A person often will have multiple [emergency department] visits until it is correctly recognized, costing thousands of dollars each time," Carlini said.

Even after an accurate diagnosis, some patients struggle to accept that cannabis is the source of their severe nausea and vomiting, said Dr. Chris Buresh, an emergency medicine specialist with UW Medicine and Seattle Children's. Cannabis is widely known for easing nausea in people undergoing chemotherapy or living with chronic conditions such as HIV and migraines, which adds to the confusion.

"Some people say they've used cannabis without a problem for decades. Or they smoke pot because they think it treats their nausea," he said. "It seems like there's a threshold when people can become vulnerable to this condition, and that threshold is different for everyone. Even using in small amounts can make these people start throwing up."

Uncertain Causes and Challenging Treatment

Why the syndrome affects some cannabis users but not others remains unclear.

"We don't know if it's related to the greater general availability of cannabis or the higher THC potency of some products or something else," Buresh said.

Treating the condition is difficult. Standard anti-nausea medications often do not work reliably, he said, which sometimes forces clinicians to turn to second and third-line options such as Haldol, a medication more commonly used for psychotic episodes.

Some individuals find limited relief through capsaicin cream, an over-the-counter analgesic that creates a warming sensation. According to Buresh, some patients apply it to their abdomen during episodes. Hot showers are also widely reported as helpful.

"That's something that can clinch the diagnosis for me, when someone says they're better with a hot shower. Patients describe going through all the hot water in their house," he said.

Why Recovery Can Be Difficult

Several factors can slow recovery. Because the syndrome appears intermittently, some cannabis users may assume a recent episode was unrelated and continue using the substance without immediate problems, only to suddenly become severely ill again. For those who accept the diagnosis and try to stop cannabis use to ease their symptoms, addiction can make abstinence difficult, Carlini said.

There's a lot of shopping you can do this weekend, but these Black Friday vacuum cleaner deals are ones you shouldn't skip if you need any kind of cleaning upgrade.

Changing to a stick vacuum hugely improved my life after moving to a three-story home, but all kinds of vacuum types can turn your life around. Never have time to vacuum or mop? Grab a robot vacuum. Need one for the car or stairs, or just for spot cleaning? You'll want a handheld vacuum. Over lugging your upright vacuum around the house? Trust me, a good stick vacuum is worth investing in.

Here are all of our favorite vacuum cleaner Black Friday deals we've spotted so far. If you're shopping for more deals, don't miss our stories on the Best Black Friday Deals, Best Apple Black Friday Deals, Best Amazon Device Black Friday Deals, and our Black Friday liveblog, where you can find us blogging all weekend long about our favorite deals we see.

Eufy

Amazon

This Eufy robot vacuum is our new top pick in our guide to robot vacuums. While it's the new pick, it's not actually new. This is last season's robot vacuum, and it's at a better price while still packing plenty of features we like to see. Shopping for an older model is WIRED reviewer Adrienne So's advice to get a good robot vacuum without paying four figures. The X10 Pro Omni's mop has downward pressure to actually scrub floors, and it packs a self-emptying bin and a good camera navigation system.

3i

Amazon

If you're looking for more of a deal, our favorite basic and affordable vacuum is even cheaper than usual right now. WIRED reviewer Adrienne So was impressed by the offerings of this little robot. Especially the enormous 1-liter dustbin, since the vacuum doesn't have a docking station to empty into. It has powerful suction for the price and good navigation, and it does come with a little charging base that works better than our last basic pick.

Bissell

If you're looking for a good but affordable stick vacuum, the PowerClean FurFinder is my top pick in our guide to the Best Cordless Vacuums. I'm a stick vac fanatic after moving to a three-story townhouse (never let another upright grace my closets or stairs, please), and this one has everything I want: Nice power! A headlight! Three cleaning modes! Can stand up on its own! Can double as a handheld vac! It's a great purchase, and comes with a couple of attachments, including one designed for pet hair.

Dyson

Dyson

Looking for a stick vacuum and mop in one? Dyson's V15 is our favorite overall of the Dyson lineup, but you can get the Submarine version to add onto a mop head. Sadly, you can't add on the mop cleaner head to an existing V15 Detect; you need to buy this exact model, so if you think you'll want a mop add-on at any point, just get this one. It's powerful and handy, and one of the best vacuum sales happening.

If you're looking for something really powerful for pet hair, the Gen5 Detect is Dyson's current top-of-the-line stick vacuum (though new ones are due out next year) and our top pick for a pet hair vacuum. It does an impressive job, and it always pulls up more cat hair than I expected to be there for how often I try to vacuum. It has three cleaning modes and comes with several attachments, and while it's certainly on the expensive side, you can easily see why when you use it.

Worx

Amazon

This vacuum is adorable, and my go-to for cleaning my cars. It's easy to hold the base in one hand and then take the hose to reach everywhere, from under the seats and between my son's car seat cushions to even tackling the dusty dashboard. It has spots on it to hold its two accessories, so you don't have to keep track of those separately.

Dyson's Car+Boat is our favorite handheld vacuum. It's as if you took a Dyson stick vacuum and got rid of the stick part, and it's much more affordable compared to our favorite stick vacuums. It's designed with vehicles in mind, if you can't tell by the name, but you should be able to use this anywhere you'd want to use a handheld vacuum, from stairs to indoor couch cushions to your vehicles. It's an affordable way to get into the Dyson ecosystem, and a good add-on if you don't need an entirely new vacuum.

After what's felt like years of waiting, hoping, and speculating, earlier this year, Lego finally confirmed it would be boldly going forward with a Star Trek set that has become the centerpiece of the brick-maker's annual Thanksgiving celebrations. Can it live up to the hype?

Thankfully, the answer is a resounding yes. Lego's first foray into Star Trek, the Enterprise-D from The Next Generation, is a fascinating tribute to the legendary series while also being an extremely compelling build experience for diehard Lego fans, packed with fun techniques to maintain Star Trek‘s famously smooth-lined starship design in the world of Lego. io9 recently received a review copy of the Enterprise from Lego, so we're here to take you inside and see what makes it so good—and why we hope it means it's the first of many.

Clocking in at 3,600 pieces, the Lego Enterprise-D is a pretty sizeable model, resulting in a replica of the Galaxy-class starship and a sturdy display stand to pose it mid-flight on that measures around 23.5″ from fore to aft and 10.5″ tall (aided by the fact the ship is held at an upwards angle on its stand). While it is a major undertaking, the build is broken into three distinct sections: the secondary hull and the Enterprise‘s nacelles, the stand itself, and then half of the 30 bags in the set are dedicated to the main saucer.

Given the nature of the Enterprise-D's design, once you get going, there are a lot of similar techniques repeated over and over again, so if you're a familiar builder, you can go pretty quickly and even duplicate some steps to speed up the process. Overall, though, if you're taking things leisurely, you can be done in 9-10 hours… or around 12 episodes of Deep Space Nine, if you're like me and like to put something on while you're building (sorry TNG fans, but I'd recently just restarted a rewatch and decided to continue that rather than put on a more thematically appropriate bit of background noise!).

Even though the focus of the set is the ship replica rather than a playset environment, it would be a crime if Lego's first Trek set didn't go all in on minifigures. Thankfully, the Enterprise-D comes with nine minifigures to faithfully recreate the bridge crew you know and love: Picard, Riker, Troi, Worf, La Forge, Data, Dr. Crusher, and Wesley Crusher in his famous jumper. Joining them to round out the set is a welcome but slightly oddball choice in Guinan, hostess of the Enterprise lounge Ten Forward, but she, like Wesley, breaks up the sea of similar Starfleet uniforms with some lovely unique elements to recreate her fashionable wardrobe.

Each minifigure comes with an accessory, some more unique than others, even if they're all appropriate. Wesley gets a very unique accessory in the form of a mini replica of the portable tractor beam generator from “The Naked Now,” as does Riker with his beloved trombone. Picard naturally comes with a teacup, Guinan has a green bottle of something from Ten Forward (it's never explicitly noted what it is, but it seems like a nod to the Aldebaran whiskey Data offers Scotty in “Relics”), Data gets Spot the cat, and Geordi comes with an engineering kit. Perhaps the least interesting ones are ironically the most typically Star Trek: Worf gets a handheld phaser, which is cleverly constructed with a wedge piece and a handle, at least, while Deanna and Beverly get a PADD and medical tricorder… both of which are just printed 1×2 tiles. Which are fine and probably the best Lego could do at minifigure scale, but just kind of boring.

What is nice is that, in a rare move, the Enterprise-D comes with a little separate stand to put the minifigures on in a row, complete with a cute little Next Generation title card (albeit as a sticker, rather than a printed piece). It's a nice acquiescence to the fact that the build is more about the display model than the minifigures themselves, but it was still nice that Lego built something more structured to display them on, instead of just leaving them as-is.

Building a Lego model out of a ship like the Enterprise-D is a risky endeavor, given its peculiar shaping and weight distribution, on top of the fact that, well, it's mostly grey. But Lego puts a lot of interesting techniques in throughout the build to not only effectively capture the curvature and shaping of the Galaxy-class but also to keep your fingers busy and not have things blur into a long series of similar patterns being used to build similar-looking, similar-colored pieces.

There are definitely a few places where more seasoned Lego builders can start duplicating builds to speed up the process: the build of the secondary hull of the Enterprise is split into two halves, for example, before you build the two nacelles that are identical in structure. Once you've built the skeleton of the main saucer, you're then essentially repeating little plate sections of the hull to sandwich over it. While the repeating can be a bit, well, repetitive, there are enough interesting techniques used for experienced builders and enough simple patterning for Trek fans who might be embarking on their first-ever Lego build of this scale.

On top of that, even though the Enterprise-D is a display set rather than a playset, the design team still snuck in a few fun little features and Easter eggs. The aforementioned main saucer section, for example, is secured into place by a little floating shuttlecraft coming in to dock at its aft shuttle bay—which can be removed so you can separate the saucer from the secondary hull to replicate the Galaxy-class' unique feature. And even though you don't get to build its iconic bridge, the center of the saucer does hold a little replica of the Enterprise‘s dedication plaque! Even as someone who is on the record on the D being far from my favorite Enterprise design, I couldn't help but be charmed at just how well Lego managed to bring it faithfully to life.

Alas, this is going to be the sticking point for a lot of Star Trek fans. At $400, the Enterprise-D may not be quite so eye-watering as some of Lego's other recent set prices, but it's still a big ask, and especially difficult considering it's the first time (and potentially last) the company has tackled Star Trek. You're definitely getting something that feels worth the price in terms of size and scope, but it's not hard to wonder if Lego should've started out at a smaller scale or with different ideas beyond ship replicas to test the waters and see if Star Trek could become just as enduring a Lego series as Star Wars has, if the alternative was a very pricey one-off.

We don't know what the future for Lego Star Trek holds beyond the Enterprise-D—this could be the start of a yearly release schedule akin to Lego's approach to Lord of the Rings, a line that exclusively stays in the upper echelons of adult-focused, high-end (and high-cost) sets. It's undeniable that as a build experience and as a replica of one of the series' most famous starships, the Enterprise-D is a Star Trek and Lego fan's dream: it looks great, it's a fun, big build, and it's got a great collection of minifigures that feels complete in the way that, if this is it, at least you got everything you'd want.

But it's equally undeniable that a lot of Star Trek fans and a lot of Lego fans are going to be put off by Lego's decision to go big as it did here to justify asking such a high price, in an age where the company's products feel like they're only getting pricier and pricier. There's a lot more value in the Enterprise-D compared to some of 2025's other big-ticket sets, sure, but $400 is still $400.

If there was some kind of indication from Lego that this wouldn't be it and that there would be more, smaller-scoped sets, it might be an easier pill to swallow, knowing Trek fans can wait and see what else the company does if they don't want to throw down this much cash in one go. Even as great a set as it is, it's a tough sell to anyone but some of the most diehard Star Trek fans without some Ferengi-level justification to your wallet.

Less than five minutes after meeting with Todd Humphrey at a Seattle coffee shop, the longtime tech exec is already sizing up the customer. He quickly assesses how coffee drinkers interact with each other and their technology devices, and wonders why they've come to this particular location.

Humphrey has spent decades focused on using technology to enhance the customer experience  — from his early days at Kobo working on e-reader services, co-founding healthcare startup League, a CEO stint at project management company LiquidPlanner, and more recently as an exec with the Seattle Kraken, where he was senior vice president of innovation and fan experience.

Humphrey left the NHL franchise earlier this year to embark on a new adventure: Highmark Sports Group, his own consultancy aimed at helping sports teams, leagues, and companies boost their operations. 

The Canadian native and former professional hockey player isn't straying far from Seattle's hockey scene. He's a senior advisor for the Seattle Torrent, the new women's pro hockey team that plays its first-ever home game tonight at Climate Pledge Arena. He's also working with the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto.

We recently caught up with Humphrey to learn more about his approach to helping organizations improve their customer experiences and how to balance new technologies like artificial intelligence with essential human touches. The interview was edited for clarity and brevity.

GeekWire: Todd, thanks for speaking with us. How are you thinking about technology and the customer experience in 2025?

Todd Humphrey: “I'm old enough to remember what the experience used to be like. You'd read about a game that was happening that night in the newspaper. You'd show up, you'd walk in, it would smell like stale beer and popcorn, and there'd be peanuts on the floor. They would play the national anthem and the game would start. 

The in-venue fan experience has totally been revamped. Technology plays a huge part of that. I think about the door-to-door experience, and all the different touch points. From the moment someone wakes up, they're going to check the app to see who's playing. You can tell them the best way to get to the game and where to park. 

Once they walk through the doors, you're thinking about lines. The average NHL fan spends more than one hour standing in lines during the three-hour experience. We tried to cut that by more than half, and I think we got there. 

You want to get people to, from, and through the venue in a really efficient manner. Technology helps with some of that — digital ticketing, way-finding, mobile ordering, mobile payments. 

We really used that Amazon approach of the customer experience and working backward — at the end of the day, what are all the friction points, and how do we alleviate those?

There's a huge opportunity for other teams and organizations to really rethink their experience. And it's not just sports teams. It's when you go to a concert, when you go to the Hockey Hall of Fame — what does that feel like? How do we turn it into a more of a holistic, overall experience beyond the time you spend in the building?”

GeekWire: How do you thread the needle of incorporating technology and automation — but also focusing on the human elements of an experience?

Humphrey: “Technology is a vessel that you have to use because it's expected and it's really convenient. Everybody's got a computer in their pocket, sitting in their hand, and if you can use it in the right way, it's a great leverage point.

At the same time, I don't want to see teams and leagues and companies get too hung up on the tech, because I think little things like the human interactions matter.

When you walk into an arena for a concert or a game, you're going have a touch point with ticketing and security before you get inside. If those interactions are awesome, your event is off to a really good start. 

I think that training the people who work there to greet people and engage with people and look them in the eye and get to know who they are — it's a huge advantage.

When I go to QFC, I don't want to check myself out. Sometimes it doesn't work as well. And I'd miss that interaction with the cashiers. They've seen my kids grow up over the years. They know who I am and what I do. There's a lot to be said for that. 

As much as technology is awesome and ChatGPT tells us all the answers, people still like human interaction. When people go to events, they really want to be seen, they want to be heard. And when I see an usher at Climate Pledge Arena high-fiving a Kraken fan during a celebration, it just warms my heart, because that's what it's all about.

AI is going to provide more efficiency for us and make things easier to do. But on the other side of that, because there's so much bent toward technology, I think live events, concerts, games, theater — all the places where people can gather are going to be more important. People just have an innate desire to be together and cheer together.”

GeekWire: What advice do you have for startup leaders who may not be leading a sports franchise, but still interact with customers and want to improve their experiences? 

Humphrey: More companies need to take their customer experience and work backwards. You also need to have conviction in what you're building and why you're building it. And it's talking to more customers. Some companies build in silos. The more you can talk to people to hear directionally where you might want to go, the better. 

But at the end of the day, you as a company, as a leadership group, have to pick your lane. I would get conviction around that. 

It's also understanding what the whole journey is going to be for that fan or customer, whether it's a SaaS customer or a cloud customer or an AI-driven customer. What is that customer going to feel all the way through the experience? And can you build a business that delivers an incredible, top-tier experience — and also drives revenue? It's a hard thing to do.”

Meesho, an Indian e-commerce rival to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, is set to launch a roughly $606 million IPO marked by token sell-downs from early backers and no sales from big names such as SoftBank and Prosus, signalling investor conviction in India's booming online retail market at a time when tech shareholders globally have been cashing out at listings.

The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021.

Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing.

Some of Meesho's early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares.

Meesho's offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.

Founded in 2015, Meesho began as a social commerce platform that targeted first-time online shoppers through WhatsApp before evolving into a full-fledged marketplace. It has since carved out a fast-growing niche with a low-cost model tailored to India's price-sensitive consumers and small merchants — an approach that has increasingly pressured larger rivals Amazon and Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based company uses a commission-light model, earning primarily from logistics fees, advertising, and other services, while charging commissions on products sold through its separate Meesho Mall channel.

Meesho reported revenue from operations of ₹55.78 billion (about $624.0 million) for the six months ended September 30, up from ₹43.11 billion (around $482.0 million) a year earlier, per its prospectus. Net merchandise value rose 44% year-over-year to ₹191.94 billion (roughly $2.15 billion). However, its losses widened, with Meesho posting a restated loss before tax of ₹4.33 billion (around $48.4 million) for the September 2025 half-year, compared with ₹0.24 billion (about $2.7 million) a year earlier.

In the last 12 months, Meesho recorded 234.20 million transacting users — unique consumers who purchased at least one product on the platform. Over the same period, the company had 706,471 annual transacting sellers, defined as sellers who received at least one order in the year.

Meesho also uses a sprawling creator network for product discovery, with more than 50,000 active content creators generating at least one placed order through their content over the past year.

“Many Indians are only experiencing e-commerce for the first time on Meesho, and much like the rest of us, over the next decade, they will buy more and more things and more and more frequently on this platform,” Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director at Peak XV Partners, told TechCrunch. “That's why long-term conviction is the reason to hold on to as much of our stake as we can hold on to.”

Peak XV — which first invested in Meesho in 2018 during its Sequoia Capital India era and holds about 13% across its two vehicles — is selling around 17.38 million shares in the IPO.

Meesho has positioned itself as a value-focused platform — unlike Amazon and Flipkart, which it sees as convenience-led players. In that respect, the company compares itself with other value-driven marketplaces such as Pinduoduo in China, Shopee in Southeast Asia, and Mercado Libre in Latin America.

“If you look at the value-focused bucket, here, you are trying to appeal to mass market consumers selling all kinds of products and categories in a marketplace business model, which tends to be asset light,” Aatrey told reporters during Meesho's press conference on Friday. “And the reason people come back is because they want access to more and more selection with the affordability value proposition.”

Meesho also sees the IPO improving its ability to attract talent and strengthening confidence across its wider ecosystem, CFO Dhiresh Bansal told TechCrunch. He said a public listing boosts the company's brand with job candidates — including those coming from big tech firms — and has a positive knock-on effect on consumers, sellers and logistics partners by reinforcing Meesho's governance standards.

The IPO will open for public subscription on December 3, with the anchor book scheduled for December 2. About 75% of the offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 10% for retail investors and 15% for non-institutional investors.

SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment.

Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is seeing healthy discounts this Black Friday, probably because its successors are right around the corner—the Galaxy S26 series is expected to be announced in January. But if you don't really need the latest and greatest, you have three excellent smartphones to choose from. The S25 is the smallest, the S25+ gets a few extra perks plus a bigger screen and better battery life, but it's the Galaxy S25 Ultra that really steps things up, with a dual telephoto camera system, integrated S Pen stylus, and a beefy battery.

One of my favorite parts of Google's new Pixel 10 series (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is that they're the first flagship Android phones with Qi2 magnetic wireless charging. That means, just like MagSafe iPhones, you can attach magnetic accessories and enjoy faster wireless charging. It's great! The phones also have excellent cameras, good performance, and tons of helpful and smart software features. Better yet, these are the first Android phones to support AirDrop with iPhones, Macs, and iPads.

This is the smartphone most people looking for a new handset should buy. If you're not married to a particular camp or brand, the Google Pixel 9a (9/10, WIRED Recommends) strikes the best balance between features and price, and this sale makes that even better. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better camera system at this price, and if you hate ginormous camera bumps, you'll love the flat-back design here. Performance is flagship-grade—it has the same Tensor chip that powers the Pixel 9 Pro—and you can access many of the great Pixel software perks, like Call Screen to cut spam calls from your life.

Folding phones are not as fragile as they used to be. No, seriously. Companies have been improving durability year over year, while also slimming them down. The Galaxy Z Fold7 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite booklike folding phone this year—it's so amazingly slim that what used to be a chunky device now feels kind of like a candy bar phone. Use the front screen like normal, and when you need extra real estate, open the device up. You can view apps on a much larger scale or easily split-screen two apps. Don't want a big folding phone? The Galaxy Z Flip7 is a pretty solid update this year, with a more usable front screen. These devices are still annoyingly expensive, but this Black Friday sale makes the prices a little more palatable.

If you're really interested in the idea of a folding flip phone, then might I suggest Motorola's Razr Ultra (8/10, WIRED Recommends)? Take your current phone today and fold it in half—OK, don't actually do that, but that's kind of what it's like to use this style of smartphone. Right now, the Razr Ultra is the best in this category, with a fresh design, good performance, surprisingly great cameras, and a functional external display. If you hate big phones, you'll love being able to stuff the Ultra in any pocket or purse. There's also the cheaper Razr 2025, which doesn't have as good performance or a camera system, but is still an incredible value, especially on sale.

Do you want a headphone jack? Do you want a microSD card slot? Are you a very cool and smart person? Yes. Then this is the smartphone for you. This is an incredible deal on a phone that delivers surprisingly smooth performance, not to mention a bright and sharp screen, and an integrated stylus. It looks smart with a textured back, and while it may not get many software updates, it's just hard to beat at this price. And you get 256 GB of storage to boot.

It's not flashy, but the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is a perfectly serviceable Android phone that should only be purchased at this $175 discount. Seriously, it's not worth the MSRP because you can usually find a Galaxy S25 on sale for close to that price. But under $500? You're getting a solid triple-camera system with a 3X optical zoom sensor, smooth performance, and day-long battery life, plus all the usual flagship extras like Qi2 Ready wireless charging and IP68 water resistance. It'll still get seven years of software updates, too.

Prefer Pixel phones but want a folding phone? This Pixel 10 Pro Fold (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is pretty much your only option. The cameras aren't as good as the Pixel 10 Pro series, but they're still respectable. The phone isn't as slim as the Galaxy Z Fold7, but it's one of the only folding phones with an IP68 dust- and water-resistance rating. Considering it launched last month, this is a heck of a discount. I have to say, having Qi2 magnets in a folding phone is very nice.

Nothing's Phone (3) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) looks nothing (heh) like any other smartphone in this list. That's the company's calling card, but it extends to the phone's Android interface, which is beautiful and unique. The fun Glyph Matrix display on the back offers up notifications and can even be used to play rock, paper, scissors. It's a quirky device, but performance is slick, the cameras are solid, there's 256 GB of storage, and good battery life. It's not the best value from a price perspective, but that might not matter if you're head over heels about how it looks.

Despite launching in January of this year, the OnePlus 13 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is no longer the latest flagship phone from the company. That'd be the OnePlus 15. But the latest and greatest isn't on sale, and the OnePlus 13 is still a very good smartphone with good battery life, extremely fast charging, and a decent camera system tuned by Hasselblad (this partnership is effectively over in the OnePlus 15).

Apple doesn't have sales, and you won't find discounted iPhones at third-party retailers. The only way to spend a little less is to look at the Black Friday carrier offers. We typically don't recommend carrier devices because it means you're getting a locked phone, but most people upgrade through their carrier. If you're going to do it, here's what the big three are offering right now.

If someone punches you in the street or steals your wallet will you file a lawsuit or call the police? Maybe in America is different, but the normal thing to do is to go to the police. Fraud is not different, the police will investigate.

reply

In the USA, probably both. You (or your insurance company) might sue them to recover your financial losses, the police would investigate the crime of assault and/or robbery and pass any evidence along to the prosecutor.Of course if they have no money or other assets, suing them is a bit pointless.

Either you and a company has a disagreement and you sue one or the other and it goes to court.But in this case, ”Utgivarna” which are basically a company/org that represents a lot of media outlets, basically went to the police instead and said ”hey, we think that meta is breaking the Swedish law”.What the police does is that they then investigate and then finds out who is responsible for the company (Mr. Zuck) and then eventually will indict him. Since its Meta that is breaking the law and The Zuck is the one in charge of Meta.

I've never cared more about my sleep in my life than during the month-plus that I've worn the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic. Previously, if I woke up drowsy, I'd blame the past night's bad choices and think, “Well, better luck tomorrow night!” Now, the first thing I do when I wake up is check my sleep score.

I've always been a person obsessed with tracking my body metrics, having become addicted to both my heart rate and my step count when fitness trackers first came out. But when sleep was added to the devices, I largely ignored it. All that data was starting to add up and feel like too much information to me. How could I possibly walk 10,000 steps in a day, get a perfect sleep score, and keep my heart rate down, my heart rate variability up, and my cardiovascular age lower than my actual age? I am literally just one person.

Oura Ring 4 Ceramic

If you want to track every biometric you can using available sensors, the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic does it best. But it still requires you to put in the work.

Pros

Cons

Most fitness trackers these days try to do it all and, honestly, most of them fall short on that task. But surprisingly, when I tested the Ring 4 Ceramic, I stopped feeling bothered by all the data points. Yes, the Ring 4 Ceramic does cram every body metric possible into its tiny device and accompanying app. And yet, somehow, it does so in a way that I am at least a little bit less bothered about than I had been in the past.

I've also decided that of all the options currently out there to track my health—smartwatches, straps, etc.—a smart ring is by far superior.

The Oura Ring, which originally debuted exactly a decade ago after a successful Kickstarter campaign, is currently in its fourth iteration, which came out over the summer. In October, the company also debuted its ceramic version of the Oura 4, which is made up of high-performance zirconia ceramic, which is a material known for its durability and light weight. The new Oura Ring 4 Ceramic comes in four colors: Tide, Petal, Cloud, and Midnight.

A benefit of the Ring 4 Ceramic, according to Oura, is that the colors are part of the ceramic, and not an added extra layer like they had been with past metals. With older models, users had issues with the colors (a mix of silvers and golds) fading or chipping over time; ceramic has no such issues. And while I'm only going on my second month, my Tide-colored Oura is still just as vibrant as day one.

See Oura Ring 4 Ceramic at Amazon

The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is currently priced at $500, which is on the pricier end for a health tracker. The regular Ring 4 is $350. Competing devices like the screenless Whoop 5.0 is an annual subscription that includes the band and starts at $200, the Samsung Galaxy Ring is $400, and the most decked-out Fitbit Sense 2 is $250.

You also need a subscription for the Oura Ring, which is $6 a month (you can also pay $70 upfront for the whole year). If you don't want to pay that monthly fee, the smart ring still works and you will still get certain data, including sleep analysis, a readiness score, and an activity tracker. But if you want access to everything else, you'll need to pay that monthly fee.

I'm not generally a big ring person, but I honestly found the Ring 4 Ceramic to be pleasantly snug and cozy on my finger. I often alternated between wearing it on my middle or index finger. For the best and most accurate results, Oura recommends the index finger mostly because it provides a snug fit, and generally, the company suggests avoiding fingers where the knuckle is wider than the base. In my experience, I found that if I wore it on my middle finger, I could more easily forget it was there, whereas if I wore it on my index finger, I tended to fidget with it.

Comfort is a huge component of health and fitness trackers, and it's one that doesn't get talked about enough when reviewing these products. If the goal is to wear them 24/7, then they have to be comfortable, and it's worth trying on a bunch of different types—smartwatches, straps, smart rings—to figure out which one works for you and your lifestyle.

A single charge lasts for up to 8 days, according to the company. In testing, mine has lasted a full 7 days multiple times. It's available in a wide variety of sizes—4 to 15—which is even more than the smart ring's previous iteration.

The Ring 4 Ceramic comes with what the company calls “smart sensing,” which is essentially an algorithm where the smart ring optimizes its multiple sensors to use the one with the best signal at any given time.

The better question, honestly, is what can't the smart ring track? The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic uses infrared LEDs to measure blood oxygen during sleep. It also uses photoplethysmogram (PPG) sensors, which detect changes in blood flow, to measure heart rate and heart rate variability as well as respiration rate (which is important for sleep tracking). Temperature sensors measure average body temperature and accelerometer sensors track movement and activity.

All of those sensors mean that the Ring 4 Ceramic has the ability to track a huge swath of data, but the key is how it spits all that out into a usable form.

The Ring 4 Ceramic provides a daily sleep score. It also breaks sleep down into smaller details like total sleep versus time in bed and gives you a sleep efficiency percentage, which is how much of your time in bed you actually spent sleeping. It knows when you are doomscrolling or tossing and turning with the Sunday scaries. The Ring 4 Ceramic takes all of this, along with your nighttime resting heart rate, and calculates a sleep score. Anything 85 and above is optimal, and I'm proud to announce to the entire internet that my highest score was 88. This is where health optimization can get somewhat addictive, and I'm absolutely prone to it.

The tracker also provides a daily “Readiness” score, which it calculates using an algorithm that takes into account your resting heart rate, heart rate variability, any significant body temperature fluctuations, as well as your respiratory rate and sleep. Again, anything 85 or higher is optimal, and I've been getting a lot of scores in the 90s, which makes me proud of my mind, body, and spirit, honestly.

It also provides a daily activity goal, which you can set yourself, and it's nice to hit that goal each day. Though a daily activity goal is pretty standard across all trackers, Oura's is really well presented.

Similar to its competitor Whoop, the Ring 4 also provides a daily stress analysis. It tells you how long your body was in high stress (which it detects based on shifts in your heart rate, heart rate variability, and your body temperature). It also shares a daily stress score by telling you if you were “stressed,” “engaged,” or “relaxed” that day.

Luckily for you all, I tested the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic during the month of October and November, which is peak fall cold season. The smart ring has an algorithm built into it called the Symptom Radar, which essentially uses changes in skin temperature, respiratory rate, resting heart rate, and heart rate variability to detect if something is off in your system. Theoretically, the idea is that it could detect these changes early and predict that you are getting sick. You could then take it easy those days or maybe even sleep an extra hour or two that night.

I got a cold in mid-October, which honestly came on pretty suddenly. I babysat a friend's kid on a Monday. She sneezed into my face multiple times (so cute) and then on Thursday morning, I woke up with that dreaded scratchy lump in my throat, which continued to get worse and then better over the course of that next week and a half. The Ring 4 Ceramic didn't detect any shifts from my baseline on Tuesday or Wednesday, or even Thursday, when I woke up feeling off. But once my cold was full-blown, the app did note that both my body temperature and resting heart rate were elevated, and wanted to know what was up.

That cold was fairly mild, and came on quickly, so I do wonder if I had had something worse, like the flu or covid, if it would have detected it a bit earlier. I also wonder if I keep wearing the Ring 4 Ceramic for longer, would it get better at knowing what's normal and what's not for me?

I still think that the best period tracker is a pen and paper (or a dedicated note in your notes app). Oura's new cycle insights and fertility feature, which was unveiled at the end of October by the company (I had been using it since the start of my testing in early October) requires 60 nights of data in order to make accurate predictions. In order to really assess whether it's working well or not, I'd want to give the Ring 4 Ceramic another couple of months after that, too. So, it's too soon to tell how well it works.

To predict your period, the tracker collects body temperature readings over a long period of time (two months or more) and uses that in addition to an algorithm to predict when your next cycle might arrive and when you might be ovulating.

The Oura 4 Ceramic really can do it all, from tracking your sleep and your stress score to monitoring your period, your activity level, and your heart rate. There are also a slew of integrations that you can use with the Ring 4, including Headspace, Strava, Natural Cycles, and even Stelo, which is a continuous glucose monitor. Connecting it to the smart ring allows users to see their glucose levels in the Oura app, which shows how factors like meal choices, sleep, and activity impact their glucose levels. Oura's newest partnership, as of late October, is with Quest Diagnostics, the blood testing company. For an additional yearly membership fee of $100, users can get a comprehensive blood panel, though it's not available in every state.

However, like I've written about in the past when reviewing similar products such as the Whoop and Polar Loop, how much of this data is that useful?

After a month of use, I did become obsessed with my sleep score, but I am not sure if I actually became a better sleeper because of it. This is similarly true for tracking my activity and my strain score. I've been a health tracking user for years now, and I've found that the key question you have to ask yourself when deciding whether you want to spend a couple of hundred dollars or more on these devices is: what are you trying to get from these devices? Is it better sleep, less stress, increased energy and activity? These devices can do it all, to a degree, and perhaps Oura can do it the best, but it still comes down to how much work you are personally willing to put into making your health better.

Also, making spacecraft shielding and even furniture out of this stuff?  It's the stupidest thing I ever heard.  The mass of the fungus doesn't come from ionizing radiation anymore than the mass of a plant comes from sunlight.  You might as well claim that you're going to grow trees in space using the abundant sunlight.  They power themselves with light but still need to be made out of something!  Are they also hoping these fungus like to eat lunar regolith?  It makes zero sense, but here we've got the BBC and apparently NASA taking the idea seriously.  Where is the fucking biomass meant to come from??  I must be crazy, or they all are.

reply

reply

If I understand the linked NASA press releases correctly, they are talking about using a mix of regolith, cyanobacteria and fungi as part of the outer shell of a habitat. The mycelian network of the fungi binds the loose regolith together, forming a strong and somewhat flexible material, with the fungus working a bit like the cement in a concrete mix. And because fungi don't form from nothing you add cyanobacteria that create "fungus food" (presumably some sugar) from water and CO2 (I'm sure you need to add a bit more than that, but that might be beyond the scope of a press release)This really has nothing to do with radiation-absorbing fungi at all, except for one remark how the melanin in radiation-eating fungi could provide further shielding.

Please excuse the novice question but I am confused, where does the energy come from then?

In principle if fungi could somehow concentrate enough fissionable material (say uranium), you could get something like the Oklo reactor going, but it would have to be a truly gigantic, probably unphysical amount of fungi to have access to that much environmental uranium in the first place and it would then have to be concentrated very strongly to get any measurable effect. You won't see anything at all if you just move a few atoms a few mm, so it would need to have very long range hyphae. You also need it to be basically one huge organism in order to collect the uranium to one place - billions of small fungi just doing a few square inches each won't work. It's unlikely the fungus could survive to become so huge on only the promise of fractionally higher future radiation, so it would need to eat something else too.And then it would decay into daughter isotopes that don't further benefit from the concentration so it might not help a lot anyway if you're looking for cleanup. Plus you've covered your cleanup site in, presumably, millions of tonnes of fungus which might or might not be an improvement.

Not really. You're talking about a fungus creating essentially a nuclear reactor inside of its cells, and creating it out of fuel that's not good enough to make a nuclear reactor in the first place (it at one time was, but now it's a mess of decay products and nonsense).Reactors also take a certain amount of mass. You can't just squish two tiny microgram particles together and hope to get anything going.

The good news is radiation detectors are insanely sensitive so you can map where the hotspots are and mitigate much of the risk using exclusion zones and / or various cleanup techniques to collect the radioactive material so it can be safety stored.

It has not actually been proven that this fungus gets energy from the radiation itself. They simply observe it growing faster in the presence of radiation which could be caused by any number of other things.

Even if it did somehow accelerate the decay, it wouldn't be that useful, since (Chernobyl aside), all the waste from the typical civilian nuclear reactor can fit in a side lot on the site of the reactor complex itself (and often does!). There just isn't that much radioactive waste to clean up!

Not to disagree with you, just to say that even though it's a minor nuisance it nevertheless occupies a lot of mental space because of how annoying it is.

A radiotropic fungus that's in TFA can't meaningfully affect the rate at which nuclear decay is happening. What it can do, supposedly, is to harvest the energy that the nuclear decay is releasing; normally there's too much energy for an organism to safely handle.At the risk of vastly oversimplifying, you can't plug your phone into high voltage transmission lines. These fungi are using melanin to moderate the extra energy, stepping it down into a range that's useful (or at least minimally harmful).

- If we assume they are working in the reactor we get radiation levels of something like 1 mGy/hour. But we can prop this up to mabye 500 mGy/hour since i dont know how they grew their culture- That leads to 0.05 J of extra energy per gram of microbial bio material.- Energy needed to grow 1g of microbial biomaterial ≈ 3.15 kJ
10% of that is 315 J per gramThe result is that:The amount of radiation energy available is 4 orders of magnitude too small
to power even a 10% growth boost.Edit: updated with more accurate estimations.

[Assuming they use the radiation to get energy [1].] They just wait patiently until the radioactive atoms decay and emit radiation, like a gamma ray, and then absorb the gamma ray and use the energy.

If the chatbot did not refer to a source, you cannot be sure it didn't make something up.The property measured in the source you linked, "enthalpy of formation", is not the same as the energy required to grow 1g of biomatter.

reply

They are almost completely unrelated concepts. The enthalpy of formation from the paper is the free useable energy that would be generated if you assembled all the molecules in the biomatter from the constituent atoms. E.g. the energy that would be released if you took pure hydrogen and pure oxygen and combined it into 1 gram of water. But the fungi takes in water from the environment to grow, it does not make it's own water from pure hydrogen, and it certainly does not generate any free energy from growing larger. With some margin for error in my understanding, since I'm not a chemist (but neither are you, and neither is the chatbot).> It was really just food for thought.It was more poison than food, since you just parroted randomly generated misinformation from the chatbot and passed it of as authentic insight.

No, the elephants foot isn't a point source at its surface.To use an extreme example going from 1m away from the sun to 100m away from the sun doesn't result in a 10,000x drop off in energy density.  Instead the exponential drop-off occurs relative to the center of the sun because energy is coming from any point on the surface visible to that location.  A similar principle applies with the elephants foot, though the geometry is more complicated.

And if you've gone hunting for that sort of thing in the last few years, you've almost certainly encountered Govee, increasingly one of the most visible names in smart lighting.

Govee makes smart lights for almost any situation you could imagine, from A19 RGB bulbs to light-up LED sticks meant to stand up in corners to netted string lights that let you paint your hedges with pixel art. You can make your home a total Lisa Frank fever dream using this company's products.

One new entry in its vast catalog is the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism. Yeah, that's Lights Prism, not Prism Lights. It's a modular set of soffit lights with tri-color lamps that you can use to accent your home's roofline and illuminate walkways around it, or to spray your walls with obnoxiously vibrant gradients of color, Homeowners Association busybodies be damned.

Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism

Govee's Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism is a fun, colorful way to light the outside of your house, but it's hard to justify the cost.

Pros

Cons

It seems like there are a million smart soffit lights available from countless alphabet soup brands on Amazon, ranging from the very cheap to the fairly expensive. The reason you may have heard of Govee and not, say, Letianpai or Poofzy is that Govee is a real company with an app that's actually nice to use. Also, thanks to the Matter protocol, most of its newer lights are compatible with every major smart home platform, which doesn't hurt.

After a week of testing the Lights Prism on my garage, I've found them to be responsive, reliable, and even fun to use. Getting them set up is easy enough. The lights are modular and come in manageable 6-lamp segments. Each of these lamps comes with a sticky 3M backing that bonded quickly with my garage's wooden soffit and makes it easy to secure them with screws or, if needed, anchors that Govee includes. (For the purposes of this review, I only used the adhesive.) You'll connect the lights to the generously long cable of the controller that contains all the lights' connectivity and smarts, and that in turn to the power adapter.

One issue I had is that the controller's cable, which is around 12 feet long by my hasty measurement, was still too short to reach the point where I wanted to start the lights. That's a problem because without an extension cable, I couldn't make them wrap around my garage without doubling the lights back on themselves. It would've helped if Govee had added a splitter, as I could have sent one segment in one direction, and the rest of them in the other.

The Lights Prism's lamps are its big differentiating feature. Unlike all of those generic soffit lights I mentioned, Govee's RGB lamps can blast three colors at once, each at different brightness levels, making for much more nuanced—or potentially garish!—lighting. The lights themselves are bright, at least when using the single segment I set up for testing.

These triple LEDs aren't quite as gimmicky as it might sound. For one thing, they let you direct the light. Combined, they all make the full light cone that you see when all are illuminated, but each of their beams points in a different direction and, with only one or two of the LEDs lit, can be used as a spotlight of sorts. I could see turning off most of the lights at night but keeping specific beams shining on doorways and windows. I'd even be tempted to try to use it indoors to highlight some of the large pieces of artwork I have in my basement, although that would be tricky to pull off well.

Ignoring the triple LED thing, Govee's Lights Prism makes for good ground illumination, at least from eight feet up on my garage's soffits. Whether the same would be true if I'd mounted them beneath my second-story roofline, I cannot say.

The big thing that I imagine will keep most people away from these lights is the price: starting at $540 for a 100-foot kit, they are expensive. Sure, it would cost potentially thousands of dollars for a fully integrated soffit lighting setup if you factor in professional installation, but you can get similar lights to these for less. Even Govee's own Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro, which use single LED lamps, are $100 cheaper for the same length of lighting.

The trouble is that Govee's lights feel cheaply made and that leaves me with questions about their longevity. If I wanted something that feels cheap, there are a lot of options that actually are. And if I wanted to spend more money, I don't think I'd be tempted enough by the triple LEDs of Govee's lights not to just get the cheaper Festavia Permanent Outdoor String Lights from Philips Hue, a company generally known for its high-quality and long-lasting products. After all, even the Hue bulbs I bought nearly a decade ago work as well now as the day I bought them.

Govee's known for its fancy lighting effects, and the Lights Prism is no slouch here. The Govee app is fat with options for different looping effects—you can go with premade ones, roll your own looping effects and light gradient combinations, choose from effects made by other Govee users, and more.

Unsurprisingly, you can also ask AI to make mediocre effects. For instance, when I asked the lights to mimic forest lighting, the app created an effect that made light slowly creep across the string, to mimic daylight cracking through the leaves in an overhead canopy. It was okay, but lacked the sort of simulated random swaying of trees I might have tried to build in.

I found other effects a lot more compelling. The plethora of premade ones fit into categories like “Festival,” “Soothing,” or “Universe.” They might be as simple as a gentle pulsing light or be more complex, with the individual LEDs of the lamps winking and flashing. There are also some licensed effects, like for Zootopia 2, but you'd need Govee's net-style lighting to actually get any benefit from them.

I especially liked the music synchronization effects, probably because at my core, I'm just a simple ape who wants to be entertained. Govee's effects really shine with the three-light lamps as they allow for more detailed gradients, or for the individual lights of each lamp to flash on and off in a more lively display than you might get with single light sources. It's cheesy, all of it.

Of course, neither of the ways Govee makes this work—using the microphone on the lights themselves to pick up cues from external music or using your smartphone—is good enough to be more than cheap entertainment. The onboard mic is more precise but susceptible to other noises screwing it up, while syncing using your smartphone's microphone introduces so much latency the effect might as well be totally random.

I could see using the music effects for a backyard karaoke party or something. But I would never subject my neighbors to what amounts to a Temu version of those Christmas light shows that go viral every year when some stage lighting professional goes hog wild with Disney soundtracks or whatever.

The best thing Govee has going for it these days is that, since 2023, this company has gone hard on supporting Matter. That's great for a couple of reasons. One is that any Matter-compliant smart light you buy from Govee will work with any smart home platform you use, assuming you haven't found some obscure, non-Matter-supporting one.

Also, Matter-certified devices are required to function even when your internet goes down. So, if you're savvy enough to have the Lights Prism on your local network but closed off to the broader internet, they're still controllable.

All that said, you won't be able to ditch the Govee app if you want to do anything more complicated than turning the lights on and off or setting the whole string's brightness or color at once. Matter just doesn't support that granularity, and none of the major smart home platforms has any sort of easy, built-in support for lighting effects.

The Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism is a very slick alternative to more invasive, integrated installations that would require professionals to cut holes in your soffit and install lights that they then wire up directly to your home. And with three LEDs per lamp, it makes for much more detailed lighting effects than just about any of the other permanent string lights on the market right now.

The trouble with it all is price. Sure, the Lights Prism is cheaper than those professional installations I just mentioned, but the physical product just doesn't feel like it's worth its at-least-$540 price. That's hard to get over, especially when Philips Hue has a cheaper version of this concept, minus the triple-LED gimmick. It's wild to see Philips Hue lights outprice anything even remotely similar, but there it is.

Still, the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Prism are very neat, they work with all major smart home platforms, and I wouldn't be sad if I owned them. So it's a good thing that Govee never keeps its products at their street price for long, especially around the holiday season, when prices plummet as everyone competes for your gift-giving dollars. If you're in the market for fancy outdoor smart lights and you see a really good deal on the Lights Prism—I mean cheaper-than-Hue good—go for it.

The M5 MacBook Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is only a month old, and it's already on sale. It's the only Mac so far to receive the upgrade to the latest M5 chip, benefiting from improved performance across the board. In my testing, there was a significant step forward everywhere you looked, including the GPU, the CPU, and the Neural Engine for AI tasks. It's the GPU that's seen the biggest leap, though, which should speed up both gaming and creative applications. Other than that, this is the same MacBook Pro you probably already know and love, with its bright mini-LED screen, robust speakers, and extra ports (over the MacBook Air, at least).

This base 14-inch model doesn't have the incredible value of the MacBook Air or the powerhouse performance of the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro. Ultimately, when it comes to which MacBook you should buy, the answer is still the Air. But the M5 versions of these laptops aren't coming until next year, so if you're after the latest Apple Silicon in one of the best laptops you can buy, this deal on the M5 MacBook Pro is solid.

The JBL Flip 7 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a Bluetooth speaker that has it all. As our A/V reviewer Ryan Waniata says, “JBL's Flip strikes the perfect compromise between mobility and sound quality, offering clean detail with plenty of punch.” Waniata also praises the durability of the Flip 7, which is important in a Bluetooth speaker meant to be used outdoors. There are tons of different color options to match your vibe, and it gets up to 16 hours of battery life. The increased water resistance means it'll bring the party wherever you need it. Put simply, it's the best Bluetooth speaker you can buy, and it's at a great price.

Everyone wants a cordless Dyson vacuum, but they tend to be exorbitantly expensive. It's still not cheap, but at $300 off, this is as good a deal as we've seen on this vacuum. The V15 Detect is our vacuum expert's favorite Dyson. In her testing, Nena Farrell says she was impressed by how much dust and dirt it sucked up from her carpet, as well as from hard floors. The V15 Detect also comes with an extra sensor that can actually count the number of dust particles. That's overkill for most people, but if you have severe allergies (or have friends or family that do), the Dyson V15 Detect can actually verify what you're picking up.

OLED TVs might be the best TVs you can buy, but if you're shopping for a TV under $1,000 like most people are, the TCL QM6K QLED (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is what you should be eyeing. It's a 4K mini-LED screen, and our TV reviewers call it “a versatile display that does just about everything well, from naturalistic colors to rich black levels and impressive clarity.” It's not the brightest TV in the world, but it does come with a 144-Hz refresh rate for gaming and a smart Google TV interface for your streaming needs. There are screen options ranging from 55 inches up to 98 inches, all of which are on sale ahead of Black Friday, with the happy-medium 65-inch model starting at $500.

Most people aren't using the wireless charging on their iPhone to its full extent. Picking up a MagSafe power bank is a great way to do that, and this one from Anker is our favorite. With a 10,000-mAh battery, it can power up an iPhone to a full charge nearly twice. It even works on Android phones because it supports the Qi2 standard. We also like that it comes with a built-in kickstand and a helpful LED light on the side that tells you how much charge is left. It's $35 off for Black Friday, bringing it to its lowest price so far.

Sony

The best noise-canceling headphones from Sony are also the best wireless headphones you can buy right now. Bags of processing power can silence even the loudest sounds around you, and the included microphones are excellent for Zoom calls. Sound quality is top-notch, with custom-made drivers delivering Sony's sleek and flat sound.

One of the biggest upgrades you can make to your remote work setup is a solid USB hub or laptop docking station. Most laptops don't have enough ports, especially not if you're trying to connect multiple, high-resolution monitors. The plug-and-play nature of this is super helpful, too, as you can have all of your peripherals and accessories connected via USB-C.

While you could just go out and buy any old USB hub, the Satechi Dual Dock Stand has some secrets up its sleeve. First off, it's designed to prop up your laptop slightly with its wedge shape. My favorite feature, though, is the built-in storage slot. It doesn't come with an SSD included, but any M.2 SSD will work. It's a handy feature to have. The best part is the price, which is down to $105, a new low at Best Buy for Black Friday.

Just last week, this laptop cost $1,000. Now it's down to $550. That's a 45 percent drop in price. And while I wouldn't say this laptop is worth $1,000, it's an absolute steal for $550. The Zenbook A14's calling card is its weight of just 2.16 pounds. It's light enough that it'll make you do a double-take when you pick it up off the table. That makes it an ideal travel companion to lug across campus or on airplanes. Unlike ultra-light laptops in the past, the Zenbook A14 doesn't have any major compromises in battery life, performance, or keyboard. It even has an OLED screen, as so many Asus laptops do.

This is a great price for the base iPad. But a cheaper iPad is only so good if it's limited by its software. But with the iPadOS 26 update, you're also getting a better iPad than ever before. With a more accurate cursor and resizable windows, the iPad is now more like a MacBook than ever before. Multitasking on an iPad has always been a nightmare, but now that you can pull up multiple windows side by side and resize them to your heart's content. Connect it up with a wireless mouse and keyboard, and you've got something that could replace a laptop in a pinch.

No one is calling the Moto G Stylus 5G the best phone in the world. In fact, our phone expert (and tech editor extraordinaire, Julian Chokkattu) recommends Nothing's Phone 3a as the better cheap phone. But the 2025 Moto G Stylus is not only the best Moto G phone you can buy, it also has a lot of high-end features, such as a large 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate. It even has a beautiful blue back, a built-in stylus, and a headphone jack. That's a lot of uncommon features in a remarkably cheap phone, especially at its discounted pre–Black Friday price.

These earbuds came out a couple of years ago, but they remain some of the best you can buy. When they came out, Sony's fifth-generation of high-end wireless earbuds were trimmed down to around 25 percent smaller and 20 percent lighter than the previous generation. You also get two extra full charges from the case, for a total of up to 36 hours of listening. That all makes it the best pair of earbuds for traveling in particular. There's no compromise in noise canceling either. In fact, our A/V experts say the XM5 has “some of the most advanced functionality in terms of EQ, touch controls, and adaptive noise canceling available on the market.” They're $100 off the retail price ahead of Black Friday, which is the best discount we've ever seen on them.

You can't go wrong with Google's brand-new Pixel 10. The smartest of the best Android phones, it boasts genuinely useful AI features, like Call Screen and Now Playing. There's also an excellent, versatile, triple-camera system that includes a 5X optical zoom for capturing action from afar. There's Qi2 support for magnetic wireless charging and magnetic accessories. It's unusual to see a deep discount on this year's Google flagship, so it's worth biting.

Samsung makes some of the prettiest gaming monitors, especially in the past couple of years. Within its Odyssey lineup, there's now just about every size and form factor of monitor you can imagine. The Odyssey G6 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 27-inch OLED with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 and a 360-Hz refresh rate, which should be great no matter what game you're playing. Want extreme frame rates for competitive shooters? You can drop the resolution to 1080p and explore the higher echelon of the 360-Hz refresh rate. For slower-paced single-player games, the 1440p resolution is crisp, and the OLED panel gets you gorgeous HDR in games. It's $250 off the full price ahead of Black Friday, down now to $650.

Asus

You can't expect a laptop this cheap to be without compromises. But when it comes to budget Chromebooks, this is as good as it gets. It's a reasonably affordable and attractive laptop, with lots of ports, decent performance, and a comfortable keyboard. For a Chromebook, the specs aren't bad either, coming with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage. Unfortunately, the touchpad isn't the best, nor is the display. It's not bright enough, and the colors look off. For a laptop under $300, though, the CX14 should do the trick, especially for a student or a first-time laptop owner.

Alienware

Amazon (RTX 5070)

Best Buy (RTX 5070)

Dell (RTX 5070 Ti)

With RAM prices skyrocketing, just buying a prebuilt gaming desktop feels like an increasingly smart move, especially at this price. The Alienware Aurora Gaming Desktop is down to just $1,225, coming with an Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti, Intel Core Ultra 7 265F, 32 GB of memory, and 1 TB of storage. That's cheaper than Dell's own price for that configuration, but I wouldn't recommend buying this particular model, as it comes with only a 500-watt power supply. While that's enough power for the RTX 5060 Ti, you'll be limited from upgrading to any GPUs more powerful in the future. So, I'd highly recommend buying one of the configurations with the 1,000-watt power supplies, such as the RTX 5070 configuration. Before buying, I'd also recommend comparing prices with Dell.com, as it has some strong deals on particular configurations, such as this RTX 5070 Ti model for just $1,000.

If you play MMOs, you know how useful it is to map various actions to buttons on your keyboard or mouse. Well, this gaming mouse from Corsair gives you a ton of options to customize your gameplay. There are 12 reprogrammable side buttons, but the mouse also has a high 33,000-dpi optical sensor and 1,000-Hz polling for low input lag and high responsiveness. It can connect via a 2.4-GHz dongle instead of Bluetooth, too.

Everyone could use faster and more reliable Wi-Fi, right? This high-performing, tri-band, Wi-Fi 7 mesh is the runner-up in our Best Mesh guide. You'll get lightning-fast speeds on the 6-GHz band at close range. Each unit has plenty of ports (one 10 Gbps Ethernet port, one 2.5 Gbps port, a Gigabit port, and a USB 3.0 port), and the Deco app is very easy to use. The possibility of a TP-Link ban in the US might put you off, or it might encourage you to pull the trigger now.

Anthropologists have spent centuries piecing together the story of human history. For every fascinating detail they unearth, there are others that are rather, uh, unsavory. A new analysis of human bone fragments paints a particularly gruesome picture of our Neanderthal cousins.

The study, published November 19 in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, suggests that these remains belonged to six women and children who were slaughtered, butchered, and cannibalized by other Neanderthals. The bone fragments were found inside the Goyet cave system in modern-day Belgium, and they appear to be between 41,000 and 45,000 years old.

The findings point to targeted predatory behavior toward slender, short-statured females and children from other Neanderthal groups, according to the researchers.

Back when Neanderthals roamed the Earth, cannibalism wasn't all that uncommon. Researchers have been digging up evidence of this grisly practice for years, with instances occurring over extended time periods and across distant geographic regions.

Neanderthal cannibalism appears to stem from a broad range of motivations, from sustenance and survival to potential rituals. However, piecing together the context surrounding individual occurrences has proved difficult largely due to the fragmented condition of most skeletal remains and a lack of preserved cultural clues.

With that being said, the assemblage of Neanderthal remains recovered from the Goyet caves offers some of the clearest insight into Neanderthal cannibalism during the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition. This collection of 101 bone fragments is the largest assemblage of Neanderthal remains in Northern Europe with clear evidence of human-made modifications.

For this study, a team of researchers led by Quentin Cosnefroy, a biological anthropologist at the University of Bordeaux in France, reassembled the bone fragments as much as possible and conducted a genetic analysis. The results indicated that the bones belonged to four adult women and two male children and that the women were shorter and more slender than the average female Neanderthal.

Forensic investigation and microscopic analysis of the remains revealed clear signs of butchery, such as cut marks and notches. This is evidence of nutritional cannibalism, according to the researchers.

When they combined their findings with a previous isotopic analysis of the remains, they concluded that the cannibalized Neanderthals came from a completely different region than the one they died in. This indicated that they were victims of exocannibalism—the practice of eating a person from outside of one's own community—possibly as a result of intergroup conflict, territoriality, or cultural treatment of outsiders.

“At a minimum, it suggests that weaker members of one or multiple groups from a single neighbouring region were deliberately targeted,” the researchers wrote in the study. They hypothesize that exocannibalism may have served as a selection strategy aimed at undermining the reproductive potential of one or more competing groups.

The study's findings, while stomach-turning, are a window into our distant past. They illustrate how subtle clues from ancient human remains can expose the complex social tensions and selective violence that shaped Neanderthal lives and, ultimately, our own.

It kinda looks like DOOM ported to the Atari Battlezone wireframe arcade games era.

Developer Michael Ayles has unleashed a version of DOOM that runs within a PCB design application, of all places. KiDOOM is a portmanteau of KiCad, the free and open source electronic design automation (EDA) software suite, and DOOM, the influential first-person shooter (FPS) that pioneered and shaped the genre for eternity. In this release, the game world is rendered fast and fluid in KiCAD's PCB editing viewport. However, the dev makes it clear KiDOOM isn't DOOM running in KiCAD; the EDA app is actually the display renderer, the game engine is a separate process.

The seminal 1993 FPS has looked better, and also a lot worse, but this version, using the KiCad renderer, certainly has a retro style we appreciate. To our eyes, the visuals are reminiscent of the Atari Battlezone wireframe arcade games or the Vectrex era. They could have probably been more firmly cemented in this era, but for Ayles deciding to use preset 64-pin packages for demons, and humble 3-pin parts for ammo clips. But that's fun too, especially for electronics enthusiasts.

 




In addition to marveling over this combination of EDA, CAD, and DOOM, our hearts are warmed by the dev's assertion that “every frame creates a legitimate PCB design that could theoretically be fabricated.”

So, instead of a screenshot to recall a particularly frantic and fun DOOM escapade, you could even fab a unique commemorative PCB. Don't expect to do anything with the PCB, other than hang it on your wall or use it as a table mat, though.

 




Ayles explains that KiDOOM provides triple mode rendering for different use-cases, with three parallel visualizations, and every frame traverses a six-stage pipeline. Luckily, for fluidity, the dev noticed that “DOOM's engine already calculates visible geometry as vectors. PCB traces ARE vectors.” Thus, for speed and efficiency, “Instead of 64,000 pixels, we need 100-300 line segments.”

In gameplay, between the neon wireframe walls, you will see demons and zombies rendered as QFP-64 packages, barrels, dead bodies, and torches as SOIC-8 packages, and collectables like health packs, ammo, and keycards using SOT-3 components.

Several key optimizations were done in the pipeline to enable pretty smooth gameplay on a modern computer. There are also four important KiCad settings that need to be tweaked by those wanting to give KiDOOM a spin – otherwise, you will have an experience that is “2-5x worse.” Those interested are encouraged to try KiDOOM for themselves, and Ayles provides a walkthrough of preparatory steps to get up and running.

As for performance, it looks like our intrepid dev had access to an M1 MacBook Pro, which could deliver 15-25fps in this game port. An “i7 + RTX 3050 Ti” could push the frame rate to between 18-28fps. We aren't sure whether throwing more CPU and GPU power at KiDOOM will pay off in a linear fashion, or other bottlenecks will make themselves known. But if you try it on an RTX 5090 or RX 9070 XT, or one of the other best GPUs for gaming in 2025, please let us know!

A domestic processor combining 14nm logic and 18nm DRAM could boast both power and efficiency.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


At the ICC Global CEO Summit in Beijing, China Semiconductor Industry Association vice chairman Wei Shaojun claimed that a new domestically designed AI processor using mature 14nm logic and 18nm DRAM nodes can match the performance of Nvidia's current 4nm chips. The architecture, which leverages 3D hybrid bonding and software-defined near-memory computing, is intended to counter China's reliance on the Nvidia CUDA ecosystem.

Wei pitched the design as a potentially disruptive shift away from U.S. dependency, calling it central to China's AI strategy, but fell short of disclosing any specific technical details, hinting that he would “leave some suspense” for now, DigiTimes reports.

What he did describe was 14nm logic bonded directly to 18nm DRAM to drastically increase memory bandwidth and reduce compute latency. He said the system's power efficiency reaches 2 TFLOPS per watt, with a claimed total throughput of 120 TFLOPS, which is much higher than Nvidia's A100 GPUs. He argued that by placing memory and logic in the same package, the chip avoids the “memory wall” that hinders large-scale GPU deployments.

Wei added that the chip is part of a fully domestic supply chain effort and will be formally disclosed in detail later this year. The ultimate goal, he said, is to sidestep Western supply chain constraints, cut costs, and decouple China's AI development from U.S. vendors at both the hardware and software levels.

Wei's comments put forward a direct challenge to the dominant logic of semiconductor development over the last decade. Where U.S. and Taiwanese chipmakers have focused on smaller transistors — Apple's M3 at 3nm and Nvidia's Hopper at 4nm — China's researchers are now pitching advanced packaging and system architecture as a way to restore competitiveness using older manufacturing nodes.

The architecture described involves stacking a logic chip built on a 14nm process directly onto or alongside 18nm DRAM, using 3D hybrid bonding. This technique differs from traditional package-on-package or chiplet interconnects, in that it allows extremely dense, low-latency, high-bandwidth connections between dies. Unlike wire bonding or organic interposers, hybrid bonding directly fuses copper-to-copper contacts between wafers or die surfaces at the micron scale, supporting much higher interconnect density and thermal performance.

 




According to Wei, this layout enables near-memory compute, with logic operations executed in close proximity to memory blocks. That reduces the energy and latency cost of frequent memory fetches, often the limiting factor in AI workloads. He said software-defined logic further boosts efficiency by allowing compute units to be dynamically mapped and configured for AI-specific workloads.

He also suggested that a theoretical performance of 120 TFLOPS could be reached with a total power draw of 2 TFLOPS per watt, which would place the architecture well above the energy efficiency of Nvidia's A100 and in the territory of Hopper-class or Blackwell-class chips. It also implies a significant advantage over CPU-bound systems like Intel Xeon, which Wei said remain less efficient for large model training.

He stopped short of naming which Chinese firms are building silicon around this model, but past Chinese state media coverage has identified national champions such as Cambricon, Loongson, and Biren as players developing GPGPU-class accelerators. Cambricon in particular has previously discussed near-memory architectures and filed patents related to logic-in-memory compute.

Wei devoted a significant part of his address to outlining how he sees the entrenchment of CUDA as a vulnerability in the global AI industry. He argued that the early compatibility between large AI models and Nvidia's GPGPU architecture created a cycle of increasing architectural dependency. Over time, software was designed for CUDA and Nvidia optimized its hardware for deep learning workloads, leading to what Wei called a "deep pit" of mutual dependence between model developers and GPU vendors.

He claimed that this dynamic leaves alternative architectures — such as domestic AI chips incompatible with CUDA — with almost no route to widespread adoption, regardless of theoretical performance. In his view, if China becomes similarly locked into this ecosystem, it will effectively lose sovereignty over its AI trajectory.

 




Wei is clearly not alone in this line of thought. Chinese companies such as Cambricon and Huawei have advanced CUDA alternatives and software abstraction layers in parallel with domestic AI hardware, with state-aligned investment efforts backing broader ecosystem development. Cambricon's NeuWare stack, for instance, now offers compatibility with PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX, and provides migration tools for CUDA-trained models. Alibaba and Huawei have similarly promoted their own developer frameworks targeting Ascend and XuanTie hardware.

Wei warned that continued reliance on U.S.-controlled software and toolchains would carry “very serious” consequences, both economically and geopolitically. He said China's goal is to “abandon U.S. technology routes” and build a domestic AI technology stack that is resilient to supply chain shocks and regulatory constraints.

The Chinese are right to be concerned. In recent years, the U.S. has significantly expanded its export controls and blocked Nvidia from selling its leading hardware to Chinese firms. In response, the company introduced modified, lower-performance chips, which were also eventually restricted. Today, now that Nvidia has no market share left in China, domestic companies rely on legacy hardware or workarounds using second-tier accelerators and the grey market.

The claims made at ICC raise questions that cannot yet be answered without detailed benchmarks and independent testing. While hybrid bonding is an established technology, the real-world performance of a full stack built on 14nm logic and 18nm DRAM remains to be seen.

Thermal dissipation in 3D stacks is still a major concern, particularly when logic and memory are in close proximity, and airflow is limited. Hybrid bonding also requires very high manufacturing precision and wafer alignment. These challenges could impact both yield and cost. China's domestic foundries, including SMIC, are known to have strong 14nm-class production lines, but hybrid bonding at scale for logic-memory stacks would be a new capability.

Breaking Nvidia's lock on the model training ecosystem also requires not just raw performance parity, but broad software support and capable developers. Even if China succeeds in building a functionally equivalent AI processor, adoption will remain limited without tooling and integration into PyTorch or TensorFlow workflows.

Still, with EUV lithography out of reach and GAA transistor designs still years away for domestic fabs, architectural innovation and packaging integration may be China's most viable path to short-term competitiveness in high-performance AI workloads. Wei indicated that more technical details would be shared in future disclosures, but did not confirm whether working silicon had been produced.

The biggest problem is the harsh image thresholding done by the superfast receipt printer.

Playing PC games on inappropriate displays looks like it is becoming a trend in late 2025. Last month, we saw a PC enthusiast playing Battlefield 6 on the tiny circular screen of a CPU liquid cooler. Today, we spotted a YouTuber who had decided any type of conventional monitor or screen had to be snubbed. Instead, Smilly recorded themselves enjoying a bit of Minecraft using a printer as their sole viewport into the famously blocky game's universe.

Above, you can see and hear that Smilly isn't having the happiest time in Minecraft, via his high contrast paper-spooled view of the game world.

The receipt printer provides surprisingly rapid updates, which is a welcome feature for any gaming "display." But it isn't the ‘refresh rate', which we'd hazard is around 0.5 frames per second, that seems to be frustrating the YouTuber.

 




Rather, we hear Smilly venting frustratedly about what is (and isn't) visible in the game world, due to the stark contrasty monochromatic nature of the printouts.

Occasionally, audio clues help give the video gaming fan an idea of what is going on, but such clues are fleeting at best.

 




Mid-video clip, Smilly seems to be settling more comfortably into the black and white super-contrasty world he is adventuring within. But then matters get worse. “I need to go to the inventory now,” states our printer-vision-restricted hero, flatly. Switching to his inventory view shows… an unrecognizable shape surrounded by a murky gray nothingness. “Oh…. Sh*t.”

As we mentioned in the intro, gamers, particularly those on the more open platform of the PC, have long adventured into strange realms. Sometimes necessity is the mother of invention – so you might use your tiny secondary display as your main monitor when the latter is in for repair, or on loan, or whatever.

More and more, though, we see gaming boundaries pushed simply 'because it's there.' That's certainly the case here, and there's a wealth of prior examples of getting Doom to run on inappropriate gadgets like pregnancy test devices, keyboard keycaps, lawn mowers, and more.

Don't be tempted. It's Black Friday, you're in the market for a new MacBook, and you're likely wondering if you should buy the new M5 MacBook Pro. It's usually good advice to buy whatever the latest release of a tech product is, especially if you're looking for the best Black Friday MacBook deal. In theory, that ensures you get the best performance and features, and will hopefully mean you won't have to replace it for many years.

But in this case, you probably shouldn't.

That might come as a surprise coming from me, especially since my evaluation of the M5 MacBook Pro was quite positive. There's a lot to like about it. The M5's performance is a solid step up over the M4, especially in the GPU department. The stuff that hasn't changed is still really high-quality, including the Mini-LED display, excellent speakers, and iconic design. It's been over four years since many of these features have changed, but the MacBook Pro remains competitive in almost every aspect. It's even $200 off for Black Friday, despite launching only a month ago.

The problem is the position of this particular MacBook Pro in the lineup. The base 14-inch MacBook Pro is the only Mac in the lineup where you can currently get the M5. That's a shame, as I view it as the most niche MacBook in the lineup. The MacBook Air is the laptop most people should buy, while the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros are what serious creative professionals need to accelerate their workflows.

The base 14-inch MacBook Pro has a spruced-up display and more ports, but performance and battery life are more or less equal to the MacBook Air. Apple knows people will buy the MacBook Air this holiday season, especially at its sale price of $749. So, bringing the M5 exclusively to the 14-inch MacBook Pro feels like an easy way to boost sales on an otherwise overlooked laptop in the lineup. I'm speculating on Apple's strategy here, but that's my best read.

According to the latest reports, it'll be at least a couple more months before the M5 comes to other MacBooks, but that timing is not guaranteed. Here's the truth: most people should still just buy the M4 MacBook Air. It might be the best laptop ever sold for that price. Or, if you want the larger 15-inch model, you can get it for $949. That extra $200 gets you more screen real estate (without sacrificing sharpness) and better speakers.

You certainly shouldn't buy the M5 MacBook Pro if you're looking for more performance. The M4 Pro MacBook Pro is still a significant step up in performance over the M5 (and is $250 off its retail price right now). Meanwhile, you'll pay an extra $200 to upgrade from the 15-inch MacBook Air to the M5 MacBook Pro—even though performance isn't too drastically different. And yes, that's when you configure them with the same amount of storage.

It's not that there are no benefits of the Pro versus the Air. But they are quality-of-life changes, not performance-driven ones. A brighter, HDR-capable screen and more ports are the two primary differences, and it's really only people whose work depends on those differences that should buy the M5 MacBook Pro. I know plenty of people who balk at the idea of owning a laptop without an SD card slot, for example. Fair enough. But with the improved external display support on the M4 MacBook Air, which can now support up to two 4K monitors, the number of people who should buy the M5 MacBook Pro has only gotten smaller over the past year.

So, don't be fooled by the “Pro” branding. The MacBook Air is the MacBook most people should buy for Black Friday this year.

Fall is when coffee tastes best. Not because of the weather—that's dumb, it's good all year. Coffee tastes best in the fall because this is when all the espresso makers, coffee machine makers, and coffee grinder makers trot out their best deals. Which means it's when you upgrade your home bean game. I usually advise people to wait to buy espresso machines on Prime Day in the summer, or right now.

Here are the best deals you'll find during the fall bean bonanza, on the best espresso machines, drip coffee machines, and coffee grinders WIRED has tested—in some cases for 7 years or more.

Breville

Amazon

Best Buy

Seattle Coffee Gear

Breville Barista Express is the unparalleled blockbuster of the espresso world, long one of WIRED's top picks and long the best-selling machine of its kind on Amazon. The reasons are simple. It hits that Goldilocks sweet spot of taste, ease, and affordability—and never more so than during big sales events. It's still the one I recommend as the best device for most people, especially as a starter to the espresso world. If you're looking for a machine with a grinder included, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better or more reliable semi-automatic machine than this Breville. This thing has been chugging happily along.

Ninja

Amazon

Ninja

I was as surprised as anyone when Ninja got in on the espresso machine game. It's a tough world, full of Italians. I was even more surprised when the Ninja Luxe Cafe Premier performed as well as it did out of the gate when introduced last year, with a terrific milk frother and a bean-assist function that's useful in dialing in your grind settings on the built-in conical burr grinder without being obtrusive. This year's Luxe Cafe Pro is the refinement of the Premier machine, with an automated tamper and a much-needed hot water spout. Sure, the “drip coffee” is no great shakes, and the fast cold brew isn't as good as the slow kind. But this is a great espresso machine for beginners, and the cold foam is best-in-class. And with this discount, it's only $100 more than the Luxe Cafe Premier ($499).

De'Longhi

Amazon

Williams-Sonoma

The De'Longhi Rivelia is both the Italian coffee giant's new flagship superautomatic machine and the machine that sold me on the idea of superautomatic machines in general. What's so “super” about it? It will make basically any and all varieties of frothy drinks with barely any participation on your part. Espresso and americano and several varieties of full coffee-mug drinks require just the press of a button, with a helpful bean assist function that'll dial you in for each bean. Milk frothing is ridiculously easy and can be customized for density. Nearly alone among such devices, you can swap out between two bean hoppers. This means caff in the morning, decaf in the afternoon.

Moccamaster

Amazon

The Moccamaster KBGV drip coffee machine will last. It will last for years. It will last, perhaps, decades, according to testimonials online. It lives forever, in seemingly every Scandinavian household—stubbornly analog, precisely engineered, repairable, and replaceable. Even after its 5-year warranty, you can repair it for roughly $60 at the North American Moccamaster workshop outside Portland, Oregon. You don't even need a deal for this to be a deal. But there's a deal. It's more than $100 off. That's pretty good.

Baratza

Amazon

Williams Sonoma

The Baratza Encore ESP is the coffee grinder I recommend to anyone who asks whether they need a good coffee grinder. They totally do. And this one is the most versatile and high-performing I know at its price, with a dead-ingenious fine adjustment at the espresso level of the scale, plus larger adjustments so you can also use this thing for excellent drip, French press, and cold brew. Its steadfast sturdiness and analog nature mean it's not as pretty as a Fellow Opus (also on a good sale and a terrific, very quiet grinder!) But this Baratza will power through the years without complaint.

A massive pile of money aimed at stopping AI regulation was already set to reshape U.S. electoral politics in the coming cycle, and now a massive pile of money aimed at spurring AI regulation is coming to cancel it out. None of this is business as usual, and it's going to get weird.According to the New York Times, a brand new 501(c)(4) group has just been born to counter pro-AI PAC money with anti-AI PAC money, and the plan, according to the Times' sources, is to raise $50 million. This entity calls itself Public First, and it's about to start funneling money from undisclosed donors into a Democratic anti-AI super PAC called Jobs and Democracy PAC, and a Republican twin called Defending Our Values PAC.Personalities that seem to be involved in Public First, according to the Times, are billionaire Anthropic co-founder Jack Clark, billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, and billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. A “PAC” or “political action committee” raises legally-limited contributions to influence election outcomes. A super PAC is an independent PAC that is allowed to raise unlimited money because it doesn't coordinate directly with campaigns. So super PACs are known for running negative ads smearing the candidates they're against, which doesn't require coordination in order to benefit friendly candidates. According to The New York Times, which learned about these new PACs from anonymous sources, all this is not so-secretly a response to the pro-AI PAC Leading the Future. Leading the future, which had $100 million banked when news of its existence broke earlier this month, is backed by OpenAI co-founder Greg Brockman, Andreesseen Horowitz's Marc Andreessen, and Joe Lonsdale a co-founder of Palantir. The intention with Leading the Future is to back candidates who oppose AI regulation. The amounts of money these groups are throwing around are intense, and way beyond normal spending levels for businesses and “special interests” in the U.S. For reference, the United Auto Worker's PAC, which is considered pretty influential, raised $15,259,386 for the 2024 election cycle according to OpenSecrets. The oil and gas industry, meanwhile, gave $13,895,000 to super PACs for that same cycle, according to Sludge. The type of economic power these AI PACs are achieving (or hoping to achieve) is closer in scale to President Trump's super PAC, which secured $177 million by August of this year, mostly from crypto donors, according to the New York Times. Crypto's Fairshake super PAC similarly has $140 million, placing it right alongside AI, molding politics anew for the weird tech era. For an example of what AI PAC money looks like in action, look at its hostility earlier this month toward obscure New York Assemblymember Alex Bores, who is running for a House seat. Bores is the chief sponsor of a piece of New York legislation requiring AI companies to work on preventing “critical harms” from AI models, but he suddenly found himself and his bill becoming the target of billionaires on the other side of the country in California. Leading the Future vowed to spend millions keeping this one random guy out of Congress. Bores told the San Francisco Examiner he was under fire from “a specific, small part of Silicon Valley that has an extreme minority [viewpoint] that there should be no regulation of AI whatsoever,” and noted that “the fact that they are being so straightforward about that is something I'm thankful for.” Among Politicos, Bores is famous now.This kind of weirdness is about to accelerate. Among the factions the Times says are helping dream up Public First up are “allied donors who are loosely tied to the effective altruism movement.” Effective altruism is not on the map politically. EA is a tweaked form of utilitarianism, aimed at amassing the greatest possible amount of money, and then turning around and using it to try and mitigate the most possible harms. A list of the movement's most prominent members would include imprisoned crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried, and deeply odd philosophers like Peter Singer and Nick Bostrom.These groups, in short, aren't tidily partisan. The pro-AI side, Leading the Future, so far only seems to have irritated the Trump Administration, even though the Republican Party is the more obvious fit for its agenda. Meanwhile, Public First, with its separate Democratic and Republican sides is bound to support candidates with deeply contradictory agendas before long.Many will find the lack of clear partisanship to be a relief, but rather than being a bipartisan dream, two politically incoherent funding titans are materializing, and they—alongside crypto—are about to try and drown out the rest of the political picture next year. Elections in the U.S. are always painful slogs. What's coming could be something worse: a high-stakes public competition between anonymous factions, seemingly made up largely of billionaires, using AI as a pretext to have a food fight all over what's left of the American political process. I can't wait.

That is a lot of storage


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


If you want to get a head start on your local storage ambitions, we've spotted just the deal for that. Seagate's 24 TB BarraCuda hard drive is just $239.99 on Newegg right now, down 20% from its list price and a new all-time low.

All-time low price 

If you're looking for a massi storage upgrade, you can't do much better than Seagate's massive 24 TB hard drive. This 7200-RPM disk is backed by 2 years of warranty, and doesn't even feel slow for its class, thanks to the 190MB/s top speed. This drive uses speedy CMR tech, too. 

Seagate's Barracuda lineup is one of the most well-known names in storage, and we've reviewed a lot of them. It may not win any awards, but when we tested the 8 TB variant, it had very low power consumption, the least among all drives in most benchmarks. Regardless, the 24 TB variant we're highlighting today spins at 7200 RPM and uses the SATA 6 GB/s interface, enabling transfer speeds of up to 190 MB/s. That's possible in part due to the 512 MB of onboard cache, which makes this drive a bit faster than the bare-bones offerings.

You get two years of warranty with the 24 TB Barracuda, and while it may not be as good as the 5-year period on EXOS drives, you're saving a lot by not going for an enterprise-grade drive. More importantly, this HDD uses the superior Conventional Magnetic Recording (CMR) technology instead of the far slower Shingled Magnetic Recording (SMR) that is barely better than actual shingles. All that for a record-low price of just $239.99 — it's like you're getting a terabyte for every $10.

Microsoft is doing a holdup on users to force them to upgrade threatening on their security if they don't, as they will not provide anymore important security update.
But, from the user point of view, the migration will give you nothing special except crap that they didn't ask for, like having AI everything.

reply

it's legitimate for their stopping of security updates. However, this is only true if there is no more security updates to _any_ version of windows 10. Except that microsoft still has windows 10 LTSC, and that does have updates till some 2030's. So there is an effective path to just give those same updates to all version of windows, and it is "free" (as in, it did not take extra dev time to create).Therefore, this is deliberate on microsoft's part to force more upgrades to windows 11. This should be considered anti-consumer practice, and the consumer protection groups ought to latch on and sue microsoft for this.For consumers themselves, i always advise them that the time to move is now. Linux has never been easier to install, and software (esp. old windows software) never more compatible. The small bits of pain felt now in a transition will more than pay for itself with the freedom gained in the future.

Defense tech startup Anduril Industries has faced numerous setbacks during testing of its autonomous weapons systems, according to new reporting by the WSJ. The problems cited include more than a dozen drone boats that failed during a Navy exercise off California in May, with sailors warning of safety violations and potential loss of life; a mechanical issue that damaged the engine of Anduril's unmanned jet fighter Fury during a summer ground test; and an August test of its Anvil counterdrone system that caused a 22-acre fire in Oregon.

Founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, Anduril raised $2.5 billion back in June at a $30.5 billion valuation led by Founders Fund, which help incubate the company. The company has won numerous military contracts, including programs to build autonomous aircraft and counter-drone systems.

Beyond testing failures, the Journal reports that Anduril's only real battlefield experience in Ukraine has also been problematic. Front-line soldiers with Ukraine's SBU security service found that Altius loitering drones crashed and failed to hit targets. The issues were reportedly severe enough that Ukrainian forces stopped using the drones in 2024 and haven't fielded them since, though Anduril maintains that its challenges are typical of weapons development, that its engineering team is achieving meaningful progress, and that the aforementioned incidents don't indicate any underlying flaws in its technology.

Black Friday Week launched several days ago and stockouts already plague popular items across categories as inventory depletes faster than retailers anticipated. The JBL PartyBox Stage 320 featuring dual 6.5″ woofers, 18-hour battery life and IPX4 splash resistance hasn't sold out yet, but fewer than 20 units remain at this record-low price: At $427 (including a coupon), down from $599, this portable party speaker with telescopic handle and synchronized lightshow represents 25% savings that won't last once remaining inventory disappears. Amazon's Black Friday pricing creates urgency as hesitation likely means missing the deal entirely.

The two 6.5-inch woofers produce clear, precise bass that stays clear even at full volume, unlike cheaper party speakers that make the bass sound muddy. Two 25mm dome tweeters make the highs sound crystal clear, cutting through background noise. This makes sure that vocals and treble instruments can be heard clearly at outdoor events or crowded parties. JBL says that its output is enough to fill areas the size of a tennis court with music, which means that it can cover about 2,800 square feet.

With Auracast wireless connectivity, you can connect multiple JBL PartyBox speakers to get more coverage or true stereo separation that makes the soundstage wider. Two speakers placed in the right places create left-right channel separation that can't be done with single-point sources and  makes spatial audio presentation much better during critical listening or dance parties where sound positioning is important. For bigger events, chaining together multiple units throughout the venue helps cover the whole area and gets rid of dead zones where single speakers make it hard for guests to hear.

The battery lasts for 18 hours which is enough time for the whole event, from setup to teardown, without having to stop in the middle of the party to charge it, which would kill the momentum and force you to rent generators or stay close to outlets. Pool parties, wedding receptions, and outdoor festivals that last all day can all be done on a single charge, so you won't have to worry about them dying at important times. The replaceable battery design lets you switch out dead packs for new ones during marathon events, but the included battery is usually enough for realistic use over the course of a single day. Fast charging gives you two more hours of use after just 10 minutes of charging so you can quickly charge it up during short breaks when outlets are available.

IPX4 splash resistance keeps speakers safe from rain, poolside splashes, and spilled drinks that would ruin unprotected speakers. This means you can use them outside without having to worry about the weather or cover them up all the time. People can throw beach parties, park gatherings, or backyard barbecues without worrying that unexpected rain will ruin their expensive gear.

The synchronized light show creates starry patterns, moving light trails, and strobe effects that pulse with the music, turning audio-only experiences into full sensory events. The visual elements work best at night or in the evening when the lighting makes the atmosphere impossible to recreate during the day. Instead of showing random patterns, the lights sync to bass hits, tempo changes, and volume changes.

This is the last chance to get JBL's powerful party speaker at Black Friday prices before it sells out completely, with fewer than 20 units left at $427. The combination of professional sound quality, 18-hour battery life, weather resistance and a built-in light show at 28% off retail price makes it a great deal.

Protein quantification is critical in biologics research and development. However, current methods such as ELISA, BLI, and SPR have complex workflows and can struggle with crude samples or early-stage screening. These limits drive up the need for platforms that combine quickness, ease of use, and resilience.

Redox Electrochemical Detection (RED) is a sensor-based detection approach that generates an electrical signal through enzyme-mediated redox reactions, which is then monitored directly using electrode sensors.

RED is applied on the Amperia™ platform, a compact benchtop platform built on patented sensor technology, with disposable dip-style sensors and prefilled assay plates.

Amperia™ uses Redox Electrochemical Detection (RED) to streamline protein measurement, removing the requirement for optics and fluidics. It produces consistent findings for targets like AAV, mAbs, and His-tagged proteins, even in crude samples.

It facilitates early screening and upstream workflows thanks to its small design, low training requirements, and target-specific assay formats. Ongoing development aims to broaden assay offerings and integrate with automated systems.

Abselion started in 2018, at that time under the name HexagonFab, in a small corner of a laboratory at the University of Cambridge.

We set out with the humble goal to make protein research simpler. Scientists should be able to pursue their passion for discovery and innovation, rather than spend their valuable time with tedious, manual tasks. With RED we had access to the ideal technology to create this product. A product that is so compact that it could fit on every bench, and so affordable that it is accessible to everyone. Over the years we have designed, built and tested our first product Amperia and we're proud to introduce it to the world.​

New research suggests that consuming three to four cups of coffee daily may help slow cellular aging in individuals with schizophrenia and affective disorders, uncovering a surprising lifestyle factor linked to biological resilience.

Study: Coffee intake is associated with telomere length in severe mental disorders. Image credit: PitukTV/Shutterstock.com

In a recent study published in BMJ Mental Health, researchers examined whether different levels of daily coffee consumption were associated with a marker of cellular aging in adults with severe mental disorders (SMD).

People who drank moderate amounts of coffee daily showed the longest telomeres. The most evident statistically significant difference was observed between non-drinkers and those consuming three to four cups per day. Some coffee drinkers show telomere lengths equivalent to being approximately five years biologically younger than non-drinkers.

People with SMD experience substantially reduced life expectancy due to high rates of physical diseases commonly linked to aging, such as cardiovascular conditions and cancer. Researchers have therefore proposed accelerated biological aging in these groups, often assessed through telomere length, which naturally shortens with age.

Multiple studies show that individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder typically have shorter telomere length than healthy peers, though the causes remain unclear. Because telomeres are sensitive to environmental influences, lifestyle factors such as diet have become important research targets.

Coffee is one of the world's most widely consumed beverages. Moderate coffee consumption has been linked to cognitive benefits, reduced risks of neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and lower all-cause mortality. Evidence from population studies on coffee and telomere length is mixed, with some showing detrimental effects and others suggesting antioxidant-related protection.

Individuals with SMD tend to consume more caffeine than the general population, yet no study has specifically tested how coffee consumption relates to telomere length in schizophrenia or affective disorders.

This cross-sectional study included 436 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective disorders, recruited across four psychiatric units in Norway. Participants with some neurological conditions, significant head trauma, or somatic illnesses affecting brain function were excluded.

Trained clinicians conducted diagnostic assessments. Medication use was extracted from medical records, reported as daily defined doses for major psychotropic classes. Coffee intake was measured through clinical interviews, where participants selected one of four categories: none, one or two cups per day, three or four cups per day, or five or more cups per day. Smoking status and smoking duration were also recorded.

Telomere length was measured from peripheral blood leukocytes, producing a telomere–to–single–copy gene ratio. Base-pair differences were translated into estimated years of accelerated aging.

Group differences in telomere length were evaluated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for medication dosage, smoking duration, ethnicity, age, and sex. Additional sensitivity analyses tested interactions with sex and diagnosis and compared non-drinkers with those consuming between one and four cups each day.

Across the 436 participants, coffee consumption groups differed mainly by age and smoking history. Those drinking five or more cups per day were older than non-drinkers and low-intake groups, and they also had the longest smoking histories.

Coffee use did not vary by sex or medication use, but individuals with schizophrenia consumed more coffee than those with affective disorders. Most participants were smokers, with an average of nine years of tobacco use.

Analyses showed a significant inverted J-shaped relationship between coffee intake and telomere length. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking duration, and medication, telomere length differed across consumption groups, with the clearest contrast between non-drinkers and those consuming three or four cups per day. This was the only comparison that had any statistical significance.

Moderate coffee intake was associated with longer telomeres, whereas very high intake of five or more cups daily did not show this benefit. When comparing non-drinkers with all participants consuming within the recommended range of one to four cups a day, coffee drinkers appeared biologically about five years younger, based on estimated telomere shortening rates.

These associations were consistent after adjusting for diagnosis, and there were no interactions by sex or diagnostic group, indicating similar effects in men and women and in schizophrenia versus affective disorders.

The study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is linked to longer telomeres, and therefore potentially slower cellular aging, in people with severe mental disorders. The pattern resembled an inverted J-curve: drinking up to four cups per day was associated with longer telomere length, but higher intake showed no advantage.

These findings align with some large population studies, though others report opposite or mixed results. Proposed mechanisms include antioxidants in coffee that may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as caffeine-related effects on telomerase pathways that influence telomere maintenance. These factors are especially relevant in schizophrenia and affective disorders, where accelerated aging is often observed.

Key limitations include reliance on self-reported coffee intake, lack of data on caffeine sources or coffee type, and absence of measures of inflammation or oxidative stress. The study was cross-sectional and lacked a healthy control group, which limited causal inference. Telomere length measurements provided an average rather than a distribution of short telomeres.

Overall, results suggest potential benefits of moderate coffee intake but possible harm at high levels, highlighting the importance of monitoring consumption in this population.

In preclinical studies, researchers found that priming the immune system with a Treg-expanding therapy before stem cell transplant boosted survival, protected vital organs, and promoted a balanced gut microbiome-offering hope for safer, more effective treatment of blood cancers. The study, led by researchers at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and collaborating organizations, is highlighted on the cover of the Nov. 27, 2025, issue of the journal, Blood.

The new protocol focuses on improving outcomes for patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), a procedure often used to treat blood cancers and other serious conditions.

Transplant patients face a risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a complication where the new immune cells attack the patient's own tissues. Traditionally, doctors use strong medications to suppress the immune system and prevent GVHD, but these drugs can cause side effects and leave patients vulnerable to infections.

Led by senior author, Robert Levy, Ph.D., a researcher at Sylvester and a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Miller School, the multi-institutional research team developed a new protocol that uses targeted immunotherapy to help the body's own regulatory T cells (Tregs) expand before transplant. Tregs are a type of immune cell that helps keep the immune system in balance. By increasing the number of Tregs in advance, the body is better prepared to handle the transplant and reduce the risk of GVHD.

Our approach is about helping the patient's own immune system create a safer environment for the stem cell transplant. We're not just suppressing the immune response-we're guiding it in key tissues involved following the transplant to promote success."

Robert Levy, Ph.D., researcher at Sylvester and professor of microbiology and immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine

The researchers used preclinical models to test a combination of two agents: TL1A-Ig fusion protein and low-dose IL-2. These agents stimulate specific receptors (TNFRSF25 and CD25) on Tregs, encouraging them to multiply and become more active. The expanded Tregs were found in key tissues such as the colon, liver and eye-areas often affected by GVHD.

The protocol led to several positive outcomes in preclinical studies:

"We saw that expanding Tregs before transplant helped protect vital tissues organs and supported a healthier microbiome," Levy said. "This could mean fewer complications and better recovery for patients."

This research is significant because it offers a new way to prevent GVHD without relying solely on broad immune-suppressing drugs. By using targeted immunotherapy to expand Tregs, the protocol may reduce side effects and improve the quality of life for transplant patients.

Another key finding is that the protocol does not interfere with the body's ability to address cancer cells-a process known as graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). Maintaining GVL is crucial for preventing relapse in patients with blood cancers.

"Our goal is to make transplants safer while still allowing the patient's immune system to do its job against cancer," Levy noted. "We're working toward therapies that are both effective and practical for real-world use."

Unlike older methods that require collecting and manipulating donor cells outside the body, Levy's protocol works by expanding the patient's own Tregs in vivo-inside the body-before the transplant. This approach could simplify treatment and make it more accessible.

The research also highlights the role of the gut microbiome in transplant outcomes. Patients who received the Treg expansion protocol had a more diverse and balanced microbiome, a finding that is increasingly recognized as important for immune health.

"Personalized medicine is about tailoring treatments to each patient's needs," Levy said. "By supporting the immune system and microbiome, we can help patients recover more smoothly."

He and colleagues are working to translate these findings into clinical trials. The hope is that this protocol will become part of standard care for patients undergoing stem cell transplants, leading to fewer complications and better long-term outcomes.

"We're excited to continue this work and collaborate with clinicians to bring new therapies to patients," Dr. Levy concluded. "Every step forward brings us closer to safer, more effective transplants."

Levy's team included researchers from other leading institutions including Sloan Kettering Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, Weill Cornell Medical College and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.

Instagram users may overestimate the extent to which they are addicted to the platform, according to research conducted on 1,204 US adults published in Scientific Reports. The findings suggest that for most social media users, excessive use is driven by habit rather than genuine addiction.

Addiction towards a substance or action is typically characterised by a cluster of symptoms including difficulties controlling use, experiencing cravings to use, experiencing withdrawal symptoms when not using, and continuing to use despite negative consequences or risk of harm.

Ian Anderson and Wendy Wood surveyed an approximately representative sample of 380 US Instagram users, who were 50% women and had an average age of 44 years. Participants described how addicted they felt to Instagram and were assessed for symptoms of addictive Instagram use. The authors found that although 18% of participants at least somewhat agreed that they were addicted to Instagram - with 5% substantially agreeing - only 2% displayed symptoms indicating risk of potential addiction.

The authors explored a potential cause of this discrepancy by assessing descriptions of social media use in news articles published in US news media outlets between November 2021 and November 2024. They identified 4,383 articles mentioning the phrase "social media addiction" and 50 mentioning the phrase "social media habit". This suggests that frequent social media use tends to be described as an addiction in US news articles. The authors suggest that this may influence how users perceive their social media use. 

Using a second sample of 824 US adult Instagram users, the authors investigated potential negative impacts of labelling frequent Instagram use as an addiction. The authors found that prompting participants to frame their social media use as an addiction was associated with lower feelings of control over their Instagram use and assigning higher levels of blame to both themselves and the platform for their excessive use.

Together, the findings suggest that labelling frequent social media use as an addiction by news media and other institutions may contribute to Instagram users overestimating the extent to which they are addicted to the platform and may also negatively impact their perceptions of their social media use. More selective use of the term addiction by policymakers and the news media in relation to social media use may reduce this effect, according to the authors.

Washington, D.C., could host some World Cup games after all.

In 2031.

The still-to-be-built Washington Commanders stadium was among 14 U.S. sites listed as potential hosts for the women's World Cup in 2031 in the bid book submitted Friday, Nov. 28, to FIFA by the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica. The four countries have the only bid for what will be an expanded, 48-team tournament, and FIFA will officially announce the host April 30, 2026.

FIFA also released the bid book for the 2035 tournament, a joint bid by England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. That tournament also will be awarded in April.

The United States and Mexico are co-hosting the men's World Cup with Canada next summer, and the 2031 tournament would make use of many of the same stadiums. But Charlotte, Denver, Minneapolis, Nashville, Orlando, San Diego and Washington, D.C., are also on the list of cities and stadiums for FIFA to evaluate as possible 2031 hosts.

Washington was famously snubbed when the final list of host cities for the men's World Cup in 2026 was released, the omission blamed on the state of Northwest Stadium and the toxicity of then-Commanders owner Dan Snyder. But Snyder is gone, and new Commanders owner Josh Harris is planning a $3.7 billion stadium on the old RFK Stadium site.

Washington is also an epicenter for women's soccer in the United States. The Washington Spirit played in the NWSL final for a second consecutive year last weekend, and Spirit owner Michele Kang has invested heavily in the game in the United States and Europe.

"Washington will use this platform to create safe places to play, elevate women in leadership, and ensure every girl can see herself in the game," according to the description of Washington in the bid book.

Seattle, Los Angeles, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and New York/New Jersey, all of which will hold games in 2026, are also listed as potential hosts. Mexico added Torreón to 2026 hosts Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara.

Costa Rica and Jamaica identified one host city each, San José in Costa Rica and Kingston in Jamaica.

The tournament will be held in mid-June through late July, though specific dates were not given. The bid book also did not specify which countries would host which games. Given Costa Rica and Jamaica's stadiums seat a maximum of 37,000, however, it's likely the United States would host the latter knockout-round games, including the final.

In 2026, Mexico and Canada are hosting games through the round of 16. The quarterfinals, semifinals and final are all in the United States, with the final to be played at MetLife Stadium.

Women's Soccer

The U.S. Soccer Federation, along with counterparts in Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica, has submitted 36 cities or metro areas and 50 stadiums as potential host sites for the 2031 women's World Cup.

The United States and its regional partners will almost certainly host the 2031 tournament, as they are the only (joint) bidder. Still, they are required to submit an official “bid book” and go through a formal evaluation process, concluding with a vote that will confirm them as co-hosts next year.

Ahead of a Friday deadline, U.S. Soccer submitted the bid book — and, within it, dozens of potential host cities, including 28 in the U.S., six in Mexico, and one each in Costa Rica (San José) and Jamaica (Kingston).

In some of the cities, multiple stadiums are listed — a range of NFL stadiums and soccer-specific venues, from the 92,000-seat AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, to the Kansas City Current's CPKC Stadium, the first venue purpose-built for women's professional soccer. Twenty stadiums have been submitted as a “representative sample” of the bid, which the bid book states represents the “diversity in geography, scale, and infrastructure readiness” of the tournament. A further selection of 30 stadiums have been submitted as part of the bid's broader framework “with the understanding that they will continue to be equally considered for the purposes of stadium selection in the future.”

All 11 U.S. cities set to host the 2026 men's World Cup are on the broader list, though not all stadiums are — Hard Rock Stadium near Miami is not mentioned. And three others are not on the list of 20 stadiums highlighted as the “representative sample.” Those 20, bid officials wrote, will be “subject to FIFA's formal bid evaluation and are generally representative of the bid composition in which matches could be staged across the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Jamaica.”

Among the 20 cities and stadiums, 14 are in the U.S.:

The four cities and stadiums in Mexico are:

And the cities and venues in Costa Rica and Jamaica are:

The broader list reflects the bid team's approach of retaining optionality as they and FIFA devise a strategy for the 2031 World Cup. They are unsure how many games they'll hold at large capacity, multi-deck NFL stadiums and how many they'll hold at more intimate grounds that will be easier to fill.

In some of the 14 U.S. cities above, secondary options are also listed:

The rest of the cities and stadiums included in the bid book are:

The most notable omission, like for the 2026 men's World Cup, is Chicago. Hard Rock Stadium is the lone 2026 venue not part of the 2031 bid.

The final sites will likely be determined sometime after the 2027 women's World Cup, which will take place in Brazil.

Bid officials have proposed Atlanta at the site for the World Cup draw and Dallas as host of the international broadcast center, though both decisions will ultimately be made by FIFA.

The bid book also estimates “a historic $4 billion of potential revenue,” which would be roughly eight times as much as the 2023 women's World Cup and make the 2031 edition by far the most lucrative women's World Cup ever.

Inter Miami aim to defend home turf against NYCFC, while San Diego visit Vancouver in two finely poised conference finals. GOAL's writers break down both matchups.

Right then - conference finals time. Zoom out, consider the options, and try to be objective, and maybe we were always headed here. As much as the haters wanted Inter Miami to stumble, the Lionel Messi storyline is simply too rich to ignore. San Diego FC have been good all season and fully merit their spot. Vancouver's acquisition of Thomas Muller last summer signaled their ambition - and their willingness to spend big to get here.

And then there's NYCFC. Credit to the Pigeons, who have ticked every “Cinderella story” box imaginable. If they reach the final, the feel-good narrative stays very much alive. But can anyone realistically stop Miami now? And will Vancouver's massive investment in Muller pay off with an MLS Cup final appearance?

It's all perfectly poised. GOAL U.S. writers break down two massive matches in another edition of… The Rondo.

Tom Hindle: Is it immensely offensive to NYCFC to say this might not be particularly close? Miami are too good for pretty much anyone at the moment, and if that Messi guy shows up this should really be an unfortunate formality for the Herons. A 3-1 win here.

Ryan Tolmich: If NYCFC were full strength, maybe this would be a bit closer. No disrespect to them, of course, but their injury issues aren't going to help. Miami should cruise through this as a result, giving Messi his first crack at an MLS Cup.

TH: Massive. Atlanta United is obviously the famous MLS playoff one in recent memory, but this would run it close. The Pigeons might have a shot in other circumstances, but they're without their main goalscoring threat. Pascal Jansen has them playing some good stuff, and they won't be embarrassed, but they simply don't have the quality to get it done. 

RT: Pretty damn significant. Shorthanded, on the road and against the greatest of all time? Good luck with that! Now, Miami have fallen before, and last season's loss to Atlanta was an all-time MLS upset. This, though, would probably be even crazier than that given the circumstances and stakes, even if it is a one-off game.

TH: Not even remotely. Javier Mascherano has found a winning combination with Mateo Silvetti in the XI, and it should be enough to carry Miami into the MLS Cup final. Now, if they get there, it might be a different story. But El Pistolero should be on the bench for now. 

RT: Probably not, at the moment. The club appears to have something going with the pieces around Messi, and that is almost certainly the formula for these playoffs and the next era of Miami soccer. Plus, is it the worst thing to have Suarez off the bench as a "break in case of emergency" supersub?

TH: This is a really tough one. The smart pick, though, might just be Vancouver, who beat the (other) best team in the West last weekend. Thomas Muller is a star through and through, and they're good enough at the back, too. San Diego will play some tasty stuff, but it's hard to look past Muller and Co. 

RT: Whitecaps should cruise here, right? They have momentum and, of course, quality, not to mention the superstar factor of Muller. The Whitecaps, at the moment, seem to have those "team of destiny" vibes. San Diego, too, have some of those vibes given all they've accomplished, but the Whitecaps' run still feels just a bit more real given the talent they've amassed to make it happen.

TH: Vancouver. Expansion franchises are always a wildcard, but Vancouver's ownership literally tried to sell the team at the start of the season. So, like, uhhh???

RT: San Diego, for sure. Expansion seasons are notoriously hard, even with the clean slate and abundance of resources. To get here, you have to get every single thing right, and San Diego has generally done that. Credit to them for making it this far, and if they can make it one step further, it would be a huge credit to the decision-makers at that club for putting it all together.

TH: It would absolutely have to be. St. Louis City were quality a couple of years ago, but San Diego have made it happen in the big games in the way they simply couldn't. 

RT: It absolutely would be. We've seen some good expansion seasons lately, notably St. Louis recently, but an MLS Cup final appearance would trump everything. It takes so much for a club to reach this level, and it can't all be a fluke. Because of that, San Diego would rocket right to the top of the list, if they aren't there already.

Iran among nations under restrictions issued by Trump

Snub for Washington event deemed ‘unrelated to sport'

Iran are to boycott next week's World Cup draw in Washington after the president of the country's football federation was denied a visa to enter the United States.

A spokesperson for the Iranian football federation (FFIRI) described the decision to reject the visa application as “unrelated to sport” and the move raises the prospect of Iran withdrawing from the tournament altogether.

Iran is one of 19 nations whose citizens are restricted from entering the US since a directive issued by Donald Trump in June. An exemption to the ban was granted to athletes, coaches or “persons performing a necessary support role” who were travelling for the World Cup or “other major sporting event”, but appears not to have been applied in this instance.

“We have informed Fifa that the decisions taken are unrelated to sport and that the members of the Iranian delegation will not participate in the World Cup draw,” the federation spokesperson Amir Mehdi Alavi was quoted as saying by the English language newspaper the Tehran Times.

According to the newspaper, the president of the FFIRI, Mehdi Taj, was one of three individuals denied a visa by the US state department, while four people – including the head coach, Amir Ghalenoei – were granted one. Reports in October suggested both Taj and Ghalenoei had seen their visa applications rejected, with the Tehran Times reporting that the FFIRI had taken up the issue personally with Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino.

Infantino has previously pledged that “everyone will be welcome” at the World Cup, which begins in Mexico City on 11 June. Speaking on the sidelines of an assembly of the European Football Clubs organisation on 9 October, he had sought to calm concerns that visas could be denied to athletes or officials.

“We have excellent discussions with the US government. There is a White House task force chaired by President Trump, and all these topics are discussed there,” Infantino said. “With all the relevant secretaries of state, there will be no issues with regard to visas, obviously for the participating teams and delegations, and we are working on something as well for fans. Hopefully, some good news will come out very soon.”

Fifa has since confirmed the creation of the Fifa Pass, a scheme that will allow World Cup ticket holders priority access to the visa application process before the tournament. Applications are not guaranteed to be successful, however. According to reporting in Politico, fans of Haiti – who qualified for their second World Cup last week but whose nation is also on Trump's restricted travel list – are able to submit visa applications but “may be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States”.

Fifa, the FFIRI and the US Department of State have been approached for comment.

The 2026 Fifa World Cup will be held in three countries for the first time, with Canada, Mexico and the United States sharing hosting duties

The draw for the 2026 Fifa World Cup will be held in Washington DC next week (5 December), and while supporters of teams that qualified will be anxious to know who they will play, most of the world's population will not be represented.

China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan - five of the planet's six most populous countries - have all missed out on the tournament co-hosted by the Canada, Mexico and the United States next June and July.

Indeed, of the 209 countries that started out on the journey, only 64 still have a chance of reaching the finals. And that number will be whittled down to 48 after play-offs in March determine the final line-up for football's global showpiece.

So if your country isn't at the World Cup, who should you support?

Well, everyone loves an underdog, so why not pick one of these plucky outsiders as your team for the tournament?

When is the 2026 World Cup draw?

Dick Advocaat has been the national manager of eight different countries but called qualifying with Curacao "the craziest thing I've ever achieved as a coach"

With only 155,000 inhabitants and 444 sq km of territory, Curacao is the smallest nation ever to qualify for a World Cup, in terms of both population and size.

Most of the inhabitants of the Caribbean island, located just 60km off the Venezuelan coast, could fit in the venue for the final, the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey (capacity 82,500).

Curacao boss Dick Advocaat, 78, will become the oldest coach to lead a side at a World Cup. The former Rangers and PSV boss has also been the national manager of eight different countries, but called qualifying with Curacao "the craziest thing I've ever achieved as a coach".

For a brief period until Curacao qualified, Cape Verde was the country with the second-smallest population to qualify. The small Atlantic archipelago off the coast of West Africa booked their place after beating Eswatini 3-0 last month.

Victory meant the Blue Sharks secured top spot in their group and a place at the 2026 tournament ahead of continental heavyweights Cameroon.

The national team has relied heavily on members of the diaspora to improve its footballing fortunes over recent years. Centre-back Roberto "Pico" Lopes – who was born and plays in Ireland – got his first call-up via an approach on business networking website LinkedIn.

"We're all over the world. It's great what we can achieve when we're together," he told the BBC's Destination New Jersey podcast.

Uzbekistan have qualified for a World Cup for the first time

Uzbekistan put itself on the footballing map in 2008 when club side Bunyodkor announced the signing of top Brazilian forward Rivaldo, with fellow countryman and superstar Zico as manager.

Both stayed only briefly but football's development there has been longer lasting. Uzbekistan have put in consistent performances in the Asian Cup, reaching the semi-finals in 2011 and the quarter-finals in 2023.

Having narrowly missed out before, the White Wolves will make their debut next year under the guidance of former Italy centre-back and 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro.

Jordan fans have known they will be going to the finals since June, when they clinched qualification with a 3-0 away win in Oman.

The team's Moroccan coach, Jamal Sellami, dedicated the achievement to "all the people who believed in us" and praised the years of hard work from players and the Jordan Football Association.

Their recent progress has been notable, reaching the final of the 2023 Asian Cup after taking out Jurgen Klinsmann's South Korea in the semi-final before losing to hosts Qatar.

The last time Haiti reached the World Cup, in 1974, they failed to win any of their group matches

Haiti's coach, 52-year-old Frenchman Sebastien Migne, has never even visited the country.

He has been unable to set foot there since being appointed 18 months ago because of the continuing conflict afflicting the Caribbean nation. Nearly 1.3 million people have been internally displaced by the gang-related violence, which kills thousands each year.

But that has not stopped Migne from guiding Haiti to the finals for the first time since 1974.

They will be hoping to improve on that performance, which saw them fail to win any of their three group games, in which they conceded 14 goals including a 7-0 defeat to Poland.

"My players will be wonderful ambassadors for a country that sorely needs them," Migne told the AFP news agency. "Haiti is not an easy place, with a people who are suffering and don't have many opportunities to celebrate."

The Democratic Republic of Congo are one win away from returning to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1974, when they competed as Zaire

Another country suffering devastating internal conflict could also reach the finals – the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The mineral-rich east of the country has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years and the death toll is thought to number in the millions.

It is a nation in need of a good news story and the Leopards hope to offer just that.

The Central Africans upset Cameroon and Nigeria in continental play-offs this month to put themselves one win away from returning to the finals for the first time since 1974, when they competed as Zaire.

They will face either Jamaica or New Caledonia in a winner-takes-all encounter in March's intercontinental play-offs.

"It's a good draw, because on paper we are the stronger side," former captain Gabriel Zakuani told BBC Sport Africa.

Iraq is another team hoping to qualify via those play-offs - and another country with a recent history of conflict and sectarian strife.

A contentious 2-1 win at home against the United Arab Emirates, decided by a dramatic penalty in the 17th minute of added time, sparked jubilation on the pitch and in the stands of Basra International Stadium.

Iraq's only previous appearance at a World Cup was a group-stage exit in Mexico 39 years ago.

New Caledonia, with a population of just over 250,000, has also made it through to the intercontinental play-offs for the first time. They will need to beat both Jamaica and DR Congo.

Earlier in qualifying, they knocked out fellow Pacific islanders Tahiti. Separated by more than 4,600km of ocean, this "local rivalry" is one of the most distant in sport.

Finally, Suriname are the lowest-ranked team still in with a chance. Currently 123rd in Fifa's world rankings, they must get past Bolivia and the aforementioned Iraq.

Suriname's players didn't even celebrate the last-minute goal that took the smallest country in South America through to the play-offs, as it initially seemed other results would put them out.

The 2026 World Cup is going to look very different to its 22 predecessors, with its largest line-up yet.

Critics say it could lead to mismatches and less competition, while others point to the glorious upsets and nerve-wracking drama that a growing tournament has generated since the original competition in 1930, which featured only 13 teams.

It seems likely Fifa will continue to expand its scale and ambition, with the event's organisers already discussing a proposal for 64 teams to compete in the 2030 finals.

				Officials in Tehran are urging football chief Gianni Infantino to step in.			

AI generated Text-to-speech

Iranian Football Federation officials will not attend next Friday's World Cup draw in Washington, D.C. after accusing the U.S. of refusing to grant visas to several members of its delegation.

“We have informed FIFA that the decisions taken have nothing to do with sports, and the members of the Iranian delegation will not participate in the World Cup draw,” the federation's spokesperson told state television, according to a report by Qatar-based Al Jazeera.

Iranian officials are now seeking help from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has cozied up to U.S. President Donald Trump in a bid to ensure the 2026 Men's World Cup in North America goes smoothly.

FIFA, the world football governing body, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

Infantino met with Trump this month to discuss a faster visa interview process for foreign World Cup spectators, calling it the “FIFA Pass,” as the U.S. maintains a tough posture on gaining entry to the country for many foreigners.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently emphasized that match tickets were not automatically a grant for a tourist visa. Last week, the Trump administration announced that fans from Haiti, which qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1974, will not be granted any special exceptions to follow their team.

Iran qualified for the 2026 World Cup after a win over Pakistan in March. It is the country's fourth consecutive World Cup. In its last appearance in Qatar in 2022, Iran lost 1-0 to the U.S. in a tight game.

Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca has issued an injury update on star player Cole Palmer ahead of their top-of-the-table clash with Arsenal. The England international has had an injury-hit season so far, with the playmaker missing a big chunk of the season from a persistent groin issue. Most recently, he has been sidelined with a fractured toe but Palmer is now on the cusp of being back fit for the Blues.

Chelsea fans were chomping at the bit to see what Palmer could do this season, especially after starring in their Club World Cup final win over Paris Saint-Germain this summer. But a groin problem has limited him to just four appearances in all competitions this term, and just when he looked like he would be fit and ready again, he fractured his toe. In late September, Maresca admitted he was wary of rushing the 23-year-old back to action.

"We need to protect Cole for sure, 100%. Not only Cole in my personal view because as I said now because of the Club World Cup or because we never stop, we need to manage and protect different players," the Italian said at the time." The solution with Cole, I don't know, now we have a meeting with the medical staff and we decide the best solution for him. But it's also a kind of injury that is not like black and white. It's an injury that someday you can be better. It's not that you have pain and tomorrow disappear. Sometimes you can be better, sometimes you can be worse. That's why we need to manage day by day."

But sure enough, he had to be withdrawn early from their defeat at Manchester United just over a month ago due to this same injury.

The former Manchester City man did not feature in Chelsea's 3-0 thrashing of Barcelona in the Champions League in midweek, with Maresca trying not to get Blues fans' hopes up about him before the contest.

"Yes, Cole is wearing a [protective] boot. We don't know when he will be back but for sure it will be soon. He's already on the pitch, he's already touching the ball, and the feeling [for him] is good," said the ex-Leicester City boss. "At the moment, we are only looking at tomorrow's game. It's a Champions League game against Barcelona, that is our focus, and then we will look ahead to Arsenal. I don't think he will be available for these two games, but he is doing well."

But on Friday, he confirmed Palmer is ready to face Arsenal.

He told reporters: "He is available for both [to start and to play]. [His return will elevate the squad] A lot. As you said, he's probably our best player. We are happy he is back. We need to give him time to make sure he's 100 per cent fit. He has done fantastically in the past, and there is no doubt he will do fantastically in the future."

Arsenal are on a roll right now. They are six points clear at the top of the Premier League, have outclassed Europe's most in-form team in Bayern Munich, and are the side to beat right now. That, and more, is why Maresca is very respectful of their upcoming opponents.

He said, via Football London: "They defend fantastically. Any team struggles to score goals against them, even to create chances. They have weapons when they attack. They are top in the Champions League and top in the Premier League. It's another big game. We finished the Barcelona one, and we won, it's a good feeling. If it's bigger than the last one, I don't know. For me, they are all important games. For sure, beating Barcelona and if we are able to beat Arsenal, it's a nice feeling, it's three points. We try to defend in the best way we can. They score goals in set-pieces against every team. They score goals against any team, they have a system in place that works very well and we will try to do our best to prepare in the best way."

It remains to be seen if Chelsea will play Palmer from the start against Arsenal, or if he will be brought off the bench. A win would take the Blues to within three points of Mikel Arteta's side, massively boosting their own title chances. But a defeat on their own patch would make the Gunners even stronger favourites to finally win their first league title since 2004. After this contest, Chelsea travel to lowly Leeds United on December 3, followed by a trip to Bournemouth three days later.

Niko Kovac has given his backing to Aaron Anselmino amid the defender's struggles for regular playing time after he recovered from a muscle injury that hindered his start following a loan move from Chelsea. The Argentine has started four matches for the German side, sparking suggestions he could end up being recalled to Stamford Bridge.

When Dortmund lost defenders to injury in August, the club moved quickly to bring in Anselmino on a season-long loan from Chelsea. The expectation with the Argentine's signing wasn't much but to provide cover, learn, and offer rotation. Few predicted how quickly he'd stake a claim.

Anselmino debuted just days after arriving and immediately impressed with calm ball control and intelligent positioning. His early displays earned praise inside the club and across the Bundesliga, prompting supporters and pundits to ask whether a loanee originally considered short-term cover should now be an automatic starter. That debate intensified after he recovered from a brief muscle knock. Some wanted him protected; others saw a player ready to take on more minutes.

Kovac has navigated that tension carefully. Praising the youngster publicly while managing his workload behind the scenes. The young defender now starts regularly, but his exact minutes remain a talking point as Kovac balances his team selection ahead of crucial fixtures.

During the press-conference ahead of the Bayer Leverkusen clash, Kovac left no doubt about his view of Anselmino.

"Aaron is doing really well. You can rely on the young man from the first minute to the last," he said. "A great lad, a great defender. He doesn't let anything slip. Everything is settled with Chelsea. I expect him to remain our player until the end of the season. He's getting the minutes he wasn't getting at Chelsea."

A key element in that plan is the loan arrangement with Chelsea with all parties having agreed the move would last through the season, giving Anselmino time to settle and the club certainty about his availability.

Anselmino's breakthrough is valuable precisely because Dortmund's defensive picture is unsettled. Nico Schlotterbeck remains under contract until 2027 but has stalled on signing an extension; Bayern and Liverpool have been linked, and internal offers, including significant pay rises and captaincy promises, have not yet convinced him to stay. Kovac acknowledged the limits of his influence: “I don't know to what extent I can influence things there – other than showing him appreciation. I do that every single day,” he said.

That impasse matters. If Schlotterbeck departs or his focus wavers, Dortmund will rapidly move from the luxury of rotation to the pressure of replacement. The club's short-term defensive depth is therefore contingent on two variables: Anselmino's fitness and readiness to step up, and a timely decision from Schlotterbeck. Sporting director signals that they want clarity as soon as possible.

Kovac now faces three choices he must juggle in real time. First, manage Anselmino's workload so the loanee can grow into a leading role without injury setbacks. Second, push for clarity on Schlotterbeck's contract extension that would stabilise the back line and allow continued rotation. Third, prepare tactical contingency allotting more minutes for Anselmino in a two-man centre-back pairing, temporary shifts to a back three, or prioritising a defensive signing in January if Schlotterbeck looks likely to leave.

Dortmund will next face Leverkusen in the league before clashing with the same opponents in DFB Pokal's round of 16 on December 2.

Real Madrid legend Sergio Ramos is reportedly poised to leave Mexican club Monterrey and return to European football, driven by a desire to represent Spain at the 2026 World Cup. The 39-year-old defender has decided against renewing his contract with Rayados, which is nearing its expiry, hoping to bow out with a Liga MX title.

Ramos's decision to depart Mexico stems from two primary factors: a preference for family life in Europe compared to Mexico, and a lingering ambition to play for the Spanish national team again. The El Chiringuito states that Ramos believes consistent playing time in a top-level European competition brings him closer to the style of play preferred by Spain coach Luis de la Fuente, thereby increasing his chances of a recall.

Despite turning 40 next March, just months before the World Cup in North America, Ramos has not given up on adding to his record 180 caps for La Roja. He last played for his country in March 2021 and was subsequently omitted from the squads for Euro 2020, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and Euro 2024 by former coach Luis Enrique and current boss De la Fuente respectively.

A report from AS draws a parallel with Aymeric Laporte, who left Saudi Arabia to return to Europe with Athletic Club, a move that bolstered his standing with the national team. Ramos hopes a similar path will convince De la Fuente that he can still contribute at the highest international level.

Ramos joined Monterrey on a one-year deal in 2025 and has made his mark during his brief time in Liga MX. He featured in the Club World Cup for the Mexican side, where he became the oldest goalscorer in the tournament's history. His time there also saw him receive the 30th red card of his illustrious career, further cementing his reputation as a fierce, if sometimes ill-disciplined, competitor.

Beyond his on-field contributions, where he provided defensive solidity for one of Mexico's biggest clubs, Ramos's presence brought significant commercial and media impact to Monterrey. However, with his contract running down, his departure now seems inevitable as he seeks a new challenge closer to home for the second half of the season.

While a return to La Liga remains a possibility, it is considered difficult to imagine Ramos playing for any Spanish clubs other than his former teams, Real Madrid and Sevilla. Consequently, several other European options are reportedly being explored.

Reports suggest that Roma, Bayer Leverkusen and Marseille are among the clubs that could offer Ramos a route back into European football. Roma are currently mounting a surprising title challenge in Serie A under Gian Piero Gasperini and boast the league's meanest defence. Ramos's vast experience and leadership could prove invaluable to their relatively young backline during the title run-in.

Bayer Leverkusen, meanwhile, are recovering from a poor start to their Bundesliga campaign. Following a managerial change, they are looking to close the eight-point gap to leaders Bayern Munich. Having lost several key players in the summer, Ramos is viewed as a potential stopgap signing who could provide direction and stability.

In Ligue 1, Marseille are enjoying an excellent season under Roberto De Zerbi, sitting just two points behind leaders Paris Saint-Germain. Given Ramos's history with PSG, his arrival at their arch-rivals would add significant intrigue to the title race. His experience in high-pressure situations could help Marseille sustain their pursuit of a first league title in years.

Ramos will now focus on finalising his departure from Monterrey as his contract winds down. His representatives will be aiming to secure a move to a European club in the upcoming January transfer window, ensuring he is playing regularly at a high level in the lead-up to the 2026 World Cup. His performance in the second half of the European season will be crucial in determining whether his dream of a final international recall can become a reality.

Aitana Bonmati is preparing to lead Spain into another major final but insists her historic third Ballon d'Or does not change who she is. The Barcelona Femini midfielder addressed talk of being labelled the Lionel Messi of women's football, spoke about expectations ahead of the Nations League showdown with Germany, and reflected on how she handles success on and off the pitch.

Bonmati heads into the Nations League final as the heartbeat of both Barcelona and Spain, once again carrying her side into another major showdown. The reigning world champions face Germany over two legs, beginning in Stuttgart on Friday before returning to the Wanda Metropolitano Stadium in Madrid, where more than 70,000 fans are expected. The 27-year-old's consistency has been extraordinary. From Euro 2016 to the 2023 World Cup, from multiple Champions League finals to a perfect season last year, Bonmati has risen to every occasion. Her performance against Germany in the Euro semi-final remains one of the defining moments of Spain's modern era.

Despite her meteoric rise, the Barca midfielder remains grounded. Asked how she feels returning to yet another decisive stage with Spain, she emphasised how the team cannot afford to take anything for granted. "It seems normal, but we're in another final. It can't be taken for granted. I'm so grateful for what's happening to me and what we're all experiencing. We've reached the finals in every championship we've played in. The road isn't easy, and we have to appreciate it. You win or you lose, but that's not all there is to it, because getting here is incredibly difficult."

Bonmati was also asked about Spain's mindset heading into the first leg against Germany, and she made their intentions clear and said: "It's clear: since we're here, we have to go all out and win. We want this Nations League title. It's true that it's an unusual final, because it's played over two legs. That's why the idea is to approach each leg as if it were a single match. If you try to play it safe, it could backfire."

Although Bonmati has now won three consecutive Ballon d'Or Feminin awards, she continues to reject comparisons to Barcelona and Argentina icon. With her dominance at club and international level, the parallels are understandable but she insists she is following her own path.

When asked by AS about comparisons to Messi, she responded calmly: "No, no. I don't compare myself to Messi; he's on another level. I'm following my own path. The Ballon d'Or awards don't change me. I'm still the same person, with the same personality. I still enjoy the same things that make me happy and I'm surrounded by the same people who make me feel like myself. Nothing changes me, and I think that's a very positive thing."

Bonmati also lifted the curtain on what it was like attending the Chatelet Theatre ceremony in Paris, especially in such elite company. "This year, to be honest, I went in with very low expectations. I believe that the higher your expectations, the harder it can be if you don't win. It was a surprise. You look around and see the incredibly high level of competition. I understand that everyone experiences it in their own way. It's a very special day, surrounded by the best in football. I feel that the most important thing is to enjoy it. To experience it with your loved ones."

The Barca midfielder's achievements are redefining what consistency looks like at the highest level of women's football. Her Champions League masterclasses, especially against Chelsea and Wolfsburg laid the foundation for her latest Ballon d'Or. Her landmark displays for La Roja, including the semi-final performance against Germany, only strengthened her case.

She has now won three Ballons d'Or in a row, been Player of the Match in a World Cup final, dominated the Champions League with three titles, starred in multiple European campaigns, and collected 22 domestic trophies with Barcelona. Even if she walked away tomorrow, her place among the all-time greats would be secure.

And yet, she still hasn't reached what many consider a midfielder's peak years. At 27, her evolution continues - playmaking, leadership, spatial intelligence, defensive discipline. With Spain and Barca still competing for every major title, her influence is only deepening.

Spain's immediate focus is the two-legged Nations League final, where Bonmati will once again be central to their tactical approach. After that, the long-term question inevitably returns: will she spend her entire career at Barcelona?

The midfielder addressed that speculation with honesty, stressing both her loyalty and her openness to the future. "Right now, I have a contract with Barcelona, I've been here for 14 years, and it's a club I love, a club I feel connected to," she said. "But I'm not closing the door on anything. It all depends on how you feel personally, emotionally, and in terms of motivation. Never say never. I have a contract, and my intention isn't to leave."

Manchester United have released concept images of their proposed new stadium

Manchester United's proposed new Old Trafford stadium is included in the UK's bid to host the 2035 Women's World Cup. 

Old Trafford was not considered for the 2028 men's European Championship and its redevelopment is still in the planning stages.

England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland's joint bid stands unopposed and could be ratified by a vote in a Fifa congress in 2026. 

If redevelopment plans do not go ahead, Old Trafford will still be considered in its current form. 

In total the 21 other stadiums set to feature include Birmingham City's planned new stadium and Wembley - which is likely to host the final.

Should the UK's bid be confirmed, the 2035 tournament will be the second time a World Cup has been held in the home nations after the 1966 men's tournament in England.

In total, 22 stadiums were listed in Friday's announcement - 16 in England, three in Wales, two in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland.

From 2031, the Women's World Cup will be contested between 48 teams - in line with the men's format - and require 15 stadiums. The tournament would involve 104 matches contested by the 48 teams over 39 days.

A joint statement from the CEOs of The FA, Irish FA, Scottish FA and FA of Wales said: "A Women's World Cup in the UK has the power to turbo charge the women's and girls' game both in the UK and globally.

"Our bid also demonstrates our commitment to leaving a lasting legacy, in the run up to 2035, and the years afterwards."

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: "The Lionesses' success has inspired girls across our country, and we'll build on that momentum by welcoming millions of football fans from around the world to a tournament that will benefit communities and businesses in host cities up and down the UK."

Scotland head coach Melissa Andreatta said: "The impact of bringing the World Cup to our nation would be felt for decades, driving participation, investment and equality at every level of the sport."

England head coach Sarina Wiegman added: "It's so much more than football, I think. It will boost the women's game but it will boost women in society and, as we have seen, it will bring the country together."

Wiegman on UK's bid to host 2035 Women's World Cup

The bid submission includes "Old Trafford in its current form" as proposals for a new 100,000-capacity stadium were not deemed sufficiently detailed for Fifa evaluation.

United announced plans for a revamped stadium in March and hope it will be completed in five years - although further progress has not yet been made.

Meanwhile, Birmingham City unveiled plans for their 62,000-seater Powerhouse Stadium in November, with a completion date set for the start of the 2030-2031 season.

Stok Cae Ras in Wrexham does not currently meet Fifa requirements, although there is planned redevelopment work which would make it eligible once completed.

Stamford Bridge also does not meet Fifa standards, so whether or not a Chelsea stadium can be considered for the tournament will depend on the outcome of a consultation on a new home which is under way.

The UK and Republic of Ireland's joint bid to host Euro 2028 included Casement Park and Hill Dickinson Stadium, which were both unbuilt at the time of submission. 

Casement Park will not be finished in time for the tournament, while Hill Dickinson Stadium has been selected as one of nine host grounds.

Wrexham's Cae Ras to form part of UK World Cup bid

Quite a few cities are going to be left disappointed. Fifa's bid document for the Women's World Cup requires a country to submit a minimum of 14 grounds, and there's 22 on this list.

It is going to be a long time - probably at least five years - until a decision is made. That is why the likes of the Sports Quarter Stadium and Old Trafford, on which construction work is planned but not close to starting, have been included.

Fifa will hold on-site visits in February, before the publication of an evaluation report in March and a potential host vote on 30 April at the governing body's congress. The UK bid is the only one on the table, so that would appear to be a formality, but the venues will not be set in stone at this point.

There is no specific deadline, and it is possible the list of stadiums could change over time. For instance, for the men's World Cup next year Vancouver pulled out in 2021, and was then added back in as a candidate city in April 2022, and selected in the final announcement in June of that year.

For the Women's World Cup, the final host cities have generally been announced much later - two years before the 2023 and 2027 events, compared to four years for the 2026 men's finals.  

But with so many more grounds needed (Brazil 2027 is only using eight) for an expanded 48-team tournament, you would think venue selection will come earlier.

The final decision will rest with Fifa but it is likely to be 2031 before we find out.

Over the past weeks, the world's elite under-17 national teams have been battling through the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Qatar, a tournament that has felt unusually abundant in individual talent.

Portugal were ultimately crowned champions, beating Austria 1-0 in a final few predicted when the groups were drawn. With an estimated 100 club scouts in attendance representing Europe's biggest academies and recruitment departments, this edition has effectively doubled as a live showcase for the game's next wave of talent.

Amid a field full of sharp technicians, prolific goal-scorers and tactically advanced midfielders, a handful have stood out for their consistency, match-changing ability and maturity beyond their age group. Here's a look at a selection of the eight most eye-catching 17-year-old stars in the making.

Arguably the No. 1 breakout attacker of the tournament, Moser led Austria to the final with a combination of instinctive finishing, brilliant off-the-ball movement and composure from the penalty spot (scoring three, including one Panenka). A product of Salzburg's academy -- with minutes at their feeder side Liefering as an introduction to senior football in Austria's second tier -- he plays as an attacking midfielder/winger who drifts inside (usually from the left) to attack the box. Moser ended as the tournament's top scorer , and his eight goals in Qatar have represented a diverse mix of what he offers: composed one-touch finishes from tight angles, a driven strike from distance, a strike with his weaker left foot from inside the box and several smartly timed surges into the penalty area. Beyond the scoring, he's vivacious, plays smart combinations and has an excellent work rate. For a teenager, however, it's his composure in final-third moments which stands out as a defining trait.

Cabral has been Portugal's reliable focal point up front, combining power with tidy left-footed finishes and headers. A Benfica academy centre-forward who has yet to debut for the first team, or even their B side, he's used this tournament to show he may eventually become Portugal's next senior No. 9. Cabral's seven goals in Qatar -- including the winner in the final -- have mainly come from smart movement and opportunism. There have been sharp diagonal runs across defenders, pulling away from markers in the box and crisp finishes, capitalising on poor defending and first-time strikes on his favoured left foot. He links play with nice, simple touches and gives Portugal a platform to start attacks without overcomplicating the attacks. Cabral's physical strength, high running power and good general technique already make him an early target for foreign clubs.

England's standout performer at the U-17 World Cup, even as the team exited with a shock 4-0 defeat to Austria in the round of 16. Operating as a right-footed inverted winger off the left, he's repeatedly showed off his excellent first touch, explosive acceleration and technically clean shooting skills. Heskey's four goals in Qatar were all impressive -- a brave near-post header, a low strike across the goalkeeper after timing a run between full-back and centre-back, a calm finish between the goalkeeper's legs and an equally composed finish after a 40-meter breakaway run. The son of former Liverpool and England forward Emile Heskey also links well on the move, often receiving on the half-turn to pass diagonally into space (nine key passes in the tournament, the highest) and his top speed is highly impressive. Even in the heavy loss to Austria, he remained England's most consistent attacking threat.

Technically gifted and blessed with a sublime touch, Dembélé delivered a brilliant tournament as a creative attacking mastermind. Operating as a No. 10 or an inverted winger from the right, left-footed Dembélé pulled the playmaking strings in midfield with a low-centre-of-gravity dribbling style, sharp footwork, quick direction changes and a mid-distance strike that caught goalkeepers by surprise. He opened Mali's tournament with a composed goal in the 17th minute against New Zealand, finishing a rapid counter-attack with a left-footed shot. From advanced midfield positions he plays between the lines, picking out runners with deft touches and exploiting half-spaces to accelerate tempo. His ball retention under pressure and sharp vision in tight zones are other highlights, a proper attacking orchestrator who registered seven key passes from the five games he played.

The Benfica full-back has been one of Portugal's defining figures in Qatar. At 184cm (6 feet) in height he can also slot in at centre-back and his solid physique allows him to set off on long, powerful strides and an assertive left foot for crosses and switches. A disciplined, well-schooled defender, capable of holding his own physically while offering reliable attacking output by way of strong stamina and fine ball-carrying. In this tournament he has also added proper end-product in the shape of a brace and two assists in the 6-0 win over Morocco, plus a further two against Switzerland and New Caledonia -- three of which were excellent left-footed strikes from the edge of the box, plus one header. Neto often arrives late at the back post, times unbalancing underlapping runs well and is excellent in both phases of the game. His combination of size, athleticism and technical tidiness suggests that he might soon be ripe for first-team football.

The main point of reference of Italy's attack in Qatar, Inácio is a second striker/No. 10 who constantly looks to engage the opposing the back line. Technically neat on his first touch, industrious and comfortable receiving between the lines, he often links play before accelerating through gaps with repeated, powerful carries. Across the tournament he recorded 39 progressive runs -- by far the highest figure of any player (the next best managed 25) -- which underlines how often Italy relied on him to break lines and pressure to advance with the ball. While his finishing is tidy rather than spectacular, his quick, low efforts struck early proved to catch goalkeepers unaware. The only blemish came with his red card in the semifinal loss to Austria after already being substituted, a disappointing ending to an otherwise outstanding tournament performance.

Perhaps not the most naturally talented member of a somewhat underwhelming Brazil side, Dell relies on sharp movement, constant activity around the box, industry and a razor-sharp, efficient finishing technique. In Qatar he found the net five times, mainly thanks to close-range taps-ins from crosses or cut-backs, highlighting his outstanding sense of opportunism. Dell is excellent at pulling away from the markers with short, explosive bursts and reads defensive hesitation and imbalances well. Though not one to repeatedly beat opponent with take-ons, his anticipation, relentless pressing, intensity and box intelligence has drawn reported interest from Manchester City.

The architect of the Portugal midfield, Quintas has left a solid mark on the team by setting the tempo and keeping the game fluid as an unusually composed deep-laying midfielder. The Benfica academy player often plays as a lone No.6 as he anchors possession with quick, vertical passes and a reliable first touch that allows Portugal to escape pressure. Out of possession, the Portugal captain reads danger early, blocks passing lanes, relying on positional awareness and body orientation rather than risky tackles. Quintas also contributes well attacking-wise with late supporting runs, smart diagonals to switch play and the occasional disguised pass to find wingers in the half-spaces. Always measured, Quintas is fundamental to Portugal's rhythm.

The World Cup draw can determine a nation's confidence ahead of football's showpiece event.

On Friday, December 5, at 12pm ET (9am PT; 5pm GMT), the draw for next summer's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico takes place from the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C., with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to be in attendance.

With the tournament starting on June 11 and the draw being 188 days removed from the opening match, things will start to feel very real for the countries already sure of their places.

A special shoutout to those fans who bought tickets during early lotteries without knowing the teams involved. Good luck to them as they find out what fixtures they have tickets for. The match schedule, including kick-off times and venues, will be revealed the day after the draw, Saturday, December 6, FIFA confirmed.

Here's what you can expect from the 2026 World Cup draw.

The draw will be live on FIFA.com and on FIFA's YouTube channel. In the United Kingdom, it will be broadcast on the BBC and BBC iPlayer, while in the U.S., viewers can tune into Fox and Fubo.

The 48 competing countries will be split into 12 groups of four for the group stages.

Before the draw, teams will be seeded and divided into four pots based on their FIFA rankings as of November/December 2025. The three host countries will join the highest-ranked FIFA teams in Pot 1.

Teams will be randomly drawn from each pot and assigned to one of the 12 groups. However, teams from the same confederation cannot meet — except for UEFA. There can be up to two European teams per group.

With the first game of the 2026 World Cup taking place at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, Mexico have automatically been assigned to Group A.

Canada will play the second match in Toronto, so they are in Group B. The U.S., who are playing the third match in Los Angeles, will be in Group D. These are the only two games on June 12.

The highest-ranked team (Spain) and the second-highest-ranked team (Argentina), as well as the third-highest-ranked team (France) and the fourth-highest-ranked team (England), will be positioned into groups in opposite pathways. This means the two highest-ranked nations cannot meet until the final, should they win their group, but they could face the third or fourth best-ranked teams in the semi-final.

It is worth noting that as the World Cup has expanded from 32 teams to 48, eight of the 12 best third-place teams in the groups will advance to the new round of 32. The eight teams with the highest points total will progress, with goal difference and then goals scored determining the qualifiers, should a number of teams finish on the same points total.

Holders Argentina are in Pot 1, along with England, the U.S. and the world's top-ranked team, Spain. As the graphic below shows, there are plenty of countries in the other pots that could cause the top teams problems, such as Erling Haaland's Norway and Mohamed Salah's Egypt in Pot 3.





At the time of the draw, there will still be six spaces at the World Cup yet to be determined.

During March, a further four teams will qualify from the UEFA play-off qualifiers and two from the FIFA Confederation play-off qualifiers.

Sixteen teams are in UEFA's play-offs, with four-time winners Italy needing to overcome Northern Ireland and then Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina to reach next year's tournament.



Jamaica face New Caledonia in the Confederation play-off semi-finals, with the victors facing the seeded Congo DR for a place in North America. On the other side of the draw, Bolivia take on Suriname for the chance to meet Iraq in the other final.

All qualifiers will be placed into pot four, leading to some potentially tricky draws, such as four-time winners Italy, were they to progress.

Four nations have qualified for their first World Cup. They are Uzbekistan (Pot 3) and Jordan, Cape Verde and Curacao (Pot 4).

The Caribbean island of Curacao, a nation of 185,000 people, became the smallest nation to ever qualify for a World Cup after they progressed thanks to a goalless draw against Jamaica in Kingston.

But Curacao aren't the lowest-ranked team in the draw. New Zealand are 86th in FIFA's world rankings — four places below Curacao (82) and two below Haiti (84).

Haiti, DR Congo and Panama, have qualified before, but are still looking for their first World Cup victories.

This time around, with eight of the third-place teams progressing, it may only take one win to reach the knockout stages.

Many fans will likely be hoping their team is drawn against one of the three host nations from Pot 1 to avoid the nine highest-rated FIFA nations. Although the UWMNT's 5-1 thumping of Uruguay in Florida earlier this month suggests Mauricio Pochettino's men will be difficult to beat on home soil.

Currently ranked 27th in the world, the Canadians are the lowest-ranked in Pot 1 and the team most opposition fans will be confident of taking on.

From the top-ranked nations in Pot 1, Germany have been knocked out of the group stages at the last two World Cups, although they reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024.

Based on form and recent World Cup history, the most formidable opponents are likely to be holders Argentina and 2022 finalists France. World No 2 Argentina finished top of CONMEBOL qualifying, while France didn't lose a game during their qualifying campaign.

Spain are European champions and the world's No 1 team who boast Barcelona star Lamine Yamal in their ranks. No one will want to be drawn against one of the favourites to win the competition.

And then there's England, who qualified with a 100 per cent record. Norway did, too, but England did not concede a single goal in their eight qualifying matches.

The new FIFA Peace Prize will have its first winner, awarded by FIFA president Gianni Infantino on the day of the draw.

“In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” Infantino said in a FIFA statement, adding that the prize would “recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations”.

It is not yet known who the recipient will be, but as The Athletic's Adam Crafton reported earlier this month, FIFA's description “fits the framing of Trump that he and his allies wish the world to know, as well as the ‘President of Peace' moniker he has bestowed upon himself”.

As well as the group draw and FIFA Peace Prize, the event usually entails speeches and musical performances.

The draw for the 1994 World Cup, the last time the tournament was held in the U.S., took place in the Las Vegas Convention Center and included performances by Rod Stewart, Stevie Wonder and James Brown.

No musicians have yet been confirmed, but Colombian artist J Balvin performed during half-time of the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey this summer.

Cup Countdown

The World Cup draw can determine a nation's confidence ahead of football's showpiece event.

On Friday, December 5, at 12pm ET (9am PT; 5pm GMT), the draw for next summer's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico takes place from the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C., with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to be in attendance.

With the tournament starting on June 11 and the draw being 188 days removed from the opening match, things will start to feel very real for the countries already sure of their places.

A special shoutout to those fans who bought tickets during early lotteries without knowing the teams involved. Good luck to them as they find out what fixtures they have tickets for. The match schedule, including kick-off times and venues, will be revealed the day after the draw, Saturday, December 6, FIFA confirmed.

Here's what you can expect from the 2026 World Cup draw.

The draw will be live on FIFA.com and on FIFA's YouTube channel. In the United Kingdom, it will be broadcast on the BBC and BBC iPlayer, while in the U.S., viewers can tune into Fox and Fubo.

The 48 competing countries will be split into 12 groups of four for the group stages.

Before the draw, teams will be seeded and divided into four pots based on their FIFA rankings as of November/December 2025. The three host countries will join the highest-ranked FIFA teams in Pot 1.

Teams will be randomly drawn from each pot and assigned to one of the 12 groups. However, teams from the same confederation cannot meet — except for UEFA. There can be up to two European teams per group.

With the first game of the 2026 World Cup taking place at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, Mexico have automatically been assigned to Group A.

Canada will play the second match in Toronto, so they are in Group B. The U.S., who are playing the third match in Los Angeles, will be in Group D. These are the only two games on June 12.

The highest-ranked team (Spain) and the second-highest-ranked team (Argentina), as well as the third-highest-ranked team (France) and the fourth-highest-ranked team (England), will be positioned into groups in opposite pathways. This means the two highest-ranked nations cannot meet until the final, should they win their group, but they could face the third or fourth best-ranked teams in the semi-final.

It is worth noting that as the World Cup has expanded from 32 teams to 48, eight of the 12 best third-place teams in the groups will advance to the new round of 32. The eight teams with the highest points total will progress, with goal difference and then goals scored determining the qualifiers, should a number of teams finish on the same points total.

Holders Argentina are in Pot 1, along with England, the U.S. and the world's top-ranked team, Spain. As the graphic below shows, there are plenty of countries in the other pots that could cause the top teams problems, such as Erling Haaland's Norway and Mohamed Salah's Egypt in Pot 3.





At the time of the draw, there will still be six spaces at the World Cup yet to be determined.

During March, a further four teams will qualify from the UEFA play-off qualifiers and two from the FIFA Confederation play-off qualifiers.

Sixteen teams are in UEFA's play-offs, with four-time winners Italy needing to overcome Northern Ireland and then Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina to reach next year's tournament.



Jamaica face New Caledonia in the Confederation play-off semi-finals, with the victors facing the seeded Congo DR for a place in North America. On the other side of the draw, Bolivia take on Suriname for the chance to meet Iraq in the other final.

All qualifiers will be placed into pot four, leading to some potentially tricky draws, such as four-time winners Italy, were they to progress.

Four nations have qualified for their first World Cup. They are Uzbekistan (Pot 3) and Jordan, Cape Verde and Curacao (Pot 4).

The Caribbean island of Curacao, a nation of 185,000 people, became the smallest nation to ever qualify for a World Cup after they progressed thanks to a goalless draw against Jamaica in Kingston.

But Curacao aren't the lowest-ranked team in the draw. New Zealand are 86th in FIFA's world rankings — four places below Curacao (82) and two below Haiti (84).

Haiti, DR Congo and Panama, have qualified before, but are still looking for their first World Cup victories.

This time around, with eight of the third-place teams progressing, it may only take one win to reach the knockout stages.

Many fans will likely be hoping their team is drawn against one of the three host nations from Pot 1 to avoid the nine highest-rated FIFA nations. Although the UWMNT's 5-1 thumping of Uruguay in Florida earlier this month suggests Mauricio Pochettino's men will be difficult to beat on home soil.

Currently ranked 27th in the world, the Canadians are the lowest-ranked in Pot 1 and the team most opposition fans will be confident of taking on.

From the top-ranked nations in Pot 1, Germany have been knocked out of the group stages at the last two World Cups, although they reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2024.

Based on form and recent World Cup history, the most formidable opponents are likely to be holders Argentina and 2022 finalists France. World No 2 Argentina finished top of CONMEBOL qualifying, while France didn't lose a game during their qualifying campaign.

Spain are European champions and the world's No 1 team who boast Barcelona star Lamine Yamal in their ranks. No one will want to be drawn against one of the favourites to win the competition.

And then there's England, who qualified with a 100 per cent record. Norway did, too, but England did not concede a single goal in their eight qualifying matches.

The new FIFA Peace Prize will have its first winner, awarded by FIFA president Gianni Infantino on the day of the draw.

“In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” Infantino said in a FIFA statement, adding that the prize would “recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations”.

It is not yet known who the recipient will be, but as The Athletic's Adam Crafton reported earlier this month, FIFA's description “fits the framing of Trump that he and his allies wish the world to know, as well as the ‘President of Peace' moniker he has bestowed upon himself”.

As well as the group draw and FIFA Peace Prize, the event usually entails speeches and musical performances.

The draw for the 1994 World Cup, the last time the tournament was held in the U.S., took place in the Las Vegas Convention Center and included performances by Rod Stewart, Stevie Wonder and James Brown.

No musicians have yet been confirmed, but Colombian artist J Balvin performed during half-time of the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey this summer.

Nicolai Budkov Kjaer has qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the first time.

The 19-year-old Norwegian, who has claimed four ATP Challenger Tour titles in 2025, is the sixth player to secure a spot at the 20-and-under event, held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 17-21 December. Budkov Kjaer is at a career-high No. 132 in the PIF ATP Rankings following an impressive rise.

While his continued success on the ATP Challenger Tour has been a solid foundation, it was his breakthrough performance in Bastad — where he came through qualifying before downing Thiago Monteiro for his maiden ATP Tour win — that put him into firm contention in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah.

The 2024 Wimbledon boys' champion grew up idolising fellow Norwegian Casper Ruud. Having trained alongside the former World No. 2 and three-time major finalist, Budkov Kjaer describes Ruud as a “big brother” figure, learning valuable lessons along the way.

At the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Budkov Kjaer will look to join the ranks of elite former champions, including Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, whom the Norwegian hit with as a sparring partner at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals.

Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien, Alexander Blockx, Dino Prizmic and Martin Landaluce have also qualified for the 20-and-under event.

By the time Learner Tien steps onto court in Jeddah for his second straight appearance at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, he will no longer be the fresh-faced teenager who surprised the field as last year's finalist.

Instead, the American arrives as one of the breakout revelations of 2025. Tien's surge into the World's Top 30, deep runs across all surfaces, and first ATP Tour trophy in Metz in the final week of the regular season have shifted expectations from ‘promising prospect' to ‘future fixture'. Yet if there's one thing that remains the same after his meteoric rise, it's that he refuses to shrink under the spotlight.

“I do a good job of keeping expectations off myself,” Tien told ATPTour.com in Paris in October. “I try not to put too much pressure on myself, I just try to come in and enjoy because I am playing all these tournaments for the first time. I'm just enjoying my experience and that takes a lot of weight off my shoulders: I'm able to go out there freely and that helps me a lot.

“I like to keep my routines pretty similar, but usually playing from place to place it's a little tough. I do my best to try and  keep most things the same when I can.”







That freedom translates into fearlessness on court — especially against the sport's heavyweights — and it was on full display at the Australian Open in January. As a qualifier ranked World No. 121, Tien stunned fifth seed and three-time finalist Daniil Medvedev after four hours and 49 minutes of gruelling second-round action.
It didn't stop in Melbourne, where he reached the fourth round, however. Time and time again, he walked into marquee stadiums and swung with nothing to lose, compiling a 5-3 record against Top 10 players, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, across the 2025 season.
“I really enjoy those matches, I see them as great opportunities. I don't think there is a lot of expectation on me to win, especially coming out at the beginning of the year,” said Tien, who also defeated Alexander Zverev, Ben Shelton, Andrey Rublev and Lorenzo Musetti. “I just go out, play free, and play well, and I've been fortunate enough to come through a lot of them.”






Tien is part of a generational surge powered by the same young talents who shared the stage with him last year in Jeddah. Joao Fonseca — who beat Tien in the title match — and Miami champion Jakub Mensik have joined him in turning the 2025 season into a statement year for their age group.
Together, they are leading the next wave of men's tennis, aiming to follow the path carved out by former Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champions Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, now the World No. 1 and World No. 2.
“I think a lot of the younger guys are doing well,” said Tien. “Sometimes it's tough, and people come out a little better than others during the first year as they don't really know how a lot of the new stuff can go. But the young guys do a good job of pushing each other. Everyone wants to catch the ‘top guy'. It's been great all the young guys pushing each other this year.”

Former World No. 2 Michael Chang, who joined Tien's team in July, has been played a key role in accelerating the 19-year-old's rapid growth. Chang's impact was immediate, providing the 19-year-old with the road map of someone who's lived the pressures he is only beginning to encounter.
“He brings a lot of experience, a lot of tennis knowledge,” Tien said of Chang, the 34-time tour-level champion. “I don't have much experience myself as it's my first time around, so having someone on my team who really knows how things go, and having that many years, just really helps me a lot.”
Returning to Jeddah this year with unfinished business, Tien will bring the confidence of a Top 30 breakthrough, the fearless mentality that helped him topple multiple Top 10 stars, and the poise of a young star learning to thrive under pressure.
The 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF will be held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, from 17-21 December.

Rohan Bopanna's career can be distilled into three words: patience, discipline, and self belief.

They are simple qualities, but the weight of that sentence becomes clear only when he describes how close he came to leaving the sport altogether in 2021. Instead, a shift in mindset — sparked by a conversation with his wife Supriya — paved the way for his 2024 Australian Open title with Matthew Ebden and his rise to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings at 43, the oldest man to hit that mark.

“I think my career is a story of patience, discipline and self belief,” Bopanna told ATPTour.com after bringing his playing career to a close earlier this month. “That is where it has shaped me. Yes, you have to have some kind of talent to get to a certain level, but you need to have a strong mindset. That's where it made a massive difference, a massive switch for me going from almost quitting tennis to becoming World No. 1.”

Bopanna amassed 26 tour-level doubles titles across his career, but his story began far from the sport's global hubs. The Indian grew up in Coorg, a hilly region of Karnataka known for its coffee estates and quiet rhythms rather than tennis academies.

With only one national TV channel broadcasting Grand Slam tournaments, the professional game felt remote. Yet as his ability grew, so did his connection to the wider tennis world, and it became the platform for his transition from cracked courts to the top of the ATP Tour.

“Coming from a small town like Coorg to travelling all over the world, becoming World No. 1, especially at the age of 43, it's a journey way beyond what I imagined,” said Bopanna. “The biggest thing, I'm most grateful to each and every partner, every match, every city, and everyone who supported me over the years.”

As a junior, Bopanna's tennis education came partly from watching ATP No. 1 Club member Stefan Edberg, but even more from stories of the Indian greats who paved the way. Ramanathan Krishnan and his son Ramesh Krishnan were trailblazers. Vijay Amritraj and brother Anand Amritraj were Davis Cup stalwarts who carried Indian tennis onto the global stage.

Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi became multiple major champions and former World No. 1s in doubles, redefining what Indian players could achieve. When Bopanna eventually shared the Davis Cup locker room with Paes and Bhupathi, those examples became lived lessons in professionalism and partnership. He also found strength and camaraderie alongside Sania Mirza, with whom he reached the 2023 Australian Open mixed doubles final.

“I was reading about all these guys doing so many great things, representing India at Davis Cup, at the Olympics and Asian Games,” Bopanna said of those early role models. “They started becoming a great inspiration for me. Both Mahesh and Leander were two guys I looked up to. I followed their journey closely. I got to pick their brain day in, day out, to figure out how I should go about my journey.

“Sania Mirza was also somebody I came along the Tour with, and we shared a lot of great memories. Even though I met beautiful people from across the world, just sharing this journey from somebody from your own country, I think helps you shape your journey better as well.”

Yet Bopanna's rise did not come without difficult stretches. In 2006, he had shoulder surgery that sidelined him for six months, and later in his career he battled painful knee issues. In 2019, he learned he had no cartilage left, leaving him in constant discomfort and struggling for form.

After a punishing stretch in 2021, during which he lost his opening seven tour-level matches and recorded his first win of the year in May, the then-41-year-old found himself closer than ever to retirement.

“Right after Covid, when I came back and we were going through all the lockdowns and testings, that year challenged me significantly,”Bopanna said of the 2021 season. “I went almost five months without winning a match. I remember speaking to my wife, and I told her, ‘I'm 41 years old, and I think it's time to call it a day. This is how I think the journey ends.'

“But then she said, ‘If you feel like calling it a day, it's your call, but, think about it. Look at it as a new challenge, not a limitation.' That is where I started playing my best tennis.”

That conversation became the hinge on which his career turned. Bopanna embraced a new approach anchored by the people around him — his wife, longtime coach Scott Davidoff, his physio, and his partners — forming the foundation for a remarkable late surge.

Bopanna's renaissance, highlighted by the 2024 Australian Open title with Matthew Ebden, was matched by the integrity that defined his career. In the 2023 US Open final, during his and Ebden's loss to Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury, Bopanna admitted that a ball had brushed his hand in a moment of instinctive sportsmanship that resonated with fans and peers.

“I've always felt like doing the right thing. It was straight away my instinct to call it upon myself to say that the ball touched me,” Bopanna said. “Being a father, you want to teach the right kind of things, not only to your own children, but to everybody around to show there are things so much bigger than just playing tennis sometimes.

“I'm thankful to my parents who have taught me that from a very young age. Even today, I don't have any regrets of doing something like that. I will keep that for the rest of my life.”

Bopanna posted a 539-410 career record in doubles and earned 15 singles wins, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, but retirement will not take him away from the sport. Through the Rohan Bopanna Tennis Development Foundation, he currently supports 37 underprivileged schoolchildren with education, boarding, lodging, and tennis training.



Now 45 years old, Bopanna wants to help create more tournaments in India, build better pathways for juniors, and use the relationships he formed around the world to reshape Indian tennis. For the first time in two decades, he will also spend more time at home with his loved ones.

“Becoming a father gave me a second wind of a career, with my daughter watching me win titles,” Bopanna said of his daughter Tridha. “She came into an era where I was actually doing really well, and she thought it was normal to have these things. When I made the final in Tokyo this year, the first thing after the prize distribution, I gave her the trophy and told her, 'This is for you'. Kids… They keep you grounded at all times.

“The biggest thing is that yes, I'm retiring from competing, but not from the sport. My next true mission is to help Indian tennis. I would love to use my experience and share it with the young players to help in their journey.”

Looking back on a career filled with success, Bopanna hopes his legacy reflects not only the trophies he collected but the person he was throughout.

“I stayed humble because of my tennis and it has always kept me honest and that's what I want to be remembered for,” Bopanna said. “As a person who always brought a smile every time. I brought my fierce side when I was competing, but outside the tennis court, I just want to be known as someone who was humble and enjoyed the circuit, who loved to be around this great sport and all these wonderful people I met.”

Martin Landaluce has qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, 12 months after serving as an alternate at the 20-and-under event.

The Spaniard made a good start to the season by qualifying for the Australian Open for the first time. After a consistent six months, Landaluce then won a main-draw match at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati. ATP Challenger Tour success then arrived in Orleans, where the 19-year-old lifted his second trophy at that level and first of the year.



Landaluce works with coaches Oscar Burrieza and Esteban Carril. Landaluce's partnership with Burrieza began with a phone call when the Spaniard was just 14. What sets Landaluce apart goes beyond his backhand or his court sense. Burrieza believes his greatest advantage is something rare, something almost intangible.

“For me, his balance, mentally, is one of his biggest talents,” Burrieza told ATPTour.com. “Tennis is mentally brutal. Most weeks, you lose. But Martin has this ability to wake up the next day and get back to practice like nothing happened. He resets emotionally. Whether he's about to play at the Madrid Open or a Futures match, he acts the same. That consistency in attitude is rare.”

Off court, Landaluce, a former US Open Boys' singles champion, enjoys playing the guitar and studying the mental side of the game.

"I like doing a lot of things outside of tennis that help me mentally, reading, breathing exercises, meditation. Those things help me stay focused on court,” Landaluce told ATPTour.com in August.

“I try to rely on discipline more than motivation. A lot of people think motivation comes first, but for me, discipline comes first and that brings motivation. You start doing something, and as you get better, you start enjoying it more. That's where the motivation comes from.”

The 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF will take place from 17-21 December. Former champions include Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien, Alexander Blockx and Dino Prizmic have qualified for this year's event.

Bortoleto disappointed to miss out on SQ3 spot in Qatar

Bearman laments ‘the perfect storm' in Sprint Qualifying as he misses out on SQ3

Oscar Piastri will start Saturday's 19-lap Sprint from pole, alongside George Russell.

Oscar Piastri claimed a crucial pole position for the Qatar Sprint, beating George Russell and McLaren team mate Lando Norris to the top spot.

The Australian set the pace when it mattered most in Friday's SQ3, sitting at the top of the times after both his flying laps, with his final benchmark of 1m 20.055s leaving him just 0.032s clear of Mercedes' Russell.

Norris, who holds a 24-point lead over Piastri and Max Verstappen ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix, which means he can claim a maiden Formula 1 title this weekend, finished two-tenths further back after running wide at the last corner on his final effort.

Fernando Alonso took an impressive P4 for Aston Martin, as Yuki Tsunoda out-qualified Red Bull team mate Verstappen, the Dutchman struggling with bouncing and finishing P6.

The top-10 was completed by Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes), Carlos Sainz (Williams), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) and the second Williams of Alex Albon.

Isack Hadjar failed to progress into SQ3 after losing his final lap time due to track limits at Turn 8, the Racing Bulls driver classified P11 from Ollie Bearman (Haas) and Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber).

The second Sauber of Nico Hulkenberg also lost his final lap time due to track limits and finished P14 ahead of the second Haas of Esteban Ocon.

Aston Martin's Lance Stroll was the first driver to miss the cut in SQ1 from Liam Lawson (Racing Bulls) and Lewis Hamilton, the Ferrari driver once again out in the opening phase of Qualifying, as the Alpines of Pierre Gasly and Franco Colapinto completed the order for Saturday's 19-lap Sprint.

With just a single one-hour Free Practice session under their belts and no team having used the medium tyre, drivers headed into the unknown during SQ1 with the yellow-walled tyre mandatory for the opening 12-minute segment.

Verstappen and Red Bull made their intentions clear from the outset, the Dutchman the first to hit the track but he was left behind title rivals Norris and Piastri after the opening laps, the Drivers' Championship leader topping the leaderboard on a 1m 21.621s.

With track evolution at the Lusail International Circuit high, times continued to tumble and Verstappen, Norris and Piastri traded fastest laps before Alonso briefly topped the leaderboard.

Verstappen eventually finished fastest on a 1m 21.172s, leaving him one-tenth clear of the Aston Martin driver as Piastri, Hulkenberg, Norris and Hadjar completed the top six.

In the drop zone, Stroll was the first driver to miss the cut by less than one-tenth as he headed Lawson and Hamilton, the Ferrari driver finishing nearly three-tenths away from the next stage and claiming over the radio, "the car won't go any quicker", with team mate Leclerc only P13.

The seven-time World Champion only headed both Alpines of Gasly and Colapinto, with a Turn 1 and Turn 16 incident between Verstappen and Norris for impeding noted by the stewards before no further action was taken for each.

Knocked out: Stroll, Lawson, Hamilton, Gasly, Colapinto

Norris, Piastri and Verstappen resumed their battle at the top of the times in Q2, Norris dealing the first decisive blow with a 1m 20.956s on the medium Pirelli rubber.

It left him just 0.049s clear of his team mate and only 0.080s ahead of Verstappen after the Dutchman's second effort, with the time proving good enough for P1 despite Norris running wide at Turn 2 on his final lap.

Verstappen was left complaining of bouncing aboard his Red Bull over the radio in P3, the order completed by Russell, Tsunoda, Sainz, Leclerc, Albon and Alonso.

Antonelli was provisionally eliminated but a track limits time deletion for Hadjar at Turn 8 meant the Frenchman lost his best lap and finished P11, where he was joined by Bearman, Bortoleto and Hulkenberg, who also lost his best lap to track limits, as Ocon finished P15.

Knocked out: Hadjar, Bearman, Bortoleto, Hulkenberg, Ocon

With drivers required to use the soft tyre for the time in Sprint Qualifying, McLaren seemed to take a noticeable leap forward compared with other teams, as Piastri just edged Norris by 0.044s after the pair's first flying laps.

Despite having challenged his title rivals in the other two segments, Verstappen ran wide on his first effort at Turn 4 and complained of bouncing again to his team over the radio.

With no representative time on the board, the four-time World Champion had only his final effort to move up the order, which was only good enough for sixth on the grid, directly behind team mate Tsunoda and the impressive Alonso.

Piastri improved with his second effort, posting a 1m 20.055s which was only fractionally faster than Russell, while Norris had to settle for third after running wide at the final corner and failing to improve.

Behind the top six, Antonelli headed Sainz, Leclerc and Albon, both Williams drivers reaching SQ3 on a track where they expected to struggle.

"It's been a good day, which is nice for a change," said Piastri. "It's been a day where things have clicked from the start and I think the Sprint Qualifying session went really well. I had a pretty big moment on my lap but it was just enough in the end so thanks to the team – it's a great car and it's looked really good this weekend so far. I'm pretty happy with that.

With the grid decided, the drivers will line up for the Sprint at 1700 local time on Saturday. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can catch the action.

Kelly Dodd threatened her daughter, Jolie Dodd, in a leaked voicemail.

The “Real Housewives of Orange County” alum, 50, claimed in the shocking voicemail, which is going viral online, that Jolie had “blocked [her] from everything,” so she left word with the 19-year-old's friend.

The friend then filmed herself playing the voicemail, and the video ended up on social media, though it's unclear when the voicemail was left and what might've prompted it.

“Forward this message to her,” Kelly began the voicemail. “You just opened up Pandora's box, Jolie.”

The former Bravolebrity claimed to be in possession of numerous “recordings” showing Jolie “screaming” at her dad, Michael Dodd, because he hadn't taken her on vacation or bought her a car.

“Do you remember those recordings that I saved? I have those, and I'm gonna publicly put them out there. Do you understand?” Kelly said in the voicemail.

“For you to do this to me after I bought you a car, paid for your college, paid for your health insurance, took you to the doctor's, bought you all your clothes, housed you, did all that.”

She went on to call her ex-husband a “f–king loser” and accused him of putting his other children before Jolie.

“You're going to look like a fool, you dumb little girl. You're stupid, OK, for even thinking that you're gonna win,” Kelly said in the voicemail.

She then claimed that even her attorney is “laughing” at Jolie, whom she labeled a “joke.”

Kelly concluded her voicemail by saying it's “absolutely crazy” for Jolie to take Michael's “side.”

Reps for Kelly and Jolie did not immediately respond to Page Six's requests for comment.

However, a source close to Jolie tells us she did not authorize the release of the video.

Family drama seems to follow the ex-reality personality.

In August, Kelly's brother Eric Meza claimed that Jolie had “disowned” her.

Advertisement

“She has nothing to do with her. Jolie's done with her. She's a terrible mom,” he said in an Instagram video at the time, adding that “nobody” in the family talks to his sister, including their parents and brother.

“Doesn't that tell you something about somebody?” Meza argued.

Kelly responded with her own Instagram video in which she called Meza a “sick” “psycho” who is “full of s–t.”

Kelly and Michael were married from April 2006 until they separated in September 2017. 

Their divorce was finalized in February 2018.

She tied the knot with former Fox News anchor Rick Leventhal in October 2020.

Kim Kardashian's 2022 Met Gala regret might not be what you think.

For the event, the reality TV star chose an archival dress to walk the red carpet.

But it wasn't just any dress — it was Marilyn Monroe's iconic beaded tank gown that she famously wore to sing “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” to President John F. Kennedy in 1962.

In a post-credits confessional scene from episode six of “The Kardashians” on Hulu, Kardashian talks about the one thing she would have done differently if she could go back in time to the 2022 event.

According to the 45-year-old, instead of bleaching her hair blond, she should have stuck to her natural, dark brunette shade. The point was to pay tribute to — not compete with — the late Hollywood icon.

“I don't know why, but everyone told me, ‘Don't do Marilyn hair, you're going to look like a wax figure of Marilyn,'” she shared. “We just thought we wanted to be blond. I should have been like dark, Jackie O vibes hair.”

Ultimately, Kardashian and hairstylist Chris Appleton opted for “Marilyn blond,” though she looks back on the choice as questionable.

Four and a half years later, Kardashian is still agonizing over the decision. “I've actually photoshopped it 500 different ways after the fact — like, last year — to see. Do you want to see? Because I have tortured Chris Appleton on this decision.”

Advertisement

As she quickly pulls the images up on her phone to show the producers and cameramen, Kardashian asks, “Should it have been a Marilyn vibe hair in blond … should it have been more of a Jackie O dark? Either one of these would have worked.”

The theme of that year's Costume Institute exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was “In America: An Anthology of Fashion,” which prompted Kardashian to seek out such an iconic piece of American fashion history.

That said, the star experienced significant backlash after wearing the gown, which was pulled directly from the display case of a public exhibit.

The look had found its permanent home with Ripley's Believe It or Not! after the museum acquired it at auction for over $5 million.

Even though Kardashian changed into a replica for the party itself, the original gown was said to have been damaged that evening — all for a Kardashian photo-opp.

Ripley's has denied any damage was made.

Despite the ongoing debates, the critics seem not to have penetrated the “All's Fair” actress; her greatest regret over the whole evening's look remains the color of her slicked-back hair.

Two Detroiters tried (but failed) to will their hometown Lions to victory during the NFL team's annual Thanksgiving Day game. Jack White opened his halftime show performance with “That's How I'm Feeling,” from last year's No Name, before bringing out Eminem for a mashup of the White Stripes' “Hello Operator” and the rapper's Eminem Show cut “'Till I Collapse.” Inevitably, the performance concluded with Elephant's “Seven Nation Army.” Watch a replay below and on YouTube. The show has also been uploaded, as an EP, to streaming services; scroll down to listen.

It should maybe not be a surprise that Eminem showed up for White's performance, as the rapper and his manager and Shady Records co-founder Paul Rosenberg are the executive producers of the halftime show, along with Jesse Collins Entertainment. Eminem and Rosenberg will help with the Lions' Thanksgiving halftime production through 2027.

The Detroit Lions play annually on Thanksgiving and, despite their success in recent seasons, they lose more often than they win, and that was the case yesterday, as the team fell to the rival Green Bay Packers. Last year, however, the Lions defeated the Chicago Bears in a game that featured a halftime performance from Shaboozey.

Eminem's grandson made a rare public appearance for the rapper's NFL halftime show Thursday.

The Grammy winner's daughter Hailie Jade Scott gave her Instagram followers a glimpse of Elliot as the 8-month-old watched Eminem's surprise performance alongside Jack White.

“Happy thanksgiving,” the 29-year-old captioned sweet footage of their Ford Field outing in Detroit, Mich.

Scott kept Elliot's face turned away from the camera.

The little one wore a pair of headphones to protect his ears, matching his mom in a navy blue onesie.

The duo both sported the Detroit Lions' colors as the Michigan-based team played — and lost to — the Green Bay Packers.

Social media users gushed over the mother-son duo in the comments section, with one calling Elliot the “cutest supporter in the world.”

Scott gave birth to her baby boy in March, and the infant's middle name is a sweet nod to Eminem.

The performer's real name, notably, is Marshall Bruce Mathers III.

Scott incorporated her famous father into her pregnancy reveal five months prior.

In the songwriter's “Temporary” music video in May, Eminem reacted to Scott presenting him with a “Grandpa” jersey.

“Mom & dad est. 2025,” she subsequently wrote via Instagram, tagging husband Evan McClintock in the maternity shoot snaps.

The couple have been married since May 2024, walking down the aisle in Battle Creek, Mich.

They started dating in 2016 after meeting at Michigan State University.

McClintock got down on one knee in February 2023, with Scott sharing the news in a “casual weekend recap.”

International Investigations Editor


EXCLUSIVE: Nicola Holt, a British actress and model who has appeared in Viewpoint and Hollyoaks, has warned other women in the industry to “beware” film producer Kevin Proctor after he pleaded guilty to stalking.


	Proctor, 47, was handed a 12-month restraining order and a £505 ($666) fine by Manchester Magistrate's Court after he admitted stalking Holt, including being involved in planting a tracking device on a car being used by the Emmerdale actress. 


	He has previously denied the charge of stalking involving serious alarm and distress, but on Thursday, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of stalking. During the court hearing, Proctor's barrister said the incident was isolated, out of character, and that his autism meant he struggled to make rational decisions.

	As a producer, Proctor was most recently involved in Midas Man, the troubled biopic about Beatles manager Brian Epstein, starring Jacob Fortune-Lloyd and Emily Watson. He has several high-profile credits in behind-the-scenes roles, including working as an assistant production coordinator on Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi.

	In an interview with Deadline, Holt has spoken about her experience for the first time, revealing that Proctor's actions mean she lives in perpetual paranoia about being followed. She warned other women in the screen industry to avoid falling into the producer's “nice guy trap.”


	Holt said she first encountered Proctor on social media during the pandemic. He gave her freelance work on Prime Video true-crime documentary The Never Ending Murder, co-produced by Proctor's Studio Pow. After Holt did other work for Proctor, including appearing in his 2022 short Lapushka!, their professional connection developed into a romantic relationship.

	











	They saw each other regularly while he was filming Midas Man in Liverpool, but Holt said she ended their relationship in August 2023 after learning that he had a girlfriend. Holt said they continued to discuss professional opportunities, but Proctor's behavior changed when she entered a relationship with another man in early 2024.


	Holt recalled seeing Proctor's car on numerous occasions near her home and at sets of traffic lights. When house hunting with her partner, Holt said she spotted Proctor at a yet-to-be-completed property development site. “There was no reason for anyone to be there,” she said. “As we were exiting the estate, I saw him walk across a set of driveways. I thought to myself, ‘You're going crazy, Nicola.'”


Holt Discovers Tracking Device


	In the following days, a tire was slashed on Holt's work van while she was staying in a hotel (though it was not established if this was connected to Proctor), and she spotted the producer on a separate occasion at another set of traffic lights.


	She confided in her boyfriend, who questioned how Proctor could have known her movements. On June 28, 2024, Holt found a tracking device behind a number plate on her partner's car, which she was using because her personal vehicle had broken down. Holt filed a police report and Proctor was arrested in July 2024.


	“I was shaking. My heart dropped. I ripped off the tracker because it's a magnetic one, and I ran back inside and did not stop crying,” Holt remembered. “I drove around to the local police station, which was closed, so I just sat in the car park crying.”


	Speaking in court on Thursday, Proctor's barrister said the producer hired a private investigator to attach the tracker to the car of Holt's partner. “He did not apply it himself — he is a film producer by trade and not well-versed in these sorts of things. But the tracker was applied on his instruction,” Aisling Byrnes said, per a report in the Manchester Evening News.


	Holt said her “paranoia is really heightened” after her experience, and that even seeing an unusual car outside her home can trigger anxiety. In her victim impact statement, Holt said: “Not feeling safe in your own home is a violation and that's what these brutal, thoughtless actions have done.”


	Holt said she was grateful that the matter had been dealt with in court. “I want other women to know what he's capable of,” she continued. “I wouldn't like to see him again in that place of power in the industry.” 


	Proctor's barrister said his life had been “turned upside down” by the events and he had suffered “considerable reputational damage within his industry.” The lawyer added that Proctor now works in a freezer factory and lives with his parents.


	Proctor was cited as a producer throughout Midas Man‘s development, but his credit was missing from the final feature. Deadline broke a number of stories about Midas Man‘s troubled path to the screen. Proctor's other credits include Cordelia, a psychological thriller starring Antonia Campbell-Hughes and Johnny Flynn; and Funny Cow, a story about a female comedian, starring Maxine Peake, Paddy Considine, and Stephen Graham.

His life has been turned upside down?  Oh no. If only there was a way he could have prevented that.

Sad that the consequences are so minimal for Proctor.

Dude's working a menial job now instead of working in movies and lives with his parents. I think justice has been served.

He's not changed (nor has the industry since MeToo), nor is he repentant of what he did. Textbook sociopath and will offend again given the right opportunity and resources that match his capabilities. They never stop until stopped.

Hate to break it to you, but most people don't actually change. No one's denying he's El Creepo, but so many of you demand hangings for jaywalkers.

Proctor's barrister said his life had been “turned upside down” by the events and he had suffered “considerable reputational damage within his industry.” 

Yeah, good. Don't stalk people.

So, no consequences for the stalker other than some bad press? Autism doesn't cause stalking (what a disgusting comment). No accountability nor remorse.

The Development Bank of Japan's investment in the Tokyo-based startup — launched at Cannes with backing from auteurs like Hirokazu Kore-eda and Takashi Miike — signals growing institutional support for the company's vision of shaking up Japan's conservative film financing system.


							By 

	Patrick Brzeski


Asia Bureau Chief


	The Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) has become the latest major investor to back Tokyo-based K2 Pictures' pioneering new film production fund, signaling growing institutional confidence in the company's bid to shake up Japan's long-stagnant film financing system.


	K2 Pictures said Friday that it has secured a 500 million yen ($3.3 million) investment from DBJ for its flagship K2P Film Fund I, adding momentum to the year-old venture's effort to create what founder and CEO Muneyuki Kii calls “a new ecosystem for Japanese cinema.”

	The deal follows earlier backing from Japanese megabank MUFG, which joined the fund this summer in what analysts described as an unprecedented show of support for an independent film venture. K2's growing list of blue-chip partners is a powerful vote of confidence — even if the investment sums from these entities have been modest — underscoring how even the country's conservative financial sector is beginning to view the startup's approach to the movie business as a viable investment category. 


	In a Japanese film landscape dominated by conglomerate franchises and anime blockbusters, K2's fund is positioning itself as a rare, creator-friendly bridge between independent film and capital.

	Founded in 2023, K2 Pictures is the brainchild of Kii — a 25-year veteran of Toei and producer of hit anime titles such as Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, The First Slam Dunk and Shin Kamen Rider — who launched the venture to shake up Japan's notoriously risk-averse “production committee” model. Under that traditional system, films are co-financed by sprawling consortiums of studios, broadcasters and publishers, a process critics say stifles creative autonomy and limits profit participation for filmmakers.

	











	K2's alternative structure seeks to attract both domestic and international investors through a transparent profit-sharing model that returns a portion of revenues directly to creators, lowering middleman fees and aligning incentives across production and financing. The fund has backed its first feature, Mag Mag, a comedy directed by popular Japanese comedian Yuriyan Retriever, slated for release in February 2026.


	At its launch during the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, K2 Pictures revealed an ambitious creative alliance with some of Japan's most celebrated filmmakers — including Hirokazu Kore-eda, Takashi Miike, Shunji Iwai, Miwa Nishikawa and Kazuya Shiraishi — as well as anime powerhouse MAPPA, the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Attack on Titan. All of the partners expressed intentions to work with the startup company on future projects.


	“In launching this fund, we aimed to present a new financing option for the Japanese film industry,” Kii said in a statement. “We spent valuable time preparing, and consulted thoroughly with a broad group of investors. We are delighted that the Development Bank of Japan, a government-affiliated financial institution, recognized the value of our initiative and agreed to participate. Entertainment and finance are often perceived as distant fields, and indeed, this has been the case. However, to compete globally, a strong connection between the two is essential.”


	DBJ added: “We deeply resonate with K2 Pictures' vision to globalize Japan's film industry. We are also impressed by their approach to innovating film production and financing methods by engaging a wide range of players, including those in related industries. We are delighted to join them in this endeavor.”

"Heartbroken to share that Joan, my wife and partner for 50 years, has passed away," Richard Branson writes.


													By
												

	Lars Brandle



	Richard Branson has remembered his late wife Joan Templeman as the “shining star” around which the Branson “family's universe has always orbited.”


	In a pair of posts on Instagram, Branson, the British businessman who founded the Virgin Group and launched scores of recording careers through his labels Virgin Records and V2, said he was “devastated” at the death of Templeman, aged 80.

	“Heartbroken to share that Joan, my wife and partner for 50 years, has passed away,” he writes. “She was the most wonderful mum and grandmum our kids and grandkids could have ever wished for. She was my best friend, my rock, my guiding light, my world. Love you forever, Joan.”


	The pair married on Necker island in 1989, owned by Branson, and had three children three children — Holly, Sam, and Clare Sarah, who died after four days — and five grandchildren.


	In a followup post, Branson writes of her “radiant smile,” her joyfulness, kindness and her nurturing instincts. “Life will never be the same without her. But we have fifty incredible years of memories – years filled with tears and laughter, kindness, and a love that shaped our family more than words could ever capture. It was a relationship that worked. We just had lots of laughs. We were very lucky.”


	Branson met his wife back in 1976 at the Manor, Virgin Records' live-in recording studio. He fell for her “almost from the moment I saw her,” he wrote on his blog in 2020. “Joan was a down-to-earth Scottish lady and I quickly realized she wouldn't be impressed by my usual antics.”


	Templeman was, in his mind, Branson's better half. “Joan has always been a steady source of wisdom and has played no small part in some of my better life decisions.” It was Templeman who convinced Branson to buy Necker island, for a knockdown price, which he went on to describe as “one of the best decisions I've ever made.”


	Although the cause of death has yet to be announced, Branson confirms he was by Templeman's side when she passed “quickly and painlessly”.


	Joan's “light is not gone,” he continues. “It's just taken on a new shape. It will guide us forward. And we will carry her with us, always.”


	Branson is considered one of Britain's most successful entrepreneurs. He founded the Virgin brand with Nik Powell in the early 1970s, initially with Virgin Records, before expanding into other industries including air travel, record stores, hotels, wines, space tourism and more. He sold Virgin Records to Thorn EMI in 1992 for £560 million ($804 million), and continued to own the Virgin Megastores music retail chain until 2007, when the market for CDs was in a state of collapse.


	Branson and Virgin Group returned to the record business in November 1996 with the launch of the indie label V2. Virgin Group sold a chunk in V2 Records to Morgan Stanley in 2002, and disposed its remaining stake to the U.S. investment bank in May 2006. UMG reached an agreement to buy V2 from Morgan Stanley later that year.

When Woody Guthrie died at the untimely age of 55, in 1967, the pioneering folk singer left behind 28 linear feet of lyrics scrawled on, according to his archive, “tissue paper, onionskin, gift-wrap, napkins, concert programs, and even place mats”—scraps of ballads, union songs, and protest hymns for the next generation to sing. Guthrie's prolific posthumous catalog has meant that, at the invitation of his daughter and archivist, Nora Guthrie, contemporary musicians like Billy Bragg & Wilco, Del McCoury, the Klezmatics, and the Dropkick Murphys have tried on Guthrie's unsung lyrics over the years to find that his messages of radical humanism still fit perfectly.

To write “in the spirit of Woody Guthrie”—as Haley Heynderickx and Max García Conover aspire to do on their new collaborative LP, What of Our Nature—is a different undertaking than Mermaid Avenue or Del and Woody, requiring not only creative interpretation but political imagination. Heynderickx and Conover take the task seriously. On 10 spirited tracks that address topics like mass marketing, labor history, and the struggle for Puerto Rican independence, Conover and Heynderickx affirm Guthrie's legacy not by resurrecting his words but by renewing his commitment to songwriting as a democratic exercise.

Heynderickx and Conover first collaborated on the 2018 EP Among Horses III, an intimate, mystical jewel box showcasing their respective gifts for hypnotism. Heynderickx's plaintive warble, which evokes folk singers like Shirley Collins, is her primary instrument; Conover's songs unfold in incantatory, tumbling rhythms that recall the verbose pleasure of Adrianne Lenker. On Among Horses, Conover and Heynderickx's common ground was covered in papaya trees and praying mantises, castles and ghosts—a shared vocabulary of supernatural ecology that wove their songs together like spiderweb.

Recorded directly to tape in Vermont, What of Our Nature is even earthier than its predecessor, with twinkling wind chimes, rustling hand percussion, and precise fingerpicking. Lyrically, the album returns to nature—the tongue-twisting “Boars,” especially, is a fantasia of “quiquiriqui” calls, “stag shape” runaways, and “blushfern silversage”—but the grim reapers of capitalism and colonialism are closing in. Conover and Heynderickx must now address “ticker tape accumulation” and “neoliberal sublimation,” “starvation wages” and “revolution coming round.”

These struggles aren't new: What of Our Nature's two most overtly political songs, both written by Conover, link current events to a pair of incidents from 1981. “Song for Alicia” recounts the undignified courtroom treatment of FALN member Alicia Rodríguez, who was imprisoned alongside nine other Puerto Rican independence activists while refusing to stand trial. “Buffalo, 1981” alludes to Reagan's suppression of the 1981 PATCO Strike, which dealt a massive blow to American labor power. The specificity of these references is a gift for political education. But the album's more expressionistic or metaphorical songs, though beautiful, feel atemporal and vague by contrast. Some of the overliteral proclamations sell their songwriters short: “To believe the weightless wait behind the door of salvation metaphors” is a far stronger line than “They're just making money off of us fighting” (Heynderickx); “Montserrat money makers rooting in the rutabaga” is inarguably more interesting than “The USA hates you being poor” (Conover).

Resorting to stock phrases helps Heynderickx and Conover ensure that their message is unambiguous—a useful way to assuage uncertainty about the efficacy of art in times of crisis, a motif that recurs across What of Our Nature. In “Song for Alicia,” Conover imagines a harsh future appraisal of his output: “And when someone looks at what I've done/I know songs won't seem like enough/Songs are for sure not nearly enough.” Acknowledging this doubt helps these songwriters move past it into strength. “The war's gone long without us/Using the ammo of our tongues,” Heynderickx sings on “In Bulosan's Words.”

Yet What of Our Nature's most potent weapons are smelted from the ore of others. On “Song for Alicia,” Conover and Heynderickx belt Puerto Rican poet Juan Antonio Corretjer's refrain “I would be Boricua even if I was born on the moon” with triumphant defiance that evokes the dual strength and vulnerability of Emmylou Harris and Conor Oberst's blend on “Landlocked Blues.” On “In Bulosan's Words,” Heynderickx crafts a folk protest song using lines from Filipino American poet Carlos Bulosan's America Is in the Heart. These creative forebears prove that poetry can be as effective a tool of resistance as plainspoken systemic critique; but Heynderickx and Conover, in their own words, seem less convincing. Compared to acerbic present-day folk artists like Jesse Welles, whose songs seek to meet the urgency of the moment by criticizing ICE or Netanyahu by name, Conover and Heynderickx sound slightly aimless. The targets of Conover and Heynderickx's songs? “Men in suits,” “the wealthy,” “the USA,” and, frequently, “they.”

Bob Dylan, perhaps Woody Guthrie's best-known acolyte, didn't follow Guthrie to the bitter end. One of Dylan's most haunting protest songs, “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,” sparks outrage and disdain for broken legal systems in a similar fashion as the third verse of “Song for Alicia.” Dylan credited Bertolt Brecht, explicitly not Guthrie, with inspiring his writing at that time. Perhaps with a different muse—one who reflects both their values and their uncanny sensibilities—Conover and Heynderickx will activate the full artistic potential of their convictions. What of Our Nature makes a very respectable start.

	The “Rockstar” singer also sported a No. 94 pin on his blue and white satin jacket for the Cowboys' duel with Kansas City Chiefs.


	Kneeland died by a gunshot to the head earlier this month, at the age of just 24. His death is being investigated as a suicide.


	A product of Western Michigan Broncos, the footballer earned second-team Mid-American Conference (MAC) honors in 2023, and, the following year, was selected by the Cowboys in the second round of the NFL draft.


	For Posty, the high-profile gig was a triumphant homecoming. The celebrated hip-hop artist (real name: Austin Post) was raised in Grapevine, Texas, and his dad, Rich Post, was assistant director of food and beverage at the stadium from 2005 to 2019.


	“I'm from Texas. I grew up a Cowboys fan and have been watching this halftime show for years,” Malone commented in a statement published on the Cowboys' official site. “It's a real honor to be part of the Red Kettle Kickoff with The Salvation Army and the Dallas Cowboys and help bring hope to so many people.”

	











	For the big show, Posty powered through “Wrong Ones,” “Wow” and “I Had Some Help.”


	Malone's Thanksgiving thank-you might've done enough to lifted his beloved franchise, as the Cowboys ran out winners 31-28.


	Post doesn't pass on the opportunity to perform under the bright lights of the NFL. His previous football gigs include the Baltimore Ravens and Houston Texans' Christmas Day show last year; he performed before the 2024 Super Bowl when he sang “America the Beautiful,” and earlier in the year he headlined the Super Bowl 59 YouTube tailgate concert.

"We're fighting a deeply prejudiced system," the 'Barbie' and 'Shang-Chi' actor said, "and most days it SUCKS."


							By

Simu Liu isn't holding back on his criticism of what he describes as a “backslide” of Asian representation in Hollywood.


	The actor shared his thoughts on Threads on Friday, responding to a post asking for Hollywood to put more Asian men in romantic lead roles.




	“Put some Asians in literally anything right now,” Liu responded. ‘The amount of backslide in our representation onscreen is f**king appalling. studios think we're ‘risky.'”


	The Barbie star went on to highlight several movies released in recent years that center on the Asian experience — Minari, The Farewell, Past Lives, Everything Everywhere All at Once, Crazy Rich Asians, and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings (in which Liu starred) — adding, “Every single one [was] a financial success.”

	“No Asian actor has ever lost a studio even close to 100 million dollars but a white dude will lose 200 million TWICE and roll right into the next tentpole lead,” he continued. “We're fighting a deeply prejudiced system. and most days it SUCKS.”


	The Threads post that Liu was responding to also included comments from Manny Jacinto, who recently starred as Lindsay Lohan's onscreen love interest in Freakier Friday. While some fans pleaded for Jacinto to star in more rom-coms after seeing the movie, he previously told ScreenRant that it seemed many creatives in Hollywood had other ideas, as he's mostly been “getting dad roles, or dad auditions” since.


	While the overall percentage of Asian characters on screen has increased from 2007 to 2024, those gains were wiped out between 2023 and 2024, according to USC's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative's diversity report of movies, which was released in August 2025. The percentage of speaking characters of Asian descent decreased from 18.4 percent in 2023 to 13.5 percent in 2024. However, the report found that there were significantly more white characters on screen in 2024 (63.6 percent) than in 2023 (55.7 percent).

	











	Liu also responded to claims made by producer Rachel Tan about her experience trying to cast Worth the Wait. “They gave me a list of white guys we could cast. If we could give one of the roles to them, we could get funded,” Tan previously told Singaporean newspaper The Straits Times.


	“Spoken to countless directors who have corroborated this,” he added on Threads. “Studios give a list and as of now, all the names are white with maybe ONE bipoc name that is tossed in there so they cover their own asses. and unfortunately that name is never Asian.”

	As People We Meet on Vacation makes the journey from the page to the screen, readers may notice some differences in the 2021 romantic comedy book's feature adaptation.


	Author Emily Henry recently teased how the Yulin Kuang-written, Brett Haley-directed rom-com, which premieres Jan. 9 on Netflix, departs from her book about the deep 10-year friendship between Poppy (Emily Bader) and Alex (Tom Blyth) that blossoms into something more during their annual vacation.


	“There are a couple of differences between the book and the movie that I'm really excited for the readers to see,” she told Netflix in an interview. “We've moved a lot of the book from Palm Springs to Barcelona, so there's some fun new set dressing that they haven't already experienced. But more than that, I think it's these added scenes that were used to do, like a truncated version of stuff that happens in the book.”

	Henry added, “So that means we get new dialog between Poppy and Alex, new moments, new jokes, new beats of affection. And it's kind of just like we get extra pieces of them and I really think that the readers are gonna just like eat that up.”


	Deadline exclusively reported the announcement of the People We Meet on Vacation film in development in late 2022, with cast boarding the production nearly two years later in August 2024.


	The movie also stars Sarah Catherine Hook, Jameela Jamil, Lucien Laviscount, Lukas Gage, Molly Shannon, Alan Ruck, Miles Heizer, Tommy Do and Alice Lee.

	As Shawn Levy prepares to leave his mark on the Star Wars franchise, the director has enlisted “a maestro” to compose the movie's score.


	The Star Wars: Starfighter director recently revealed that 15x Oscar nominee Thomas Newman will score the upcoming installment, which is set to premiere in theaters on May 28, 2027 in the United States. Deadline has reached out to Lucasfilm.


	“I know, bro. I don't know if that's public, so now it is. Yeah, I think we're breaking news here,” he enthusiastically said on the On Film…with Kevin McCarthy podcast. “You don't understand. If you ask me to name my favorite scores, five of the top 10 are Tom Newman: Shawshank, Road to Perdition, Nemo, American Beauty. The guy is a maestro.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Levy continued, “And I was thinking about this movie and what I need the music to be, because it wants to be sort of classically inspired. But no, it's not gonna be remixes of Williams cues. It may be inspired by some of that, but I knew that I needed a big-hearted movie score from a composer, who like John Williams, doesn't shy away from themes.”


	Williams scored George Lucas‘ original Star Wars (1977), the music of which has since become synonymous with the franchise.


	“So, I called up Tom Newman. You don't understand, I'm a fan,” added Levy. “And I said, ‘Hey, it's Shawn Levy. Would you ever consider—?' And he said, ‘Send me the script, and describe your vision.' And I did both those things, and it was yes. And I'm so stoked. … I'm so excited about it.”

	











	A standalone film outside the Skywalker saga, Starfighter is set five years after Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker (2019). Penned by Jonathan Tropper, the movie stars Ryan Gosling, Matt Smith, Mia Goth, Aaron Pierre, Simon Bird, Jamael Westman, Daniel Ings, Flynn Gray and Amy Adams.

This is the first thing thats gotten me excited for this film – a Thomas Newman star wars score has great potential!

Is he no longer working with Christophe Beck? He should be composing it.

Hailie Jade Scott gave fans a warm holiday moment when she posted a video on Nov. 27, 2025, showing her infant son watching his grandfather perform at the NFL Thanksgiving halftime show. In the clip, the toddler, Elliot Marshall McClintock, wears noise-reducing headphones and stares wide-eyed as his grandfather, rapper Eminem, takes the stage with fellow musician Jack White. She captioned the post “happy thanksgiving 💕.”

The short video offered a rare glimpse of private family life. Hailie tends to keep her personal moments away from the spotlight. Fans immediately responded with support and affection as many reacted to the tiny boy's first live concert experience.

Hailie and her husband, Evan McClintock, met in 2016 at Michigan State University. The couple got engaged in February 2023 and married in May 2024. Their son Elliot arrived in March 2025. Over the past several months, Hailie has shared occasional glimpses of motherhood, including a photo commemorating Elliot's four-month milestone. That image featured a onesie that subtly nodded to his grandfather's legacy.

Hailie has previously spoken about growing up under public scrutiny. She once said she understands what her father experienced while raising her under constant media attention. The new Instagram post suggests that she aims to share only selective moments that capture love and celebration while maintaining privacy for her child.

For years, Hailie has appeared in headlines mostly as the daughter who inspired some of Eminem's most heartfelt lyrics. Now, the narrative is changing. The Thanksgiving-night video proves she is no longer just a muse and public figure. She is a mother, and her son is part of a growing family legacy.

The scene of a grandfather performing on stage and a young grandson watching quietly captures a generational shift. Rap fans will remember Hailie as the child Eminem once rapped about. Now she is a parent witnessing her own child take in music that shaped a generation.

Hailie's Thanksgiving post adds to a growing collection of updates that document her transition into parenthood. Her content remains limited, but each post offers a brief look at how she and McClintock are navigating life as new parents while managing public attention.

The video also highlights a new phase for Eminem as he steps into the role of grandfather. For fans who have followed the rapper's career and the references to his daughter over the years, the moment marks a shift in the family's public narrative.

Fear not, Supernatural friends. Although the road so far has been a bit bumpy following Netflix's recent reveal that the hit CW series of yesteryear would soon take its leave from the streamer, we're officially back in business thanks to Prime Video. As part of the platform's upcoming December releases, the Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki-led fan-favorite series will join its extensive catalogue, giving subscribers a new shot at watching all 15 seasons. This news will come as a deep sigh of relief to anyone who considers Supernatural to be their comfort show, as with its Netflix departure, it was looking like there would be no way to stream the entire series. But, now it will just live where other projects from the show's creator, Eric Kripke, have found a home, like The Boys and its hit spin-off Gen V.

Over nearly two decades, audiences tagged along with paranormal investigators Dean (Ackles) and Sam Winchester (Padalecki) on their journey to hunt as many of hell's baddies as possible. Along the way, the siblings unraveled plenty of secrets about their family and even saved the world on numerous occasions. The title would ultimately become one of the network's most beloved productions, and not a dry eye was left when the credits rolled on the series finale upon its arrival in 2020. Along with the two brothers, a slew of other memorable characters helped make the show the fan-favorite that it became, thanks to performances from Misha Collins, Jim Beaver, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Mark Sheppard, Ruth Connell, DJ Qualls, Felicia Day, and more.

While there may not be any immediate plans to bring Supernatural back to a TV screen near you, a new graphic novel continues the Winchesters' travels and rounds out parts of the story that never made the series. Additionally, Ackles, Padalecki, and Collins will all join forces in the upcoming fifth and final season of Kripke's series, The Boys, during which Ackles will reprise his role as Soldier Boy from the show's third season. As of right now, further details about what eccentric and larger-than-life personalities Padalecki and Collins will take on are being kept under wraps, but, with Season 5 expected to arrive next year, we'll be keeping our eyes out for any further information.

For now, you can stream Supernatural on Netflix before it makes the jump to Prime Video on December 1.

Pope Leo's visit to Turkey to mark the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea has triggered a strong backlash from many Turks, with critics accusing the Catholic leader of harboring political motives or seeking to revive the Crusades.

During his first official foreign trip, Pope Leo on Friday toured the remains of an ancient basilica submerged in Lake Iznik, believed to be the site where the Council of Nicaea convened in 325 CE.

One of early Christianity's most significant gatherings, the council brought together bishops from across the Christian world to resolve theological disputes that shaped the foundations of the religion's doctrines. 

The Pope and Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of the Greek Orthodox Church, jointly commemorated the anniversary by holding prayers in Iznik, which was known as Nicaea during the Roman era.

But the visit has drawn intense and often bizarre criticism from Turkish commentators, particularly secularist and nationalist politicians and pundits.

A map circulated widely on the social media platform X on Thursday showed western Turkey annexed by Greece and Istanbul portrayed as an “independent ecumenicity”, a reference to the ecumenical patriarchate based in the city. 

“Turkey is being squeezed into a triangle,” one user wrote while sharing the map in Greek. “Consider the Pope's visit and the activities of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in this context.” The map had originally been shared by the Greek news outlet Pentapostagma in 2022.

The Pope arrived in Ankara on Thursday and was welcomed with a military guard of honor, as he is also the Vatican's head of state. Photos of him receiving a salute from a senior Turkish officer have since gone viral.

“This is utterly disgraceful,” said Gokhan Avci, a retired Turkish military officer in a post that is now not accessible. 

“Did Iznik become the Vatican without us knowing?” asked Sabahat Akkiraz, a popular left-leaning folk singer.

Former Turkish Admiral Cihat Yayci, known for his Eurasianist views, took the criticism further.

“Under the pretext of the anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, a political-religious project aimed at ‘re-establishing Rome' and reviving the Crusader spirit is being carried out,” he said. “The Pope's arrival in Iznik on November 28 is no coincidence. T his is the date in 1095 when the decision was made to launch the Crusades against Islamic lands.”

Translation, which refers to the Turkic ruler of Attila the Hun: "From the era when Attila brought the Pope to his knees... to the time when salutes were sent to the Pope..."

Journalist Erdem Atay, another prominent secularist-nationalist voice, also claimed that the visit could lead Christians to demand land from Turkey.

“They will demand rights, they will demand land. What will you give - Heybeli Island, Imbros, or Tenedos? Iznik?” Atay said. “They're coming to form a Crusader front, an invasion attempt!”

Both Yayci and Atay claimed that similar “Vatican demands” had been rejected by Ottoman sultans and later by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.

A Turkish official familiar with Vatican affairs dismissed those claims, noting that the Catholic and Orthodox churches have been formally divided since the Great Schism of 1054.

“The two churches excommunicated each other in 1054 and remained divided until the 1960s, when a joint declaration called for reconciliation,” the official told Middle East Eye. “Before that, no Pope had ever met with the Patriarch of Istanbul.”

Selcuk Erenerol, spokesperson for the Turkish Orthodox Church, said Pope Leo should not be allowed to use the title “ecumenical”.

“It disrespects the integrity of our state, which is protected by the constitution and the Treaty of Lausanne,” he said.

Umit Dikbayir, a member of parliament from the main opposition CHP, said the visit carried geopolitical implications. “Even Turkish Christians see the danger and are objecting,” he claimed.

“The Pope organising a ceremony in his capacity as a head of state in Istanbul and Iznik goes against the principle of secularism enshrined in our constitution,” added Cemil Kilinc, a nationalist theologian.

Turkish officials, meanwhile, are divided over the visit. Some see it as an opportunity to present Turkey as a country where the world's oldest churches can freely operate and commemorate their shared heritage. Others worry about the backlash fuelled by conspiracy theories spreading online among both nationalist and some conservative groups.

US Vice President JD Vance had planned to join the Pope's visit but cancelled at the last minute, a move that eased concerns among Turkish officials, who feared his participation would fuel even more speculation.

Georgia Tech and NASA used advanced chromatography and a new computational tool to compare organic compounds in meteorite and terrestrial rock samples.

A joint study between the Georgia Institute of Technology (Atlanta, Georgia) and the Goddard Space Flight Center at NASA (Greenbelt, Maryland) analyzed a suite of meteoritic and terrestrial samples and systematically compared the molecular distribution of their organic contents using 2D gas chromatography coupled to high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (⁠⁠GC x GC-HR-TOF-MS). Hypothesizing that meteorite samples can be distinguished from terrestrial rocks by differences in the distributions of their organic compounds, this research led to a paper published in PNAS Nexus (1).

Future sample return missions—such as NASA's Mars Sample Return (MSR) and JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX)—aim to bring samples from the Martian system back to Earth, including material from environments that may once have harbored life. Critical to answering questions regarding the origins of life, these missions require the development of impartial tactics for the assessment of where the line dividing samples containing abiotically synthesized organic compounds from those containing biotic remnants of past or present life should be established (2-4). Included in these samples will be carbonaceous chondrites, which are a primitive and organically rich class of meteorites that represent the oldest solid materials in the Solar System obtainable for scientific analysis. The soluble organic compounds contained in these meteorites provide evidence of abiotic chemical reactions which existed before the beginning of life as we know it (5-7).

“Determining whether organic molecules in planetary samples originate from biological or nonbiological processes,” the authors wrote in their article, “is central to the search for life beyond Earth. Yet, distinguishing these origins is challenging due to overlapping chemical signatures and limited access to pristine extraterrestrial materials.” (1)

To deconvolute the resulting large dataset which resulted from their analysis, the team developed LifeTracer, a computational framework for processing and downstream machine learning (ML) analysis of mass spectrometry data. Leveraging analyte metrics from ⁠GC x GC-HR-TOF-MS, LifeTracer identified predictive molecular features that distinguish abiotic from biotic origins and enabled a robust classification of meteorites from terrestrial samples based on the composition of their nonpolar soluble organics (1).

“In contrast to traditional biomarker-based approaches,” the authors wrote, “LifeTracer analyzes untargeted chemical signatures to infer molecular origin with high accuracy. It enables scalable, unbiased biosignature detection and offers a powerful tool for interpreting complex organic mixtures returned by current and future planetary missions” (1).

LifeTracer identified an unbiased set of discriminative features across sample types, which enabled classification based on their organic distributions, without relying on the presence or absence of known biosignatures. However, scientists cannot rely on single organic molecules to determine whether extraterrestrial organics come from life or non-life, as many of these compounds appear in both. Therefore, overall molecular patterns are compared, which can act as biosignatures. As Martian samples already contain complex mixtures from multiple sources, advanced multivariate tools like LifeTracer—supported by machine learning and expert analysis—will be crucial for assessing whether any patterns resemble known biological or abiotic signatures, especially as Mars sample return missions progress (1).

Premier League • England


                                    Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is tipped to replace his struggling successor, Arne Slot                                

Speculation that Arne Slot is on the cusp of the Liverpool sack is starting to reach fever pitch in the wake of two sources explaining why a dramatic return to Anfield for Jurgen Klopp is ON – but it seems they only want the legendary coach back in an interim capacity with a major move planned for a Champions League-winning coach as a long-term successor.

The 2025/26 campaign could not have gone much worse for Slot, having overseen nine defeats in his last 12 games. With the Premier League champions effectively out of the title race already, having slipped 11 points behind Arsenal, Liverpool now also face a fight to qualify for the latter stages of the Champions League too.

In the bottom half of the Premier League is not where a club of Liverpool's stature expect to be; less so after going into the season as reigning Premier League champions and off the back of a £440m (€505m, $600m) influx of new players over the summer.

Their current run of form is the worst seen in 71 years at Anfield; little wonder that speculation that Slot faces the sack is gathering pace.

To that end, our correspondent, Fraser Fletcher, speaking to a strong source at Anfield, revealed on Thursday that Slot has been set a ‘non-negotiable' target to avoid the Liverpool sack and with FSG ‘rattled' by their midweek hammering to PSV in the Champions League.

Now off the back of his struggles, The Sun claims Liverpool are having serious conversations over potential successors and Slot's predecessor, Klopp, is ‘part of the conversation'.

The report states there are mounting concerns from the owners that Slot is ‘losing the dressing room' and they ‘could ask Klopp to make a dramatic return'.

And with journalist Marcel Reif, writing in BILD, claiming that Klopp is ‘hovering over Anfield like a UFO' in relation to his recent admission that a Liverpool return is possible on the Diary of a CEO podcast, talk of the 58-year-old's return to the club is starting to gather serious pace…

Reif wrote: ‘Liverpool isn't just in a mess. It's practically burned to the ground!

‘The timing of this statement (Klopp on Diary of a CEO) is terrible for Slot. He's hovering over Anfield like a UFO. All of Liverpool would carry him back on their shoulders. And it would be negligent if they didn't try to bring Klopp back.

‘In Liverpool, the scar from his departure is far from healed. I don't know what it's like being Global Head of Soccer and whether you ever start to wonder, ‘Is this really me?'

‘He was exhausted after that time. It took its toll. Now he looks very rested. Almost as if Arne Slot has to watch out…'

Bayern Munich's honorary president Uli Hoeness recently claimed Klopp will soon return to management and does not see him staying i his role as Head of Global Soccer for Red Bull in the long term.

“I could never imagine him as an official travelling around the country, to New York, looking after the various teams,” he said via BILD. “And I don't think that will be a good model in the long run. I also don't think he'll do that forever, I can't imagine it.

“I have always admired Jurgen Klopp as a coach who is on the pitch, who develops a team, who moves a team forward with his personality. I see Jurgen Klopp on the pitch and nowhere else.”

With Klopp seemingly only seen as a temporary solution at Liverpool, The Sun claims that FSG have ambitiously set their sights on appointing PSG coach Luis Enrique as the long-term successor.

Ironically, Slot has tried to mirror Enrique's playing style at Anfield, having been wowed by the French giants and their manager as they defeated Liverpool in the Champions League last season on their way to winning the competition.

That swashbuckling style of football dazzled Slot and was thought to be hugely influential as he set about his own summer transfer business, recruiting not just a new-look frontline, but in adding a pair of attack-minded full-backs to his mix.

Ultimately, though, that gamble has backfired, and Slot now presides over an almost intolerable situation that sees his position at Anfield hanging by a thread.

Elsewhere, another report claims FSG have drawn up a three-man shortlist of potential successors, two of whom are currently impressing in the Premier League and another who has been making waves in Germany.

Meanwhile, Slot has been told in no uncertain terms that he needs to immediately drop two underperforming players if he is to have any hope of keeping his job.

With the Dutchman now under intense pressure, our writers have debated his future at Anfield and having answered the question ‘ will Slot still be in charge of Liverpool by Christmas?‘

On the transfer front, Liverpool have a confirmed and genuine interest in signing Antoine Semenyo, though a transfer insider now firmly believes any move to bring the player to Anfield may be frozen until the summer amid a big concern aired by Slot.




                        Manchester United have received a major boost as they eye a January midfield signing, Tottenham are plotting an outrageous £145m double swoop, and Leeds have identified a high-calibre replacement for Farke                    


                        Sunderland manager Regis Le Bris is understood to be keen on a reunion with the 26-year-old, but Newcastle and Aston Villa are also interested in a January deal                    


                        David Ornstein has provided an update on what the future holds for Marc Guehi and it makes sobering reading for Liverpool                    


                        Five defeats in six, two wins in 10, and just 11 goals in 12 league matches have plunged Farke's future at Leeds into serious doubt - not that the manager is panicking                    


                        Fabrizio Romano and David Ornstein have provided telling updates on Manchester United and their plans to sign Wolves midfielder, Joao Gomes                    


                        The Gunners are reportedly ready to build on their stunning start to the new season by triggering the release clause of a top Bundesliga talent in the January window

Known as the 4th Psychological Operations-Airborne, or 4th PSYOP, the group specializes in “using the power of the mind to persuade opinion and discourse” among the nation's enemies.

The 1:17-second clip, posted Nov. 19 on social media, is a string of baffling clips, including old cartoons, masked figures hiding in plain sight and a group of people staring blankly at the viewer over the phrase: “We are everywhere.”

“There is another force applied in combat that we generally don't think of as a weapon of war. That weapon is words,” the video says. “Words are weapons. ... This is psychological warfare.”

The video then beckons: “Join PSYOP.”

As of Nov. 26, the video has racked up more than 15,000 views on Facebook and hundreds of comments and reactions, many noting it “goes hard” with subliminal messages.

Among the surprises found, references to conspiracy theories, the “Ghost Army” that deceived the Nazi generals in WWII and the popular Pepe the Frog GIF shows up in a clown suit. At one point, the phrase “anything we touch is a weapon” flashes and fades.

“Watch it over and over again. Great little nuggets of information for us,” Nidia Law posted on Facebook.

“A lot of crumb drops in this one,” TheJason wrote on Instagram.

“I think y'all have so much fun at work! Would love to be on the other side of this ‘fog show',” Leigh Eschew said on Instagram.

The U.S. Army noted in a 2024 article that the ideal candidate for psychological operations is “very cerebral and analytical,” which means different types of recruitment methods are required. The group's recruitment videos are infrequent and tend to cause a stir due to the unusual content.

“The art of PSYOP relies on persuasion rather than physical force. The tools of the trade are logic, fear, desire and other mental factors used to evoke specific emotions, attitudes and behaviors,” according to a U.S. Army report. “The ultimate objective is to persuade enemy, neutral and friendly nations and forces to take favorable actions toward the U.S. and its allies.”

The 4th PSYOP is often referred to as “the ghost in the machine,” because its operations are seldom publicized.

It is based out of Fort Bragg – one of the largest military complexes in the world – and home of the 82nd Airborne and U.S. Army Special Operations Command. The fort covers about 251-square miles is about a 65-mile drive south from downtown Raleigh.

“PSYOP soldiers help ensure decision-makers, partners, and populations receive the right message at the right time. Quiet professionals. Global impact,” the 1st Special Forces Command-Airborne wrote in a post that shared the recruitment video.

Supernatural movies are a category all their own. They can be comedies, thrillers, horror flicks, or even romances. What sets them apart from other out-there genres—say, fantasy or sci-fi—is simple: the otherworldly element arrives in our world. Fantasy often builds entirely new worlds; sci-fi takes us into the future or outer space. Supernatural films, by contrast, bring the unexplainable into ordinary life.

Culturally, these movies endure because they tap into a general curiosity about what's lurking beyond our grasp. They entertain, yes, but they also remind us that the universe is bigger, stranger, and far less orderly than we pretend. And if the bumps in the night and the occasional flicker in the dark suggest there's more out there than meets the eye, supernatural films are our way of admitting we've noticed.



Director Ari Aster builds a family drama that slowly mutates into a supernatural catastrophe. Strange visions, cryptic symbols, and unexplained deaths stalk the Graham family until the source reveals itself: a demonic plot generations in the making. Toni Collette's performance anchors the chaos, making the horror feel painfully domestic. The film became a cultural lightning rod because it treated the supernatural with the seriousness of real trauma, particularly how grief can completely destabilize a family.

A group of college friends discovers the Necronomicon in a remote cabin, unleashing a relentless demonic force. Ash Williams fights for survival as objects animate, limbs are possessed, and the woods themselves seem alive. Sam Raimi's low-budget creativity turns gore into spectacle, balancing horror with absurdity. The film's legacy is manic and chaotic. It's as much slapstick as it is terrifying, cementing its place as a cult classic in supernatural cinema.

Most people leave a psychic reading with vague predictions about love or money, but TikToker Ashlin (@ashlin_rose) left with something a lot more dramatic.

She found out that her dad had a secret family in another country through a psychic.

One day, her mom called and asked if she was interested in seeing a psychic. Ashlin wasn't really interested, but her mom had already paid for it because she was hosting a psychic reading night at her house for one of her friends' birthdays.

They had pre-booked five spaces, but one of the friends was unable to make it. So, Ashlin decided to take the open spot. The following night, she went to her mom's house. Everyone gathered in the kitchen and went into the living room one by one for their readings.

When it was her turn, she started chatting with the psychic but tried not to give too much information about herself. The psychic saw that Ashlin had a sister, which was obvious because there were photos of her family around the house. Ashlin did not have high hopes.

But then, the psychic said that there was a third child. Ashlin told her that it was just her and her sister, but the psychic kept emphasizing a third child.

Ashlin suddenly remembered that her mom lost a baby after having her and before having her sister. She was quite far along and had to be rushed into lifesaving surgery.

Ashlin thought the psychic might be referring to this baby. The psychic asked if she knew someone named Jack, but Ashlin did not.

The last thing the psychic said was that a jack-in-the-box was going to come out and surprise everyone.

The whole reading took about 10 minutes. Afterward, Ashlin went back out to the kitchen and told her mom and her friends what the psychic had said.

A couple of days later, her mom called her, sobbing over the phone. Ashlin rushed over immediately, thinking her mom was having health issues. Ashlin, her sister, and their dad gathered around trying to console her. That's when their dad revealed he had a son.

Later, when Ashlin asked her mom how the topic had even come up, she told her that it was all because of the psychic. She brought up what the psychic said to Ashlin during dinner with the family, causing Ashlin's dad to look like he had seen a ghost.

Ashlin's mom confronted him when they were alone. Ashlin's dad admitted that he had a son who was 10 years old, and his name was Jack.

Jack was half-Vietnamese and was raised in Vietnam. Ashlin's dad didn't believe the psychic story and thought one of his work colleagues snitched on him.

Ashlin doesn't know if the psychic's powers were actually real, but she believes this was all meant to happen; otherwise, they wouldn't have found out about the secret family until her father had gone to his grave.
