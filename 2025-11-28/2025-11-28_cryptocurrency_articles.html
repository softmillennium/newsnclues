                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stablecoin issuer Tether is halting its Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay. Local media reported that El Salvador-based Tether had confirmed to Uruguay's Ministry of Labor and Social Security that it was laying off 30 of its 38 employees in the country. Tether did not immediately respond to Decrypt's questions. Tether issues USDT—the most-traded digital coin in the crypto world, and the third-biggest digital asset with a $184.4 billion market cap. The token is dubbed a digital dollar: It is backed by reserves, according to Tether, that keep it at a 1:1 par with the US dollar. Cantor Fitzgerald, previously headed up by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's, currently custodies billions of dollars in assets that back Tether. Traders in the crypto world can use USDT to quickly enter and exit digital transactions like Bitcoin buys. South American countries have been eyed up by Bitcoin miners due to their cheap energy. The crypto mining industry requires huge data centers full of expensive computers that use large amounts of electricity to process transactions on the blockchain and mint new tokens. Tether is making further inroads into Latin America after relocating to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador in January.</p>

Bitcoin dominance has dropped to the 23.6 Fibonacci retracement level, falling to 59% and continuing a decline that began in early November, potentially signaling the start of an altcoin rotation as the leading cryptocurrency's market share pulls back from recent highs.

The pullback in Bitcoin dominance follows a rejection at a major resistance zone, with the current level representing a key technical threshold that traders monitor for market rotation signals.

Bitcoin dominance tracks the cryptocurrency's market capitalization relative to the broader crypto market. A decline in this metric typically indicates liquidity shifting away from Bitcoin toward alternative digital assets.

The current retreat to the 23.6% Fibonacci level suggests early-stage rotation into altcoins, as lower dominance levels historically correlate with increased investment flows into non-Bitcoin cryptocurrencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of U.S. chipmaker Intel were leading the S&P higher as stocks edged upward on a holiday-shortened Black Friday session expected to be light on trading volume and corporate news. It's an abridged day for traders after yesterday's holiday break: The stock market closes at 1 p.m., while the bond market is set to close an hour later. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's action here.) Intel (INTC) was the biggest mover, on a percentage basis, on the S&P 500 in either direction, rising about 8%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) was the biggest decliner, slipping close to 3%. A few consumer-focused companies were among the top movers on Black Friday, a vital in-store and online shopping day. Brown-Forman (BF.A, BF.B), known for Jack Daniel's whiskeys and Herradura tequilas, among other things, was up 1.5%, while athletic apparel company Lululemon (LULU) was more than 2% higher. Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY), which reported its latest quarterly financial results earlier this week, was more than 1% lower. Shares of crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) were recently up nearly 4%. Cathie Wood's ARK funds have reported purchases of the stock this week; the price of Bitcoin was recently changing hands around $92,000 as the leading cryptocurrency extended its bounce off recent lows.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Australian government has introduced a bill to regulate digital asset platforms, requiring them to hold financial services licenses. This move toward regulatory clarity is a green light for the industry, indicating that crypto is becoming a permanent fixture in the global financial system. However, investors are looking for the best altcoins to buy, with DeepSnitch AI becoming the top choice for a project that will deliver immediate gains. Australia's Assistant Treasurer Daniel Mulino introduced the Corporations Amendment (Digital Assets Framework) Bill 2025 to the House of Representatives. This legislation is a step in bringing the crypto industry under the umbrella of existing financial services laws. Mulino explained the necessity of this regulation during his address. The bill aims to provide a structured environment for digital asset platforms, ensuring consumer protection while fostering a stable ecosystem for growth. While regulators build frameworks, the market is still bearish, with investors trying to recover from Bitcoin bleeding. It is among the best altcoins to buy if you see serious gains. If you have not heard of it before, the SnitchFeed AI agent actively tracks whale movements and sentiment shifts. SnitchScan is live as a concept, designed to be a “bear-proof” scam filter that audits contracts for risk before you invest. Staking is also live, offering a dynamic, uncapped APY that has already attracted significant participation. Now, imagine DeepSnitch AI that has that same viral marketing energy (a 30% marketing allocation) combined with essential, high-demand utility. That's why joining the presale now, with a launch planned by January, is the best choice for smart investors. This project, which has already delivered massive gains from its lows, proves that the market has an appetite for viral narratives. Technical analysts predict that by 2027, FARTCOIN could trade between $1.48 and $1.75, with an average of $1.52. This bullish outlook suggests that despite being a “joke” coin, it is still among the best altcoins to buy. However, for new investors, the massive 1600% move has already happened. This suggests that while short-term volatility is high, the project has strong fundamental value to be among the best altcoins to buy. Australia's new bill confirms that crypto is here to stay. While established meme coins like Fartcoin have had their 1600% moment, the real opportunity lies in finding the next breakout star. With over $609,000 raised and a January launch planned, this is one of the best altcoins to buy for those seeking exponential growth in 2026. DeepSnitch AI is one of the best altcoins to buy because it offers asymmetric upside. It is a low-cap presale in the AI sector. While specific ChatGPT crypto predictions vary, AI models generally favor sectors with high growth potential. The altcoin forecast 2026 shows tokens like DeepSnitch AI are the best options for anyone who wants a chance at massive gains. This article is not intended as financial advice.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Simple Proof, the bitcoin-based document timestamping company, recently announced official partnerships with El Salvador's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Environment to protect The collaboration marks El Salvador's continued leadership in applying Bitcoin technology beyond financial applications. Both ministries have begun registering official documents on the Bitcoin blockchain, with verified records now publicly accessible through dedicated government portals. “Bitcoin is not just digital money — it's also a clock that no one controls. This allows us to certify with precision the exact moment a document was created, guaranteeing its authenticity and protecting the country's history forever… We're helping ensure that the country's history is preserved intact and can be verified directly on Bitcoin, without intermediaries,” said Carlos Toriello, CEO of Simple Proof, in a press release shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The Ministry of Environment's timestamped documents, including national reports and public files, are available at blockchain.ambiente.gob.sv. Peter Todd, creator of OpenTimestamps, the platform and protocol used in part to time-stamp critical data on the Bitcoin blockchain, said in the press release that, “With a single transaction, we can protect millions of documents without congesting the network or altering its monetary function,” noting that the system stores only cryptographic hashes rather than actual documents on Bitcoin. The project positions El Salvador as a global reference for using blockchain technology in government information management, strengthening the transparency and public trust of democratic institutions and processes, by eliminating the possibility of document tampering. Established in 2012, Bitcoin Magazine is the oldest and most established source of trustworthy news, information and thought leadership on Bitcoin.</p>

Bitcoin miners have returned to China in recent months, tempted by cheap electricity and data center boom, according to a Reuters report citing data from Hashrate Index that found China made up 14% of the global bitcoin mining market at the end of October. “The resurgence of mining activity in China is one of the most important signals the market has seen in years,” Patrick Gruhn, chief executive of crypto market infrastructure company Perpetuals.com, told the newswire, adding “even hints of China's policy easing could act as a tailwind for bitcoin's narrative as a global, state-resilient asset.” Bitcoin and crypto trading, as well as the mining of cryptocurrency using high-powered computers to secure crypto networks in exchange for newly minted coins, remains illegal in mainland China following a 2021 ban. Subtle local policy shifts, economic incentives, and overbuilt infrastructure support the rebound, with China now controlling 21% of global mining capacity. This resurgence demonstrates how financial incentives can override regulatory barriers, influencing global bitcoin supply and stabilising network activity.” Sign up now for CryptoCodex—A free crypto newsletter that will get you ahead of the market “Because in crypto it's a kind of an industry where basically you're going to have number one and you're not gonna have a number two.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FILE PHOTO: Michael Saylor, executive chairman and co-founder of Strategy, speaks during the "Bitcoin Treasuries Unconference" cryptocurrency event, in New York City, New York, U.S., September 17, 2025. (Reuters) -Fresh turbulence in the crypto market is weighing on shares of companies that stockpile bitcoin and other tokens on their balance sheets, stoking concerns over stress in the niche but fast-growing sector. Buoyed by U.S. President Donald Trump's crypto-friendly stance and inspired by the meteoric success of Michael Saylor's Strategy, the number of publicly traded companies investing in cryptocurrencies in the hopes they will appreciate has boomed this year. However, concerns over a potential AI bubble and uncertainty over the path of U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts have weighed on risk assets lately, pushing bitcoin this month to its lowest level since April and sending many of these "digital asset treasury" or DAT companies wobbling. At least 15 bitcoin treasury companies were trading below the net asset value of their tokens as of Friday, according to data from crypto publication The Block. With DATs holding 4% of all bitcoin, 3.1% of all ether and 0.8% of all solana, their fortunes could have major implications for coin prices, Standard Chartered analysts wrote in a September note, adding they expected consolidation in the space. DAT executives say their success will be rooted in their ability to make smart investing decisions, and many are seeking new ways to generate income. Shares of bitcoin DATs, the most prevalent type, have fallen substantially from their 2025 highs. Michael Saylor's Strategy - which pioneered corporate bitcoin hoarding, spawning dozens of copycats that have saturated the market - has dropped almost 36% in November alone. As the bitcoin DAT sector became overcrowded, new entrants have diversified into other coins including ether, with firms like Bitmine and Sharplink Gaming leading the charge into ether. Several companies have also broadened their holdings to include "altcoins" such as solana and Ripple's XRP. Small companies have also started to dip into more thinly traded volatile tokens in a bid to boost their profits, creating more potential volatility risk for their share price.

The SARB confirmed that a retail CBDC is technically feasible but unnecessary at present. It believes that ongoing payment reforms will deliver faster and broader financial inclusion in the near term. The central bank emphasized that current upgrades aim to enhance settlement efficiency and inclusivity. It sees this approach as a more practical step toward strengthening digital finance. The SARB wants to ensure that any future CBDC aligns with national policy goals and regulatory frameworks. Although South Africa will not issue a retail CBDC soon, the central bank maintains flexibility for future adoption. It insists that such a system must match cash in affordability ease of use, privacy and offline capability. The SARB's studies found that financial inclusion remains a key challenge, with about 16% of adults still unbanked. It believes that strengthening digital payments through reforms will achieve better outcomes in the short term. It plans to monitor international progress and adjust its stance when necessary. The central bank's position paper highlighted that future demand for a CBDC could arise as technology and consumer needs evolve. This balanced approach will ensure readiness for digital transformation when the timing proves appropriate. The SARB will now deepen its exploration of wholesale CBDC applications. These efforts will assess how digital currencies can improve settlement systems and cross-border transactions. The findings are expected to guide future decisions regarding a broader CBDC rollout. The bank has warned that unregulated crypto assets and stablecoins pose growing financial risks. It is developing new regulations with the National Treasury to strengthen oversight and prevent misuse. The Financial Sector Conduct Authority has already begun licensing crypto service providers. Nigeria, Jamaica and The Bahamas have launched digital currencies but seen limited adoption. In this context, South Africa's cautious strategy reflects its focus on practical reforms that enhance financial stability and digital efficiency.

DeCurret DCP has signed a basic agreement for collaboration with Shinoken Group and JAPAN POST BANK for collaboration to utilize JAPAN POST BANK's tokenized deposits. This proof-of-concept (PoC) will verify the automation and efficiency of payments utilizing tokenized deposits,… pic.twitter.com/MO5noEV5Fg The initiative represents the first-ever attempt to introduce tokenized deposits into real estate payment workflows in Japan—a sector long burdened by paper-based procedures and slow settlement times. The pilot combines Shinoken Group's real estate expertise with DeCurret DCP's blockchain infrastructure to test improvements in settlement efficiency, cost reduction, and automation. Traditional real estate transactions in Japan often involve high-value transfers, multiple intermediaries, and lengthy processing times. By incorporating DCJPY, the companies aim to enable instant settlement for transactions involving security tokens, NFTs, and other digitized assets. In an August 2024 review, the Bank of Japan noted that tokenized deposits align well with the current monetary system and highlighted their advantages in tamper resistance and operational resilience. The institution plans to begin full-scale deployment of tokenized deposit services by fiscal year 2026. DeCurret DCP has already collaborated with partners such as GMO Aozora Net Bank to test blockchain-based settlement for digital bonds and environmental value certificates. The new real estate pilot could significantly accelerate blockchain adoption in Japan's financial infrastructure.

He has contributed to leading publications such as Cryptonews, Investing.com, 99Bitcoins, and 24/7 Wall St. South Africa's central bank has cooled expectations for a retail central bank digital currency, saying the country does not face an urgent need to launch one and should focus instead on upgrading the existing payments system. The bank argued that current reforms aimed at improving the national payments rails, adding faster settlement, and widening participation by non-bank providers offer a more practical route to better financial access for now. Rather than pursuing a digital rand for everyday use, the central bank plans to focus on wholesale applications of digital currency and on boosting the efficiency of cross-border payments. SARB's researchers also tested whether a retail CBDC would solve gaps in the country's payments network and found mixed results. About 16% of adults remain unbanked, but the bank said a digital currency would need to match or beat cash on key features such as offline use, universal acceptance, ease of use, privacy and low cost to make a meaningful dent in that number.
