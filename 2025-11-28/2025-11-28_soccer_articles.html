                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Washington, D.C., could host some World Cup games after all. The still-to-be-built Washington Commanders stadium was among 14 U.S. sites listed as potential hosts for the women's World Cup in 2031 in the bid book submitted Friday, Nov. 28, to FIFA by the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica. FIFA also released the bid book for the 2035 tournament, a joint bid by England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. That tournament also will be awarded in April. But Charlotte, Denver, Minneapolis, Nashville, Orlando, San Diego and Washington, D.C., are also on the list of cities and stadiums for FIFA to evaluate as possible 2031 hosts. But Snyder is gone, and new Commanders owner Josh Harris is planning a $3.7 billion stadium on the old RFK Stadium site. Washington is also an epicenter for women's soccer in the United States. "Washington will use this platform to create safe places to play, elevate women in leadership, and ensure every girl can see herself in the game," according to the description of Washington in the bid book. Seattle, Los Angeles, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and New York/New Jersey, all of which will hold games in 2026, are also listed as potential hosts. Costa Rica and Jamaica identified one host city each, San José in Costa Rica and Kingston in Jamaica. The tournament will be held in mid-June through late July, though specific dates were not given. Given Costa Rica and Jamaica's stadiums seat a maximum of 37,000, however, it's likely the United States would host the latter knockout-round games, including the final. In 2026, Mexico and Canada are hosting games through the round of 16.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Soccer Federation, along with counterparts in Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica, has submitted 36 cities or metro areas and 50 stadiums as potential host sites for the 2031 women's World Cup. Still, they are required to submit an official “bid book” and go through a formal evaluation process, concluding with a vote that will confirm them as co-hosts next year. Ahead of a Friday deadline, U.S. Soccer submitted the bid book — and, within it, dozens of potential host cities, including 28 in the U.S., six in Mexico, and one each in Costa Rica (San José) and Jamaica (Kingston). All 11 U.S. cities set to host the 2026 men's World Cup are on the broader list, though not all stadiums are — Hard Rock Stadium near Miami is not mentioned. And three others are not on the list of 20 stadiums highlighted as the “representative sample.” Those 20, bid officials wrote, will be “subject to FIFA's formal bid evaluation and are generally representative of the bid composition in which matches could be staged across the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica, and Jamaica.” The four cities and stadiums in Mexico are: They are unsure how many games they'll hold at large capacity, multi-deck NFL stadiums and how many they'll hold at more intimate grounds that will be easier to fill. In some of the 14 U.S. cities above, secondary options are also listed: The final sites will likely be determined sometime after the 2027 women's World Cup, which will take place in Brazil. Bid officials have proposed Atlanta at the site for the World Cup draw and Dallas as host of the international broadcast center, though both decisions will ultimately be made by FIFA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Inter Miami aim to defend home turf against NYCFC, while San Diego visit Vancouver in two finely poised conference finals. Zoom out, consider the options, and try to be objective, and maybe we were always headed here. As much as the haters wanted Inter Miami to stumble, the Lionel Messi storyline is simply too rich to ignore. San Diego FC have been good all season and fully merit their spot. Vancouver's acquisition of Thomas Muller last summer signaled their ambition - and their willingness to spend big to get here. Credit to the Pigeons, who have ticked every “Cinderella story” box imaginable. But can anyone realistically stop Miami now? And will Vancouver's massive investment in Muller pay off with an MLS Cup final appearance? GOAL U.S. writers break down two massive matches in another edition of… The Rondo. Tom Hindle: Is it immensely offensive to NYCFC to say this might not be particularly close? Miami are too good for pretty much anyone at the moment, and if that Messi guy shows up this should really be an unfortunate formality for the Herons. Ryan Tolmich: If NYCFC were full strength, maybe this would be a bit closer. Miami should cruise through this as a result, giving Messi his first crack at an MLS Cup. Atlanta United is obviously the famous MLS playoff one in recent memory, but this would run it close. The Pigeons might have a shot in other circumstances, but they're without their main goalscoring threat. Pascal Jansen has them playing some good stuff, and they won't be embarrassed, but they simply don't have the quality to get it done. Now, Miami have fallen before, and last season's loss to Atlanta was an all-time MLS upset. This, though, would probably be even crazier than that given the circumstances and stakes, even if it is a one-off game. Javier Mascherano has found a winning combination with Mateo Silvetti in the XI, and it should be enough to carry Miami into the MLS Cup final. Now, if they get there, it might be a different story. But El Pistolero should be on the bench for now. Plus, is it the worst thing to have Suarez off the bench as a "break in case of emergency" supersub? TH: This is a really tough one. Thomas Muller is a star through and through, and they're good enough at the back, too. San Diego will play some tasty stuff, but it's hard to look past Muller and Co. San Diego, too, have some of those vibes given all they've accomplished, but the Whitecaps' run still feels just a bit more real given the talent they've amassed to make it happen. Expansion seasons are notoriously hard, even with the clean slate and abundance of resources. To get here, you have to get every single thing right, and San Diego has generally done that. Credit to them for making it this far, and if they can make it one step further, it would be a huge credit to the decision-makers at that club for putting it all together. TH: It would absolutely have to be. St. Louis City were quality a couple of years ago, but San Diego have made it happen in the big games in the way they simply couldn't. We've seen some good expansion seasons lately, notably St. Louis recently, but an MLS Cup final appearance would trump everything. It takes so much for a club to reach this level, and it can't all be a fluke. Because of that, San Diego would rocket right to the top of the list, if they aren't there already.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran among nations under restrictions issued by Trump Iran is one of 19 nations whose citizens are restricted from entering the US since a directive issued by Donald Trump in June. An exemption to the ban was granted to athletes, coaches or “persons performing a necessary support role” who were travelling for the World Cup or “other major sporting event”, but appears not to have been applied in this instance. Reports in October suggested both Taj and Ghalenoei had seen their visa applications rejected, with the Tehran Times reporting that the FFIRI had taken up the issue personally with Fifa's president, Gianni Infantino. Infantino has previously pledged that “everyone will be welcome” at the World Cup, which begins in Mexico City on 11 June. Speaking on the sidelines of an assembly of the European Football Clubs organisation on 9 October, he had sought to calm concerns that visas could be denied to athletes or officials. There is a White House task force chaired by President Trump, and all these topics are discussed there,” Infantino said. “With all the relevant secretaries of state, there will be no issues with regard to visas, obviously for the participating teams and delegations, and we are working on something as well for fans. Hopefully, some good news will come out very soon.” According to reporting in Politico, fans of Haiti – who qualified for their second World Cup last week but whose nation is also on Trump's restricted travel list – are able to submit visa applications but “may be ineligible for visa issuance or admission to the United States”.</p>

So if your country isn't at the World Cup, who should you support? Well, everyone loves an underdog, so why not pick one of these plucky outsiders as your team for the tournament? Dick Advocaat has been the national manager of eight different countries but called qualifying with Curacao "the craziest thing I've ever achieved as a coach" With only 155,000 inhabitants and 444 sq km of territory, Curacao is the smallest nation ever to qualify for a World Cup, in terms of both population and size. Victory meant the Blue Sharks secured top spot in their group and a place at the 2026 tournament ahead of continental heavyweights Cameroon. Centre-back Roberto "Pico" Lopes – who was born and plays in Ireland – got his first call-up via an approach on business networking website LinkedIn. 'Biggest thing since independence' - Cape Verde celebrates World Cup spot World Cup-bound Cape Verdean Lopes relishing his week to remember Uzbekistan put itself on the footballing map in 2008 when club side Bunyodkor announced the signing of top Brazilian forward Rivaldo, with fellow countryman and superstar Zico as manager. Both stayed only briefly but football's development there has been longer lasting. Having narrowly missed out before, the White Wolves will make their debut next year under the guidance of former Italy centre-back and 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro. Jordan fans have known they will be going to the finals since June, when they clinched qualification with a 3-0 away win in Oman. History made: Debutants Uzbekistan and Jordan celebrate World Cup places Haiti's coach, 52-year-old Frenchman Sebastien Migne, has never even visited the country. Nearly 1.3 million people have been internally displaced by the gang-related violence, which kills thousands each year. "My players will be wonderful ambassadors for a country that sorely needs them," Migne told the AFP news agency. "Haiti is not an easy place, with a people who are suffering and don't have many opportunities to celebrate." "It's a good draw, because on paper we are the stronger side," former captain Gabriel Zakuani told BBC Sport Africa. DR Congo and M23 rebels sign framework for peace in Qatar Iraq is another team hoping to qualify via those play-offs - and another country with a recent history of conflict and sectarian strife. They will need to beat both Jamaica and DR Congo. Earlier in qualifying, they knocked out fellow Pacific islanders Tahiti. Finally, Suriname are the lowest-ranked team still in with a chance. Currently 123rd in Fifa's world rankings, they must get past Bolivia and the aforementioned Iraq. Critics say it could lead to mismatches and less competition, while others point to the glorious upsets and nerve-wracking drama that a growing tournament has generated since the original competition in 1930, which featured only 13 teams. It seems likely Fifa will continue to expand its scale and ambition, with the event's organisers already discussing a proposal for 64 teams to compete in the 2030 finals.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iranian Football Federation officials will not attend next Friday's World Cup draw in Washington, D.C. after accusing the U.S. of refusing to grant visas to several members of its delegation. Iranian officials are now seeking help from FIFA President Gianni Infantino, who has cozied up to U.S. President Donald Trump in a bid to ensure the 2026 Men's World Cup in North America goes smoothly. FIFA, the world football governing body, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Infantino met with Trump this month to discuss a faster visa interview process for foreign World Cup spectators, calling it the “FIFA Pass,” as the U.S. maintains a tough posture on gaining entry to the country for many foreigners. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio recently emphasized that match tickets were not automatically a grant for a tourist visa. Last week, the Trump administration announced that fans from Haiti, which qualified for the World Cup for the first time since 1974, will not be granted any special exceptions to follow their team. Iran qualified for the 2026 World Cup after a win over Pakistan in March. It is the country's fourth consecutive World Cup. Iran and the U.S. have not had diplomatic ties for more than 45 years. U.N. humanitarian aid chief Tom Fletcher describes Darfur in the west of the country as “an absolute horror show” and “a crime scene.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United have released concept images of their proposed new stadium England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland's joint bid stands unopposed and could be ratified by a vote in a Fifa congress in 2026. If redevelopment plans do not go ahead, Old Trafford will still be considered in its current form. In total the 21 other stadiums set to feature include Birmingham City's planned new stadium and Wembley - which is likely to host the final. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: "The Lionesses' success has inspired girls across our country, and we'll build on that momentum by welcoming millions of football fans from around the world to a tournament that will benefit communities and businesses in host cities up and down the UK." England head coach Sarina Wiegman added: "It's so much more than football, I think. The bid submission includes "Old Trafford in its current form" as proposals for a new 100,000-capacity stadium were not deemed sufficiently detailed for Fifa evaluation. United announced plans for a revamped stadium in March and hope it will be completed in five years - although further progress has not yet been made. Meanwhile, Birmingham City unveiled plans for their 62,000-seater Powerhouse Stadium in November, with a completion date set for the start of the 2030-2031 season. Stok Cae Ras in Wrexham does not currently meet Fifa requirements, although there is planned redevelopment work which would make it eligible once completed. Stamford Bridge also does not meet Fifa standards, so whether or not a Chelsea stadium can be considered for the tournament will depend on the outcome of a consultation on a new home which is under way. The UK and Republic of Ireland's joint bid to host Euro 2028 included Casement Park and Hill Dickinson Stadium, which were both unbuilt at the time of submission. Casement Park will not be finished in time for the tournament, while Hill Dickinson Stadium has been selected as one of nine host grounds. Wrexham's Cae Ras to form part of UK World Cup bid Quite a few cities are going to be left disappointed. That is why the likes of the Sports Quarter Stadium and Old Trafford, on which construction work is planned but not close to starting, have been included. Fifa will hold on-site visits in February, before the publication of an evaluation report in March and a potential host vote on 30 April at the governing body's congress. But with so many more grounds needed (Brazil 2027 is only using eight) for an expanded 48-team tournament, you would think venue selection will come earlier. The final decision will rest with Fifa but it is likely to be 2031 before we find out.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With an estimated 100 club scouts in attendance representing Europe's biggest academies and recruitment departments, this edition has effectively doubled as a live showcase for the game's next wave of talent. Amid a field full of sharp technicians, prolific goal-scorers and tactically advanced midfielders, a handful have stood out for their consistency, match-changing ability and maturity beyond their age group. - Who are the breakout U21 Champions League players you don't know? - Why everyone is talking about Bayern Munich's new star Lennart Karl, 17 - What's in a soccer contract? A product of Salzburg's academy -- with minutes at their feeder side Liefering as an introduction to senior football in Austria's second tier -- he plays as an attacking midfielder/winger who drifts inside (usually from the left) to attack the box. Moser ended as the tournament's top scorer , and his eight goals in Qatar have represented a diverse mix of what he offers: composed one-touch finishes from tight angles, a driven strike from distance, a strike with his weaker left foot from inside the box and several smartly timed surges into the penalty area. Beyond the scoring, he's vivacious, plays smart combinations and has an excellent work rate. Cabral has been Portugal's reliable focal point up front, combining power with tidy left-footed finishes and headers. A Benfica academy centre-forward who has yet to debut for the first team, or even their B side, he's used this tournament to show he may eventually become Portugal's next senior No. There have been sharp diagonal runs across defenders, pulling away from markers in the box and crisp finishes, capitalising on poor defending and first-time strikes on his favoured left foot. Cabral's physical strength, high running power and good general technique already make him an early target for foreign clubs. Operating as a right-footed inverted winger off the left, he's repeatedly showed off his excellent first touch, explosive acceleration and technically clean shooting skills. Even in the heavy loss to Austria, he remained England's most consistent attacking threat. 10 or an inverted winger from the right, left-footed Dembélé pulled the playmaking strings in midfield with a low-centre-of-gravity dribbling style, sharp footwork, quick direction changes and a mid-distance strike that caught goalkeepers by surprise. From advanced midfield positions he plays between the lines, picking out runners with deft touches and exploiting half-spaces to accelerate tempo. His ball retention under pressure and sharp vision in tight zones are other highlights, a proper attacking orchestrator who registered seven key passes from the five games he played. Watch your favorite events in the newly upgraded ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. The Benfica full-back has been one of Portugal's defining figures in Qatar. At 184cm (6 feet) in height he can also slot in at centre-back and his solid physique allows him to set off on long, powerful strides and an assertive left foot for crosses and switches. A disciplined, well-schooled defender, capable of holding his own physically while offering reliable attacking output by way of strong stamina and fine ball-carrying. In this tournament he has also added proper end-product in the shape of a brace and two assists in the 6-0 win over Morocco, plus a further two against Switzerland and New Caledonia -- three of which were excellent left-footed strikes from the edge of the box, plus one header. Neto often arrives late at the back post, times unbalancing underlapping runs well and is excellent in both phases of the game. His combination of size, athleticism and technical tidiness suggests that he might soon be ripe for first-team football. Technically neat on his first touch, industrious and comfortable receiving between the lines, he often links play before accelerating through gaps with repeated, powerful carries. The only blemish came with his red card in the semifinal loss to Austria after already being substituted, a disappointing ending to an otherwise outstanding tournament performance. Perhaps not the most naturally talented member of a somewhat underwhelming Brazil side, Dell relies on sharp movement, constant activity around the box, industry and a razor-sharp, efficient finishing technique. In Qatar he found the net five times, mainly thanks to close-range taps-ins from crosses or cut-backs, highlighting his outstanding sense of opportunism. Though not one to repeatedly beat opponent with take-ons, his anticipation, relentless pressing, intensity and box intelligence has drawn reported interest from Manchester City. The Benfica academy player often plays as a lone No.6 as he anchors possession with quick, vertical passes and a reliable first touch that allows Portugal to escape pressure. Out of possession, the Portugal captain reads danger early, blocks passing lanes, relying on positional awareness and body orientation rather than risky tackles. Quintas also contributes well attacking-wise with late supporting runs, smart diagonals to switch play and the occasional disguised pass to find wingers in the half-spaces.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The World Cup draw can determine a nation's confidence ahead of football's showpiece event. On Friday, December 5, at 12pm ET (9am PT; 5pm GMT), the draw for next summer's tournament in the U.S., Canada and Mexico takes place from the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts in Washington , D.C., with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to be in attendance. A special shoutout to those fans who bought tickets during early lotteries without knowing the teams involved. Here's what you can expect from the 2026 World Cup draw. In the United Kingdom, it will be broadcast on the BBC and BBC iPlayer, while in the U.S., viewers can tune into Fox and Fubo. Before the draw, teams will be seeded and divided into four pots based on their FIFA rankings as of November/December 2025. Teams will be randomly drawn from each pot and assigned to one of the 12 groups. However, teams from the same confederation cannot meet — except for UEFA. There can be up to two European teams per group. With the first game of the 2026 World Cup taking place at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11, Mexico have automatically been assigned to Group A. As the graphic below shows, there are plenty of countries in the other pots that could cause the top teams problems, such as Erling Haaland's Norway and Mohamed Salah's Egypt in Pot 3. During March, a further four teams will qualify from the UEFA play-off qualifiers and two from the FIFA Confederation play-off qualifiers. Sixteen teams are in UEFA's play-offs, with four-time winners Italy needing to overcome Northern Ireland and then Wales or Bosnia and Herzegovina to reach next year's tournament. All qualifiers will be placed into pot four, leading to some potentially tricky draws, such as four-time winners Italy, were they to progress. Four nations have qualified for their first World Cup. The Caribbean island of Curacao, a nation of 185,000 people, became the smallest nation to ever qualify for a World Cup after they progressed thanks to a goalless draw against Jamaica in Kingston. Haiti, DR Congo and Panama, have qualified before, but are still looking for their first World Cup victories. This time around, with eight of the third-place teams progressing, it may only take one win to reach the knockout stages. Many fans will likely be hoping their team is drawn against one of the three host nations from Pot 1 to avoid the nine highest-rated FIFA nations. Although the UWMNT's 5-1 thumping of Uruguay in Florida earlier this month suggests Mauricio Pochettino's men will be difficult to beat on home soil. Based on form and recent World Cup history, the most formidable opponents are likely to be holders Argentina and 2022 finalists France. World No 2 Argentina finished top of CONMEBOL qualifying, while France didn't lose a game during their qualifying campaign. Spain are European champions and the world's No 1 team who boast Barcelona star Lamine Yamal in their ranks. No one will want to be drawn against one of the favourites to win the competition. And then there's England, who qualified with a 100 per cent record. Norway did, too, but England did not concede a single goal in their eight qualifying matches. “In an increasingly unsettled and divided world, it's fundamental to recognise the outstanding contribution of those who work hard to end conflicts and bring people together in a spirit of peace,” Infantino said in a FIFA statement, adding that the prize would “recognise the enormous efforts of those individuals who unite people, bringing hope for future generations”. It is not yet known who the recipient will be, but as The Athletic's Adam Crafton reported earlier this month, FIFA's description “fits the framing of Trump that he and his allies wish the world to know, as well as the ‘President of Peace' moniker he has bestowed upon himself”. As well as the group draw and FIFA Peace Prize, the event usually entails speeches and musical performances. No musicians have yet been confirmed, but Colombian artist J Balvin performed during half-time of the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey this summer.
