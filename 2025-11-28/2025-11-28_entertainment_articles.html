                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The “Real Housewives of Orange County” alum, 50, claimed in the shocking voicemail, which is going viral online, that Jolie had “blocked [her] from everything,” so she left word with the 19-year-old's friend. “Forward this message to her,” Kelly began the voicemail. The former Bravolebrity claimed to be in possession of numerous “recordings” showing Jolie “screaming” at her dad, Michael Dodd, because he hadn't taken her on vacation or bought her a car. “Do you remember those recordings that I saved? Do you understand?” Kelly said in the voicemail. She went on to call her ex-husband a “f–king loser” and accused him of putting his other children before Jolie. Kelly concluded her voicemail by saying it's “absolutely crazy” for Jolie to take Michael's “side.” Sign up for Virtual Reali-Tea with Danny and Evan, our must-read newsletter!

In August, Kelly's brother Eric Meza claimed that Jolie had “disowned” her. She's a terrible mom,” he said in an Instagram video at the time, adding that “nobody” in the family talks to his sister, including their parents and brother. “Doesn't that tell you something about somebody?” Meza argued. Kelly responded with her own Instagram video in which she called Meza a “sick” “psycho” who is “full of s–t.” Kelly and Michael were married from April 2006 until they separated in September 2017. She tied the knot with former Fox News anchor Rick Leventhal in October 2020.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kim Kardashian's 2022 Met Gala regret might not be what you think. But it wasn't just any dress — it was Marilyn Monroe's iconic beaded tank gown that she famously wore to sing “Happy Birthday, Mr. President” to President John F. Kennedy in 1962. In a post-credits confessional scene from episode six of “The Kardashians” on Hulu, Kardashian talks about the one thing she would have done differently if she could go back in time to the 2022 event. I should have been like dark, Jackie O vibes hair.” Ultimately, Kardashian and hairstylist Chris Appleton opted for “Marilyn blond,” though she looks back on the choice as questionable. Four and a half years later, Kardashian is still agonizing over the decision. “I've actually photoshopped it 500 different ways after the fact — like, last year — to see. Because I have tortured Chris Appleton on this decision.” As she quickly pulls the images up on her phone to show the producers and cameramen, Kardashian asks, “Should it have been a Marilyn vibe hair in blond … should it have been more of a Jackie O dark? The look had found its permanent home with Ripley's Believe It or Not! after the museum acquired it at auction for over $5 million. Even though Kardashian changed into a replica for the party itself, the original gown was said to have been damaged that evening — all for a Kardashian photo-opp.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two Detroiters tried (but failed) to will their hometown Lions to victory during the NFL team's annual Thanksgiving Day game. Jack White opened his halftime show performance with “That's How I'm Feeling,” from last year's No Name, before bringing out Eminem for a mashup of the White Stripes' “Hello Operator” and the rapper's Eminem Show cut “'Till I Collapse.” Inevitably, the performance concluded with Elephant's “Seven Nation Army.” Watch a replay below and on YouTube. The show has also been uploaded, as an EP, to streaming services; scroll down to listen. It should maybe not be a surprise that Eminem showed up for White's performance, as the rapper and his manager and Shady Records co-founder Paul Rosenberg are the executive producers of the halftime show, along with Jesse Collins Entertainment. Eminem and Rosenberg will help with the Lions' Thanksgiving halftime production through 2027. The Detroit Lions play annually on Thanksgiving and, despite their success in recent seasons, they lose more often than they win, and that was the case yesterday, as the team fell to the rival Green Bay Packers. Last year, however, the Lions defeated the Chicago Bears in a game that featured a halftime performance from Shaboozey. All rights reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Nicola Holt, a British actress and model who has appeared in Viewpoint and Hollyoaks, has warned other women in the industry to “beware” film producer Kevin Proctor after he pleaded guilty to stalking. He has previously denied the charge of stalking involving serious alarm and distress, but on Thursday, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of stalking. During the court hearing, Proctor's barrister said the incident was isolated, out of character, and that his autism meant he struggled to make rational decisions. All3Media Writes Down Value Of Lime Pictures By $33M After 'Hollyoaks' Cuts Kevin Proctor, 'Midas Man' Producer & Ex-'Star Wars' Crew Member, Pleads Not Guilty To Stalking Actress As a producer, Proctor was most recently involved in Midas Man, the troubled biopic about Beatles manager Brian Epstein, starring Jacob Fortune-Lloyd and Emily Watson. He has several high-profile credits in behind-the-scenes roles, including working as an assistant production coordinator on Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi. In an interview with Deadline, Holt has spoken about her experience for the first time, revealing that Proctor's actions mean she lives in perpetual paranoia about being followed. Holt said she first encountered Proctor on social media during the pandemic. He gave her freelance work on Prime Video true-crime documentary The Never Ending Murder, co-produced by Proctor's Studio Pow. After Holt did other work for Proctor, including appearing in his 2022 short Lapushka!, their professional connection developed into a romantic relationship. They saw each other regularly while he was filming Midas Man in Liverpool, but Holt said she ended their relationship in August 2023 after learning that he had a girlfriend. Holt said they continued to discuss professional opportunities, but Proctor's behavior changed when she entered a relationship with another man in early 2024. Holt recalled seeing Proctor's car on numerous occasions near her home and at sets of traffic lights. When house hunting with her partner, Holt said she spotted Proctor at a yet-to-be-completed property development site. “As we were exiting the estate, I saw him walk across a set of driveways. In the following days, a tire was slashed on Holt's work van while she was staying in a hotel (though it was not established if this was connected to Proctor), and she spotted the producer on a separate occasion at another set of traffic lights. On June 28, 2024, Holt found a tracking device behind a number plate on her partner's car, which she was using because her personal vehicle had broken down. Holt filed a police report and Proctor was arrested in July 2024. I ripped off the tracker because it's a magnetic one, and I ran back inside and did not stop crying,” Holt remembered. “I drove around to the local police station, which was closed, so I just sat in the car park crying.” “He did not apply it himself — he is a film producer by trade and not well-versed in these sorts of things. In her victim impact statement, Holt said: “Not feeling safe in your own home is a violation and that's what these brutal, thoughtless actions have done.” Holt said she was grateful that the matter had been dealt with in court. “I want other women to know what he's capable of,” she continued. Proctor's barrister said his life had been “turned upside down” by the events and he had suffered “considerable reputational damage within his industry.” The lawyer added that Proctor now works in a freezer factory and lives with his parents. Proctor was cited as a producer throughout Midas Man‘s development, but his credit was missing from the final feature. Deadline broke a number of stories about Midas Man‘s troubled path to the screen. Proctor's other credits include Cordelia, a psychological thriller starring Antonia Campbell-Hughes and Johnny Flynn; and Funny Cow, a story about a female comedian, starring Maxine Peake, Paddy Considine, and Stephen Graham.

No one's denying he's El Creepo, but so many of you demand hangings for jaywalkers. Proctor's barrister said his life had been “turned upside down” by the events and he had suffered “considerable reputational damage within his industry.” So, no consequences for the stalker other than some bad press?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>K2 Pictures said Friday that it has secured a 500 million yen ($3.3 million) investment from DBJ for its flagship K2P Film Fund I, adding momentum to the year-old venture's effort to create what founder and CEO Muneyuki Kii calls “a new ecosystem for Japanese cinema.” Olivia Dean Wins Partial Refunds for Fans After Slamming "Exploitative" Resale Market The deal follows earlier backing from Japanese megabank MUFG, which joined the fund this summer in what analysts described as an unprecedented show of support for an independent film venture. In a Japanese film landscape dominated by conglomerate franchises and anime blockbusters, K2's fund is positioning itself as a rare, creator-friendly bridge between independent film and capital. Founded in 2023, K2 Pictures is the brainchild of Kii — a 25-year veteran of Toei and producer of hit anime titles such as Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo, The First Slam Dunk and Shin Kamen Rider — who launched the venture to shake up Japan's notoriously risk-averse “production committee” model. Under that traditional system, films are co-financed by sprawling consortiums of studios, broadcasters and publishers, a process critics say stifles creative autonomy and limits profit participation for filmmakers. At its launch during the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, K2 Pictures revealed an ambitious creative alliance with some of Japan's most celebrated filmmakers — including Hirokazu Kore-eda, Takashi Miike, Shunji Iwai, Miwa Nishikawa and Kazuya Shiraishi — as well as anime powerhouse MAPPA, the studio behind Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and Attack on Titan. “We spent valuable time preparing, and consulted thoroughly with a broad group of investors. However, to compete globally, a strong connection between the two is essential.” DBJ added: “We deeply resonate with K2 Pictures' vision to globalize Japan's film industry.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"Heartbroken to share that Joan, my wife and partner for 50 years, has passed away," Richard Branson writes. Richard Branson has remembered his late wife Joan Templeman as the “shining star” around which the Branson “family's universe has always orbited.” In a pair of posts on Instagram, Branson, the British businessman who founded the Virgin Group and launched scores of recording careers through his labels Virgin Records and V2, said he was “devastated” at the death of Templeman, aged 80. Australia's Parliament Passes Content Quotas For Streaming Video Platforms “Heartbroken to share that Joan, my wife and partner for 50 years, has passed away,” he writes. “Life will never be the same without her. But we have fifty incredible years of memories – years filled with tears and laughter, kindness, and a love that shaped our family more than words could ever capture. Branson met his wife back in 1976 at the Manor, Virgin Records' live-in recording studio. “Joan was a down-to-earth Scottish lady and I quickly realized she wouldn't be impressed by my usual antics.” “Joan has always been a steady source of wisdom and has played no small part in some of my better life decisions.” It was Templeman who convinced Branson to buy Necker island, for a knockdown price, which he went on to describe as “one of the best decisions I've ever made.” Although the cause of death has yet to be announced, Branson confirms he was by Templeman's side when she passed “quickly and painlessly”. And we will carry her with us, always.” Branson is considered one of Britain's most successful entrepreneurs. He founded the Virgin brand with Nik Powell in the early 1970s, initially with Virgin Records, before expanding into other industries including air travel, record stores, hotels, wines, space tourism and more. He sold Virgin Records to Thorn EMI in 1992 for £560 million ($804 million), and continued to own the Virgin Megastores music retail chain until 2007, when the market for CDs was in a state of collapse. UMG reached an agreement to buy V2 from Morgan Stanley later that year. A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Woody Guthrie died at the untimely age of 55, in 1967, the pioneering folk singer left behind 28 linear feet of lyrics scrawled on, according to his archive, “tissue paper, onionskin, gift-wrap, napkins, concert programs, and even place mats”—scraps of ballads, union songs, and protest hymns for the next generation to sing. Guthrie's prolific posthumous catalog has meant that, at the invitation of his daughter and archivist, Nora Guthrie, contemporary musicians like Billy Bragg & Wilco, Del McCoury, the Klezmatics, and the Dropkick Murphys have tried on Guthrie's unsung lyrics over the years to find that his messages of radical humanism still fit perfectly. To write “in the spirit of Woody Guthrie”—as Haley Heynderickx and Max García Conover aspire to do on their new collaborative LP, What of Our Nature—is a different undertaking than Mermaid Avenue or Del and Woody, requiring not only creative interpretation but political imagination. On 10 spirited tracks that address topics like mass marketing, labor history, and the struggle for Puerto Rican independence, Conover and Heynderickx affirm Guthrie's legacy not by resurrecting his words but by renewing his commitment to songwriting as a democratic exercise. Heynderickx and Conover first collaborated on the 2018 EP Among Horses III, an intimate, mystical jewel box showcasing their respective gifts for hypnotism. Heynderickx's plaintive warble, which evokes folk singers like Shirley Collins, is her primary instrument; Conover's songs unfold in incantatory, tumbling rhythms that recall the verbose pleasure of Adrianne Lenker. Recorded directly to tape in Vermont, What of Our Nature is even earthier than its predecessor, with twinkling wind chimes, rustling hand percussion, and precise fingerpicking. Lyrically, the album returns to nature—the tongue-twisting “Boars,” especially, is a fantasia of “quiquiriqui” calls, “stag shape” runaways, and “blushfern silversage”—but the grim reapers of capitalism and colonialism are closing in. These struggles aren't new: What of Our Nature's two most overtly political songs, both written by Conover, link current events to a pair of incidents from 1981. “Song for Alicia” recounts the undignified courtroom treatment of FALN member Alicia Rodríguez, who was imprisoned alongside nine other Puerto Rican independence activists while refusing to stand trial. The specificity of these references is a gift for political education. But the album's more expressionistic or metaphorical songs, though beautiful, feel atemporal and vague by contrast. In “Song for Alicia,” Conover imagines a harsh future appraisal of his output: “And when someone looks at what I've done/I know songs won't seem like enough/Songs are for sure not nearly enough.” Acknowledging this doubt helps these songwriters move past it into strength. On “Song for Alicia,” Conover and Heynderickx belt Puerto Rican poet Juan Antonio Corretjer's refrain “I would be Boricua even if I was born on the moon” with triumphant defiance that evokes the dual strength and vulnerability of Emmylou Harris and Conor Oberst's blend on “Landlocked Blues.” On “In Bulosan's Words,” Heynderickx crafts a folk protest song using lines from Filipino American poet Carlos Bulosan's America Is in the Heart. These creative forebears prove that poetry can be as effective a tool of resistance as plainspoken systemic critique; but Heynderickx and Conover, in their own words, seem less convincing. Compared to acerbic present-day folk artists like Jesse Welles, whose songs seek to meet the urgency of the moment by criticizing ICE or Netanyahu by name, Conover and Heynderickx sound slightly aimless. One of Dylan's most haunting protest songs, “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll,” sparks outrage and disdain for broken legal systems in a similar fashion as the third verse of “Song for Alicia.” Dylan credited Bertolt Brecht, explicitly not Guthrie, with inspiring his writing at that time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Post Malone used his halftime spot at the Dallas Cowboys' Thanksgiving home game Thursday night (Nov. 27) to pay tribute to Marshawn Kneeland, the late Cowboys defensive end. 'Wicked: For Good' Soundtrack Casts a Spell on ARIA Chart 'Stranger Things' Soundtrack For Season 5 Premieres With Cuts by Michael Jackson, ABBA 94 pin on his blue and white satin jacket for the Cowboys' duel with Kansas City Chiefs. His death is being investigated as a suicide. For Posty, the high-profile gig was a triumphant homecoming. The celebrated hip-hop artist (real name: Austin Post) was raised in Grapevine, Texas, and his dad, Rich Post, was assistant director of food and beverage at the stadium from 2005 to 2019. I grew up a Cowboys fan and have been watching this halftime show for years,” Malone commented in a statement published on the Cowboys' official site. For the big show, Posty powered through “Wrong Ones,” “Wow” and “I Had Some Help.” Malone's Thanksgiving thank-you might've done enough to lifted his beloved franchise, as the Cowboys ran out winners 31-28.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>‘The amount of backslide in our representation onscreen is f**king appalling. Shawn Mendes, Simu Liu, Sidney Crosby: Meet Team Canada's 2026 Soccer World Cup Cheerleaders 'In Your Dreams' Review: Simu Liu and Cristin Milioti Lead Voice Cast of Netflix's Pixar-esque Animated Charmer “No Asian actor has ever lost a studio even close to 100 million dollars but a white dude will lose 200 million TWICE and roll right into the next tentpole lead,” he continued. The Threads post that Liu was responding to also included comments from Manny Jacinto, who recently starred as Lindsay Lohan's onscreen love interest in Freakier Friday. While some fans pleaded for Jacinto to star in more rom-coms after seeing the movie, he previously told ScreenRant that it seemed many creatives in Hollywood had other ideas, as he's mostly been “getting dad roles, or dad auditions” since. While the overall percentage of Asian characters on screen has increased from 2007 to 2024, those gains were wiped out between 2023 and 2024, according to USC's Annenberg Inclusion Initiative's diversity report of movies, which was released in August 2025. “They gave me a list of white guys we could cast. “Spoken to countless directors who have corroborated this,” he added on Threads. “Studios give a list and as of now, all the names are white with maybe ONE bipoc name that is tossed in there so they cover their own asses.

And it's kind of just like we get extra pieces of them and I really think that the readers are gonna just like eat that up.” Deadline exclusively reported the announcement of the People We Meet on Vacation film in development in late 2022, with cast boarding the production nearly two years later in August 2024.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hailie Jade Scott gave fans a warm holiday moment when she posted a video on Nov. 27, 2025, showing her infant son watching his grandfather perform at the NFL Thanksgiving halftime show. The short video offered a rare glimpse of private family life. Hailie tends to keep her personal moments away from the spotlight. Fans immediately responded with support and affection as many reacted to the tiny boy's first live concert experience. Hailie and her husband, Evan McClintock, met in 2016 at Michigan State University. Over the past several months, Hailie has shared occasional glimpses of motherhood, including a photo commemorating Elliot's four-month milestone. Hailie has previously spoken about growing up under public scrutiny. She once said she understands what her father experienced while raising her under constant media attention. The new Instagram post suggests that she aims to share only selective moments that capture love and celebration while maintaining privacy for her child. For years, Hailie has appeared in headlines mostly as the daughter who inspired some of Eminem's most heartfelt lyrics. The Thanksgiving-night video proves she is no longer just a muse and public figure. Rap fans will remember Hailie as the child Eminem once rapped about. Hailie's Thanksgiving post adds to a growing collection of updates that document her transition into parenthood. Her content remains limited, but each post offers a brief look at how she and McClintock are navigating life as new parents while managing public attention. The video also highlights a new phase for Eminem as he steps into the role of grandfather. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.
