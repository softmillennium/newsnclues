                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar stands at the State Department in Washington, Sept. 30, 2025. PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) — The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago retracted comments where she asserted that no U.S. Marines were currently in the twin-island nation — a development that comes as the U.S. government seeks allies amid ongoing strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean and beyond. Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar told reporters Thursday that U.S. Marines were at the airport on the island of Tobago working on its radar, runway and road just days after she said they had left. It also wasn't clear whether they were installing a new radar or upgrading the current one. Persad-Bissessar met Wednesday with Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and U.S. President Donald Trump's primary military adviser, who traveled to Trinidad and Tobago. A day after the visit, Persad-Bissessar told reporters that Trinidad had not been asked to be a base for any attack against Venezuela, and that Venezuela was not mentioned in recent conversations with the U.S. Officials in Tobago have confirmed that at least one U.S. military plane recently touched down on the island, saying it was for the purpose of refueling. Earlier this year, the U.S. approached the eastern Caribbean island of Grenada asking if they could install a temporary radar at its main international airport, but officials there have not said whether they would authorize such a move. Grenada, like Trinidad and Tobago, is located close to Venezuela, with some experts saying that the ongoing U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean, the largest in generations, is a tactic to force Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to resign. He made the announcement with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at his side. The U.S. strikes that began in early September have killed at least 83 people.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shoppers wait in lines before they browse through stores at Mall of America for Black Friday deals, Friday, Nov. 28, 2025, in Bloomington, Minn. (AP Photo/Adam Bettcher) NEW YORK (AP) — Black Friday no longer tempts people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs, but the annual sales event still brings more shoppers into stores than any day of the year and rules as the U.S. retail industry's unofficial start of the holiday shopping season. At Macy's Herald Square flagship store in New York City, customers who streamed in soon after the store opened at 6 a.m. found for deep discounts on clothes, shoes, linens and cosmetics. The footwear department had products selling for 40% to 50%. Nicholas Menasche, 19, from Queens, New York, shopped with his mother for shoes and clothing, and planned to head next to Best Buy for video games. Menasche, an intern at a bank, said he expected to spend around $1,200 this year on his holiday shopping, roughly the same amount as last year. Veronica Nam, 68, headed to the shoe department to buy Nike sneakers for her husband after spending $256 on Lacoste bedding that she estimated cost half the regular price. Nam said she thought Black Friday had the best holiday deals but that she would wait until after Christmas to finish buying gifts for other relatives. She said it was hard to know when to find the best prices given the unpredictability of President Donald Trump 's wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods and several years of inflation. Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect. “Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said this week of shoppers' moods heading into Black Friday. Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. “We're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,” Renslow said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.” The growth in online sales also has been robust so far. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 23, U.S. consumers spent $79.7 billion, or 7.5% more than a year earlier, according to web tracking and analysis platform Adobe Analytics. They spent another $6.4  billion online on Thanksgiving Day, a  5.3% increase over last year, while taking advantage of better than expected deals, the firm said. “Clearly, there's uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. But at the moment, it doesn't seem like it's changing how they are showing up for this season.” Cyber Monday, however, should be the best time to buy apparel and computers.</p>

Venezuelan leader urges troops to defend "every inch" of the nation from outside threats (Associated Press video.) Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro delivered a defiant address in Caracas earlier this week, brandishing a sword and warning supporters to prepare for confrontation with what he called "imperialist aggression" as President Donald Trump said the United States will "very soon" begin stopping suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers on land. Maduro told supporters that the country was facing a decisive moment. The Associated Press reported him saying that, "For anyone, whether civilian, politician, military, or police. And with (Simon) Bolívar, I come to say that if the homeland demands it, the homeland will have our lives, if necessary," he declared while raising Bolívar's sword. Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro brandishes a sword said to have belonged to independence hero Simon Bolivar during a civic-military event at the military academy in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. Maduro framed the situation as a struggle against what he described as external threats, urging Venezuelans to mobilize against any foreign aggression. The address came as tensions have risen following months of U.S. maritime strikes that Washington says targeted vessels used by drug traffickers. Reuters has reported that more than 80 people have been killed since September, and a separate Reuters report on Friday detailed heightened surveillance and security crackdowns in coastal communities where the strikes occurred. Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro brandishes a sword during an event at the military academy in Caracas, Venezuela, Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. Speaking on Thanksgiving to U.S. service members, Trump said the United States will expand its efforts from sea interdiction to land operations. "In recent weeks, you've been working to deter Venezuelan drug traffickers, of which there are many. Of course, there aren't too many coming in by sea anymore. He added that maritime operations have already stopped an estimated 85% of drugs arriving by sea. "You probably noticed that now people aren't wanting to be delivering by sea, and we'll be starting to stop them by land also. The land is easier, but that's going to start very soon." Trump said traffickers are responsible for "hundreds of thousands of people a year" dying from the "poisons" brought into the United States. "We warn them, stop sending poison to our country," he said.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Earlier this month, Trump said he had not ruled out sending U.S. troops to Venezuela as part of the administration's crackdown on criminal networks tied to senior figures in Caracas. They would like to talk," Trump told reporters over the weekend. Since early September, U.S. strikes across the Caribbean and eastern Pacific have destroyed dozens of vessels. U.S. officials say many were linked to Venezuelan and Colombian criminal groups. Efrat Lachter is an investigative reporter and war correspondent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tim Walz (D-MN) dismissed President Donald Trump, who called the Minnesota Democrat  “retarded” for questioning his mental fitness. Walz's post was a reference to Trump's recent annual physical exam. Walz was responding to a Thanksgiving post from Trump in which the president outlined his opposition to further migration from “third-world countries” and also made a jab at Walz. “The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both.” Among these screenings was a magnetic resonance imaging exam. Trump told reporters earlier this month that “getting an MRI is very standard.” Other people get it,” Trump said at the time. Trump is battling reports of declining health, which he largely dismisses by pointing to his cognitive test results. When an outlet hinted at signs of fatigue in Trump earlier this week, he acknowledged that he is not immune to the effects of aging. “There will be a day when I run low on Energy, it happens to everyone, but with a PERFECT PHYSICAL EXAM AND A COMPREHENSIVE COGNITIVE TEST (“That was aced”) JUST RECENTLY TAKEN, it certainly is not now!” Trump wrote on Truth Social.</p>

This photo provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office on Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025, shows National Guard member Staff Sgt. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died. Beckstrom and Wolfe were deployed with the West Virginia National Guard as part of President Donald Trump's crime-fighting mission that federalized the D.C. police force. The president has said he wants to “permanently pause migration” from poorer nations and expel millions of immigrants from the country. In an interview on Fox News, Pirro said there are “many charges to come” beyond the upgraded murder charge. She said her heart goes out to the family of Beckstrom, who volunteered to serve and “ended up being shot ambush-style on the cold streets of Washington, D.C., by an individual who will now be charged with murder in the first degree.” Investigators are continuing to execute warrants in the state of Washington, where Lakanwal lived, and other parts of the country, she said. Wolfe remains in “very critical condition,” West Virginia Gov. He ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom's death “These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,” Morrisey said. “Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.” Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but his asylum was approved under the Trump administration, #AfghanEvac said in a statement. Lakanwal has been living in Bellingham, Washington, about 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of Seattle, with his wife and five children, said his former landlord, Kristina Widman. Lakanwal had briefly worked as an independent contractor for Amazon Flex, which allows people to use their own cars to deliver packages, a company spokesperson shared with The Associated Press. Lakanwal delivered packages from the end of July to the end of August and hadn't been active since. Mohammad Sherzad, a neighbor of Lakanwal's in Bellingham, told the AP in a phone interview Friday that Lakanwal was polite, quiet and spoke very little English. Sherzad said he attended the same mosque as Lakanwal and had heard from other members that Lakanwal was struggling to find work. But we didn't see anything bad about him. Sherzad said Lakanwal “disappeared” about two weeks ago. In his address to the troops Thursday, Trump said that Lakanwal “went cuckoo. People who knew Lakanwal say he served in a CIA-backed Afghan Army unit before immigrating to the United States. Zero Units were paramilitary units manned by Afghans but backed by the CIA that also served in front-line fighting with CIA paramilitary officers. Beckstrom had enlisted in 2023, the same year she graduated high school, and served with distinction as a military police officer with the 863rd Military Police Company, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. “She exemplified leadership, dedication, and professionalism,” the statement said, adding that Beckstrom “volunteered to serve as part of Operation D.C. The president called Beckstrom an “incredible person, outstanding in every single way.” On Wednesday night, Trump called for the reinvestigation of all Afghan refugees who had entered under the Biden administration initiative that brought roughly 76,000 people to the country, many of whom had worked as interpreters and translators. The program has faced intense scrutiny from Trump and others over allegations of gaps in the vetting process, even as advocates say there was extensive vetting and the program offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals. Citizenship and Immigration Services Joseph Edlow said in a statement that the agency would take additional steps to screen people from 19 “high-risk” countries “to the maximum degree possible.” But in June, the administration banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access from seven others, citing national security concerns.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said that one of the two West Virginia National Guard members shot by an Afghan national near the White House had died. He is blaming immigrants for problems from crime to housing shortages as part of “social dysfunction” in America and demanding “REVERSE MIGRATION.” His most severe social media post against immigration since returning to the Oval Office in January came after two National Guard members were shot while patrolling the streets of the nation's capital under his orders. One died and the other is in critical condition. Mohammad Sherzad, a neighbor of Lakanwal's in Bellingham, Washington, told The Associated Press in a phone interview Friday that Lakanwal was polite, quiet and spoke very little English. Sherzad said he attended the same mosque as Lakanwal and had heard from other members that Lakanwal was struggling to find work. But we didn't see anything bad about him. Beckstrom enlisted in 2023, the same year she graduated high school, and served with distinction as a military police officer with the 863rd Military Police Company, the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. “She exemplified leadership, dedication, and professionalism,” the statement said, adding that Beckstrom “volunteered to serve as part of Operation D.C. Trump called Beckstrom an “incredible person, outstanding in every single way.” Soon after Wednesday's shooting, Trump said he would send 500 more National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. It's not clear where the additional troops would come from. In addition to West Virginia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama also had forces in the capital early this month. A federal judge last week ordered an end to the Guard deployment but also put her order on hold for 21 days to allow the Trump administration time to either remove the troops or appeal. Video reviewed by investigators showed Lakanwal “came around the corner” on Wednesday afternoon and immediately started firing at the troops, according to Jeffery Carroll, an executive assistant D.C. police chief. Carroll said that it was not clear whether one of the Guard members or a law enforcement officer shot Lakanwal. There were nearly 2,200 Guard members from various states in D.C. for the mission. Both Beckstrom and Wolfe were on orders in Washington since August, according to the West Virginia National Guard. Beckstrom, a resident of Summersville, West Virginia, had volunteered for the operation “to ensure the safety and security of our nation's capital,” the West Virginia National Guard said in a statement. She had graduated from Webster County High School in June 2023, and enlisted with the guard that month, serving “with distinction” as a military police officer, the guard said. Wolfe, who is from Martinsburg, West Virginia, entered service in February 2019. He had graduated from Musselman High School as part of the Class of 2019, said Karla Troppman, a spokesperson for Berkeley County Schools in West Virginia. Patrick Morrisey issued a proclamation requesting that all West Virginians observe a statewide moment of silence or prayer at 2:15 p.m. Friday to honor Wolfe and Beckstrom. He also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in recognition of Beckstrom's death. “These two West Virginia heroes were serving our country and protecting our nation's capital when they were maliciously attacked,” Morrisey said. “Their courage and commitment to duty represent the very best of our state.” U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro announces a Scam Center Strike Force to go after crypto investment fraudsters who are targeting Americans to the tune of 10 billion a year, Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2025, in Washington. In an interview on Fox News, Pirro said there are “many charges to come” beyond the upgraded murder charge. She said her heart goes out to the family of Beckstrom, who volunteered to serve and “ended up being shot ambush-style on the cold streets of Washington, D.C., by an individual who will now be charged with murder in the first degree.” She said Wolfe remains in critical condition and that “we still have hope.” “We are doing everything we can to assist his family and to make sure that they have everything they need during this difficult time for them,” Pirro said. Lakanwal applied for asylum during the Biden administration, but his asylum was approved under the Trump administration, #AfghanEvac said in a statement. Supporters have said there was extensive vetting and the program offered a lifeline to people at risk of Taliban reprisals. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, announced Friday that charges against a man who authorities say shot two National Guard members have been upgraded to first-degree murder. Andrew Wolfe, 24, were hospitalized in critical condition after Wednesday afternoon's shooting and Trump announced Thursday evening that Beckstrom had died. Pirro said that Lakanwal drove across the country to launch an “ambush-style” attack with a .357 Smith & Wesson revolver. Pirro said that “it's too soon to say” what the suspect's motives were. People who work with refugees are worried that those who fled dangerous situations to start again in America will face backlash after authorities say an Afghan national shot two National Guard soldiers this week, killing one of them. Many Afghans living in the U.S. are afraid to leave their houses, fearing they'll be swept up by immigration officials or attacked with hate speech, said Shawn VanDiver, president of the San Diego-based group #AfghanEvac, a group that helps resettle Afghans who assisted the U.S. during the two-decade war. It's insane,” VanDiver told The Associated Press Thursday. “People are acting xenophobic because of one deranged man. ▶ Read about what groups are saying in the shooting's aftermath AP Morning Wire curates the most important stories and sends them straight to your inbox.</p>

The fugitive Virginia high school football coach who disappeared amid an alleged child pornography investigation has had his profile scrubbed from the school's website. On Tuesday, authorities announced that they have obtained 10 warrants to charge Travis L. Turner, 46, with five counts of possession of child pornography and five counts of using a computer to solicit a minor. The investigation remains ongoing, with authorities adding that additional charges are pending. Turner was first reported missing as officers with the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation's Wytheville Field Office were en route to his Appalachia home to speak with him about the investigation on Friday, Nov. 21, according to authorities. Officials had visited Turner's home one day prior, and were returning only to speak with him and not make any arrests, police said. Union High School head football coach Travis Turner has been reported missing, according to the Virginia State Police. Police have launched an extensive search across Wise County utilizing drones, K-9 units and foot patrols. He was last seen wearing a gray sweatshirt, sweatpants and glasses, according to Virginia's missing person database. Just days after the investigation was announced and following Turner's disappearance, Union High School appeared to have scrubbed the football coach's profile from the online staff directory, according to ABC 7. Upon searching Turner's last name on the site, the only ‘Turner' listed as an employee is his eldest son, Bailey, who works as a physical education teacher, the Daily Mail reported. Virginia State Police have launched a search for Union High football coach Travis Turner, whose disappearance has stunned the Big Stone Gap community. In a previous statement, a spokesperson for Wise County Public Schools confirmed that a staff member employed by the district had been placed on administrative leave pending review of an external allegation. "A staff member has been placed on administrative leave with pay while an external agency reviews an allegation that was reported to the division," Superintendent Mike Goforth said in a statement at the time. In an updated statement released later in the week, the school district acknowledged that law enforcement has since filed charges against the staff member who was already placed on leave. Travis Turner disappeared from his family's home in Appalachia, Virginia on Friday, Nov. 21, 2025. Authorities announced that they have obtained 10 warrants to charge Turner with five counts of possession of child pornography and five counts of using a computer to solicit a minor. "The individual remains on leave and is not permitted on school property or to have contact with students," Goforth said. "The division will continue to cooperate with law enforcement as this process moves forward. Because this is an active legal matter involving personnel, the division cannot comment further." Wise County Public Schools did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment regarding Turner's current employment status. In 2023, Timothy Lee Meador, a teacher and coach at the same school, pleaded guilty to two charges of indecent liberties with a child and served one year and three months in prison, ABC 7 reported. The two men's employment at the school reportedly overlapped, but details regarding which sport Meador coached remain unclear. In light of the charges filed against Turner, his wife, Leslie Caudill Turner, has spoken out to deny the accusations after her husband was charged, telling The Daily Mail that "none of that is true." Turner's family attorney and the VSP did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett weighs in on the death of 18-year-old Anna Kepner aboard a cruise ship and the FBI's investigation. A relative of Anna Kepner, who died onboard a Carnival Cruise ship in early November, says the teenager "fought for her life" amid reports that her death was ruled a homicide. 18-year-old Anna was found dead while she was onboard the Carnival Horizon on Nov. 7 during a family vacation. Her death was ruled a homicide by "mechanical asphyxiation," according to ABC News, but authorities haven't announced a suspect or person of interest. Relatives said Anna was found dead inside her room aboard the Carnival Horizon, which she shared with her stepbrother. Krystal Wright, Anna's aunt, told Fox 35 Orlando she believes the 18-year-old cheerleader fought back. Anna Kepner was identified by her family as the passenger who died onboard the Carnival Horizon. I know she fought for her life, so it's rough. Anna's aunt said she's frustrated that there's still no arrest, despite the death reportedly being ruled a homicide. "We don't understand why, if the boy is a suspect, why has he not been charged yet? Anna Kepner, 18, was found dead aboard a Carnival cruise ship on Nov. 7, during a vacation with her family. While authorities haven't announced any criminal charges, stepmother Shauntel Kepner revealed that Anna's 16-year-old stepbrother has been eyed as a suspect. She made the claim in a court filing amid a legal battle with her ex-husband Thomas Hudson. Anna's 15-year-old ex-boyfriend recalled an instance where the stepbrother allegedly tried to get on top of her during a FaceTime call. "When I was on FaceTime with her, and she was lying down, and her brother tried to go on top of her," the ex-boyfriend said. The ex-boyfriend reported the incident to Anna's parents, saying she had previously complained about being "uncomfortable" around her stepbrother. Anna's ex-boyfriend said he'd be on the cruise had they not broken up. Anna Kepner's family said she had dreams of joining the military. In a court filing, Christopher Kepner, Anna's father, told People that "I want him to face the consequences … I will be fighting to make sure that does happen." "He was the only one that was in the room, and the FBI has an ongoing investigation in which they will have to provide the evidence to say that he did do it or did not do this," Kepner said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stores of grain attracted rodents, which in turn enticed wildcats, and humans found it useful to keep those mouse catchers around, leading to the cats' eventual domestication. The oldest known cat remains in the archaeological record date from a burial in Cyprus from that time period. However, new analysis of genetic information recovered from cat skeletal remains at archaeological sites across Europe, the Middle East and Asia suggests that the domestic cats familiar today have far more recent origins and were not the first felines to live alongside humans. “We started to interrogate the bones that are ascribed to domestic cats that go back to 10,000 years and find which actually have the same genomes as the modern cat population that now dominates,” said Greger Larson, a professor in the school of archaeology at England's University of Oxford. Larson coauthored two papers resulting from the research that published Thursday. It analyzed DNA from 22 felid bones unearthed in China over the past 5,000 years. Before then, an entirely different species of feline unrelated to the domestic cat or its ancestor lived alongside humans from at least 5,400 years ago until AD 150, the researchers discovered. Known scientifically as Prionailurus bengalensis, or the leopard cat, its remains — found previously at seven archaeological sites in China — were identified in the new analysis. Native to Asia, Prionailurus bengalensis is a small wildcat that does not naturally interbreed with Felis species. The leopard cat's relationship with humans was historically “commensal” — the two benefited from one another — but it never became fully domesticated despite living alongside people for more than 3,500 years, said Shu-jin Luo, a senior author of the China-focused study and a researcher at Peking University's School of Life Sciences in Beijing. “The human-leopard cat commensal relationship eventually ended, and leopard cats returned to their natural habitats, living today as our elusive and hidden neighbors,” Luo said. One hypothesis for why the leopard cat never ended up fully domesticated stems from its reputation for preying on chickens as well as rodents, unlike domestic cats that are better at catching mice. In Chinese folklore, the leopard cat is known as the “chicken-catching tiger,” a reference to its appetite for poultry, Luo explained. “After the Han Dynasty, the rise and change in poultry farming practices — from free ranging to cage-based systems — likely escalated human–leopard cat conflict,” Luo said via email. “Their strong tendency to prey on chickens, and to overkill in confined spaces, would have made leopard cats increasingly unwelcome around human settlements.” “This does not imply that leopard cats went extinct; rather, they simply retreated from human settlements and continued to persist in their natural forest habitats,” she added. “I think it's very cool to see these DNA studies help trace how the story of cats of Europe and Asia — this ubiquitous little critter that many folks take for granted — takes us back to the first trade routes like the Silk Roads that were built on travel by animals like horse, donkey, and camel.” The﻿ new findings that trace the origins of the domestic cat to North Africa are perhaps not surprising, said Jonathan Losos, a professor of biology at Washington University in St. Louis. Cats play an important role in the iconography of ancient Egypt, he noted in a commentary published alongside the Science study. Oldest sequenced RNA reveals details about a mammoth's final moments 40,000 years ago The Europe-focused study found that the cats at archaeological sites earlier than 200 BC were genetically identifiable as European wildcats of the species Felis silvestris, not domestic cats, even though their skeletons were difficult to tell apart. It is still possible that the wildcats lived among humans, Losos noted, as kittens of wildcat species can be relatively easily tamed. The work to untangle the history of cats is ongoing, and Losos noted a lack of archaeological samples from North Africa and southwest Asia means the domestic cat's origin story is far from complete. “Ever sphinx-like, cats give up their secrets grudgingly,” he added. “Yet more ancient DNA is needed to unravel these mysteries of long ago.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump said that the United States will “permanently pause” all immigration from “third-world countries” and pursue a policy of “reverse migration” in response to the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. Beckstrom, a National Guard member from West Virginia, was 20 years old. Trump posted shortly after the announcement of Beckstrom's death that his administration would take steps to deport foreign nationals who are “non-compatible with Western Civilization.” “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or who is incapable of loving our Country,” Trump posted. Trump also said that “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.” When asked about which countries constituted “third-world” in light of Trump's announcement, Immigration and Customs Enforcement referred the Washington Examiner to the 19 countries listed in Trump's June Executive Order restricting the entry of foreign nationals from dangerous countries. That list includes Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, and Venezuela, among others. Following a court settlement in September 2023, USCIS was bound to adjudicate all Afghan asylum claims on an expedited basis. Records indicate that Lakanwal was granted asylum this April, but McCaughlin said that, regardless of his asylum status, he would not have been removed from the country because of his parole status. “Effective immediately, processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely pending further review of security and vetting protocols,” McCaughlin said in the statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow Friday to shore up Hungary's energy supplies and discuss efforts to end the war in Ukraine. Having spurned chances to reduce its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, Hungary was facing a violent economic shock after the Trump administration last month imposed sanctions on Russia's two biggest oil producers. Before the sanctions were announced, Orbán had warned that, without energy imports from Russia, Hungary's economy would be brought “to its knees.” But Orbán, a hard-right populist and a darling of the MAGA movement, was spared that shock after US President Donald Trump granted Hungary a one-year exemption from the sanctions, saying it had been “difficult” for his ally to wean the country off Russian oil since it is landlocked. Now we must take the next step, guaranteeing that deliveries to Hungary continue without interruption,” Orbán wrote on social media Friday. “This is why I am going to Russia today: to make sure Hungary's energy supply remains secure and affordable this winter and in the year ahead,” he added. Although Trump, explaining why he was considering granting Hungary an exemption, said it had been “very difficult for him (Orbán) to get the oil and gas from other areas” since “they don't have ports,” analysts have disputed this reasoning. After Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, European Union countries moved to slash Russian energy imports in a bid to deplete the Kremlin's war chest. However, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – three Central European nations – were given an exemption from a ban on importing Russian crude oil, giving them time to reduce their reliance on Moscow. While the Czech Republic has since phased out Russian crude oil, Hungary and Slovakia used the exemption to deepen their dependence. So far this year, 92% of Hungary's crude oil imports have been from Russia. Slovakia, meanwhile, is “almost 100% dependent” on supply from Moscow, according to a report in May from the Center for the Study of Democracy and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. Isaac Levi, an analyst at CREA, told CNN earlier this month that the latest US exemption is a “terrible and unnecessary mistake that will allow over €1 billion ($1.2 billion) to flow into the Kremlin's war chest.” “This clearly shows that the oil flows that continue to finance Putin's war in Ukraine are entirely unnecessary,” Levi said. Putin did not rule out Friday the possibility of a summit in Budapest with Trump, Russian state media reported. Putin and Trump had agreed in October to meet in the Hungarian capital to discuss ending the conflict, but those plans were swiftly shelved, with Trump saying he did not want the talks to be a waste of time.

Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney explains how a ring of alleged porch pirates stole hundreds of smartphones and tablets using hacked shipment tracking information. New York prosecutors say they've busted up a sophisticated porch pirate ring in which the alleged thieves hacked into tracking information that investigators say led them to high-value packages as soon as they were delivered. This still image from security video shows two alleged thieves grabbing a package from a FedEx driver with their getaway vehicle waiting steps away. Prosecutors said they stole 15 Samsung tablets in the heist. The investigation spanned from October 2023 to February 2025 and resulted in a sweeping indictment announced this week. In another incident, the thieves allegedly followed a homeowner into her house after she brought a package inside, so they could steal it, Tierney said. Other incidents, caught on home security cameras, show thieves swiping packages minutes after FedEx delivery drivers dropped them off. The ring is also accused of having packages shipped to "fictitious" individuals at other addresses, just so they could be stolen, Tierney said. The stolen goods were allegedly sold in New York City and abroad. (Suffolk County District Attorney's Office, FOX 5 New York) FedEx said in a statement that the entire shipping industry is working "proactively" with law enforcement to combat the rise in sophistication among thieves. Most of the suspects are from New York City. They are accused of targeting working-class and wealthy communities in Suffolk County, a suburban area that covers the eastern half of Long Island. They allegedly hacked into data that held FedEx shipping info for devices from Verizon and AT&T and monitored deliveries before stealing them, Tierney said. Exactly how the information was accessed is still under investigation. Prosecutors identified the alleged ringleader as 29-year-old Bronx resident Andricson Jerez. District Attorney Ray Tierney said the alleged thieves often picked up packages minutes after they were delivered by FedEx. The ring is accused of using insider information to home in on packages with smartphones and other valuable electronics inside. "Most incidents (and all charged) involved residents who legitimately ordered phones," a spokesperson for Tierney's office told Fox News Digital. However, we also have evidence that at least one of the runners was using a stolen identity and placing orders with that stolen identification." Tierney's office identified them as Wandy Almanzar Liranzo, 35, Jackson Suazo, 30, Alvaro Alvarez Fermin, no age given, Leonel Tejeda Reynoso, 32, Felipe Batista, 22, and Luger Guerrero, 26. Jerez had four alleged "lieutenants" who acted as transporters of the stolen goods, according to prosecutors. They were identified as Luis Marte Tavares, 34, Eugenio Valencia, 35, Raimond Cabrera de Leon, 32, and Juan Baez, 48. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney speaks as alleged Gilgo serial killer Rex Heuermann appears in Suffolk County Court on January 16, 2024, in Riverhead, New York. That group is accused of delivering stolen goods from the stash house to three other alleged conspirators, identified as Fawaz Hameed, a 35-year-old who owns the Manhattan electronics store, Anzar Ali, 57, and Eddie Zaibak, 28. They allegedly stole the goods, brought them to a stash house in the Bronx and sold some of them at a storefront on Broadway in Manhattan, a few blocks south of Herald Square. While executing a search warrant at the Bronx hideout, police recovered 200 new phones and more than $100,000 worth of other goods, according to the district attorney's office. Images investigators took inside the building show dozens of new phones piled up, still in their packaging. Jerez faces similar charges in New Jersey, according to prosecutors, and the ring was allegedly operating up and down the East Coast. Jerez, Marte Tavares and Cabrera de Leon are also facing federal charges. The other suspects have been placed on supervised release and had to surrender their passports. Some of them were freed without bail because their charges are ineligible under New York law. Experts have a few other recommendations for keeping your holiday packages secure, including home security cameras, scheduling deliveries for when you know you'll be at home, keeping in touch with your neighbors or even having packages delivered to your job if you won't be home during the day. According to an annual theft report from Security.org, one in four Americans has been the victim of porch piracy, and thieves have stolen more than $8 billion worth of merchandise nationwide in the past year.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? From Trader Joe's totes to Starbucks Bearista cups, low-end items carry more meaning in the affordability era. And yet, this is what occurred in some Starbucks shops earlier this month after the coffee chain released a limited line of teddy bear-shaped tumblers as a part of their holiday merchandise. The “Bearista” cup, which was originally sold in South Korea and retails for $30, is reportedly sold out across Starbucks locations in the United States — but not before customers hassled baristas and tussled with each other in line to get their hands on one. Meanwhile, shoppers who managed to procure the Bearista cup in store are posting their wins. The Bearista cup is just the latest entry on a list of seemingly random but extremely hard-to-get merchandise that's gone viral this year, from Labubus to Owala water bottles to Trader Joe's micro tote bags. That certain low-cost novelty items can attract huge lines isn't exactly new. (Cabbage Patch Kids and Beanie Babies are canonical examples.) What's new is the extent to which these relatively cheap trinkets have become status symbols and an innovative way to distinguish oneself. Status symbols are traditionally thought of as expensive luxury items that indicate one's class. But in a time when affordability is driving the political conversation, young consumers are finding alternative ways to convey their social stature. Status can be earned by getting your hands on something rare, even if it only costs 30 bucks. Even wealthy people are embracing these less glitzy but in-the-know signifiers. Many companies use artificial scarcity as a marketing tactic, partaking in seasonal or limited product drops to boost sales, while others may not anticipate the initial demand of new products and run out of supply, according to Tara Sinclair, head of the economics department at George Washington University. In any case, these shortages lend themselves to social media content that sparks intrigue and turns the purchasing of these products into full-blown experiences. On TikTok and YouTube, the search to find a special-edition Stanley cup or a Dubai chocolate bar has become its own subgenre. Users post trips to their local grocers or big box stores where they scour the aisles, either successfully or unsuccessfully, for the latest trendy purchase. Others have filmed themselves going dumpster diving behind stores. Given that these products are not financially out of reach for working and middle-class consumers, the thrill of attaining these items seems largely wrapped up in beating your competition, whether through time, dedication, or pure luck. That said, these items still signal a level of financial privilege. (A $30 mug is more expensive than the paper cup that you usually get with your coffee at Starbucks.) “When we think about products of scarcity, there's typically two ways that we pay for them, money or our time,” she says. “Spending time scouring a store is not so different from spending your money on it because you could, otherwise, potentially be working and earning money during that time.” Even so, it's notable that our idea of status symbols is expanding to include a variety of low-end and easily collectible things. This fits into a larger trend of Gen Z spending on so-called “affordable luxuries,” that some have theorized as a recession indicator. At the time, Estée Lauder chair Leonard Lauder noted that the company had experienced a rise in lipstick sales, inspiring a theory that says consumers are less likely to spend on expensive, luxury goods in the midst of an economic crisis, instead opting for cheap indulgences. After all, luxury spending is slowing down and could continue this trajectory for a while. But Silvia Bellezza, associate professor of business at Columbia University, isn't totally convinced that Gen Z's obsession with trinkets and tumblers is primarily a response to harsh economic times, given that people are always falling for these novelty items. These alternative status symbols could also be driven by an interest in acquiring taste or “cultural capital.” Bellezza has found that “traditional markers of superiority,” like cars and designer clothes, become too mainstream and diluted when they are mass-produced. Given that social media is such an integral part of Gen Z's shopping experiences, it's only natural that owning status symbols is more about achieving social clout than signaling actual currency. Waiting in line, fighting crowds, and tracking down these affordable items may be extremely inconvenient, but it's suitable for a cohort with an uncertain financial future. We don't have to accept all that death and waste for a dry, flavorless bird no one likes. Don't Americans deserve better than turkey on Thanksgiving? What happens when you tell a generation they're special?</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Broadcaster Piers Morgan invited white nationalist Nick Fuentes for a future appearance on his program. Fuentes splintered the Republican Party after conservative commentator Tucker Carlson interviewed him. Some believed Carlson should not have platformed Fuentes, who is known for espousing antisemitic views. “Fair enough, maybe it's time we had a chat. He's coming off several interviews on the podcast circuit, including with Carlson. The interview gave Fuentes one of his largest audiences yet. But many didn't believe Carlson should have had Fuentes on his show, accusing the former Fox News host of platforming someone who has praised Hitler, to his audience. “We should not be giving a platform to amplify those views. And I think that's important for us to say.” Johnson's comments signaled a break with President Donald Trump, who said that “you can't tell” Carlson who to interview. Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts also defended Carlson for the interview, but received backlash within his organization for doing so. Some left their positions, including a board member, citing Roberts's response to Carlson's interview with Fuentes. The party's reaction to Fuentes has made him more relevant in recent times. Morgan's interview with him could add to the controversy. While the pair didn't focus on Fuentes, Morgan sat down with Carlson for an interview, which was released on Wednesday. Carlson prodded Morgan to say the word, but he hesitated. He later said it, but acknowledged that using the word would offend people. Fuentes is known for testing the bounds of free speech, using slurs openly on his show and spouting controversial takes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>West Virginia National Guard soldier Sarah Beckstrom has died from her injuries after she and another soldier were shot Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced. Her father, Gary Beckstrom, previously said she wasn't expected to recover and had a mortal injury. “I must unfortunately tell you that just seconds before I went on right now, I heard that Sarah Beckstrom of West Virginia, one of the guardsmen that we're talking about, highly respected young, magnificent person, started service in June of 2023 outstanding in every way. She's just passed away,” Trump said Thursday evening. She's looking down at us right now. Patrick Morrisey confirmed that she had died. “Sarah served with courage, extraordinary resolve, and an unwavering sense of duty to her state and to her nation. “Today, we honor her bravery and her sacrifice as we mourn the loss of a young woman who gave everything she had in defense of others. We will forever hold her family, her friends, and her fellow Guardsmen in our prayers as they grieve what no family should ever have to bear,” he added. The New York Times spoke with her father, Gary, and a former boyfriend, Adam Carr. “I'm holding her hand right now,” Gary Beckstrom told the outlet earlier. It's not going to be a recovery.” Carr said Beckstrom was “caring and tenderhearted.” He also said she enjoyed nature, road trips and spending time with her family. “As long as she was with people who cared about her, she was having a good time,” he said. He added that she wasn't excited to go to the nation's capital initially because of people who did not want the National Guard there. She then grew fond of spending time in D.C., wandering museums and memorials. The other soldier, U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, is still fighting for his life. The pair were allegedly ambushed with a revolver by Afghan national Rahmanullah Lakanwal near the Farragut West metro station before he was subdued. With Beckstrom's death, the Department of Justice is expected to pursue first-degree murder charges against Lakanwal, among other charges. In a post on X, Attorney General Pamela Bondi suggested she will seek the death penalty. Thank you to President Trump — the death penalty is back.” Thank you to President Trump — the death penalty is back. Beckstrom was deployed to D.C. in August as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on crime in the city. She appears to be one of the first National Guard soldiers who have been mortally wounded in the city.</p>
