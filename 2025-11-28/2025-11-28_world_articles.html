In a statement, the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (UBCIC) “loudly” voiced its opposition to the memorandum of understanding signed by Carney and Smith. “This MOU is nothing less than a high risk and deeply irresponsible agreement that sacrifices Indigenous peoples, coastal communities, and the environment for political convenience,” said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the UBCIC. “By explicitly endorsing a new bitumen pipeline to BC's coast and promising to rewrite the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act, the federal government is resurrecting one of the most deeply flawed and divisive ideas in Canadian energy politics.” “Carney's deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built,” said Lewis, a veteran journalist and climate activist. Our path is through climate leadership and building good jobs in the clean economy.” Carney's deal with Danielle Smith is the sellout of the century: scrapping climate legislation for a pipeline that will never be built.We need powerlines, not pipelines.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Frank-Walter Steinmeier travels to Basque town for remembrance ceremony marking ‘terrible crimes' of 1937 Hundreds of civilians were killed and hundreds more injured on 26 April 1937 when planes from the German Condor Legion, operating alongside aircraft from fascist Italy, spent hours bombing Guernica on market day. Adolf Hitler had loaned the Luftwaffe unit to Gen Francisco Franco's nationalist forces to help them in their coup against the republican government, and to allow Nazi Germany's pilots to practise the blitzkrieg tactics they would later use in the second world war. On Friday, Frank-Walter Steinmeier became the first German head of state to travel to Guernica, where he joined King Felipe VI of Spain in a remembrance ceremony held in a cemetery in the town and laid a wreath for the victims. The pair then visited Guernica's Museum of Peace, where they met two survivors of the attack, Crucita Etxabe and María del Carmen Aguirre. Steinmeier, who is on a state visit to Spain, used a speech earlier this week to address the bombing and its legacy. Hundreds of defenceless children, women and men lost their lives in appalling, agonising ways. The terror, pain and grief is felt to this day by many Basque families.” Steinmeier, who visited the Reina Sofía museum in Madrid to see Picasso's Guernica for himself, said the artist's warning against remaining indifferent in the face of conflict and suffering “has lost none of its urgency”. He added: “It is very important to me, and I am consciously addressing this sentence to my compatriots in Germany, that we do not forget what happened back then. His words came three decades after Germany's then president, Roman Herzog, said he wished “to confront the past and … explicitly admit to the culpable involvement of German pilots”. In an interview with Cadena Ser radio on Thursday, Gorroño said the Spanish state owed a “moral debt to the victims of the bombing”, adding: “Picasso's Guernica should come to Guernica. “No one has any doubts that the current Spanish state is very different from that one,” he told the Basque parliament last week.</p>

But then, Israel launched its genocide on Gaza, destroying or damaging all 12 universities within the Gaza Strip by May 2024, and killing hundreds of university students and academics. She never imagined that the road to college would be paved with such pain; only days after her acceptance, Abu Hjeer's father and brother were killed in an Israeli attack while they searched for a bag of flour during the famine. “It was the hardest decision of my life … to leave my mother broken like that,” Abu Hjeer, who is now in Italy, told Prism in a phone interview. At first glance, the scholarships appear to be a necessary humanitarian gesture. “On one hand, they offer vital opportunities to continue learning after everything has been destroyed. On the other, they risk turning education into a pathway of forced academic exile.” By July 2024, education had been disrupted for more than 625,000 children after about 93% of school buildings sustained some damage from Israeli attacks, and about 85% required full reconstruction or significant rehabilitation before they would be usable, according to the 2024 Occupied Palestinian Territories Education Cluster report. Amid this violence and destruction, international scholarships have become one of the few remaining pathways for Palestinian students in Gaza to continue their education. For Abu Hjeer, that harrowing journey started when she saw a Facebook post about a scholarship at the University of Tuscia, part of the Italian Universities for Palestinian Students program, a government initiative run by the Conference of Italian University Rectors, which this year offered scholarships to 35 Palestinian students from Gaza and the West Bank. After receiving her acceptance, Abu Hjeer wrote daily to the Italian Consulate in Jerusalem, urging officials there to speed up the evacuation process, so she could escape the genocide with a chance of survival like dozens of other students with foreign scholarships. By late September, the long-awaited call came: Students were to leave at 2 a.m. from a gathering point in southern Gaza, Abu Hjeer recalled. At Bani Suhaila, a town east of Khan Younis, an Israeli armored vehicle blocked their way and aimed rocket-propelled grenade launchers at them, throwing everyone into panic. After a long, exhausting wait, they were allowed to cross through Israel into Jordan. They stayed at the border for seven hours before being transferred to the Italian Hospital in Amman, and from there, flown to Italy aboard a military aircraft—a six-hour journey with no rest. “I never imagined studying away from Gaza,” Abu Hjeer said, “but maybe education is the only thing that can bring our lives back after everything that's been shattered.” While some see these programs as a chance for academic survival, others fear they may contribute to Gaza's intellectual depletion, especially amid the blockade and absence of a reconstruction plan or reintegration strategy. “We study and live here, but our minds are there. The scholarship saved my life, but it stole me from my homeland,” said one international student who did not want to be named due to safety concerns. Amer said the attack on education is not just about destruction. Al-Israa University was turned into a military base and later leveled to the ground. Several countries have launched emergency programs to evacuate and support Palestinian students. In Italy, the University Corridors for Refugees program evacuated a group of students and researchers through Jordan to Italian universities as part of a broader scholarship initiative. In the U.K., several students from Gaza were hosted under fully funded scholarships, including programs such as Chevening. Yet despite this solidarity, the struggle to obtain visas and exit permits continues to be a daily battle fought amid blackouts, blockades, and bureaucracy. The Palestine Education Cluster of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that hundreds of students granted scholarships abroad remain trapped between borders and visa delays, or lost their documents due to destruction or university shutdowns. Even those accepted often saw their opportunities canceled because of bureaucratic delays. But some academics warn that these efforts may become symbolic gestures that ease international pressure without addressing the root problem: the destruction of Gaza's educational infrastructure. Amer said that Gaza needs more than just scholarships for some students. “What Gaza needs is not individual rescue but collective reconstruction—a ‘de-scholasticide' movement. That means… restoring education inside Gaza, not draining its talents abroad,” he said. Universities are the backbone of any future Palestine,” he added. “We reaffirm our collective determination to remain on our land and to resume teaching, study, and research in Gaza, at our own Palestinian universities, at the earliest opportunity,” a group of dozens of scholars and administrators wrote in an open letter published in Al Jazeera.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla quits as MP after being accused of recruiting 17 men who are trapped in war-torn Ukraine A daughter of the former South African president Jacob Zuma has resigned as an MP, after being accused of tricking 17 South African men into fighting for Russia in Ukraine by telling them they were travelling to Russia to train as bodyguards for the Zumas' uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party. Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, 43, the most visible and active in politics of her siblings, volunteered to resign and step back from public roles while cooperating with a police investigation and working to bring the men home, the MK chair, Nkosinathi Nhleko, said at a press conference in Durban. On 22 November another of Zuma's daughters, Nkosazana Zuma-Mncube, filed a police report alleging that her sister Zuma-Sambudla and two others, Siphokazi Xuma and Blessing Khoza, had recruited the men, including eight of their family members. Zuma-Mncube did not suggest a motive for her sister's alleged recruiting in the statement she made to police. Zuma-Sambudla then filed an affidavit of her own, claiming she was “a victim of deception, misrepresentation and manipulation” by Khoza after the men were recruited for what she had believed was a legitimate paramilitary training course. Zuma-Sambudla said she went to Russia herself for a month of the training, in excerpts from her statement to police published by local media: “I experienced only non-combat, controlled activities. Zuma, MK party's president, was at the press conference but did not speak. Polygamy is recognised in South Africa via a law governing “customary” marriages. Zuma was ousted as South Africa's president in 2018, after being accused of directing a period of huge corruption known as “state capture”, allegations he has always denied. On Tuesday, police confirmed they were investigating, after receiving both affidavits. On 6 November the office of South Africa's president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said it was investigating how the men became trapped in eastern Ukraine and was working to bring them home, after receiving “distress calls for assistance”. Zuma-Sambudla has consistently posted her support for Russia and its president, Vladimir Putin, online. “We Love You Both LOUDLY And UNAPOLOGETICALLY So … I'll Drink To That” she posted on X, then Twitter, with a photo of her father and Putin making a toast, on 22 February 2022, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. In May, she posted on X: “I Stand With Russia,” alongside photos of the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, although it was not clear if she had taken the photos herself or when they were taken. South Africa's African National Congress party, which forced Zuma to stand down as president in 2018, has long been close to Russia after the Soviet Union supported its struggle against apartheid.</p>

Andriy Yermak, head of the President's Office, submitted his resignation following searches by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) at his premises earlier on Nov. 28, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. Yermak is being investigated by the NABU in a case involving state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom, the biggest corruption investigation during Zelensky's presidency. "There will be a reset of the President's Office," Zelensky said. I am grateful to Andriy for always presenting Ukraine's position in the negotiation track exactly as it needed to be." Zelensky said he wanted to "avoid rumors and speculation." "As for the new head of the (President's) Office, tomorrow I will hold consultations with those who could lead this institution," he added. Zelensky also commented on who would represent Ukraine instead of Yermak, who was appointed to lead a delegation in the U.S.-Ukraine talks in Switzerland on Nov. 23. Rustem Umerov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, is also under investigation in the Energoatom corruption case, but has not been charged so far. Two other officials implicated in the corruption scandal, Justice Minister Herman Halushchenko and Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, were fired on Nov. 19. Zelensky said that he expected new energy and justice ministers to be appointed soon. "The current ministers must be assessed in a way that allows for clear conclusions about whether they are capable of meeting the challenges of both this winter and this war," he added. Ukrainska Pravda reported on Nov. 24, citing its sources, that Yermak is implicated in the corruption scandal, and investigators refer to him as "Ali Baba." Ukraine's chief anti-corruption prosecutor Oleksandr Klymenko said earlier in November that, according to investigators, "Ali Baba is holding meetings and assigning tasks to law enforcement agencies to ensure they persecute NABU detectives and anti-corruption prosecutors." The President's Office did not respond to requests for comment. Appointed in 2020, Yermak has gathered unprecedented influence within the Ukrainian government. Despite long-standing criticism, Zelensky previously said he trusted Yermak and dismissed claims that the latter wielded excessive power. He does what I tell him to do, and he carries out these tasks," Zelensky said in an interview with Bloomberg last year. "The first issue is updating state governance, which, especially in the absence of elections, has been widely discussed," he said. "There is no one within the system or outside it who sees this as a negative step, only positive." Zheleznyak added that the country would not be weakened by Yermak's departure if Zelensky, together with parliament and the government, quickly forms a new team. When asked who might replace Yermak, Zheleznyak said four candidates are being discussed: Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov, military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov, and Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal. Inna Sovsun, another lawmaker from the Holos party, said the resignation came as a surprise despite long-standing calls for it. "It was desired, even dreamed of, but still unexpected. We remember the president saying he would dismiss Yermak only if there was evidence of his involvement in corruption schemes." "So now there is a question of what ultimately prompted the president to act." We are looking for 25,000 people who know the world needs an independent Ukrainian voice like ours — and want to stand with it. "I don't know who might be the new chief of staff — it might be someone from outside the President's Office, because the president wants to reshuffle it," he said. "Yermak staying in his chair could definitely lead us to bad consequences on the international arena and to a deepening of our domestic social crisis," he told the Kyiv Independent. Even "a saint," he said, could be put into the role and "in two months or half a year, this saint person can transform into a devil," noting that "Lucifer started as an angel." "We can thank the president for this difficult but timely decision," he added. We understand investigations are ongoing," he told the Kyiv Independent. Mercier stressed that the anti-corruption drive remains central to Ukraine's EU bid, noting that accession requires "continuous efforts to guarantee a strong capacity to combat corruption and the respect for the rule of law."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Israeli military operation on a Syrian village Friday morning turned into the deadliest attack by a foreign nation on Syria since the ouster of former dictator Bashar al-Assad last year. At least 13 people were killed and 24 were injured after Israeli forces infiltrated the Beit Jinn village in southern Syria to capture two members of Jama'a Islamiya, a Lebanese Islamist militant group. Six Israeli troops were wounded, including three seriously injured, while the two militants were captured and taken back to Israel, the statement added. Syria's Foreign Ministry said Israel launched a “savage and deliberate bombardment” that killed women and children after residents of the village “confronted” the Israeli soldiers. Five members of one Syrian family were killed in the Israeli attack, the medical director of al-Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus told Syria's state news agency. The attack also triggered “large-scale displacement” into neighboring areas after residents fled the bombardment, Syria's Foreign Ministry added. Israeli strikes left Syria ‘stunned' and makes normalization ‘difficult,' Syrian foreign minister says After the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad last year, Israel occupied a number of villages in southern Syria, expressing distrust of the Islamist rebels led by Ahmed al-Sharaa. The Israeli government launched a series of air strikes and military incursions targeting Assad's military infrastructure and weaponry in an attempt to render them unusable to the Islamist rebels. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also ordered his military to intervene in southern Syria to protect the Druze minority after clashes broke out in July between forces loyal to Syria's new government and members of the religious sect. Israel's military interventions into Syria has added pressure on the new government of Al-Sharaa, who had expressed several times a desire to maintain peace with Israel as he attempts to rebuild Syria, devastated after more than a decade of civil war. The two nations held unprecedented direct talks on several occasions over the past year to discuss security arrangements, yet no permanent agreement has been reached so far.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Vladimir Kara-Murza, Yulia Navalnaya and Ilya Yashin in Berlin on Nov. 17, 2024. One of Russia's most prominent opposition figures is visiting Canada next week, hoping to push Ottawa to open its doors to Russian dissidents who are at risk of being deported from the United States and back into the arms of the Vladimir Putin's security services. The lobbying mission by Ilya Yashin, one of Mr. Putin's loudest critics, is a follow-up to a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney that was published in September. The letter was written by Mr. Yashin, along with fellow opposition leaders Yulia Navalnaya and Vladimir Kara-Murza. The 42-year-old – who was released from a Russian prison last year after spending two years there for criticizing the invasion of Ukraine – was nonetheless optimistic about his three-day trip to Ottawa. Mr. Yashin will be accompanied by Natalia Arno, president of the Free Russia Foundation, a Washington-based non-profit organization. Mr. Yashin, a longtime anti-Putin activist and former Moscow city councillor, and Mr. Kara-Murza, a former aide to the assassinated opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, were both released from prison in August, 2024, as part of a Cold War-style prisoner exchange between Russia and the U.S. The Russian dissident who didn't want to leave Putin's jail However, Ms. Arno said the opposition was now focused on getting Ottawa to open a special immigration channel for a list of 30 well-known anti-Putin activists. “There are, I would say, over 1,000 Russians in ICE detention, if not more, but we cannot vouch for all of them. But we can vouch for those who are core activists, journalists and human rights defenders,” she said. While Ms. Arno said there had since been a pause in such mass deportation flights, it may only have been a function of the 43-day U.S. government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. Alexei Navalny's prison diaries show 10 days of soul-searching with zero regrets Ms. Arno said the Free Russia Foundation, which maintains an office in Kyiv, was also pushing for Canada to assist Ukrainian nationals being held in ICE detention and at risk of being deported back to a country that has been at war since Mr. Putin launched his invasion almost four years ago. After the meetings in Ottawa, Mr. Yashin plans to visit Montreal and Toronto, where he will meet with members of the Russian-Canadian diaspora and urge them to do more to oppose Mr. Putin and his war. “People can engage in different forms of political activism. Some can donate money to buy generators for Ukraine. Some can volunteer with opposition organizations,” said Mr. Yashin, who has organized a series of similar meetings with the Russian diaspora around Europe since his release from prison. “I want these groups of Russian diaspora, from different cities around the world, to become one movement – a movement against the war in Ukraine, a movement for Russia to become a free, peaceful and democratic country.” Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>One of Ukraine's most influential political operators and a close aide of President Volodymyr Zelensky has resigned, hours after anti-corruption agencies raided his home – a major crisis as Kyiv faces new pressure from the US to accept a peace deal to end the war with Russia. Officially the chief of staff to the president, Andriy Yermak has often been seen as Ukraine's second most powerful man. He has been leading the Ukrainian delegation during recent talks in Geneva with Washington. Yermak's resignation, which was announced by Zelensky on Friday, complicates Kyiv's position going into crucial peace negotiations with the United States. “I want no one to have any questions about Ukraine today. The head of the office, Andriy Yermak, has written a letter of resignation,” Zelensky said in his daily TV address. Yermak did not immediately issue a public statement. They have been given full access to the apartment, and my lawyers are on site, interacting with law enforcement officials,” he said. The scandal has already taken down two of Zelensky's ministers and embroiled a former business associate from his days in the entertainment industry. But the latest development is particularly awkward for Zelensky given Yermak's recent elevation to the top of Ukraine's negotiating team. Announcing the resignation, Zelensky said he would be speaking to possible candidates to take up the chief of staff post on Saturday. Energy scandal spells trouble for Zelensky as Ukrainians face another winter of power cuts Last week, the Trump administration came up with a 28-point peace plan that largely reflected Russia's extensive wishlist, including demands for Ukraine to give up territory, reduce its army and be barred from joining NATO. Ukrainian and European officials strongly opposed that version of the peace plan and Yermak's delegation managed to convince the US to revise it. More talks have been scheduled for the coming days. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he was expecting a US delegation to arrive to Moscow early next week, while Zelensky said the Ukrainian team was also set to meet the Americans. Russia said it was monitoring developments following Yermak's resignation. One can hardly now make a prognosis on what is going to happen next,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told CNN on Friday. “We are watching very carefully the situation, while of course pursuing our own goals by continuing the special military operation and then continuing to be open for negotiations and getting prepared for meeting with (US envoy Steve) Witkoff,” Peskov added. While some US officials, including President Donald Trump, have touted great progress being made this week, any chances of a swift breakthrough appear slim, especially after Putin indicated on Thursday that he is unwilling to budge from his maximalist demands. Ukraine has long been seen as one of the most corrupt countries in Europe, a major obstacle to its aspirations to join the European Union. Fighting rampant government corruption was also Zelensky's main campaign pledge ahead of the 2019 election. A former comedian who played Ukraine's president on a hit TV show, Zelensky had zero political experience before his victory – but he tapped into voters' dismay on the issue. During the war, Zelensky has fired a slew of senior Ukrainian officials over corruption allegations, and his government has instigated anti-corruption measures, including the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. But Zelensky's decision earlier this year to fast-track a new law that granted oversight of the NABU and SAPO agencies to the prosecutor general, a politically appointed figure, was seen as a series misstep. Criticised by anti-corruption watchdogs at home and abroad, as well as the EU, the move sparked Ukraine's first anti-government protests since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. But that episode, coupled with the recent allegations wielded against some of Zelensky's closest allies, including his former business partner Timur Mindich, his former Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Chernyshov and now Yermak, are putting more pressure on the Ukrainian leader at a time when he is facing difficult negotiations with the US and Russia.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quality journalism takes work — and a community that cares. Editor's note: Andriy Yermak later submitted his resignation, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced. The National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said on Nov. 28 that it was conducting searches at the premises of President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak. Yermak is being investigated by the NABU in a corruption case involving state nuclear power monopoly Energoatom, the biggest corruption investigation during Zelensky's presidency. "Today, the NABU and SAPO are indeed carrying out procedural actions at my home," Yermak wrote on Telegram. They have been given full access to the apartment, and my lawyers are present on site and are cooperating with law enforcement. The President's Office and Zelensky's press service did not respond to requests for comment. Ukrainian media outlet Dzerkalo Tyzhnia reported, citing its sources, that Yermak's office on Bankova Street in Kyiv and his apartment were being searched. Yermak has faced calls to resign amid the corruption scandal. Despite the backlash, Zelensky has refused to dismiss Yermak. Experts told the Kyiv Independent that, by sending Yermak as a negotiator, Zelensky sought to protect him from investigators. The President's Office did not respond to requests for comment. Ukrainska Pravda also reported on Nov. 24, citing its sources, that Yermak is implicated in the corruption scandal, and investigators refer to him as "Ali Baba." Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of the Anti-Corruption Action Center, said that "usually searches are conducted right before charges are presented to possible suspects." "So therefore we can expect today or very soon charges against Andriy Yermak," she told the Kyiv Independent. A lawmaker from Zelensky's Servant of the People party said that "there hasn't really been much of a reaction" in the party so far. Only a few individuals have taken note of recent events. "But it turns out that this is only the beginning," he added. The lawmaker said that Yermak "should have been dismissed a long time ago.” "It looks as if the president is protecting his friends. Zheleznyak also said that he expects protests and that he hopes "public support is totally on the side of the NABU and SAPO (Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office)." "Until this issue is resolved, he's a weak representative of Ukraine during the negotiations, and that's what I'm most afraid of," she added. "In the first scenario, we have a chance to present ourselves as a European country that has corruption but is actively fighting it," he said. Anastasia Radina, head of parliament's law enforcement committee representing Zelensky's party, said that the NABU and SAPO should "be allowed to do their job without any pushback from other law enforcement (agencies)." "As shocked as we might be, I think it's also important to stress that we finally have these anti-corruption institutions able to probe into people regardless of their position and political standing. This is something Ukraine didn't have 10 years ago." Oleksiy Honcharenko, a lawmaker from the opposition European Solidarity party, said that Yermak should be suspended after the searches and fired if he is charged. "These are tectonic shifts in our current political system because Yermak plays a crucial role there," he added. "He's not the main beneficiary in all this — Zelensky is. But Yermak is his key ally in running everything." Independent journalism is never easy, and it's even harder in wartime.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>US president announces plan after National Guard shooting in Washington DC Donald Trump said the United States would suspend migration from what he called “third world countries”, a day after an Afghan national allegedly shot two National Guard soldiers in Washington DC. “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover,” Mr Trump wrote in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform on Thursday evening. Authorities have charged suspect Rahmanullah Lakanwal, a 29-year-old former special forces commander from Afghanistan, who came to the US in 2021 as part of a resettlement programme, over the shooting. “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,” he said on his social media platform, Truth Social. Mr Trump said he would end all federal benefits and subsidies for “non-citizens”, adding he would “denaturalise migrants who undermine domestic tranquillity” and deport any foreign national deemed a public charge, security risk, or “non-compatible with Western civilization.” When Kabul fell to the Taliban, Mr Lakanwal was evacuated to the United States through Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era programme, arriving in Washington state on September 8 2021. Sex offenders, corrupt officials and people imprisoned under the US-led coalition are also among those who have been accepted for resettlement in the UK in an apparent failure of vetting procedures. Mr Trump's angry post, which finished by wishing Americans a happy Thanksgiving, marked an escalation in the anti-migrant policies of his second term dominated by a mass deportation campaign. “These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations,” Mr Trump said on Thursday.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday his administration will “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” following the death of a National Guard member in an attack near the White House. One National Guard member shot in D.C. has died, Trump says Trump did not identify any countries by name or explain what he meant by third-world countries or “permanently pause.” He said the plan would include cases approved under former President Joe Biden's administration. “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden's autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States,” he said on his social media platform, Truth Social. Trump said he would end all federal benefits and subsidies for “non-citizens,” adding he would “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility” and deport any foreign national deemed a public charge, security risk, or “non-compatible with Western civilization.” Citizenship and Immigration Services did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. UN human rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told a Geneva press briefing: “They are entitled to protection under international law, and that should be given due process.” A National Guard member died on Thursday after being shot near the White House in an ambush that investigators say was carried out by an Afghan national. Fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life,” Trump said. In a separate post prior to his “permanently pause” announcement, Trump claimed that hundreds of thousands of people poured into the U.S. totally “unvetted and unchecked” during what he described as the “horrendous” airlift from Afghanistan. Trump indicated that his administration's goals are aimed at significantly reducing “illegal and disruptive populations,” suggesting that measures would be taken to achieve this outcome. Cracking down on both legal and illegal immigration has been a key focus of his presidency, and this case gave him an opportunity to broaden the debate beyond legality to include stricter vetting of immigrants. Trump has already deployed additional immigration officers to major U.S. cities to achieve record deportation levels, including many long-term residents and individuals with no criminal record. Over two-thirds of the roughly 53,000 people arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and detained as of Nov. 15 had no criminal convictions, according to ICE statistics.
