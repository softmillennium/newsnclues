                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Protein quantification is critical in biologics research and development. However, current methods such as ELISA, BLI, and SPR have complex workflows and can struggle with crude samples or early-stage screening. These limits drive up the need for platforms that combine quickness, ease of use, and resilience. Redox Electrochemical Detection (RED) is a sensor-based detection approach that generates an electrical signal through enzyme-mediated redox reactions, which is then monitored directly using electrode sensors. RED is applied on the Amperia™ platform, a compact benchtop platform built on patented sensor technology, with disposable dip-style sensors and prefilled assay plates. Amperia™ uses Redox Electrochemical Detection (RED) to streamline protein measurement, removing the requirement for optics and fluidics. It produces consistent findings for targets like AAV, mAbs, and His-tagged proteins, even in crude samples. It facilitates early screening and upstream workflows thanks to its small design, low training requirements, and target-specific assay formats. Ongoing development aims to broaden assay offerings and integrate with automated systems. Abselion started in 2018, at that time under the name HexagonFab, in a small corner of a laboratory at the University of Cambridge. We set out with the humble goal to make protein research simpler. Scientists should be able to pursue their passion for discovery and innovation, rather than spend their valuable time with tedious, manual tasks. Over the years we have designed, built and tested our first product Amperia and we're proud to introduce it to the world.​ Sponsored Content Policy: News-Medical.net publishes articles and related content that may be derived from sources where we have existing commercial relationships, provided such content adds value to the core editorial ethos of News-Medical.Net which is to educate and inform site visitors interested in medical research, science, medical devices and treatments.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research suggests that consuming three to four cups of coffee daily may help slow cellular aging in individuals with schizophrenia and affective disorders, uncovering a surprising lifestyle factor linked to biological resilience. Study: Coffee intake is associated with telomere length in severe mental disorders. In a recent study published in BMJ Mental Health, researchers examined whether different levels of daily coffee consumption were associated with a marker of cellular aging in adults with severe mental disorders (SMD). People who drank moderate amounts of coffee daily showed the longest telomeres. The most evident statistically significant difference was observed between non-drinkers and those consuming three to four cups per day. Some coffee drinkers show telomere lengths equivalent to being approximately five years biologically younger than non-drinkers. People with SMD experience substantially reduced life expectancy due to high rates of physical diseases commonly linked to aging, such as cardiovascular conditions and cancer. Researchers have therefore proposed accelerated biological aging in these groups, often assessed through telomere length, which naturally shortens with age. Multiple studies show that individuals with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder typically have shorter telomere length than healthy peers, though the causes remain unclear. Because telomeres are sensitive to environmental influences, lifestyle factors such as diet have become important research targets. Coffee is one of the world's most widely consumed beverages. Moderate coffee consumption has been linked to cognitive benefits, reduced risks of neurodegenerative disorders, obesity, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and lower all-cause mortality. Evidence from population studies on coffee and telomere length is mixed, with some showing detrimental effects and others suggesting antioxidant-related protection. Individuals with SMD tend to consume more caffeine than the general population, yet no study has specifically tested how coffee consumption relates to telomere length in schizophrenia or affective disorders. This cross-sectional study included 436 adults diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders or affective disorders, recruited across four psychiatric units in Norway. Participants with some neurological conditions, significant head trauma, or somatic illnesses affecting brain function were excluded. Medication use was extracted from medical records, reported as daily defined doses for major psychotropic classes. Telomere length was measured from peripheral blood leukocytes, producing a telomere–to–single–copy gene ratio. Base-pair differences were translated into estimated years of accelerated aging. Group differences in telomere length were evaluated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for medication dosage, smoking duration, ethnicity, age, and sex. Across the 436 participants, coffee consumption groups differed mainly by age and smoking history. Those drinking five or more cups per day were older than non-drinkers and low-intake groups, and they also had the longest smoking histories. Coffee use did not vary by sex or medication use, but individuals with schizophrenia consumed more coffee than those with affective disorders. Analyses showed a significant inverted J-shaped relationship between coffee intake and telomere length. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, smoking duration, and medication, telomere length differed across consumption groups, with the clearest contrast between non-drinkers and those consuming three or four cups per day. This was the only comparison that had any statistical significance. Moderate coffee intake was associated with longer telomeres, whereas very high intake of five or more cups daily did not show this benefit. When comparing non-drinkers with all participants consuming within the recommended range of one to four cups a day, coffee drinkers appeared biologically about five years younger, based on estimated telomere shortening rates. These associations were consistent after adjusting for diagnosis, and there were no interactions by sex or diagnostic group, indicating similar effects in men and women and in schizophrenia versus affective disorders. The study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is linked to longer telomeres, and therefore potentially slower cellular aging, in people with severe mental disorders. The pattern resembled an inverted J-curve: drinking up to four cups per day was associated with longer telomere length, but higher intake showed no advantage. These findings align with some large population studies, though others report opposite or mixed results. Proposed mechanisms include antioxidants in coffee that may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as caffeine-related effects on telomerase pathways that influence telomere maintenance. These factors are especially relevant in schizophrenia and affective disorders, where accelerated aging is often observed. The study was cross-sectional and lacked a healthy control group, which limited causal inference. Telomere length measurements provided an average rather than a distribution of short telomeres. Overall, results suggest potential benefits of moderate coffee intake but possible harm at high levels, highlighting the importance of monitoring consumption in this population.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In preclinical studies, researchers found that priming the immune system with a Treg-expanding therapy before stem cell transplant boosted survival, protected vital organs, and promoted a balanced gut microbiome-offering hope for safer, more effective treatment of blood cancers. The new protocol focuses on improving outcomes for patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT), a procedure often used to treat blood cancers and other serious conditions. Transplant patients face a risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a complication where the new immune cells attack the patient's own tissues. Traditionally, doctors use strong medications to suppress the immune system and prevent GVHD, but these drugs can cause side effects and leave patients vulnerable to infections. Led by senior author, Robert Levy, Ph.D., a researcher at Sylvester and a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Miller School, the multi-institutional research team developed a new protocol that uses targeted immunotherapy to help the body's own regulatory T cells (Tregs) expand before transplant. The researchers used preclinical models to test a combination of two agents: TL1A-Ig fusion protein and low-dose IL-2. The protocol led to several positive outcomes in preclinical studies: "We saw that expanding Tregs before transplant helped protect vital tissues organs and supported a healthier microbiome," Levy said. "This could mean fewer complications and better recovery for patients." This research is significant because it offers a new way to prevent GVHD without relying solely on broad immune-suppressing drugs. By using targeted immunotherapy to expand Tregs, the protocol may reduce side effects and improve the quality of life for transplant patients. Another key finding is that the protocol does not interfere with the body's ability to address cancer cells-a process known as graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). Maintaining GVL is crucial for preventing relapse in patients with blood cancers. "Our goal is to make transplants safer while still allowing the patient's immune system to do its job against cancer," Levy noted. "We're working toward therapies that are both effective and practical for real-world use." This approach could simplify treatment and make it more accessible. Patients who received the Treg expansion protocol had a more diverse and balanced microbiome, a finding that is increasingly recognized as important for immune health. "Personalized medicine is about tailoring treatments to each patient's needs," Levy said. "By supporting the immune system and microbiome, we can help patients recover more smoothly." He and colleagues are working to translate these findings into clinical trials. The hope is that this protocol will become part of standard care for patients undergoing stem cell transplants, leading to fewer complications and better long-term outcomes. "Every step forward brings us closer to safer, more effective transplants." Levy's team included researchers from other leading institutions including Sloan Kettering Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York, Weill Cornell Medical College and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle. Pretransplant targeting of TNFRSF25 and CD25 stimulates recipient Tregs in target tissues, ameliorating GVHD post-HSCT.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The findings suggest that for most social media users, excessive use is driven by habit rather than genuine addiction. Addiction towards a substance or action is typically characterised by a cluster of symptoms including difficulties controlling use, experiencing cravings to use, experiencing withdrawal symptoms when not using, and continuing to use despite negative consequences or risk of harm. Ian Anderson and Wendy Wood surveyed an approximately representative sample of 380 US Instagram users, who were 50% women and had an average age of 44 years. The authors found that although 18% of participants at least somewhat agreed that they were addicted to Instagram - with 5% substantially agreeing - only 2% displayed symptoms indicating risk of potential addiction. The authors explored a potential cause of this discrepancy by assessing descriptions of social media use in news articles published in US news media outlets between November 2021 and November 2024. They identified 4,383 articles mentioning the phrase "social media addiction" and 50 mentioning the phrase "social media habit". This suggests that frequent social media use tends to be described as an addiction in US news articles. The authors suggest that this may influence how users perceive their social media use. Using a second sample of 824 US adult Instagram users, the authors investigated potential negative impacts of labelling frequent Instagram use as an addiction. The authors found that prompting participants to frame their social media use as an addiction was associated with lower feelings of control over their Instagram use and assigning higher levels of blame to both themselves and the platform for their excessive use. Together, the findings suggest that labelling frequent social media use as an addiction by news media and other institutions may contribute to Instagram users overestimating the extent to which they are addicted to the platform and may also negatively impact their perceptions of their social media use. More selective use of the term addiction by policymakers and the news media in relation to social media use may reduce this effect, according to the authors. Overestimates of social media addiction are common but costly.
