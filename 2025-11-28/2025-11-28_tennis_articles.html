                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nicolai Budkov Kjaer has qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF for the first time. The 19-year-old Norwegian, who has claimed four ATP Challenger Tour titles in 2025, is the sixth player to secure a spot at the 20-and-under event, held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 17-21 December. 132 in the PIF ATP Rankings following an impressive rise. While his continued success on the ATP Challenger Tour has been a solid foundation, it was his breakthrough performance in Bastad — where he came through qualifying before downing Thiago Monteiro for his maiden ATP Tour win — that put him into firm contention in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah. The 2024 Wimbledon boys' champion grew up idolising fellow Norwegian Casper Ruud. Having trained alongside the former World No. 2 and three-time major finalist, Budkov Kjaer describes Ruud as a “big brother” figure, learning valuable lessons along the way. At the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Budkov Kjaer will look to join the ranks of elite former champions, including Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, whom the Norwegian hit with as a sparring partner at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals. Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien, Alexander Blockx, Dino Prizmic and Martin Landaluce have also qualified for the 20-and-under event.

I'm just enjoying my experience and that takes a lot of weight off my shoulders: I'm able to go out there freely and that helps me a lot. That freedom translates into fearlessness on court — especially against the sport's heavyweights — and it was on full display at the Australian Open in January. It didn't stop in Melbourne, where he reached the fourth round, however. Time and time again, he walked into marquee stadiums and swung with nothing to lose, compiling a 5-3 record against Top 10 players, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, across the 2025 season. I don't think there is a lot of expectation on me to win, especially coming out at the beginning of the year,” said Tien, who also defeated Alexander Zverev, Ben Shelton, Andrey Rublev and Lorenzo Musetti. “I just go out, play free, and play well, and I've been fortunate enough to come through a lot of them.” Tien is part of a generational surge powered by the same young talents who shared the stage with him last year in Jeddah. Joao Fonseca — who beat Tien in the title match — and Miami champion Jakub Mensik have joined him in turning the 2025 season into a statement year for their age group. Together, they are leading the next wave of men's tennis, aiming to follow the path carved out by former Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champions Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, now the World No. “I think a lot of the younger guys are doing well,” said Tien. “Sometimes it's tough, and people come out a little better than others during the first year as they don't really know how a lot of the new stuff can go. But the young guys do a good job of pushing each other. It's been great all the young guys pushing each other this year.” You May Also Like: Learner Tien: First-Time Winner Spotlight Former World No. “I don't have much experience myself as it's my first time around, so having someone on my team who really knows how things go, and having that many years, just really helps me a lot.” Returning to Jeddah this year with unfinished business, Tien will bring the confidence of a Top 30 breakthrough, the fearless mentality that helped him topple multiple Top 10 stars, and the poise of a young star learning to thrive under pressure.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rohan Bopanna's career can be distilled into three words: patience, discipline, and self belief. They are simple qualities, but the weight of that sentence becomes clear only when he describes how close he came to leaving the sport altogether in 2021. “I think my career is a story of patience, discipline and self belief,” Bopanna told ATPTour.com after bringing his playing career to a close earlier this month. That's where it made a massive difference, a massive switch for me going from almost quitting tennis to becoming World No. Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden win the 2024 Australian Open doubles title. The Indian grew up in Coorg, a hilly region of Karnataka known for its coffee estates and quiet rhythms rather than tennis academies. With only one national TV channel broadcasting Grand Slam tournaments, the professional game felt remote. 1, especially at the age of 43, it's a journey way beyond what I imagined,” said Bopanna. As a junior, Bopanna's tennis education came partly from watching ATP No. 1s in doubles, redefining what Indian players could achieve. When Bopanna eventually shared the Davis Cup locker room with Paes and Bhupathi, those examples became lived lessons in professionalism and partnership. “I was reading about all these guys doing so many great things, representing India at Davis Cup, at the Olympics and Asian Games,” Bopanna said of those early role models. “They started becoming a great inspiration for me. Both Mahesh and Leander were two guys I looked up to. I got to pick their brain day in, day out, to figure out how I should go about my journey. “Sania Mirza was also somebody I came along the Tour with, and we shared a lot of great memories. Even though I met beautiful people from across the world, just sharing this journey from somebody from your own country, I think helps you shape your journey better as well.” Yet Bopanna's rise did not come without difficult stretches. In 2006, he had shoulder surgery that sidelined him for six months, and later in his career he battled painful knee issues. After a punishing stretch in 2021, during which he lost his opening seven tour-level matches and recorded his first win of the year in May, the then-41-year-old found himself closer than ever to retirement. “Right after Covid, when I came back and we were going through all the lockdowns and testings, that year challenged me significantly,”Bopanna said of the 2021 season. “I went almost five months without winning a match. This is how I think the journey ends.' That is where I started playing my best tennis.” That conversation became the hinge on which his career turned. Rohan Bopanna celebrates with his wife Supriya and daughter Tridha at the 2024 Australian Open. Bopanna's renaissance, highlighted by the 2024 Australian Open title with Matthew Ebden, was matched by the integrity that defined his career. In the 2023 US Open final, during his and Ebden's loss to Rajeev Ram and Joe Salisbury, Bopanna admitted that a ball had brushed his hand in a moment of instinctive sportsmanship that resonated with fans and peers. “I've always felt like doing the right thing. It was straight away my instinct to call it upon myself to say that the ball touched me,” Bopanna said. “I'm thankful to my parents who have taught me that from a very young age. Even today, I don't have any regrets of doing something like that. I will keep that for the rest of my life.” Bopanna posted a 539-410 career record in doubles and earned 15 singles wins, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, but retirement will not take him away from the sport. Now 45 years old, Bopanna wants to help create more tournaments in India, build better pathways for juniors, and use the relationships he formed around the world to reshape Indian tennis. “She came into an era where I was actually doing really well, and she thought it was normal to have these things. My next true mission is to help Indian tennis. Looking back on a career filled with success, Bopanna hopes his legacy reflects not only the trophies he collected but the person he was throughout. “I stayed humble because of my tennis and it has always kept me honest and that's what I want to be remembered for,” Bopanna said. I brought my fierce side when I was competing, but outside the tennis court, I just want to be known as someone who was humble and enjoyed the circuit, who loved to be around this great sport and all these wonderful people I met.” No part of this site may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any way or by any means (including photocopying, recording or storing it in any medium by electronic means), without the written permission of ATP Tour, Inc..</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Martin Landaluce has qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, 12 months after serving as an alternate at the 20-and-under event. After a consistent six months, Landaluce then won a main-draw match at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati. ATP Challenger Tour success then arrived in Orleans, where the 19-year-old lifted his second trophy at that level and first of the year. Landaluce works with coaches Oscar Burrieza and Esteban Carril. But Martin has this ability to wake up the next day and get back to practice like nothing happened. Whether he's about to play at the Madrid Open or a Futures match, he acts the same. "I like doing a lot of things outside of tennis that help me mentally, reading, breathing exercises, meditation. Those things help me stay focused on court,” Landaluce told ATPTour.com in August. “I try to rely on discipline more than motivation. A lot of people think motivation comes first, but for me, discipline comes first and that brings motivation. That's where the motivation comes from.” The 2025 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF will take place from 17-21 December. Former champions include Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz. Jakub Mensik, Learner Tien, Alexander Blockx and Dino Prizmic have qualified for this year's event.
