                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bortoleto disappointed to miss out on SQ3 spot in Qatar Bearman laments ‘the perfect storm' in Sprint Qualifying as he misses out on SQ3 Oscar Piastri will start Saturday's 19-lap Sprint from pole, alongside George Russell. Oscar Piastri claimed a crucial pole position for the Qatar Sprint, beating George Russell and McLaren team mate Lando Norris to the top spot. Norris, who holds a 24-point lead over Piastri and Max Verstappen ahead of the Qatar Grand Prix, which means he can claim a maiden Formula 1 title this weekend, finished two-tenths further back after running wide at the last corner on his final effort. Fernando Alonso took an impressive P4 for Aston Martin, as Yuki Tsunoda out-qualified Red Bull team mate Verstappen, the Dutchman struggling with bouncing and finishing P6. The top-10 was completed by Kimi Antonelli (Mercedes), Carlos Sainz (Williams), Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) and the second Williams of Alex Albon. Isack Hadjar failed to progress into SQ3 after losing his final lap time due to track limits at Turn 8, the Racing Bulls driver classified P11 from Ollie Bearman (Haas) and Gabriel Bortoleto (Kick Sauber). With track evolution at the Lusail International Circuit high, times continued to tumble and Verstappen, Norris and Piastri traded fastest laps before Alonso briefly topped the leaderboard. Verstappen eventually finished fastest on a 1m 21.172s, leaving him one-tenth clear of the Aston Martin driver as Piastri, Hulkenberg, Norris and Hadjar completed the top six. The seven-time World Champion only headed both Alpines of Gasly and Colapinto, with a Turn 1 and Turn 16 incident between Verstappen and Norris for impeding noted by the stewards before no further action was taken for each. It left him just 0.049s clear of his team mate and only 0.080s ahead of Verstappen after the Dutchman's second effort, with the time proving good enough for P1 despite Norris running wide at Turn 2 on his final lap. Verstappen was left complaining of bouncing aboard his Red Bull over the radio in P3, the order completed by Russell, Tsunoda, Sainz, Leclerc, Albon and Alonso. Antonelli was provisionally eliminated but a track limits time deletion for Hadjar at Turn 8 meant the Frenchman lost his best lap and finished P11, where he was joined by Bearman, Bortoleto and Hulkenberg, who also lost his best lap to track limits, as Ocon finished P15. With drivers required to use the soft tyre for the time in Sprint Qualifying, McLaren seemed to take a noticeable leap forward compared with other teams, as Piastri just edged Norris by 0.044s after the pair's first flying laps. Piastri improved with his second effort, posting a 1m 20.055s which was only fractionally faster than Russell, while Norris had to settle for third after running wide at the final corner and failing to improve. Behind the top six, Antonelli headed Sainz, Leclerc and Albon, both Williams drivers reaching SQ3 on a track where they expected to struggle. "It's been a day where things have clicked from the start and I think the Sprint Qualifying session went really well. I had a pretty big moment on my lap but it was just enough in the end so thanks to the team – it's a great car and it's looked really good this weekend so far.</p>
