                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In central Egypt, archaeologists uncovered one of these elaborate scenes: a 3,500-year-old New Kingdom cemetery filled with mummies, amulets, statues, canopic jars, and a 43-foot-long papyrus scroll containing part of the Book of the Dead. This scroll is the first complete papyrus found in the Al-Ghuraifa area, and is “characterized by being in good condition,” Mustafa Waziri, secretary general of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in a translated Arabic statement from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities. “If it's that long and well-preserved [then it's] certainly a great and interesting find,” Lara Weiss, CEO of the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Germany, told Live Science. The book, which is more properly translated as “The Chapters/Book of Going Forth By Day,” played a key role in ancient Egyptian culture. Any examples of the text give researchers insight into ancient Egyptian religion and beliefs about an afterlife, according to the American Research Center in Egypt. Next to her coffin were two wooden boxes with her canopic vessels, in addition to a complete set of ushabti statues and a statue of the ostrich-like deity, Ptah Sokar.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bats are beneficial to our ecosystems and economy but, as habitat destruction and environmental stressors put them in closer proximity to humans, disease risks can emerge. It found young bats are infected more frequently and could be a key source of viral spillover into other species. Endemic in bat populations, most coronaviruses never infect humans. "Coronaviruses tend not to be of major concern to bats," said Dr Alison Peel from the University's School of Veterinary Science, who led the study. In one of the most comprehensive single studies of its type, the researchers collected more than 2,500 faecal samples, via which bats shed coronaviruses, over three years. Viral testing of the samples showed coronaviruses were most prevalent in young bats between March and July, when they were weaning and approaching maturity. Particularly notable was the high proportion of bats infected with multiple coronaviruses at once. "We were surprised by that high rate of co-infection among juveniles and subadults," Dr Peel said. "Co-infection presents the opportunity for a single cell to become infected with multiple viruses, an important natural precursor to the generation of new strains." "We safely tracked how and when coronaviruses circulated naturally in bat populations. Using genomics to track infections to individual animals," Dr John-Sebastian Eden, a study co-author from the Westmead Insitute for Medical Research and the University's Faculty of Medicine and Health. By focusing on co-infections in young bats during certain periods, researchers might better predict the natural evolution and emergence of riskier coronaviruses before they pose a risk to human health." "We know from previous research on other viruses that habitat loss caused by encroaching human populations and food shortages can create stress in bats that weakens immunity and makes them susceptible to infections. It will be important to find out if that's also the case for coronaviruses." It built on earlier research into the spread of Hendra virus, which also originates in bats. "It's rare to see this scale and depth of data in virological research, even among human viruses," said Dr Peel. "The gathering of samples from both individual bats and beneath roosts, and the tracking of individual strains across multiple sites and years, provides a strong foundation for ongoing research into the role of environmental stress on coronavirus emergence." “Remarkable” Results – Scientists Say This Supplement Reversed Heart Damage MIT's Tiny New Device Could Save Diabetics From Deadly Blood Sugar Crashes Stay informed with ScienceDaily's free email newsletter, updated daily and weekly.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Beneath the scales of Australia's iconic monitor lizards (commonly known as goannas), scientists have discovered an unexpected secret: a hidden layer of bony skin structures known as osteoderms. These structures, which have been long overlooked, may hold the key to understanding how these ancient reptiles not only survived but thrived in one of the world's harshest environments. The international collaboration brought together researchers from Australia, Europe and the United States, who used cutting-edge micro-CT scanning to examine nearly 2,000 reptile specimens from major museum collections including those held at Museums Victoria's Research Institute. 'We were astonished to find osteoderms in 29 Australo-Papuan monitor lizard species that had never been documented before,' said Roy Ebel, lead author and researcher at Museums Victoria Research Institute and the Australian National University. Osteoderms are most commonly known from crocodiles, armadillos, and even some dinosaurs like Stegosaurus. But their function has remained something of an evolutionary mystery. This new research reveals that osteoderms are far more widespread in lizards than previously thought, occurring in nearly half of all lizard species worldwide - an 85% increase on earlier estimates. Scientific institutions like Museums Victoria Research Institute play a critical role in preserving biodiversity through time, enabling researchers to study species long after they were collected. These collections are not just archives, they're active tools for scientific discovery. 'What's so exciting about this finding is that it reshapes what we thought we knew about reptile evolution,' said Dr Jane Melville, Museums Victoria Research Institute Senior Curator of Terrestrial Vertebrates. But the discovery of their widespread presence across Australo-Papuan goannas opens up new questions about how these lizards adapted, survived and diversified across the continent.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>While Australia is the world's second-largest exporter of oats, high oil content in oat grains creates challenges during milling, reducing processing efficiency and limiting product innovation - particularly in high-demand sectors like oat flour and plant-based proteins. In this study, two contemporary varieties of oats were examined using spatial imaging techniques to track oil build-up during grain development. These findings will help to guide future breeding efforts for naturally lower-oil oat varieties, improving milling yields and creating new value-added opportunities across the oat supply chain. "While oil can be removed from partially milled oat flakes - using supercritical carbon dioxide prior to further milling - this approach is laborious and expensive," he says. "Breeding low-oil oat varieties is a cost-effective approach but requires further understanding of oil production in oats. "Our analysis has identified several key enzymes that are involved in oil synthesis which could be genetically manipulated to lower oil content of oat grains. "Reducing oil content could also unlock new opportunities in sectors like oat flour and alternative proteins, which could significantly strengthen Australia's position in the market." The UniSA findings are being used by the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) oat grain quality consortium to improve suitability for milling and food/beverage ingredient development. Additional research is continuing within the consortium that will build on the study's findings to further inform breeding efforts aimed at reducing oil content in oats. "The consortia are currently working on a larger and more diverse oat cohort to further investigate molecular markers and nutrient partitioning of oil in oats," Lau says. SARDI Project Lead Dr Janine Croser, says the study's findings provide further evidence of key pathways involved in oat oil biosynthesis. "This research provides important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying varietal differences of oil production in developing oat grains," Dr Croser says. "We expect that the development of low-oil lines will improve efficiencies in the flour milling process and potentially lead to novel uses for oats.

Nature Immunology (2025)Cite this article Microglia are implicated in aging, neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Low-plex protein imaging does not capture cellular states and interactions in the human brain, which differs from rodent models. Here we used multiplexed ion beam imaging to spatially map cellular states and niches in cognitively normal human brains, identifying a spectrum of proteomic microglial profiles. Defined by immune activation states that were skewed across brain regions and compartmentalized according to microenvironments, this spectrum enables the identification of proteomic trends across the microglia of ten cognitively normal individuals and orthogonally with single-nuclei epigenetic analysis, revealing associated molecular functions. Notably, AD tissues exhibit regulatory shifts in the immunologically active cells at the end of the proteomic spectrum, including enrichment of CD33 and CD44 and decreases in HLA-DR, P2RY12 and ApoE expression. These findings establish an in situ, single-cell spatial proteomic framework for AD-specific microglial states.

The precious coins and materials weren't simply strewn about. Crews discovered plenty of ancient buildings making up an entire settlement from the La Tene period, likely a Celtic community. “The settlement was a supra-regional trade and production center connected to long-distance trade routes, as evidenced by the finds of amber, gold and silver coins, and evidence of the production of luxury ceramics.” The team found gold and silver Celtic coins, coin dies, fragments of ceramic vessels, dwelling foundations, production facilities, and at least one religious sanctuary. With 22,000 bags loaded with artifacts from the area, it is one of the largest ever collections discovered in Bohemia comprising both everyday objects and an “extraordinarily rich collection of jewelry.” Tomas Mangel, a professor at the University of Hradec Kralove and the excavation co-leader, told Live Science there could be several hundred coin pieces and that the jewelry features “pieces of bronze and iron brooches, fragments of armlets, metallic components of belts, glass beads, and armlets.” “Bohemia is traditionally really connected with [the] Boii,” Mangel told Live Science.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Studying nuclear decay modes is crucial for understanding properties of atomic nuclei. "Aluminium-20 is the lightest aluminium isotope that has been discovered so far. Through detailed analysis of angular correlations, the researchers found that the aluminium-20 ground state first decays by emitting one proton to the intermediate ground state of magnesium-19, followed by subsequent decay of magnesium-19 ground state via simultaneous two-proton emission. To date, scientists have discovered over 3,300 nuclides, yet fewer than 300 are stable and exist naturally. The remainder are unstable nuclides that undergo radioactive decay. In the 1970s, scientists discovered single-proton radioactivity, where nuclei decay by emitting a proton. In recent years, even rarer decay phenomena such as three-, four-, and five-proton emission were observed. This collaborative effort included contributions from IMP, GSI, Fudan University, and more than a dozen other institutions. Materials provided by Chinese Academy of Sciences Headquarters.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NASA Staff Rebuke White House Cuts in Rare Public Dissent More than 280 NASA employees past and present, including at least 4 astronauts, have signed a declaration of opposition to the many drastic changes that the administration of US President Donald Trump is working to enact. “The last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce,” reads the employees' letter to interim administrator Sean Duffy. It argues that Trump's changes threaten human safety, scientific progress and global leadership at NASA.

Kaplan works on a contract basis as a website administrator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was speaking on her own behalf and not that of her employer or of NASA. When Duffy ran for a seat in the US Congress more than a decade ago, he released a campaign advertisement that featured him wearing lumberjack clothing and saying he would bring his axe to “topple the big spending in Washington”. The agency is not interested in sustaining “lower-priority missions”, said NASA spokeswoman Bethany Stevens. “We must revisit what's working and what's not so that we can inspire the American people again and win the space race.” At least US$118 million in NASA grants has been cancelled outright, and the White House has proposed slashing nearly half of the agency's science budget for next year. Congress, which sets US spending, might reject at least some of those proposed cuts. “Once operational spacecraft are decommissioned, they cannot be turned back on,” the document says. NASA, like other agencies, is supposed to follow spending priorities laid out by Congress, and Duffy, as interim administrator, could theoretically ignore the White House requests until a budget is finalised. The declaration asserts that since Trump took office, safety has taken a back seat to politics, marking a “dangerous turn” away from NASA's efforts to make human space flight less risky. The document's signers also disapprove of the agency's withdrawal from international missions, saying that such actions threaten partnerships with other nations' space agencies. The White House budget proposal, for instance, would cancel NASA participation in European Space Agency missions to Mars and Venus. Dissent by employees at other federal agencies has met with mixed reactions. At the NIH, where more than 480 employees signed a Bethesda Declaration, director Jay Bhattacharya has said he intends to foster respectful dissent. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has placed more than 100 signatories to a dissenting document on administrative leave, saying he will not tolerate employees undercutting the president's agenda.

Nature Machine Intelligence (2025)Cite this article Advances in data-driven design and additive manufacturing have substantially accelerated the development of truss metamaterials—three-dimensional truss networks—offering exceptional mechanical properties at a fraction of the weight of conventional solids. While existing design approaches can generate metamaterials with target linear properties, such as elasticity, they struggle to capture complex nonlinear behaviours and to incorporate geometric and manufacturing constraints—including defects—crucial for engineering applications. Here we present GraphMetaMat, an autoregressive graph-based framework capable of designing three-dimensional truss metamaterials with programmable nonlinear responses, originating from hard-to-capture physics such as buckling, frictional contact and wave propagation, along with arbitrary geometric constraints and defect tolerance. Integrating graph neural networks, physics biases, imitation learning, reinforcement learning and tree search, we show that GraphMetaMat can target stress–strain curves across four orders of magnitude and vibration transmission responses with varying attenuation gaps, unattainable by previous methods. We further demonstrate the use of GraphMetaMat for the inverse design of novel material topologies with tailorable high-energy absorption and vibration damping that outperform existing polymeric foams and phononic crystals, potentially suitable for protective equipment and electric vehicles. This work sets the stage for the automatic design of manufacturable, defect-tolerant materials with on-demand functionalities.

The physics bias for stress predictions is encoded in the ‘Magnitude Decoder' of the forward model, predicting the coefficients C and n of the power-scaling law, \({y}_{max}={C}_{\rho }^{-n}\), with the relative density \(\bar{\rho }\). Distribution of the relative error (NMAE) for stress-strain inverse design on the (a) 90:5:5 split test set, (b) user-defined target curves, and (c) energy absorbing-oriented target curves. Distribution of the accuracy for wave transmission inverse design on the (d) 90:5:5 split test set, (e) user-defined target sequences, and (f) noise control-oriented target responses. The relative error and accuracy are computed between the predicted responses of the generated metamaterials and the target responses. These results demonstrate how all components, from IL to RL and MCTS, contribute to the performance of our model. (a) Distribution of the relative error (NMAE) between the target and predicted test stress-strain responses, with and without printability constraint. (b) Distribution of the degree of support, Rsupp of the generated graphs on the test stress-strain target responses, with and without printability constraint. (c) Two examples of generated structures with and without printability constraint along with the corresponding FE-reconstructed stress-strain curves. These results reveal that, for certain target responses, printable structures can outperform non-printable truss networks. Overall, GraphMetaMat demonstrates the new capability of encoding manufacturing constraints, and offers flexibility in balancing performance and manufacturability constraints, as highlighted in (a) and (b).

Nature Biomedical Engineering (2025)Cite this article The oral cavity is an accessible site for vaccination, but its sublingual and buccal sites have limited vaccine uptake. Here we show that flat tape dental floss can deliver vaccines through the junctional epithelium of the gingival sulcus, exploiting its naturally leaky properties. Floss-based vaccination delivered protein, inactivated virus, peptide-presenting immunogenic nanoparticles and messenger RNA. In mice, gold nanoparticles functionalized with a peptide derived from the ectodomain of the transmembrane matrix 2 protein of human influenza virus stimulated local lymph nodes, increased CD4+T cells in lymph nodes, lungs and spleen, and boosted antibody-secreting cells in the bone marrow. Floss-based immunization induced strong and sustained immune activation across multiple organs, robust systemic and mucosal antibody responses, and durable protection against lethal influenza infection, independent of age, food and liquid consumption. Floss-based vaccination was superior to sublingual and comparable with intranasal vaccination. In human participants, fluorescent dye delivered via floss picks effectively reached gingival sulcus, supporting clinical feasibility. These findings establish floss-based vaccination as a simple, needle-free strategy that enhances vaccine delivery and immune activation compared with existing mucosal immunization methods.

Scientists are hopeful that this will help ensure research of global significance continues on the continent, despite the US government's proposal to slash spending on polar science. China's latest station, Qinling, kicked off its first winter mission in March. Situated on Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay, Qinling is China's first station in southern Antarctica, not far from stations run by Italy and South Korea. Qingling is “well-placed for research into a huge range of contemporary challenges in Antarctic research”, says Christina Hulbe, a geophysicist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. One of them is determining how cold, dense waters form on the continental shelf, Hulbe says. These waters are the precursor to Antarctic bottom water, which plays a pivotal role in regulating the ocean's ability to store heat and capture carbon. The region is also important for studying marine biodiversity, including krill, penguins and whales. China does not reveal how much it spends on Antarctic research each year, but researchers say that there has been growing government funding for overall research and development over the past decade. Since 2018, China has also built two new icebreakers, Xue Long 2 and Ji Di, and is planning a new summer station in southwest Antarctica, which is scheduled to open in 2027. US scientists fear that they might not be able to continue some of their research and fieldwork in Antarctica. There are also concerns that the US polar databases will not be maintained or updated. Kim Yeadong, the chair of the Korean National Committee on Polar Research, based in Incheon, South Korea, says that Antarctic study benefits all of humanity. “If the US walks away, somebody should continue on this very important endeavour,” he adds. Qinling's global significance will depend partially on how China shares its data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As revenues from the anti-aging market -- riddled with hope and thousands of supplements-- surged past $500 million last year, Emory University researchers identified a compound that actively delays aging in cells and organisms. A newly published study in Nature Partner Journals' Aging demonstrates that psilocin, a byproduct of consuming psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, extended the cellular lifespan of human skin and lung cells by more than 50%. These mice also displayed healthier physical features, such as improved fur quality, fewer white hairs and hair regrowth. While traditionally researched for its mental health benefits, this study suggests that psilocybin impacts multiple hallmarks of aging by reducing oxidative stress, improving DNA repair responses, and preserving telomere length. Telomeres are the structured ends of a chromosome, protecting it from damage that could lead to the formation of age-related diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, or cardiovascular disease. "Most cells in the body express serotonin receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life," says Louise Hecker, PhD, senior author on the study, and former associate professor at Emory University, where the research was initiated and funded. While much of what researchers know about psilocybin relates to the brain, few studies have examined its systemic impacts. "Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. "This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging -- not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years," says Director of Psychedelic Research at Emory University's Department of Psychiatry Ali John Zarrabi, MD. But these mice weren't just surviving longer -- they experienced better aging," adds Zarrabi, co-investigator of the study. "Emory is actively involved in Phase II and III clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression, and these results suggest we also need to understand psilocybin's systemic effects in aging populations," says Zarrabi. "My hope is also that if psilocybin-assisted therapy is approved as an intervention for depression by the FDA in 2027, then having a better quality of life would also translate into a longer, healthier life." The study was initiated at Emory University and funded by several awards, including the Imagine, Innovative, and Impact (I3) Award, Emory University School of Medicine; the Georgia CTSA NIH Award; and a grant from Emory's Woodruff Health Sciences Center for Health in Aging.
