            A Bangladesh Air Force jet crashed into a college in the capital Dhaka on Monday, killing at least 27 people, mostly children, according to officials, in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory.
    


            The crash at Milestone School and College campus, in the Diabari neighborhood of northern Dhaka, injured 171 others, the Bangladesh Armed Forces said Monday. Most of the injured are students who are being treated in hospitals in the capital, the military said.

            Students were attending afternoon classes when the BAF F7 jet hit the two-story campus around 1:18 p.m. local time (3:18 a.m. EST) after a mechanical fault, according to state media BSS News, citing the country's armed forces.
    


            The plane's pilot made “every effort to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas toward a more sparsely inhabited location,” the military said. The pilot was among those killed, The Associated Press reported, citing regional officials.
    


            Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the crash.
    


            Of those killed, 25 were children and 78 people are receiving treatment at various hospitals in Dhaka, Dr Md Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, told reporters on Tuesday.
    


            Scores of people rushed toward the crash site, where emergency crews could be seen trying to extinguish the smoking wreckage of the jet.
    


            The government announced a day of mourning and special prayers, BSS News said.
    


            “I express my deep grief and sorrow over the tragic incident of casualties caused by the crash,” the country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus wrote in a post on X.
    


            “This is a moment of profound pain for the nation. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured and direct all concerned authorities, including hospitals, to address the situation with the utmost priority,” he added.
    


            Eyewitnesses, including the parents of students, recalled huge plumes of ash rising over the school – after a banging sound rang out following the deadly crash.
    


            “When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realized something came from behind,” Masud Tarik, also a teacher at the school, told Reuters. “I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke.”
    


            Others watched the chaotic aftermath unfold on TV. “I was terrified watching videos,” Rafiqa Taha, a student at the facility, told The Associated Press.
    


            “My God! It's my school,” added the 16-year-old.
    


            Milestone College teaches students from ages 4 to 18, according to its website.
    


            Video from Bangladesh's Channel 24 showed smoke billowing as firefighters sprayed water onto the crash site while onlookers gathered around. Other rescue workers searched the rubble.
    


            Video from the hospital shows people being urgently rushed in.
    


            A family member is heard saying his injured sister is a grade four student. Another family member told Channel 24 a first batch of victims arrived at the hospital with severe burns.
    


            “We literally saw skin being torn off,” she said.
    


            A young, injured girl told Channel 24 from her hospital bed: “When we came out, we saw many students who had been charred.”
    


            Condolences came in from across the region with Pakistan and India's prime ministers expressing their solidarity with Bangladesh.

            Hundreds of students gathered outside the smoldering remains of a school in the Bangladeshi capital on Tuesday to demand answers after a military jet slammed into the campus, killing dozens of children.
    


            An ordinary school day turned into terror on Monday when a Bangladesh Air Force jet suffered a mid-air mechanical fault and ploughed into the Milestone School and College in Dhaka, engulfing the two-story building in flames and smoke.
    


            Young students were finishing up afternoon classes and parents had gathered outside the gates to greet their children when the aircraft hit, killing at least 31 people - including 25 children - in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory. Some 165 others were left injured, according to the armed forces public relations directorate (ISPR), many with severe burns.
    


            That most of the dead and injured are young children has compounded the tragedy that shocked the nation of 171 million people and sent the country into national mourning.
    


            As police and air force personnel worked at the scene to retrieve parts of the crashed plane on Tuesday, the gathered crowd began shouting at officials, with some students telling CNN they believe the death toll may be higher than officially released.
    


            The government has denied it is withholding information about the casualties of the crash, state media BSS News reported, citing the Chief Adviser's press wing. It added that the identities of those killed are still being verified.
    


            At the crash site on Tuesday, witnesses were still visibly shaken by the horror they had seen the day before.
    


            “We saw scattered parts of different bodies, of children, guardians,” Mohammad Imran Hussein, a lecturer in the school's English department, told CNN.
    


            “I cannot express everything in words,” he said, emotionally distressed and struggling to speak.
    


            Hussein said he was in a school building across the playground when the jet crashed.
    


            “The sound was really intolerable. And I looked around to see what happened, I saw the tail of the plane. I saw a huge flame of fire,” he said.
    


            Milestone College has a kindergarten, an elementary school and a high school on its campus. The building destroyed in the crash was one of about 20 housing almost 100 students between the ages of six and 13, Hussein said.
    


            “It's like this building was turned into a death trap. It was horrible, totally horrible,” said Sheik Rameen, 21, a student at the high school.
    


            “I saw a lot of children, I tried to save their lives,” he told CNN at the site. “I saw a burnt child seek help but nobody came to help them.”
    


            The FT-7 jet was on a routine training mission when it crashed soon after take off at around 1:18 p.m. local time on Monday (3:18 a.m. EST) after a mechanical fault, according to BSS News, citing the country's armed forces.
    


            The plane's pilot, who has been named as Flight Lieutenant Towkir Islam, made “every effort to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas toward a more sparsely inhabited location,” the military said.
    


            The F-7  BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China's Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane's Information Group. Reuters reported that Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.
    


            Images from the crash site showed parts of the mangled wreckage of the jet lodged into the side of the scorched school as emergency crews continued their operations.
    


            Following the crash, emergency crews and families rushed the injured to hospitals in the capital where doctors raced to treat severe burns caused by the inferno. The hospitals quickly became overwhelmed with frantic relatives desperate for news of their loved ones.
    


            Most of the injured at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital's burns unit are children under the age of 12, resident surgeon Harunur Rashid told Reuters.
    


            Video shows crowds waiting outside the hospital and waiting rooms packed with anxious families.
    


            Bangladesh's interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said on Monday that, “I have no words. I don't know how to begin.”
    


            “None of us ever imagined it. It wasn't within anyone's expectations. But we had to suddenly accept this unbelievable reality,” Yunus said in a video message.
    


            Yunus said the training aircraft “crashed and fell upon these innocent children” and many were “burned to death in the fire.”
    


            “What answer can we give to their parents? What can we possibly say to them? We can't even answer ourselves,” he said.

            Stephen Colbert gained a little help from his friends and late-night rivals on Monday, his first night back on “The Late Show” since announcing that CBS is ending the legendary show.
    


            NBC's Jimmy Fallon, HBO's John Oliver, and Comedy Central's Jon Stewart were among the faces in the “Late Show” crowd during a spoof of the now-famous “Coldplay cam.”
    


            The fellow comedians didn't speak and they didn't have to: Being there was the point.
    


            The “Late Show” cancellation raised concerns about the future of late-night comedy — and about something bigger. Are big TV networks going to keep supporting political satire and free speech at a time when President Trump's campaign of retribution is rattling corporate America?
    


            “Some people see this show going away as a sign of something truly dire,” Colbert acknowledged Monday night.
    


            “And while I am a big fan of me, I don't necessarily agree with that statement,” he said. “Because we here at ‘The Late Show' never saw our job as changing anything other than how you felt at the end of the day.”
    


            He also made some jokes about CBS saying the show was ending for “purely financial” reasons. Through humor, he raised an eyebrow at news reports about the show becoming unprofitable, though he didn't directly dispute that.
    


            “Folks, I'm going to go ahead and say it: Cancel culture has gone too far,” he quipped.
    


            After the “Coldplay cam” spoof, which was led by Lin-Manuel Miranda and “Weird Al” Yankovic, Colbert pretended that CBS had just cancelled the song because it lost money.
    


            The cameos were a testament to Colbert's long-lasting relationships in the TV industry. Fallon and his NBC colleague Seth Meyers were seated together. Bravo late-night host Andy Cohen sat with his best friend, CNN's Anderson Cooper. Actors Adam Sandler and Christopher McDonald were there with Robert Smigel and his Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.
    


             Beyond the partisan arguments about whether anti-Trump comics are funny is a broader fear about institutions caving to Trump and removing room for dissent.
    


            There is a long history of American TV networks giving comics space to poke politicians and even network executives in the eye, despite the potential ramifications. Fans feel that tradition is under threat now.
    


            Outside the “Late Show” studio, the Ed Sullivan Theater, on Monday, pro-Colbert and anti-Trump protesters held up signs criticizing CBS for cancelling the show. One sign read, “Silencing comedians is no joke.” Another read, “Colbert forever.”
    


            Stewart spoke out about it from his own television perch, “The Daily Show,” on Monday night. Both shows are owned by the same company, Paramount Global, which has been in a perilous political position in recent months. Colbert catapulted to fame on Stewart's show twenty years ago; the two men have remained friends ever since; and Stewart is now an executive producer of Colbert's “Late Show,” so he has some visibility into the situation.
    


            “If you're trying to figure out why Stephen's show is ending, I don't think the answer can be found in some smoking gun email or phone call from Trump to CBS executives, or in CBS's QuickBooks spreadsheets on the financial health of late night,” Stewart said on-air.
    


            “I think the answer in the fear and pre-compliance that is gripping all of America's institutions at this very moment — institutions that have chosen not to fight the vengeful and vindictive actions of our pubic hair-doodling commander in chief,” he said.
    


            Stewart, whose “Daily Show” contract expires at the end of this year, added, “This is not the moment to give in. I'm not giving in! I'm not going anywhere — I think.”
    


            Stewart also had a profane message for Paramount and other media companies: “If you believe, as corporations or as networks, you can make yourselves so innocuous, that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king's radar, why will anyone watch you, and you are f***ing wrong.”
    


            “The Late Show” has been a cornerstone of the CBS programming schedule for decades, so fans and industry followers were shocked when the network announced its cancellation last Thursday.
    


            Top executives at CBS said it was an “agonizing” decision but one that was unrelated to “other matters happening at Paramount.” In other words, the merger.
    


            Paramount has been attempting to merge with Skydance Media, which means billions of dollars and some big egos are on the line. However, the deal requires approval from the Trump administration, and the review process has been taking longer than usual, which has raised concerns about political interference.
    


            Earlier this month, while Colbert and “The Late Show” were on a mid-summer break, Paramount settled Trump's legally dubious lawsuit against CBS News by agreeing to pay $16 million toward his future presidential library.
    


            The settlement was widely criticized, and Colbert joined the chorus when he returned from vacation last week, likening the payoff to a “big fat bribe.”
    


            Two days after that telecast, Colbert was informed that CBS was retiring “The Late Show” franchise. The move will take effect next May, when Colbert's contract expires and the broadcast TV season ends.
    


            Colbert referred to the settlement again on Monday night's show. He cited the media leaks indicating that the “Late Show” was losing “between $40 million and $50 million a year.”
    


            “Forty million's a big number,” Colbert said. “I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million… oh, yeah.”
    


            Meantime, the founding host of “The Late Show,” David Letterman, weighed in on the franchise's retirement on Monday by publishing to his YouTube channel a 20-minute highlight reel of his past jokes about CBS. The video caption read: “You can't spell CBS without BS.”

Hunter Biden, son of former US President Joe Biden, has said he would threaten El Salvador with military action to force the return of foreign nationals deported there during Donald Trump's presidency.

Speaking in an interview published on Monday with YouTuber Andrew Callaghan, Biden criticized Trump-era immigration policies and urged Democrats to adopt a more aggressive approach, even in the face of anti-immigrant sentiment among American voters.

”[If I were president] I would pick up the phone and call the f*cking president of El Salvador and say, ‘You either f*cking send them back or I'm going to f*cking invade.' It's a f*cking crime what they're doing,” Hunter Biden said.

He referred to both Trump and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele as “dictator thugs,” and described the high-security prison in Tecoluca – a centerpiece of El Salvador's anti-gang crackdown – as a “concentration camp” where “if you're not dead, you would want to be dead.”

The Trump administration's hardline immigration policies, which include mass deportations of suspected gang members, have sparked controversy and led to multiple protests against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Critics say many deportees were denied due process, while Trump supporters maintain the measures were necessary to protect the public.

Over the course of a three-hour interview, Biden praised his father's legacy while condemning Democratic officials who suggested the party should soften its immigration stance following Trump's return to the White House in 2024.

”All these Democrats say, you have to talk about and realize that people are really upset about illegal immigration? F*ck you!” he said, emphasizing the economic contributions of undocumented workers, particularly in low-wage sectors.

Advocacy groups have long noted that fear of retaliation or deportation prevents many undocumented laborers from challenging exploitation and contributes to suppressed wages across the US economy.

Hungary has announced progress on a new pipeline with Serbia to transport Russian oil. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said the project is “moving forward” and vowed to defy Brussels' efforts to cut Budapest off from Russian energy.

The 300km-long pipeline, which will have an expected annual capacity of 4-5 million tons, will enable Serbia to receive Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline and position Hungary as a transit hub.

Szijjarto made the announcement on Monday after meeting with Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin and Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy Dubravka Dedovic-Handanovic. Szijjarto said all sides support the project, which could be operational by 2027, and have reviewed investment and construction details.

“We're moving forward with Serbian and Russian partners to build a new oil pipeline between Hungary and Serbia,” Szijjarto wrote on X.

We're moving forward with Serbian and Russian partners to build a new oil pipeline between Hungary and Serbia. While Brussels is banning Russian energy, cutting links and blocking routes, we need more sources, more routes. Hungary won't fall victim to these disastrous decisions.

Speaking to reporters, he accused Brussels of seeking “to cut us off from Russian oil and gas, forcing Hungarian families to pay two to four times more.”

“We won't allow that. We are building new sources, not shutting them down.”

Szijjarto did not disclose Moscow's exact role in the project, but Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum last month that the country was ready to both aid in construction and supply oil to the planned pipeline.

Russian oil supplies to the EU have plunged due to Ukraine-related sanctions, including a 2023 embargo on seaborne crude and a price cap on Russian oil. Brussels now aims to eliminate Russian energy imports entirely by 2028 under its RePowerEU plan.

Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian energy, opposes the plan and recently blocked new sanctions targeting Moscow's energy but lifted its veto in July after securing national exemptions. The 18th sanctions package includes a dynamic price cap on Russian oil and curbs on imports of oil products made from Russian crude in third countries.

Moscow has condemned the Western sanctions as illegal and self-defeating, especially those targeting energy, citing price spikes in the EU and warning the bloc will eventually have to turn to costlier alternatives or indirect Russian imports through intermediaries.

Germany has agreed to provide Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine “as quickly as possible,” officials confirmed on Monday. The plan was reportedly agreed with the US, after President Donald Trump said Washington would continue supplying weapons to Ukraine as long as European NATO countries pay for them.

While some members of the US-led military bloc have agreed to procure weapons for Kiev, others, including Italy, Hungary, and France, have opted out, citing limited resources and domestic security needs.

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has confirmed that Berlin will deliver five Patriot systems from its own inventory, despite previous statements that the remaining stocks were too low to support additional transfers. He said the US has agreed to supply Germany with replacement systems originally ordered by Switzerland, though delivery is not expected until 2027-2028.

“We will coordinate closely in the coming days to determine how best to achieve this,” Pistorius said following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. He added that Germany will also provide air defense ammunition and fund Ukrainian-made long-range drones.

Berlin has already sent three of its 12 Patriot batteries to Ukraine. Two more are currently stationed in Poland, and others are used for NATO operations and training. Germany currently only has six, according to Pistorius.

Officials have not said when Ukraine will receive the new batch.

Germany's commitment to increase military aid to Ukraine has been met with backlash. Opposition figures have slammed the government for spending billions on Kiev while domestic needs remain unmet.

While Patriot systems have been one of Kiev's top demands from the West, the Wall Street Journal reported last week that the systems have struggled to intercept Russian ballistic missiles. On Monday, the Russian Defense Ministry reported that it destroyed three Patriot launchers in Ukraine. 

Moscow has criticized Western military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it only prolongs the conflict without altering the eventual outcome.

ROME, July 22. /TASS/. The cancellation of a concert by Valery Gergiev, People's Artist of Russia, in Italy's Caserta harms diplomacy and only intensifies existing tensions, Danilo Della Valle, member of the European Parliament from Italy's opposition party, Movimento 5 Stelle (Five Star Movement), stated.

In a video address on his Facebook page (banned in Russia due to its ownership by Meta, which has been designated as extremist), Della Valle noted that those who supported the cancellation, including members of the ruling Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) party and the opposition Democratic Party, were ""celebrating as if they had ended the conflict between Russia and Ukraine."" The parliamentarian's video featured the Dance of the Knights score by Sergey Prokofiev from the Romeo and Juliet ballet in the background.

""Politics is a far more complex process, and decisions like this only exacerbate the situation from a political and diplomatic standpoint. For the city of Caserta, this also represents a missed opportunity,"" Della Valle emphasized.

Earlier, the administration of the Royal Palace of Caserta announced the cancellation of Gergiev's performance on July 27 as part of the Un'Estate da Re (Summer of the King) festival with the Orchestra of the Teatro Verdi di Salerno, featuring soloists from the Mariinsky Theatre. The program included works by Giuseppe Verdi, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Maurice Ravel.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

TUNIS, July 22. /TASS/. The tense situation in the Syrian province of Suwayda threatens to plunge the country into a deeper crisis, the Democratic Syria Council, linked to the Kurdish autonomous administration in the country's northeast, said.

The Democratic Syria Council claims that what's happening in Suwayda is ""a sign of the collapse of the country's political and institutional system,"" as well as of ""the central government's inability to perform its duty to manage a variety of ethnic groups and ensure civil order."" The council warned about ""the risk of [the country] sliding into domestic conflicts of religious, regional or civic nature,"" which could have ""devastating consequences.""

The council called for convening ""a comprehensive nationwide conference"" to chart a new political course for the country ""based on transitional justice and a decentralized, pluralistic system."" The body also demanded an end to all ""forms of incitement to hatred and acts of provocation in the media and politics,"" which pose a direct threat to civil peace.

On July 13, clashes between Arab tribal militias and Druze self-defense units broke out in the Suwayda province. On July 15, the Syrian army entered the region's eponymous capital and launched a mop-up operation in order to restore stability. A while later, Israel began conducting strikes on the Syrian army's military convoys, citing a desire to protect the Druze population; on July 16, Israel attacked several strategic facilities in Damascus.

On July 19, Syrian's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa declared a ceasefire in Suwayda based on a settlement plan developed together with international mediators, including the US.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

The federal employee works for the US Patent and Trademark Office, and was visiting China in a personal capacity, according to the state department. “We are tracking this case very closely and are engaged with Chinese officials to resolve the situation as quickly as possible,” a spokesperson said.

Chinese authorities confirmed that another American, Wells Fargo banker, Chenyue Mao, had also been blocked from leaving. Both individuals have been subjected to an “exit ban”.

Exit bans are a controversial mechanism used by the Chinese government to bar both Chinese citizens and foreigners from leaving, for reasons ranging from criminal investigations to unsettled civil disputes, but is also used as a leverage tool in diplomatic disputes.

The exact reasons for the federal employee's exit ban are unclear, but the Washington Post had previously reported that the worker, whose identity has not been released, was stopped from leaving the country after he failed to disclose his government employment on the visa application. He reportedly had also served in the US Army.

It has been reported as the first time a US government employee has been affected.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, said he had “no details to share” about the case when asked at a regular press briefing on Monday. However, Guo did confirm the exit ban on Mao, saying she was involved in a criminal case and obliged to cooperate with an investigation.

“Chenyue Mao is involved in a criminal case currently being handled by Chinese law-enforcement authorities and is subject to exit restrictions in accordance with the law,” Guo said.

Wells Fargo has since banned all employees from travelling to China since Mao – a naturalised US citizen of Chinese descent – was stopped from leaving.

A 2023 report by Safeguard Defenders said that since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, “China has expanded the legal landscape for exit bans and increasingly used them, sometimes outside legal justification”.

Exit bans have been used against activists and journalists – including foreign correspondents – and family members of the people actually of interest to the Chinese government. In 2019 two American siblings were allowed to return home after three years trapped in China. Cynthia and Victor Liu were subject to an exit ban, despite not facing any criminal allegations. Their father, a former bank official and fugitive Liu Changming, was wanted in China to face fraud charges.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

As Harvard's feud with Trump escalated, so did tensions over an ‘education and Palestine' issue of a prestigious journal. Scholars blame the ‘Palestine exception' to academic freedom

In March 2024, six months into Israel's war in Gaza, education in the territory was decimated. Schools were closed – most had been turned into shelters – and all 12 of the strip's universities were partially or fully destroyed.

Against that backdrop, a prestigious American education journal decided to dedicate a special issue to “education and Palestine”. The Harvard Educational Review (HER) put out a call for submissions, asking academics around the world for ideas for articles grappling with the education of Palestinians, education about Palestine and Palestinians, and related debates in schools and colleges in the US.

“The field of education has an important role to play in supporting students, educators, and policymakers in contextualizing what has been happening in Gaza with histories and continuing impacts of occupation, genocide, and political contestations,” the journal's editors wrote in their call for abstracts.

A little more than a year later, the scale of destruction in Gaza was exponentially larger. The special issue, which was slated to be published this summer, was just about ready – contracts with most authors were finalized and articles were edited. They covered topics from the annihilation of Gaza's schools to the challenges of teaching about Israel and Palestine in the US.

But on 9 June, the Harvard Education Publishing Group, the journal's publisher, abruptly canceled the release. In an email to the issue's contributors, the publisher cited “a number of complex issues”, shocking authors and editors alike, the Guardian has learned.

US universities have come under intensifying attacks from the Trump administration over accusations of tolerating antisemitism on campuses. Many have responded by restricting protest, punishing students and faculty outspoken about Palestinian rights, and scrutinizing academic programs home to scholarship about Palestine.

But the cancellation of an entire issue of an academic journal, which has not been previously reported, is a remarkable new development in a mounting list of examples of censorship of pro-Palestinian speech.

The Guardian spoke with four scholars who had written for the issue, and one of the journal's editors. It also reviewed internal emails that capture how enthusiasm about a special issue intended to promote “scholarly conversation on education and Palestine amid repression, occupation, and genocide” was derailed by fears of legal liability and devolved into recriminations about censorship, integrity and what many scholars have come to refer to as the “Palestine exception” to academic freedom.

Paul Belsito, a spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote in a statement to the Guardian that the decision to cancel the special issue followed nine months of conversations and an “overall lack of internal alignment” about the issue.

The authors see it differently. “If the universities – or in this case a university press – are not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don't know what they're doing. What's the point?” said Thea Abu El-Haj, a Palestinian-American anthropologist of education at Barnard College, the women's school affiliated with Columbia University, who was one of the solicited authors.

Harvard has been embroiled in a bitter battle with the Trump administration over millions in federal funding cuts and the revocation of its eligibility to host international students. In April, it became the first and so far only university to sue the administration, earning praise for its resistance to Trump's onslaught.

But Harvard has also cracked down on Palestine scholarship, demotings scholars and canceling related programs. “Harvard is being held up as the heroic institution, but what's happening internally is much more complicated,” said Abu El-Haj.

In January, as part of a legal settlement with Jewish students who had accused Harvard of tolerating and promoting antisemitism on campus, the university adopted a controversial definition that critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel.

In an email to the authors announcing the cancellation, the executive director of the publishing group did not cite antisemitism; she wrote the decision stemmed from what she described as an inadequate review process and the need for “considerable copy editing”.

The journal's editorial board rejected that characterization and said they had been sidelined by the publisher in making the decision. The decision to cancel the issue was “out of alignment with the values that have guided HER for nearly a century”, the board members wrote in a collective statement.

The announcement came after the publishers had demanded that the articles be submitted to a legal review late into the process – a step the authors found highly unusual and called a “dangerous form of institutional censorship” in a joint letter objecting to the demand. The publisher's request was prompted by fear the issue would attract antisemitism claims, said one editor.

The dispute underscores the unprecedented restraints placed on knowledge production amid escalating accusations of antisemitism on campuses and the Trump administration's crusade against higher education. But it also signals the levels to which universities are abandoning their stated commitments out of fears of legal or financial repercussions.

“Even within the broader landscape around Palestine in the university, it's unprecedented,” said Chandni Desai, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of one of the scrapped articles. “You just don't solicit work, peer-review it, have people sign contracts, advertise the articles, and then cancel not just one article, but an entire special issue.”

The Harvard Educational Review is a century-old academic journal that publishes research and opinion geared to education academics and professionals and is considered a leading publication in the field. It is published by the Harvard Education Publishing Group, a division of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and edited by doctoral students at the university.

The Palestine issue was slated to include a dozen research articles, essays and other writings on topics ranging from education in Israel-Palestine and among the Palestinian diaspora, to academic freedom in the US. They explored the evolution of the concept of “scholasticide”, a term describing the systematic annihilation of education first coined during Israel's 2008 invasion of Gaza; the “ethical and educational responsibilities” of English language teachers in the West Bank; and the impact of “crackdowns on dissent” on teaching about Palestine in US higher education institutions, according to finalized abstracts of the articles shared with the Guardian.

Abu El-Haj's piece, co-authored with two other scholars, explored the “centrality of education in the struggle for Palestinian liberation”, drawing from an oral history project on the experiences of teachers with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The journal's editors were so enthusiastic about her piece that last spring they selected it with two others to promote the upcoming special issue on the back cover of the spring one.

The special issue was also formally announced at an annual gathering of education scholars in Chicago in March. “There was quite a lot of interest in it,” said Jo Kelcey, a professor at the Lebanese American University in Beirut and one of Abu El-Haj's co-authors.

The authors received the first inkling of trouble shortly after that.

Rabea Eghbariah, a Palestinian doctoral candidate at Harvard Law School, had been solicited to write the afterword for the special issue. In 2023, a different Harvard journal, the Harvard Law Review, had blocked publication of an article it had commissioned from him. When the Columbia Law Review published the piece instead, that journal's board responded by temporarily shutting down its entire website. Wary of that experience, Eghbariah specifically requested to amend his contract with the Harvard Educational Review to add a clause seeking to safeguard his academic freedom. After a long silence, the journal declined his request in April.

“It is incredibly shameful to see a university publication so explicitly betraying its mission and rejecting a clause on protecting academic freedom,” said Eghbariah, who did not sign the contract. “My afterword specifically is about Nakba denialism – the phenomenon of manipulating facts to affirm Zionism and shape knowledge with regards to Palestine – and it is quite ironic that it is being denied publication.”

Days after their response to Eghbariah, the journal's editorial board wrote to the authors, citing an “increasingly challenging climate” and asking for their availability for a meeting, which never ended up happening. “As a part of a scholarly community deeply committed to uplifting Palestinian voices and scholarship, we are facing some increasingly unprecedented contexts,” they wrote.

The email offered little detail, but for weeks, the journal's editors had been under mounting pressure from the publisher. In January, they were told that an “institutional review” of the manuscripts would be required. In February, the publisher tried – without the editors' knowledge – to alter the back cover of the spring issue promoting some of the forthcoming articles, according to email correspondence reviewed by the Guardian. (The printing company flagged the change to the editors, who reversed it.) In conversations with the editors – although not in writing – the publisher acknowledged that it was seeking a “risk assessment” legal review by Harvard's counsel out of fear the issue's publication would prompt antisemitism claims, an editor said.

As tensions came to a head, the board again contacted the authors in early May, to inform them of the requested legal review.

It was an extraordinary demand, the authors and editor interviewed by the Guardian said. Legal reviews would sometimes be requested for a specific article when there is a libel concern – but early in the process, and not for an entire issue, they noted.

“This doesn't happen, certainly not at the point where you've been accepted for publication and you've signed contracts,” said Kelcey. “This is not the way scholarship is supposed to operate.”

By then, the Trump administration had upended higher education by threatening billions of dollars in funding from universities in the US over their responses to pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard had sued in April, escalating its feud with the president. The authors, who hadn't initially been in touch, found each other and organised a collective response, slamming the request for a legal review at that stage as “unprecedented”, they wrote in a 15 May letter to the journal's editorial board and publisher. “This sends a dangerous message to scholars globally: that academic publishing contracts are conditional, revocable, and subject to external political calculations.”

The authors asked for the legal review to be reconsidered. But less than a month later, the press's executive director, Jessica Fiorillo, wrote to them that the issue was being pulled altogether. In an email seen by the Guardian, she claimed the manuscripts were “unready for publication”, in part due to a copy editor's resignation. She also cited an unspecified “failure to adhere to an adequate review process”, a “lack of internal alignment” between the authors, editors and the publisher, and “the lack of a clear and expedient path forward to resolving the myriad issues at play”.

“This difficult situation is exacerbated by very significant lack of agreement about the path forward, including and especially whether to publish such a special issue at this time,” she wrote.

The copy-editing issue wasn't just a personnel one. The publisher's letter claimed that the review editors “provided highly restrictive editing guidelines to the copy editor under contract to work on the special issue, limiting her focus to grammar, punctuation, and syntax errors, and directing her to refrain from offering any editorial suggestions to address, in the editors' words, ‘politically charged' content”. It claimed that the copy editor resigned in large part because of those restrictions.

Fiorillo added that it would be “entirely appropriate” to subject the work to legal checks for “any libelous or unlawful material” but that no such review had taken place. She added that the cancellation was not “due to censorship of a particular viewpoint nor does it connect to matters of academic freedom”.

The journal's editors were blindsided. “The Editorial Board has not been made privy to any internal decision-making at HEPG regarding the Special Issue, and we only learned about this communication and decision 30 minutes before it was sent out,” they wrote to the authors shortly after Fiorillo's email.

In a longer letter to the authors, two days later, they rebutted Fiorillo's claims about irregularities in the review process and expressed disappointment with the decision to cancel the issue.

“It is a deep loss that your work will not appear in the pages of [Harvard Educational Review] as we intended – for HER, for the field of education, and for social justice,” they wrote.

Regarding the publisher's claim regarding overly restrictive copy-editing guidelines, the editors said that they were asked by the publisher to develop copy-editing guidelines – something that hadn't been required for previous issues – and that they invited feedback at multiple points in the process.

It is not clear how far up within Harvard's administration the decision to cancel the issue had come from. Belsito, the spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote that Harvard's office of the general counsel does not “make or direct editorial decisions” for the school or its publishing group.

“HEPG acknowledges the disappointment this decision may have caused for the authors and remains deeply committed to our robust editorial process, only publishing work of the highest scholarly quality through a process rooted in integrity, collaboration, and editorial rigor,” he added.

The Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors which got involved after learning about the cancellation, believes the decision came from the publisher.

“To us, it sounded like a textbook example of the killing of speech and academic inquiry related to Palestine,” said Kirsten Weld, a history professor and the chapter's president. “Thus far, though our fact-finding remains incomplete, it looks like the impetus came from Harvard Education Publishing Group.”

One of the editors of the Harvard Educational Review, who asked for anonymity citing the repressive climate in academia, said that the pressure from the publisher on the editors ramped up shortly before Trump took office. The request to subject the entirety of the edited manuscripts to a risk assessment was “totally abnormal” the editor said. “I didn't even know the [office of the general counsel] review was an option, I had never heard of it.”

The censorship of the issue, the editor added, is “exactly how authoritarianism grows”.

The members of the editorial board who worked on the issue said that they had done their best to “advance this work amidst a climate of repression and institutional accommodation”.

“As we reflect on this moment, we urge the scholarly community to defend the ability to publish rigorous, justice-oriented scholarship without interference and repression,” they added.

The ordeal was a “test case” for academic freedom, said Desai, whose article on scholasticide, co-written with three Palestinian colleagues, was also directly solicited and advertised on the back of the spring journal issue. (It was the teaser to their article that the publishers tried to remove from the back of the previous issue, without the editors' knowledge.)

Desai criticized the cancellation as a “serious breach and violation of academic freedom and integrity” but also an affront to the labor of scholars who are “writing these articles during a genocide”.

She and her co-authors, including a dean at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, were not merely documenting the resilience of Palestinian education amid the destruction but were personally involved in those efforts, she noted. Many of their colleagues and students were killed as the group worked on the article. “This is not some abstract academic exercise,” said Desai. “I can't keep stressing the urgency of this article as we're watching universities being blown up.”

The authors are in talks with other journals and hope their pieces can be published together as planned. All those interviewed by the Guardian expressed fear that the incident would deter other scholars from pursuing work on Palestine – a longstanding problem that they say has only been exacerbated over the last two years. “There's this risk of kind of closing down the democratic space,” said Kelcey.

As Israel and Palestine have become the flashpoint for a rapidly deteriorating climate for free speech and academic freedom in the US, Harvard has already demoted two faculty members leading the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (one of whom wrote the forward for the cancelled issue), suspended a partnership with Birzeit University in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and ended a divinity school initiative dedicated to the conflict.

Scholars fear that the the capitulation of universities is hurting an entire field of study at the time when it's most needed. But Abu El-Haj warned that the special issue's cancellation also set a dangerous precedent for the independence of scholarship on a variety of subjects. She accused the publisher of “anticipatory compliance” and warned that “it's not going to stop with Palestine,” she said.

But she also sounded a note of optimism. In a sign of the growing chasm between decision-makers and the broader public on the issue, she said that the war in Gaza had led to unprecedented interest among students in Palestine coursework and scholarship.

She recalled being a student in the US during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Israeli-backed Lebanese militias. “There were three of us protesting,” she recalled. “I never would have imagined in my life I'd see the encampments that happened last year.

“We're in a really critical juncture,” she added. “The level of repression that we're seeing is related to the shift in the narrative, and the loss of control over that narrative.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

UN secretary general warns ‘last lifelines' may soon collapse after Israeli forces attack WHO facilities in Deir al-Balah

Israel is facing intensifying international condemnation for its killing of starving Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and its attacks on humanitarian efforts, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the “last lifelines keeping people alive [in the strip] are collapsing”.

An angry chorus of senior figures, among them the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and a senior Catholic cleric, expressed on Tuesday a growing sense of global horror over Israel's actions.

“I spoke again with [the Israeli foreign minister] Gideon Saar to recall our understanding on aid flow and made clear that IDF [Israel Defense Forces] must stop killing people at distribution points,” the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on X. “The killing of civilians seeking aid in Gaza is indefensible.”

She said “all options were on the table” if Israel does not deliver on aid pledges, but did not say what those options included.

According to UN officials on Tuesday, more than 1,000 desperate Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of May trying to reach food distributions run by the controversial US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) amid widening conditions of starvation in the Palestinian territory.

The comments came as Israeli forces attacked warehousing and staff accommodation in Deir al-Balah – Gaza's main aid hub – belonging to the World Health Organization.

The Israeli strikes on WHO facilities came as Israel cancelled the work visa of Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) inside Gaza and the most senior UN aid official in the coastal strip.

Speaking to the UN security council on Tuesday, Guterres described the situation in Gaza as a “horror show” condemning the Israeli attacks on UN offices.

“Malnourishment is soaring and starvation is knocking on every door in Gaza,”Guterres said. “And now we are seeing the last gasp of a humanitarian system built on humanitarian principles. That system is being denied the conditions to function. Denied the space to deliver. Denied the safety to save lives.”

Guterres' comments came hours after a hard-hitting joint statement on Monday by 27 western countries including the UK, France, Australia and Canada harshly criticising Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid and calling for an immediate end to the war.

Guterres said he “deplored the growing reports of children and adults suffering from malnutrition” as health officials in Gaza reported a further 33 deaths, including 12 children, in the past 48 hours.

Lammy amplified that message in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, describing himself as “appalled [and] sickened” by what was happening in Gaza.

“These are not words that are usually used by a foreign secretary who is attempting to be diplomatic,” Lammy said.

“But when you see innocent children holding out their hand for food, and you see them shot and killed in the way that we have seen in the last few days, of course Britain must call it out.”

Thameen Al-Kheetan, a UN human rights office spokesperson, said: “Over 1,000 Palestinians have now been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food in Gaza since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operating.

“As of 21 July, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near UN and other humanitarian organisations' aid convoys.”

The head of the UN's main agency for Palestinians, Unrwa, on Tuesday described Gaza as a “hell on earth”.

Philippe Lazzarini said Unrwa's own staff, as well as doctors and humanitarian workers, were fainting on duty owing to hunger and exhaustion as Israel limited access to life-saving humanitarian aid, and that many were surviving on a single small meal a day.

“Caretakers, including Unrwa colleagues in Gaza, are also in need of care now – doctors, nurses, journalists, humanitarians, among them Unrwa staff, are hungry. Many are now fainting due to hunger and exhaustion while performing their duties,” he said in a statement at a media briefing in Geneva.

The UN World Food Programme on Monday said its assessments showed a quarter of the population of Gaza was facing “famine-like” conditions and almost 100,000 women and children were suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

The most recent assessment of hunger in Gaza by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a group that includes the World Food Programme and the WHO, said about 10% of the territory's population – 244,000 people – were facing catastrophic levels of hunger and 93% were experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity.

Separately, the Roman Catholic church's most senior cleric in the Holy Land said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “morally unacceptable”, after visiting the wartorn Palestinian territory.

“We have seen men holding out in the sun for hours in the hope of a simple meal,” Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, told a news conference. “It's morally unacceptable and unjustified.”

Despite the high-profile criticism in recent days, aid agencies have criticised the lack of meaningful action by the governments who signed the joint statement, including the UK, against Israel.

Kristyan Benedict, of Amnesty International UK, said the British government's “failure to take robust measures to prevent genocide is no accident”, adding that “as a state party to the genocide convention, the UK has a legal duty to prevent and punish genocide – a duty it is failing miserably to uphold”.

The growing international furore came as Israeli troops pushed into the city of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where a number of international aid organisations are based, in what appeared to be the latest effort to carve up the Palestinian territory with military corridors.

Deir al-Balah is the only city in the Gaza Strip that has not experienced major ground operations or suffered widespread devastation in 21 months of war, leading to speculation that the Hamas militant group holds large numbers of hostages there.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Reuters

11:42 JST, July 22, 2025

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, July 21 (Reuters) – China's Premier Li Qiang announced construction had begun on what will be the world's largest hydropower dam, on the eastern rim of the Tibetan Plateau, at an estimated cost of at least $170 billion, the official Xinhua news agency said.

Commencement of the hydropower project, China's most ambitious since the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, was seized by Chinese markets as proof of economic stimulus, sending stock prices and bond yields higher on Monday.

Made up of five cascade hydropower stations with the capacity to produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by Britain last year, the dam will be located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo. A section of the river tumbles 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) in a span of 50km (31 miles), offering huge hydropower potential.

India and Bangladesh have already raised concerns about its possible impact on the millions of people downstream, while NGOs warned of the risk to one of the richest and most diverse environments on the plateau.

Beijing has said the dam will help meet power demand in Tibet and the rest of China without having a major effect on downstream water supplies or the environment. Operations are expected sometime in the 2030s.

China's CSI Construction & Engineering Index .CSI399995 jumped as much as 4% to a seven-month high. Power Construction Corporation of China 601669.SS and Arcplus Group PLC 600629.SS surged by their 10% daily limit.

“From an investment perspective, mature hydropower projects offer bond-like dividends,” Wang Zhuo, partner of Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management said, while cautioning that speculative buying into related stocks would inflate valuations.

The project will drive demand for construction and building materials such as cement and civil explosives, Huatai Securities said in a note to clients.

Shares of Beijing-listed Hunan Wuxin Tunnel Intelligent Equipment Co 835174.BJE, which sells tunnel construction equipment, surged 30%. So did shares of Geokang Technologies Co Ltd 830879.BJE, which makes intelligent monitoring terminals.

Cement maker Xizang Tianlu Co Ltd 600326.SS and Tibet GaoZheng Explosive Co 002827.SZ, producer of civil explosive materials, both jumped their maximum 10%.

The Chinese premier described the dam as a “project of the century” and said special emphasis “must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Xinhua said on Saturday.

Government bond yields rose across the board on Monday, with the most-traded 30-year treasury futures CTLU5 falling to five-week lows, as investors interpreted the news as part of China's economic stimulus.

The project, overseen by the newly formed state-owned China Yajiang Group, marks a major boost in public investment to help bolster economic growth as current drivers show signs of faltering.

“Assuming 10 years of construction, the investment/GDP boost could reach 120 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) for a single year,” said Citi in a note. “The actual economic benefits could go beyond that.”

China has not given an estimate on the number of jobs the project could create.

The Three Gorges, which took almost two decades to complete, generated nearly a million jobs, state media reported, though it displaced at least a similar number of people.

Authorities have not indicated how many people would be displaced by the Yarlung Zangbo project.

The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra River as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India and finally into Bangladesh. NGOs say the dam will irreversibly harm the Tibetan Plateau and hit millions of people downstream.

The chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, said earlier this year that such a colossal dam barely 50km from the border could dry out 80% of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas in Arunachal and neighboring Assam state.

Some experts also express concerns for a project in a seismically active zone.

Irina Podnosova, the chair of the Russian Supreme Court, has died in Moscow at the age of 71 after a serious illness, Russian state news agency TASS reported on July 22, citing sources close to her.

The judge battled the illness for over a year, Russian pro-state news agency RBK reported. TASS said she died of cancer.

Podnosova had headed Russia's chief judiciary body since April 17, 2024, when she was appointed as the only candidate, being nominated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

She took the post after the death of Vyacheslav Lebedev, who had served as the Supreme Court's chair since 1991.

Podnosova graduated from the law faculty of Leningrad State University in 1975, the same year as Putin. She has worked at the Supreme Court since 2020, becoming a deputy chair focusing on economic disputes and arbitration cases.

The Russian newspaper Kommersant wrote at the time that Podnosova had no experience with arbitration but was considered an influential person within Russia's judicial structures. The outlet's sources said that ""everyone understands who is behind her.""

The Supreme Court is Russia's court of final appeal. Its 115 members are nominated by the Russian president and appointed by the Federation Council, the upper chamber of the country's parliament. 

Human rights experts say that Russia's judicial system is tightly controlled by the government, often used to repress political opponents.

Senior News Editor

Martin Fornusek is a news editor at the Kyiv Independent. He has previously worked as a news content editor at the media company Newsmatics and is a contributor to Euromaidan Press. He was also volunteering as an editor and translator at the Czech-language version of Ukraïner. Martin studied at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia, holding a bachelor's degree in security studies and history and a master's degree in conflict and democracy studies.

The legislation grants the prosecutor general new powers over investigations led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and cases led by the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.

The announcement comes as pro-Western President Maia Sandu, who narrowly secured reelection last year, seeks to preserve her parliamentary majority and advance Moldova's bid for EU accession.



The breach reportedly prompted an urgent response from Ukrainian units to prevent the situation ""from spiraling into disaster.""

Russian schoolchildren are recruited into drone development and other military programs through seemingly harmless video games, state-run competitions, and promises of academic and career advancement.

An SBU officer is suspected of demanding a $300,000 bribe from a person under investigation for allegedly organizing illegal border crossings for military-age men during wartime, NABU said.

Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council has imposed a moratorium on business inspections by state authorities, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 21, calling the move essential for the country's economic security.

The delegation will be led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov and include representatives from Ukraine's military intelligence, the Foreign Ministry, and the Presidential Office.

The target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russian forces launched 42 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones overnight, primarily from Russia and occupied Crimea, Ukraine's Air Force said. At least 26 drones were shot down, and seven more were lost or suppressed by electronic warfare systems, according to the statement.

Russian troops have entered the front-line city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState and soldiers on the ground said on July 22.

Pokrovsk, situated around 67 kilometers (41 miles) northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk, has emerged as one of the fiercest hotspots in the Kremlin's ongoing offensive in eastern Ukraine.

Speaking to the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity, a member of a Ukrainian drone team working out of Pokrovsk reported that Russian soldiers had made it into the city limits, though it wasn't clear if they had managed to dig in.

According to DeepState, Russian forces managed to penetrate the city from the direction of Zvirove a few days earlier after exploiting weakened Ukrainian infantry positions and inaccurate situational reporting.

The breach reportedly prompted an urgent response from Ukrainian units to prevent the situation ""from spiraling into disaster.""

""Russian units attempted to entrench themselves and gain control over Defenders of Ukraine street,"" DeepState said. ""Some of them have been killed, others are still being hunted. The search and destruction of these groups is still ongoing.""

The group noted that Ukrainian forces suffered casualties in the ongoing cleanup operation, with incidents of friendly fire reported due to a lack of clear intelligence on the Russian troops' movements and locations. 

DeepState warned that reports on such infiltration attempts should be approached with caution and confirmed data.

Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on July 18 that Ukrainian troops were ""steadfastly"" defending Pokrovsk from repeated Russian infantry assaults. In June, Syrskyi described it as ""the hottest spot along the entire 1,200-kilometer front line.""

According to Syrskyi, Russian troops continue to rely on small infantry groups to probe Ukraine's defenses but has so far failed to gain control of the city. 

He warned that Russian troops are attempting to sever logistics routes from the northern city of Dobropillia and noted that Russian forces had massed over 110,000 troops in the area by early summer.

Pokrovsk remains a strategic target for Russia as it seeks to advance further into Donetsk Oblast and potentially threaten neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

The Kyiv Independent reached out to Ukraine's military for additional comment.

Ukraine carried out a wave of overnight drone attacks across Russia on July 22, Moscow said, while a Ukrainian official said that one of the targets was a key military-linked facility.

In Russia's Samara Oblast, Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev said several drones were destroyed while attempting to strike an industrial facility. 

Fedorishchev reported no casualties or damage but confirmed that authorities temporarily restricted mobile internet in the area to allegedly assist military efforts in neutralizing the drones.

According to Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, the target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives. 

These materials are used in artillery shells, aerial bombs, cluster munitions, and rockets — critical components of Russia's military operations, he said.

""The volume of processing (of raw materials) is about 1 million tons per year,"" Kovalenko said. It remains unclear whether the facility suffered any damage.

Samara lies roughly 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the Ukraine-Russia border.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed 35 fixed-wing drones overnight in various regions, including those near Moscow, the Black Sea, and several western and southern oblasts. 

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin confirmed that a drone was downed en route to the capital, with emergency services responding at the debris site. This marks the sixth consecutive night of drone attacks on Moscow.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports.

Kyiv has repeatedly targeted Russian industrial and military facilities deep in the rear to undermine Moscow's ability to wage its all-out war.

The legislation grants the prosecutor general new powers over investigations led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and cases led by the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.

The announcement comes as pro-Western President Maia Sandu, who narrowly secured reelection last year, seeks to preserve her parliamentary majority and advance Moldova's bid for EU accession.



The breach reportedly prompted an urgent response from Ukrainian units to prevent the situation ""from spiraling into disaster.""

Russian schoolchildren are recruited into drone development and other military programs through seemingly harmless video games, state-run competitions, and promises of academic and career advancement.

An SBU officer is suspected of demanding a $300,000 bribe from a person under investigation for allegedly organizing illegal border crossings for military-age men during wartime, NABU said.

Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council has imposed a moratorium on business inspections by state authorities, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 21, calling the move essential for the country's economic security.

The delegation will be led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov and include representatives from Ukraine's military intelligence, the Foreign Ministry, and the Presidential Office.

The target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russian forces launched 42 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones overnight, primarily from Russia and occupied Crimea, Ukraine's Air Force said. At least 26 drones were shot down, and seven more were lost or suppressed by electronic warfare systems, according to the statement.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick in Washington.Leah Millis/Reuters

Any time Howard Lutnick is interviewed, you're guaranteed a whole lot of mishegas. But because he's the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and his words are tailored to express what he thinks the boss wants to hear, attention must be paid. Even to the nonsense. Especially to the nonsense.

In a Sunday morning chat with the CBS TV program Face the Nation, Mr. Lutnick said some things that are positive for trade between Canada and its largest trading partner. Unfortunately, he said even more things that suggest long-term negatives for our previously free-trading relationship.

On the plus side, he said that the 35-per-cent tariff that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on Aug. 1 would not apply to all Canadian exports, but only those outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This isn't news – immediately after Mr. Trump announced the levy earlier this month, White House spokespersons quietly briefed the media that it is not intended to apply to all Canadian goods, only those not covered by the USMCA. But it's good to hear the exemption reiterated. It suggests that it's U.S. policy, for now.

Trump's tariffs haven't raised prices yet. That might be a bad sign

Premiers' meeting expected to focus on tariffs and trade

Mr. Lutnick said that 75 per cent of goods currently move tariff-free among Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, while an analysis last month from RBC Economics puts the figure even higher, with 89 per cent of Canadian exports USMCA-complaint in April. Whatever the level, take it as a sign that the Trump administration does not want the markets or the American public to believe that it's trying to end free trade with Canada.

That's why Mr. Lutnick justified existing and possible future tariffs on Canada as an action forced upon the U.S. “Unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border,” he said, the U.S. would have no choice but to hit Canada with tariffs. 

Though in the next breath he added that, even if Canada addressed the imaginary fentanyl problem, tariffs could remain.

“The President understands that we need to open the markets,” he said. “Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the President has. It's fair trade, it's reciprocal trade. Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed?”

That is the most magnificent mille-feuille of mishegas. It's layer upon layer of flaky nonsense.

Until five minutes ago, Canada and the U.S. had very low or no tariffs on each other's exports. The Canadian market is not “closed” to American goods or services, which is why Canada is the world's largest buyer of American goods and services. Take oil and gas out of the mix, and the U.S. even runs a trade surplus with us.

The Trump administration wants higher tariffs, and it's willing to tell all sorts of tall tales to get there. It especially needs to tell tales to American voters, because they are not excited about tariffs.

Notice how Mr. Lutnick described Mr. Trump's trade policy: “It's fair trade, it's reciprocal trade.”

To quote noted Spanish trade expert Inigo Montoya, “You keep using that word” – reciprocal. “I do not think it means what you think it means.”

The Commerce Secretary celebrated two recently announced trade frameworks as examples of this reciprocity. There's an agreement with Vietnam, said to involve a 20-per-cent tariff on exports to the U.S., and an Indonesian deal, with a 19-per-cent U.S. tariff. Details are sketchy, but Washington claims that in return, American goods will get visa-free access to these countries. 

I don't know what dictionary was the preferred supplier at Trump University, but in every other lexicon, the arrangements with Indonesia and Vietnam are the opposite of reciprocal. They are – and the Trump administration is celebrating them as – asymmetrical trade, not free trade. No tariff for me; a fat tariff for thee.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said last week that the Americans are signalling that they don't want to make a deal that doesn't include tariffs, and on Sunday Mr. Lutnick underlined that. It appears to be the Trump administration one clear policy goal in all discussions with its trade partners.

Asked about the 10-per-cent baseline tariff imposed on most countries (but not Canada, at least not yet, because of the USMCA), he replied that “10 per cent is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher.”

As for the future of free-ish trade under USMCA, which he had been touting a moment earlier, Mr. Lutnick said that of course the treaty will have to be renegotiated next year. And he left no mistaking that in his view the U.S. goal in those negotiations would be less free trade and more tariffs. He said, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly said, that the President, “doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico when they can be built in Michigan or Ohio.”

If you're trying to come to an agreement with someone, and the person on the other side of the table is constantly changing their demands and the reasons for them, there are two possibilities. The first is that they don't know what they want. The second is that they know exactly what they want.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=world+news+site:dw.com","Are Donald Trump's tariffs the new sanctions?","https://www.dw.com/en/are-donald-trumps-tariffs-the-new-sanctions/a-73280374","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 04:48:28 GMT","

Donald Trump is using tariffs to pressure adversaries, a role usually played by sanctions. But does the threat of rising US inflation and retaliation make sanctions a safer choice?

US President Donald Trump's reliance on tariffs rather than sanctions has been described as both the ""world's worst bet"" and ""a powerful proven source of leverage"" to protect the national interests of the United States. 

While tariffs essentially are taxes on imports to protect domestic industries, sanctions are penalties imposed on other countries to punish or influence their governments. Sanctions typically restrict trade or finance.

Since his return to the White House in January, Trump's tariff threats against dozens of countries have created great uncertainty among US businesses and global trading partners. 

What's become known as ""tariff tango"" — bold pledges of steep duties on foreign goods, followed by abrupt reversals — suits Trump's shifting political or economic goals. Yet, financial markets remain on edge, not knowing how or when the president may deploy tariffs next.

The tariff on China, the biggest economic and military rival to the US, reached historic highs in April, soaring to 145% before being significantly cut the following month after trade talks in London.

Trump's sudden increase and later rollback of tariffs show how he uses them as a flexible way to fix what he sees as unfair trade, based on past trade disputes.

""What shapes the president's views is the rapid rise of Japan in the 1980s and the feeling that the Japanese were out-competing the iconic American car industry because the US has been too generous in its trade terms,"" Jennifer Burns, associate professor of history at Stanford University, told DW.

Tariffs are Trump's preferred weapon to tackle the massive US trade deficit, particularly with China, which amounted to $295 billion (€253 billion) in 2024, according to the US Census Bureau. They also align with his ""America First"" agenda to protect domestic industries and boost US job creation.

The White House has defended the president's approach, insisting that tariffs can be quickly deployed and, unlike sanctions, don't completely shut foreign markets to US firms.

""[Trump] can add this pressure when he wants and then bring it back when markets start to freak out or it stops serving his purpose,"" Sophia Busch, associate director of the Geoeconomic Centre at the Atlantic Council think tank, told DW. ""This is much easier with tariffs than with sanctions.""

Although tariffs have been widely criticized for their potential to stoke inflation, they do raise revenue for the US Treasury, unlike sanctions. US tariff revenues are up 110% to $97.3 billion (€83.2 billion) in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Tariffs are expected to raise $360 billion next year, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.

Tariffs give Trump direct, unilateral control, using executive orders without needing approval from the US Congress. Sanctions, on the other hand, often require complex legal frameworks and cooperation with international partners, like the European Union.

The preference for tariffs over sanctions reflects Trump's aim for rapid, visible economic leverage, but raises concerns about the destabilizing effects of such policies on global trade and peace.

""The reason [tariffs] have such a bad reputation is because they're linked to these episodes of de-globalization, and in the 20th century, they were linked to armed conflict,"" said Burns. ""If low tariffs and open markets knit countries together in a way that forestalls armed conflict, does it mean that we might be moving away from that?""

""Sanctions are more about punishing countries for violating international norms,"" Stanford's Jennifer Burns told DW. ""They're in response to specific actions, and if those actions cease, the sanctions can be undone.""

Trump's second-term policies suggest he is using tariffs to achieve objectives typically associated with sanctions, such as pressuring countries like Canada, Mexico and China on nontrade issues like immigration and drug trafficking. These tariffs have prompted retaliatory measures or threats, which have intensified global trade tensions.

Similarly, Colombia was threatened with tariffs after it rejected US deportation flights, while threatened levies on the European Union were partly announced as a response to EU privacy and climate regulations.

Earlier this month, Trump threatened to impose a 50% tariff on imports from Brazil, which were framed as retaliation for the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a close ally. The far-right politician faces trial for allegedly plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss, including plans to assassinate political rivals.

Noting how the uncertainty around Trump's tariff policy had left US firms and global trade partners reeling, Burns warned that ""years of tariff uncertainty"" may cause a ""serious economic slowdown, as businesses and investors wait for a more predictable landscape.""

Previous US administrations have preferred sanctions over tariffs as a punitive tool to bring rogue countries into line.

Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US has imposed more than 2,500 sanctions on Russia, targeting individuals, entities, shipping and aircraft. The US has also imposed sanctions on Venezuela, Iran and North Korea.

""These economies are not crucial trading partners for the US,"" the Atlantic Council's Busch said, adding that Trump's tariffs on the ""top US trading partners"" were ""more of an economic threat domestically.""

Trump has recently expressed more openness to deploying sanctions. Referring to a bill proposed by Senator Lindsey Graham for additional penalties on Russia if it fails to negotiate a peace deal in good faith with Ukraine, Trump said he was ""very strongly"" considering fresh sanctions.

If passed, the Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025 will target key Russian officials and oligarchs, financial institutions and the energy sector, aiming to curb Russia's ability to export oil and gas.

The bill, which has bipartisan support, also proposes secondary sanctions on third countries and foreign companies, which Trump has termed ""secondary tariffs"" of up to 500% on countries importing Russian energy.

Trump's similar ""secondary tariffs"" of 25% on buyers of Venezuelan oil, which took effect in March, were also designed to pressure energy importers to align with US foreign policy, a role typically reserved for sanctions.

Secondary sanctions usually include blacklisting individuals and entities, asset freezes and banking restrictions. The threat of US criminal charges and travel bans is also often used.

New hardline EU immigration policy could see development funding cut unless African nations prevent migrants from leaving. Some experts are warning it's counterproductive, undermines sovereignty, and fuels resentment. 

The European Union (EU) Commission has proposed conditioning development aid for African and other third countries on their cooperation with migration enforcement. Under the  Global Europe instrument, aid allocation may now depend on how well a country cooperates with returns, readmissions, and border controls.

Internal EU documents cited by the Financial Times and Reuters state that countries that do not comply with deportation agreements could see aid slashed. The move has led to criticism from humanitarian organizations, with Oxfam calling it a ""distortion of the EU's development goals"" and a ""short-term political fix"" to deeper structural issues.

The policy shift comes amid mounting pressure within Europe to curb irregular migration across the Mediterranean and Sahara routes. The pressure is particularly intense in countries like Germany, Italy, and Greece, where national governments face increasing domestic opposition to asylum-seekers.

Policy experts and scholars across Africa are condemning the policy shift, calling it coercive and neo-colonial. The EU's approach, they argue, is likely to undermine both sovereignty and trust.

""Stop your people from migrating or lose aid — sounds to me like a message of coersion and not cooperation,"" Maria Ayuk, a postdoctoral researcher in peace and security at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg in Germany, told DW.

""This reduces the African nations to border guards rather than equal partners in development. The EU is securitizing, and has over the years politicized, migration.""

She added that, ""what the EU is doing is forcing Africans to keep people in Africa, because they are afraid of the 'Africanization' of Europe.""

While European policymakers often emphasize ""pull factors"" such as jobs and security, African analysts say greater attention is needed on the conditions driving people to migrate in the first place.

""People will definitely have the urge to move,"" said Fidel Amakye Owusu, a Ghana-based geopolitical and security advisor. Some of the main drivers are ""socioeconomic problems, rural-urban development gaps, abject poverty, conflicts, and unemployment,"" he told DW.

Paul Ejime, a media and global affairs analyst, agrees: ""They are leaving because the environment […] is not conducive."" Ejime also noted that ""poverty, hardship, and instability"" are pushing Africans to risk their lives in search of livelihoods. ""Shutting the door or building walls is not the solution.""

According to Ayuk, governance failures are a part of the problem. ""We have several autocratic leaders that want to stay in power forever. These are core issues we have to address,"" she told DW.

Experts are of the consensus that Europe's trade practices and foreign interventions have directly contributed to instability and economic underdevelopment in Africa. These conditions, they argue, further drive migration.

""Europe's extractive trade policies, arms exports, and selective interventions [...] have contributed to instability and insecurity, and of course underdevelopment, fueling the very migration it seeks to prevent,"" Ayuk said.

""Most of the health personnel in these countries are in Europe and America. The health sector is poorly funded, under-resourced, and the personnel they have are leaving the country,"" Ejime noted. The problem is exacerbated by what he says are Europe's double standards: ""They can open their doors for people from Ukraine. But when it concerns Africans, they tighten the rules.""

The EU's tactic of conditioning development aid on cooperation with its migration objectives is also perceived as exploitative.

""Yes, I think that the EU is tying aid to migration control,"" said Ayuk. ""It weaponizes it and it shifts aid from solidarity to self-interest.""

She said that such an approach ""undermines trust and mutual respect"" between Europe and Africa.

Ejime added that, ""they have always done that.""

""At times, they come up with conditionalities when they want to give you any support,"" he told DW.

While sharply critical of the EU policy shift, the three experts who spoke to DW agreed that African governments bear significant responsibility for the crisis and the tough immigration policies towards their citizens.

""Africa is the problem, because it lacks the international agency,"" said Ayuk. ""Those that are supposed to represent Africa do not represent the collective interest of Africa, but rather the individual interests of elites.""

Some experts are calling on African leaders to redefine the terms of negotiations with the EU.

""Unfortunately, they are negotiating from a position of weakness. They are weak. The economies are weak. Politically, they are not even popular in their own countries and some of them are corrupt,"" Ejime said.

""In the past, under slavery, Africans were forced to go abroad. Today, young people are the ones running away, because the environment is not conducive.""

Despite their critiques, the experts believe Africa is not powerless. They maintain that the continent's strength can only come if it can mobilize political will.

""Africa has the potential, and leverage exists,"" Ayuk said, pointing to the continent's resources and regional blocs. ""But Africa requires unified leadership and a shift from dependence to a self-defined development.""

Owusu sees a need to harness technology and ensure effective management of national borders. ""Many African countries lack the technology to patrol all their borders. It is very difficult to manage such borders and control the flow of people.""

However, he warned that the EU's approach could be counterproductive for countries making genuine efforts.  As Europe grows more insular in its migration policies, some African countries may begin to pivot toward alternative global partnerships, for example with BRICS countries or other Global South initiatives, as Owusu pointed out.

He suggested that, if Europe continues using development aid as leverage, Africa could deepen ties with emerging powers like China, India, Brazil, and Russia.  ""The more [the West] looks inwards for solutions, the more confrontational their policies become, and the more Africa moves towards the East,"" he said.

But Ejime proposed a different approach: ""Africa needs to be strategic, maximize its own interest, and negotiate from a position of strength."" He added that, ""if skilled workers go abroad, maybe there should be a kind of agreement or contract that sends money back to develop the health and education systems.""

The experts agree that the current EU model that links aid to migration control, risks damaging long-term relations with Africa and fails to address root causes.

""Migration should be managed, yes, but not securitized or politicized. We need reciprocal relations based on respect, equity, and justice,"" Ayuk said.

Owusu also emphasized the need for mutual respect in achieving desired outcomes. ""Europe must stop seeing Africa as the problem and start treating it as a partner,"" he told DW.

Ejime turned the spotlight back on Africa and the need for effective leadership: ""Africa is not zero-poor. It's poorly managed. And has been impoverished by bad leadership.""

Hunter Biden unleashed on George Clooney in an expletive-laden rant, describing him as “not a f—ing actor”.

Hunter criticised the Academy Award winner for withdrawing his support for his father Joe Biden during the 2024 presidential race.

“F‑‑‑ him. F‑‑‑ him. F‑‑‑ him and everybody around him,” he told YouTube journalist, Andrew Callaghan during an interview on his “Channel 5”.

“I don't have to be f‑‑‑ing nice. No. 1, I agree with Quentin Tarantino. F‑‑‑ing George Clooney is not a f‑‑‑ing actor. He is a f‑‑‑ing, like… I don't know what he is. He is a brand.”

Hunter was referring to remarks by director Tarantino in which he said Clooney was not a “movie star”.

Clooney wrote a New York Times op-ed last July highlighting Joe Biden's mental decline and urging him to pull out of the race against Donald Trump. The piece contributed to the pressure which ultimately led Joe Biden to step down.

Elsewhere in the interview, Hunter revealed that he bought crack near the White House during Mr Trump's first term as president.

Hunter, 55, said he purchased the drugs in Washington DC's Lincoln Park after admitting to his doctor that he had begun drinking again shortly after his brother Beau died of cancer.

“I know it to be…sometimes an open air drug market, and I saw someone that I knew from my past life as being on the streets, a woman that I referred to as Bicycles, and I knew that it was kind of a suicidal thought,” he told Mr Callaghan.

“I said: ‘Do you got any crack?' She sold me crack. And that was it.”

The interview was published on the one-year anniversary of his father's withdrawal from the race for the White House.

In the three-hour conversation, Hunter spoke candidly about his drug use, addressed criticism of his father from both Republicans and Democrats and shared his thoughts on Mr Trump's border crackdown, comparing it to Nazi Germany.

Hunter also suggested that Ambien, a sedative used to treat insomnia, was to blame for his father's dire debate performance last year, in which he was often incoherent and struggled to complete sentences.

“He flew around the world, basically the mileage he could have flown around the world three times. He's 81 years old. He's tired as s--t,” Hunter said.

“They give him Ambien to be able to sleep. He gets up on the stage, and he looks like he's a deer in the headlights.”

The president's son dismissed claims that he acted as a de facto chief of staff to his father as one of a number of “conspiracies” spread about him.

The allegations are contained in Original Sin, a recently-published book by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios's Alex Thompson, chronicling the former president's mental decline and aides' attempts to cover it up.

Responding to suggestions that he played a key decision role in the Biden administration, Hunter said: “I think I spent 12 days in the White House in the last two years of the administration. I had a lot of other things going on.”

Hunter has frequently clashed with Mr Tapper.

The former president's son also hit out at Democratic commentators David Axelrod and Rahm Emmanuel, claiming that they want the Left to “turn away from all values” on the issue of immigration.

The two Democrats, who worked in the Obama administration, were critical of Joe Biden's decision to run for a second term.

“These guys think that we need to turn away from all values in order for us to lead.”

If he were president, he would threaten to invade El Salvador in order to free US deportees detained there, Hunter said.

“I would pick up the phone and call the f—ing president of El Salvador and say, you either f—ing send them back or I'm going to f—ing invade,” he said.

Hunter said any migrant who goes to extreme lengths to get into the country “deserves to be an American”.

Addressing his drug addiction, which spiralled out of control between 2016 and 2019, when he got clean, Hunter said he was drinking a bottle of vodka a day and began to make his own crack cocaine.

Asked how he sourced the drug, he said: “One of the things I don't want to do is give a how-to to any moron like myself that may think that it's a good idea.”

Having tried his first drink before high school and begun experimenting with drugs in his teenage years, the former president's son said that during his period of full-blown addiction, he was “smoking anything that even remotely resembled crack cocaine”.

“I probably smoked more parmesan cheese than anyone,” he joked.

Hunter denied that a bag of cocaine found in the White House in 2023 during his father's presidency was his, after the FBI opened an investigation into the matter.

“I have been clean and sober since June of 2019. I have not touched a drop of alcohol or a drug, and I'm incredibly proud of that,” he said. “Why would I bring cocaine into the White House and stick it into a cubby outside of the situation room in the West Wing?”

The discovery of the illicit substance fuelled rumours among Maga supporters that Hunter was responsible.

Donald Trump said he is being subjected to a “witch hunt” over his government's refusal to release the Epstein files. 

Mr Trump faced his first grilling by the media since a lewd birthday letter he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein was published by the Wall Street Journal.

“It's, it's sort of a witch hunt, just a continuation of a witch hunt,” Mr Trump said of the political crisis engulfing his presidency.

On Friday Mr Trump filed a $10 billion (£7.4 billion) defamation suit against the newspaper, the two reporters who wrote the story and Rupert Murdoch, the newspaper's owner.

The US president claimed the alleged letter, which is said to have included a drawing of a naked woman, is “fake”. On Tuesday, he described the WSJ as a “terrible paper” and said that he is suing them “for a lot of money”.

It came after the Department of Justice announced that administration officials had asked to meet Ghislaine Maxwell to discuss the Epstein case. 

Todd Blanche, the deputy US attorney general, said the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the FBI had reached out to the British socialite and former girlfriend of the paedophile financier, who is currently serving a 20-year jail sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking.

In a post shared by Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, Mr Blanche said: “President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DoJ will hear what she has to say.

“Therefore, at the direction of Attorney General Bondi, I have communicated with counsel for Ms Maxwell to determine whether she would be willing to speak with prosecutors from the Department. I anticipate meeting with Ms Maxwell in the coming days.”

Mr Trump claimed he was unaware of the plans to interview Maxwell. He said: “Yeah, I don't know about it, but I think it's something that would be... sounds appropriate to do.” Mr Trump continued: “I don't really follow that too much.” 

Maxwell's lawyer, who has been trying to meet with the Trump administration and has suggested his client should be freed, has confirmed he is in talks with government officials.

“I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully,” David Oscar Markus said.

He added: “We are grateful to president Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.”

Mr Trump's handling of the information related to the case has angered even some of his most loyal supporters.

The FBI and the DoJ sparked dismay among the president's Maga base earlier this month after concluding that the sex offender did not have a “client list” and took his own life in a Manhattan prison cell in 2019.

Conspiracy theorists, including many Trump voters, believe that Epstein was killed to prevent supposed information about high-profile “clients” involved with the financier from being made public.

Mr Blanche said that no previous administration had made contact with Maxwell on behalf of the DofJ. “That changes now,” he said.

It comes after Alan Dershowitz, Epstein's former lawyer, described Maxwell as the “Rosetta Stone” of the case.

“She knows everything. She is the Rosetta Stone. She knows everything. She arranged every single trip with everybody. She knows everything,” he told Fox News on Monday.

He suggested she should be given legal immunity in exchange for talking freely about the case before Congress.

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has become one of the most senior members of his party to call on Mr Trump to release “everything” related to the paedophile financier.

But on Monday, Mr Johnson's stance on the issue appeared to have softened, with the top Republican saying the administration needed “space” to resolve the matter.

“My belief is we need the administration to have the space to do what it is doing, and if further congressional action is necessary or appropriate, then we'll look at that,” Mr Johnson said.

He added: “But I don't think we're at that point right now because we agree with the president.”

On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he would shut the House down early for August recess, closing the session after a vote on Wednesday.

Making the announcement shortly after the DoJ revealed it had contacted Maxwell, Mr Johnson said the move was to avoid “political games”.

House Republicans offered a resolution calling for the so-called Epstein files to be made public, although the resolution carries no legal weight.

On Friday, Mr Trump ordered the release of grand jury transcripts from Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case after The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a story alleging Mr Trump had written a “bawdy” letter to Epstein for his birthday in 2003.

Mr Trump filed a lawsuit against the newspaper and its owner Rupert Murdoch, and on Monday, the White House removed the newspaper from the pool of reporters covering the president's upcoming trip to Scotland.

The president denied he wrote the letter, which is said to have included a drawing of a naked woman, and called it “fake”.

The potential meeting has raised questions over whether Maxwell will try to leverage information about the case for a reduced prison sentence. An appeal put forward by her lawyers was rejected last year.

Maxwell's appeal focused largely on a 2007 non-prosecution agreement made between Epstein and federal prosecutors in southern Florida, which she said barred her from being prosecuted in Manhattan 13 years later.

Her lawyer argued that the wording of the agreement signalled the government's intent to bar prosecutions nationwide of “potential co-conspirators”, including, but not limited to, four of Epstein's assistants.

Earlier in July, the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to reject another appeal by Maxwell's lawyers.

D John Sauer, the US solicitor-general, said the argument relating to the 2007 non-prosecution agreement was unlikely to succeed in any appeals court.

It comes as Republicans moved to force Maxwell to testify in front of the House about the Epstein case.

Recommended

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee advanced a motion filed by Tim Burchett, a Tennessee representative, seeking approval to subpoena Maxwell.

The Republican lawmaker was directed to introduce the motion by James Comer, the committee chair.

Both lawmakers told Axios they had not consulted Mr Trump before introducing the motion to compel the convicted sex offender to testify. The move marks the brewing discontent within members of Mr Trump's own party.

“The Committee will seek to subpoena Ms Maxwell as expeditiously as possible,” a committee aide said in a statement to Politico, adding: “Since Ms Maxwell is in federal prison, the Committee will work with the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons to identify a date when [the] Committee can depose her.”

“This deposition will help the American people understand how Jeffrey Epstein was able to carry out his evil actions for so long without being brought to justice,” Mr Burchett said in a statement.

Mr Trump's relationship with Maxwell stretches back decades. He was pictured with Maxwell and her paedophile financier boyfriend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2000.

In 2020, while Maxwell was awaiting trial on federal sex crimes for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking crimes, Mr Trump said he wished her “well”.

Asked whether he expected her to go public with the names of the men who have been accused in lawsuits of taking part in Epstein's sex-trafficking crimes, Mr Trump said: “I don't know... I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly.”

“I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is,” Mr Trump added.

In an interview with Axios that year, Mr Trump doubled down on his well wishes for Maxwell.

“Her friend, or boyfriend, was either killed or committed suicide in jail. She's now in jail,” Mr Trump said.

“I do wish her well. I'm not looking for anything bad for her. I'm not looking bad for anybody,” Mr Trump said, adding: “Her boyfriend died. He died in jail.”

Trump has suggested that his $16 million settlement is worth twice as much as the publicly reported amount.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A trio of Democratic U.S. senators on Monday launched a probe into reports that President Donald Trump's legal team struck a secretive side deal with Skydance — the prospective owner of CBS — that includes millions of dollars worth of “broadcast transmissions” supporting right-wing causes.

In a letter to Skydance CEO David Ellison, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote that Trump himself appeared to confirm the existence of the side deal in comments to reporters about his $16 million settlement with Paramount, the current owner of CBS that is seeking federal approval for its pending merger with Skydance.

Trump suggested the settlement was worth twice as much as the publicly reported figure, saying, “We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million—or maybe more than that in advertising… So it's like $32 to maybe $35 million. I think that's what they did.”

The senators described the alleged side deal as a “potential secret Trump payoff.”

“This admission appears to corroborate reporting that claims you reached a ‘side deal' with the president, the terms of which involve CBS airing public service announcements ‘and other broadcast transmissions' worth between $15 million and $20 million that ‘support conservative causes supported by President Trump.' The nature and existence of this arrangement are uncertain, with at least one anonymous source calling the reports ‘false.'”

The president's comments aligned with a New York Post story published earlier this month alleging that Ellison vowed to “run between $15 million and $20 million of public service ads to promote causes supported by the president” once the Skydance CEO takes over CBS.

Paramount denied having any knowledge of a side deal.

Did Skydance make a secret side deal with Donald Trump so he'd approve its $8 BILLION merger with Paramount? This could be bribery in plain sight. I'm pushing for answers NOW. https://t.co/UMSf84Cx7h

The Democratic senators wrote in their letter to Ellison that the president's comments and related reporting “raise fresh questions about corruption in the Trump administration and President Trump's willingness to accept payments from entities with significant policy interests before agencies he controls.”

The senators demanded that Ellison provide answers to seven questions, including whether there is “currently any arrangement under which you or Skydance will provide compensation, advertising, or promotional activities that in any way assist President Trump, his family, his presidential library, or other administration officials” and whether Ellison has “personally discussed with President Trump, any of his family members, any Trump administration officials, or presidential library fund personnel any matters related to the Paramount-Skydance transaction.”

The letter was sent days after Ellison met with Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr — a Trump loyalist — to discuss the pending merger with Paramount.

The meeting, according to Skydance's counsel, included a discussion of “Skydance's commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS‘ editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.”

As Variety noted, “That's significant because Carr, appointed by Trump, had reopened an agency probe into a ‘news distortion' complaint against CBS over the allegedly deceptive editing of a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris segment — the same interview that Trump sued Paramount and CBS over.”

“The application of the FCC's ‘news distortion' policy in this way was highly unusual, according to former agency officials,” Variety reported.

The Trump administration has openly defied court orders at an unprecedented rate, legal experts note.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

An analysis has found that the Trump White House has taken actions to defy one out of every three judicial rulings against the president's actions.

The examination of 160 lawsuits, conducted by The Washington Post, suggests “widespread noncompliance with America's legal system” on the part of President Donald Trump and his administration, the analysis concluded.

What's more, the administration seems to be taking advantage of the fact that the judicial system is slow to consider, begin or follow through on contempt proceedings — meaning that their noncompliance often goes unpunished. Indeed, none of the judges whose orders have been ignored have tried to force compliance in the form of punitive orders, The Post's analysis found. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Part of the reason judges may be reluctant to take such action is that they may want to avoid a constitutional crisis — such punitive orders, while issued by judges, are followed up by the U.S. Marshals Service, whose director is an executive branch appointee, meaning that the agency, under Trump's orders, may also ignore judicial decrees.

The Post examined 337 lawsuits in total, finding 165 cases in which judges had ruled against the administration. The Trump White House has been accused of “defying or frustrating court oversight” in 57 cases, or around 35 percent of rulings or orders made against them, the analysis found — an unprecedented amount, according to legal experts speaking to the publication. 

The White House appears to be seeking to sidestep court orders on immigration cases in particular, the data shows. Rulings on federal funding cuts or the firings of federal workers were also frequently ignored, according to the analysis.

Transgender journalist Erin Reed recently reported that the administration is also failing to abide by rulings on LGBTQ rights, including in a case that would allow transgender people to continue updating gender markers on their passports. Citing a source within the government, Reed noted that the “noncompliance is intentional,” and is a deliberate “stalling” of the order as the appeals process continues.

The White House typically justifies these actions by claiming that judges are biased against them, with Trump oftentimes asserting, without evidence, that rulings he disagrees with are from “radical left judges.”

The Washington Post's analysis seems to confirm concerns from a Department of Justice (DOJ) whistleblower earlier this year. The whistleblower report by Erez Reuveni, a former DOJ employee, stated that Emil Bove, the DOJ's principal associate deputy attorney general, frequently told colleagues that the administration should ignore court orders. When Reuveni tried to correct actions his coworkers were taking that appeared to follow through on that directive, he was “threatened, fired and publicly disparaged,” he said in his report.

Bove was recently nominated by Trump to become a federal judge in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The Republican-controlled Congress appears to be no help in the matter, either — indeed, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has sided with Trump, suggesting that judges should be punished in some way for issuing orders against the president's actions.

“We can eliminate an entire district court,” Johnson told reporters in March.

While Republican lawmakers appear to be aligning themselves with Trump's subversion of orders, polling suggests that voters are concerned about the administration's refusal to comply. 

A Demand Justice/Global Strategy Group poll released in June examined voters' attitudes in battleground states. The poll found that, while voters were split almost evenly along self-identified political lines, a majority of them, 53 percent, disapproved of Trump's response to court decrees, with nearly three-quarters of voters in the poll, 72 percent, saying they are “concerned about Trump's attempts to refuse to obey court orders.” A majority of voters, 52 percent, also said they viewed Trump's defiance as “an abuse of power.”

It is “very clear that voters overwhelmingly do not support Trump's attacks on the rule of law and the courts,” Demand Justice wrote in its press release of the poll's results. “All of us who care about the rule of law, the Constitution and our democracy must push back against these attacks.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

National security leaders rarely get to choose what to care about and how much to care about it. They are more often subjects of circumstances beyond their control. The September 11 attacks reversed the George W. Bush administration's plan to reduce the United States' global commitments and responsibilities. Revolutions across the Arab world pushed President Barack Obama back into the Middle East just as he was trying to pull the United States out. And Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended the Biden administration's goal of establishing “stable and predictable” relations with Moscow so that it could focus on strategic competition with China.

Policymakers could foresee many of the underlying forces and trends driving these agenda-shaping events. Yet for the most part, they failed to plan for the most challenging manifestations of where these forces would lead. They had to scramble to reconceptualize and recalibrate their strategies to respond to unfolding events.

The rapid advance of artificial intelligence—and the possible emergence of artificial general intelligence—promises to present policymakers with even greater disruption. Indicators of a coming powerful change are everywhere. Beijing and Washington have made global AI leadership a strategic imperative, and leading U.S. and Chinese companies are racing to achieve AGI. News coverage features near-daily announcements of technical breakthroughs, discussions of AI-driven job loss, and fears of catastrophic global risks such as the AI-enabled engineering of a deadly pandemic.

There is no way of knowing with certainty the exact trajectory along which AI will develop or precisely how it will transform national security. Policymakers should therefore assess and debate the merits of competing AI strategies with humility and caution. Whether one is bullish or bearish about AI's prospects, though, national security leaders need to be ready to adapt their strategic plans to respond to events that could impose themselves on decision-makers this decade, if not during this presidential term. Washington must prepare for potential policy tradeoffs and geopolitical shifts, and identify practical steps it can take today to mitigate risks and turbocharge U.S. competitiveness. Some ideas and initiatives that today may seem infeasible or unnecessary will seem urgent and self-evident with the benefit of hindsight.

There is no standard, shared definition of AGI or consensus on whether, when, or how it might emerge. Today's frontier AI models are already increasingly capable of performing a greater number and complexity of cognitive tasks than the most skilled and best resourced humans. Since ChatGPT launched in 2022, the power of AI has increased by leaps and bounds. It is reasonable to assume that these models will become more powerful, autonomous, and diffuse in the coming years.

Nevertheless, the AGI era is not likely to announce itself with an earth-shattering moment as the nuclear era did with the first nuclear weapons test. Nor are the economic and technological circumstances as favorable to U.S. planners as they were in the past. In the nuclear era, for example, the U.S. government controlled the new technology, and planners had two decades to develop policy frameworks before a nuclear rival emerged. Planners today, by contrast, have less agency and time to adapt. China is already a near peer in technology, a handful of private companies are steering development, and AI is a general-purpose technology that is spreading to nearly every part of the economy and society.

In this rapidly changing environment, national security leaders should dedicate scarce planning resources to plausible but acutely challenging events. These types of events are not merely disruptions to the status quo but also signposts of alternative futures.

Say, for instance, that a U.S. company claims to have made the transformative technological leap to AGI. Leaders must decide how the U.S. government should respond if the company requests to be treated as a “national security asset.” This designation would grant the company public support that could allow it to secure its facilities, access sensitive or proprietary data, acquire more advanced chips, and avoid certain regulations. Alternatively, a Chinese firm may declare that it has achieved AGI before any of its U.S. rivals.



Policymakers grappling with these scenarios will have to balance competing and sometimes contradictory assessments, which will lead to different judgments about how much risk to accept and which concerns to prioritize. Without robust, independent analytic capabilities, the U.S. government may struggle to determine whether the firms' claims are credible. National security leaders will also have to consider whether the new technological advance could provide China with a strategic advantage. If they fear AGI could give Beijing the ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. critical infrastructure faster than cyberdefenses can patch them, for example, they may prescribe actions—such as trying to slow or sabotage China's AI development—that could escalate the risk of geopolitical conflict. On the other hand, if national security leaders are more concerned that nonstate actors or terrorists could use this new technology to create catastrophic bioweapons, they may prefer to try to cooperate with Beijing to prevent proliferation of a larger global threat.

Enhancing preparedness for AGI scenarios requires better understanding of the AI ecosystem at home and abroad. Government agencies need to keep up with how AI is developing to identify where new advances are most likely to emerge. This will reduce the risk of strategic surprise and help inform policy choices on which bottlenecks to prioritize and which vulnerabilities to exploit to potentially slow China's progress.

Policymakers also need to explore ways to work with the private sector and with other countries. A scalable, dynamic, and two-way private-public partnership is crucial for a strategic response to the current challenges that AI presents, and this will be even more the case in an AGI world. Mutual suspicion between government and the private sector could cripple any crisis response. Meanwhile, leaders will need to develop policies to share sensitive, proprietary information on developments in frontier AI with partners and allies. Without such policies, it will be challenging to build the international coalition needed to respond to an AI-induced crisis, reduce global risk, and hold countries and companies accountable for irresponsible behavior.

Artificial general intelligence will not only complicate existing geopolitical dynamics; it will also present novel national security challenges. Imagine an unprecedented AI-enabled cyberattack that wreaks havoc on financial institutions, private corporations, and government agencies and shuts down physical systems ranging from critical infrastructure to industrial robotics. In today's world, determining who is responsible for cyberwarfare is already a challenging and time-intensive task. Any number of state and nonstate actors possess both the means and motivations to carry out destabilizing attacks. In a world with increasingly advanced AI, however, the situation would be even more complex. Policymakers would have to contemplate not only the possibility that an operation of this scale might be the prelude to a military campaign but also that it might be the work of an autonomous, self-replicating AI agent.

Planning for this scenario requires evaluating how today's capabilities can handle tomorrow's challenges. Governments cannot rely on present-day tools and techniques to quickly and confidently assess a threat, let alone apply relevant countermeasures. Given AI systems' proven capacity to deceive and dissemble, current systems may be unable to determine whether an AI agent is operating on its own or at the behest of an adversary. Planners need to find new ways to assess its motivations and how to deter escalation.

Preparing for the worst requires reevaluating “attribution agnostic” steps to harden cyberdefenses, isolate potentially compromised data centers, and prevent the incapacitation of drones or connected vehicles. Planners need to assess whether current military and continuity of operations protocols can handle threats from adversarial AI. Public distrust of the government and technology companies will make it even more difficult to reassure a worried populace in the event of artificial intelligence–fueled misinformation. Given that an autonomous AI agent is not likely to respect national boundaries, adequate preparations would involve setting up channels with partners and adversaries alike to coordinate an effective international response.

How leaders diagnose the external impacts of an impending threat will shape how they react. In the event of a cyberattack, policymakers will have to make a real-time decision about whether to pursue targeted shutdowns of vulnerable cyber-physical systems and compromised data centers or—fearing the potential for rapid replication—impose a more comprehensive shutdown, which could prevent escalation but inhibit the functioning of the digital economy and systems on which airports and power plants rely. This loss-of-control scenario highlights the importance of clarifying legal authority and developing incident-response plans. More broadly, it reinforces the urgency of creating policies and technical strategies to address how advanced models are inclined to misbehave.

At minimum, planning should involve four types of actions. First, it should establish “no regret” actions that policymakers and private-sector players can take today to respond to events from a position of strength. Second, it should create “break glass” playbooks for future emergencies that can be continually updated as new threats, opportunities, and concepts emerge. Third, it should invest in capabilities that seem crucial across multiple scenarios. Finally, it should prioritize early indicators and warnings of strategic failure and create conditions for course corrections.

Planning for the impacts of AGI on national security needs to start now. In an increasingly competitive and combustible world, and with an economically fragile and politically polarized domestic environment, the United States cannot afford being caught by surprise.

Although it is possible that AI will ultimately prove to be a “normal technology”—a technology, like the Internet or electricity, that transforms the world but whose pace of adoption has natural limits that governments and societies can control—it would be foolish to assume that preparing for major disruption would be a mistake. Planning for more difficult challenges can help leaders identify core strategic issues and build response tools that will be equally useful in less severe circumstances. It would also be unwise to presume that such planning will generate policy instincts and pathways that exacerbate risks or slow AI advances. In the nuclear era, for example, planning for potential nuclear terrorism inspired global initiatives to secure the fissile material needed to make nuclear weapons that ultimately made the world safer.

It would also be dangerous to treat the possibility of AGI like any “normal scenario” in the national security world. Technological expertise and fluency across the government is limited and uneven, and the institutional players that would be involved in responding to any scenario extend far beyond traditional national security agencies. Most scenarios are likely to occur abroad and at home simultaneously. Any response will rely heavily on the choices and decisions of actors outside government, including companies and civil society organizations, that do not have a seat in the White House Situation Room and may not prioritize national security. Likewise, planning cannot be delegated to futurists and technical experts sent to a far-off bunker to spend months crafting detailed plans in isolation. Preparing for a future with AGI must continuously inform today's strategic debates.

There is an active debate about the merits of various strategies to win the competition for AI while avoiding catastrophe, but there has been less discussion about how AGI might reshape the international landscape, the distribution of global power, and geopolitical alliances. In an increasingly multipolar world, emerging players see advanced AI—and how the United States and China diffuse AI technology and its underlying digital architecture—as key to their national aspirations. Early planning, tabletop exercises with allies and partners, and sustained dialogue with countries that want to hedge their diplomatic bets will ensure that strategic choices are mutually beneficial. Any AI strategy that fails to account for a multipolar world and a more distributed global technology ecosystem will fail. And any national security strategy that fails to grapple with the potentially transformative effects of AGI will become irrelevant.

National security leaders don't get to choose their crises. They do, however, get to choose what to plan for and where to allocate resources to prepare for future challenges. Planning for AGI is not an indulgence in science fiction or a distraction from existing problems and opportunities. It is a responsible way to prepare for the very real possibility of a new set of national security challenges in a radically transformed world.

Nearly 25 years ago, Americans discovered just how critical the antibiotic ciprofloxacin could be. Commonly prescribed for bacterial infections, “cipro” is also the first-line treatment for anthrax exposure. In September 2001, just one week after the 9/11 terror attacks, the American public found itself contending with yet another nightmare: someone was sending anthrax through the U.S. Postal Service to media companies and congressional offices—ultimately killing five people and infecting 17 others. Those with even the smallest risk of exposure lined up for treatment.

Today, anthrax remains one of the deadliest and easiest biological weapons to produce. Yet 80 percent of the U.S. supply of ciprofloxacin is still imported. Moreover, most of those imports, whether from Europe, India, or Jordan, rely on key starting ingredients made in China. 

It's not just cipro. The United States is alarmingly dependent on imports for many of its critical medicines and their ingredients. Over the last two decades, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, U.S. pharmaceutical imports have grown by an average of nine percent annually. Over the last 12 months, the value of U.S. pharmaceutical imports has ballooned 40 percent, to $315 billion; the pharmaceutical sector, which U.S. manufacturers once dominated, was the fifth-largest U.S. import category in 2024. By volume, China and India are the largest suppliers of drugs and their ingredients to the United States, including common antibiotics, statins, and other older low-cost generic medicines. By value, Germany, Ireland, and Switzerland dominate the U.S. pharmaceutical trade, largely through their exports of top-selling branded drugs such as Viagra and Botox and patented medicines such as new weight-loss treatments and Keytruda, the top-selling cancer drug. The United States has long dominated the production of innovative medicines, but even that market segment is at risk: in 2024, one-third of the new compounds licensed by U.S. pharmaceutical companies reportedly were made by Chinese biotechnology firms.

The combination of U.S. reliance on imports for critical medicines and the geographic concentration of those supplies has left Americans vulnerable to the natural disasters, manufacturing mishaps, and strategic prerogatives of other nations. In 2023, a U.S. Department of Defense official testified that the national security risks of Chinese dominance of the global market for active pharmaceutical ingredients—the building blocks of all drugs—“cannot be overstated.” Should China “decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the United States,” he warned, “it would have a debilitating effect on U.S. domestic production and could result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.” The United States maintains stockpiles of strategic medicines—the supply of ciprofloxacin is meant to cover 12 million people for 60 days—but emergency stockpiles are no answer for the chronic drug shortages already prevalent in the United States. Nor would they meet Americans' health needs in a sustained crisis, such as a pandemic or an attack by a foreign adversary.

U.S. President Donald Trump has correctly surmised that the United States doesn't make many of the everyday drugs that Americans take anymore, but his proposed remedy could make the problem worse. This month, the president promised that the country's pharmaceutical imports would be “tariffed at a very, very high rate, like 200 percent,” which he predicted would motivate pharmaceutical manufacturers to bring production “roaring back” to the United States if they are given “a year, year and a half” delay in tariff implementation. In service of that goal, the Trump administration has launched an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to determine whether pharmaceutical imports threaten U.S. national security. Notably, the security-related products targeted under Section 232 are exempt from recent court decisions that blocked Trump's reciprocal tariffs, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said recently that the pharmaceutical inquiry would conclude at the end of July.

But a blanket tariff on pharmaceutical imports would only worsen the dangers posed by the United States' growing dependence on foreign drugs and drug inputs. It would spur disruptions in supplies of essential medicines such as chemotherapy agents, penicillin, and other sterile injectable medications that have low profit margins and are complex to make and difficult to reprice under Medicaid and Medicare rules and long-term hospital contracts. Although Trump hopes this disruption will incentivize a shift to domestic manufacturing, even an 18-month transition period would not be long enough to establish new pharmaceutical manufacturing sites, which can require three to five years to build. In the meantime, patients and caregivers would not be able to access lifesaving medicines.

Overcoming the root causes of the U.S. dependence on foreign drugs instead requires understanding why some critical medicines and pharmaceutical ingredients are no longer made in the United States and why others are at risk of their production moving abroad. And it will mean coming up with effective policies for reversing those trends. Tariffs alone will not solve the problem.

Pharmaceutical manufacturing emerged in the 1930s from the dye and chemical industry and expanded dramatically with the production of antibiotics during World War II. As other labor-intensive industries moved offshore in search of cheaper labor, drug and vaccine makers stayed put for decades, anchored by high startup costs, infrastructure demands, and stringent quality, safety, and efficacy regulations.

This situation began to shift with the advent of low-cost generic medicines in the United States. In 1984, in an effort to increase competition in the U.S pharmaceutical market, lawmakers created an abbreviated pathway for approval of generic versions of drugs by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration: manufacturers would no longer have to redo all the expensive clinical trials that supported the greenlighting of the original drug. U.S. states passed laws permitting and in some cases requiring pharmacists to substitute approved generics in lieu of more expensive branded drugs, if available. In the late 1980s, insurers, pharmaceutical benefit managers, and Medicaid programs followed suit, instituting strong financial incentives for patients to use the cheapest available FDA-approved generic version.

Even with these new business practices and more favorable regulatory requirements, however, the shift from domestic U.S. pharmaceutical products to low-cost imports did not happen overnight. Two decades later, in 2004, generics only accounted for about half of all prescribed drugs in the United States, and India provided just one percent of U.S. pharmaceutical imports. At that point, most generic medicines dispensed in the United States were still manufactured in Europe, in Israel, or at home. In 1994, the United States, the EU, Japan, and other advanced economies pushed for and successfully concluded the World Trade Organization's Agreement on Trade in Pharmaceutical Products to exempt a broad array of these products from tariffs because of their public health importance.

Around 2010, however, a generational business opportunity arose to sell low-cost versions of top drugs. Over the next five years, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry experienced a “patent cliff” when patents expired on many of the top-selling drugs in the history of the pharmaceutical industry, including Lipitor, a statin used to control cholesterol. Suddenly, a large wave of medicines started becoming eligible for sale in generic versions, and by 2016, generics represented 89 percent of all prescriptions filled nationally. Drug manufacturers in China and India rushed to claim a piece of that expanding and lucrative pie. Many U.S. drug makers either formed joint ventures in China and India or dropped out of certain product lines entirely.

The arrival of these low-cost imports transformed the structure of the U.S. pharmaceutical market. Today, generics represent more than 90 percent of Americans' prescriptions, and Indian pharmaceutical companies supply 47 percent of these generic prescriptions. More worryingly for policymakers in Washington, approximately 70 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients used by Indian drug manufacturers come from China.

Although U.S. policies and business opportunities have provided incentives for hospitals, insurers, pharmaceutical benefit managers, and Medicaid and Medicare programs to rely on cheap prescription drug imports, the reasons that foreign firms dominate particular pharmaceutical segments go beyond low labor costs and are often particular to the product class involved.

Environmental concerns in the United States, for instance, have played a significant role in a shift to overseas manufacturing for many older generic products, such as commonly used antibiotics and everyday cardiovascular drugs. Production of active pharmaceutical ingredients often involves chemical reactions such as fluorination and chlorination, with toxic byproducts. In the first decade of this century, Western regulators and news media began to publicize these environmental and occupational harms. News reports described how hormones in the runoff from pharmaceutical manufacturing were feminizing fish and detailed the high concentration of antibiotics discovered in riverbeds and sewage. Amid the resulting outcry, European countries and the United States began mandating environmental risk assessments and adopting new regulations for pharmaceutical manufacturers. By contrast, China and India offered more relaxed environmental laws and more affordable water and power inputs, and the potential for enormous economies of scale as more manufacturing moved to those countries.

By 2021, China accounted for one-fifth of the world's antibiotics exports and nearly half of global exports of antibiotic ingredients. It had a reported production capacity of 14,000 tons—nearly three times that of India—for amoxicillin, a broad-spectrum penicillin antibiotic prescribed to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including ear, throat, sinus, respiratory, and urinary tract infections, especially in children. Over 20 million prescriptions for amoxicillin are written annually in the United States, sourced from generic producers in Europe, India, Israel, Jordan, and a small facility in Tennessee. But most of those manufacturers rely on APIs made in Chinese facilities in Shanghai and in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu. If a natural disaster struck there or China withheld amoxicillin API supplies for geopolitical reasons, as it has with rare-earth elements, the effects would ripple through every U.S. hospital, pharmacy, and pediatric practice within weeks.

For some critical medicines, U.S. regulatory changes have helped shift production abroad. Take the drug Heparin. Like amoxicillin, heparin is one of those foundational medications that make modern medicine possible. It is best known for preventing coronary disease and heart attacks, but it also works as a blood thinner that inhibits blood clots and pulmonary embolisms. It is used in everything from common surgeries to kidney dialysis to asthma medicines, and as a treatment for COVID-19. For decades, heparin was made with ingredients from cows, until the mad cow disease scare in the 1990s prompted manufacturers and regulators to adopt porcine alternatives. With that change, China, the world's largest pork producer, also became the dominant supplier of crude heparin.

This has created a critical dependence on China. Millions of U.S. patients use the drug annually, and numerous times, fluctuations in China's pig population have put the supply at risk. Most recently, the 2019 African swine fever epidemic devastated China's hog farms and triggered a global shortage of heparin. In 2008, when a Chinese-made heparin API was made with a cheaper synthetic counterfeit that proved toxic, the result was 149 deaths worldwide, including 80 in the United States. Some forms of heparin have been in short supply since 2017, prompting the FDA to reverse course and encourage producers to seek approval for a bovine version.

The United States continues to lead the world when it comes to manufacturing advanced biopharmaceuticals. Drugs for cutting-edge gene and cell therapies are made at sites in California and New Jersey, and insulin, vaccines, and immunotherapy doses are produced in Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and Puerto Rico. The United States also exports those medicines, with the COVID-19 pandemic boosting global demand for U.S.-manufactured COVID-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibodies.

Yet U.S. regulatory hurdles and the questionable intellectual property and tax policies of other countries have started to erode the U.S. biopharmaceutical advantage. FDA approval processes for early-stage clinical research have become increasingly cumbersome, slow, and costly. The risk-averse agency, for example, often requires extensive animal testing before researchers move on to Phase 1 clinical trials. As a result, many of those early-stage trials are now conducted abroad, often in China. Once that started, China began using its joint venture requirements and the conditions for its regulatory approval of drugs to compel foreign pharmaceutical companies to share their drug formulations, manufacturing processes, or research data with local firms and regulators. These practices have helped China establish a fast-follower strategy for drug development: Chinese companies replicate American-made innovations with only superficial tweaks or improvements. Heavy government support for AI-enabled biotechnology firms—including BioMap, the life sciences arm of the Chinese multinational Baidu, and WuXi AppTec, China's leading biomanufacturer—is accelerating China's emergence as a dominant biotech power. Merck and Pfizer's recent deals with Chinese biotechnology firms for advanced cancer and cardiovascular therapies worth billions of dollars signal a growing confidence among multinational drug firms in China's ability to develop and produce novel therapeutic treatments that meet rigorous Western standards.

For many years, Puerto Rico served as a hub of pharmaceutical manufacturing for the United States. But in 2006, the special tax credits that had encouraged Puerto Rico's industry were fully phased out. As a result, Ireland, Singapore, and other countries began offering tax incentives to lure U.S. pharmaceutical firms into establishing manufacturing operations and subsidiaries within their borders. The result, as the economist and Council of Foreign Relations fellow Brad Setser has shown, is that American firms have shifted production of their most lucrative drugs, which are often developed through research funded by U.S. taxpayers, to low-tax settings abroad just to sell them back at high prices to American consumers. This has led not only to huge trade deficits and lost U.S. tax revenues but also the rise of competitors with highly skilled biopharmaceutical workforces and robust manufacturing bases. The U.S. health system's reliance on important immunological and weight-loss drugs from abroad is making it less resilient.

The Trump administration wants to use tariffs to address these vulnerabilities in the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain. And its use of Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act makes it possible that Trump's tariffs could last. Indeed, before 2016, the Commerce Department rarely conducted Section 232 investigations, and when it did, it usually concluded that the imports in question did not meet the statute's requirement of threatening to “impair U.S. national security.” The few that did meet that criterion never resulted in tariffs. But the first Trump administration concluded six Section 232 investigations—nearly a fifth of all such inquiries that had been initiated since the federal statute was approved in 1962. In the most high-profile 232 investigations, such as those on aluminum and steel, Trump imposed tariffs. And once in place, none of those tariffs were lifted, not even by the Biden administration.

In the public comment period this past spring, patient groups and pharmaceutical firms almost universally opposed instituting Section 232 pharmaceutical tariffs. But Trump has announced his desired outcome, and U.S. courts have afforded the president broad discretion under Section 232 to impose tariffs with no specified end date. There is also a growing bipartisan consensus in Washington that the dependence on foreign countries in the pharmaceutical sector is a national security risk.

There are ways in which the Section 232 investigation might help improve U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain resilience if appropriately targeted. For starters, a tariff that applies to key starting materials and APIs—not just finished drugs—would actually capture the products where China is dominant and thus U.S. national security at risk. The Section 232 investigation should focus on this category but also recognize that building U.S. manufacturing capacity in this area will take time. To minimize U.S. drug shortages, then, the Section 232 investigation should also differentiate, as past investigations have, between adversaries and allies, exempting critical imports from the latter as “diverse and ‘safe' foreign suppliers.” Because previous Section 232 penalties have endured, the private sector would likely see such a tariff as durable, which would then justify the cost of sourcing from U.S. and trusted nations' suppliers.

A 232 tariff might also target and galvanize firms that produce expensive patented drugs to shift that intellectual property from low-tax nations back to the United States, a process that can take months, rather than years. Novartis, Eli Lilly, and other manufacturers of such medicines have already announced longer-term plans to build or expand their U.S. facilities. These expensive innovative drugs are often not covered by Medicaid and Medicare pricing restrictions, which means that the firms may seek to pass along tariff costs to patients and hospitals.

In contrast, imposing high tariffs on essential generic medicines is likely to increase costs for the U.S. health-care system and exacerbate risks of supply disruptions and shortages. Makers of these products cannot easily pass along tariff costs to their customers, and low profit margins, environmental challenges, regulatory requirements, and the need for economies of scale will make it difficult to relocate production to the United States. In other words, tariffs cannot offset the economic and political forces that created vulnerabilities in the pharmaceutical supply chain.

Fixing the national security challenge of overdependence on foreign sources for critical medicines instead requires coordinated action across U.S. government agencies and a strategic mix of policy instruments. Security-minded federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense, and procurement programs, such as the Strategic National Security Stockpile, could enter into limited-term, guaranteed purchase agreements with U.S.-based manufacturers of critical generic medicines. The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, known as ARPA-H, could boost their investments in innovations that enable the creation of smaller, cleaner, and more cost- and energy-efficient manufacturing facilities of key starting materials and APIs. Automation, continuous production, and modular equipment could all lower the manufacturing costs for pharmaceutical production while mitigating the associated environmental risks.

The FDA, meanwhile, should streamline the clinical trial approval process and consistently enforce quality standards for generic medicines; U.S. producers have often been subject to more frequent inspections and exacting oversight than their foreign counterparts, which contributed to an uneven and uncompetitive landscape. The recent launch of unannounced and surprise FDA inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities is a positive development in this regard.

But to protect the U.S. system of biomedical innovation, the Trump administration will have to do more than just level the playing field. The United States has led the pharmaceutical industry because of the collaboration among American universities, entrepreneurs, and large drug firms, and an openness to tapping the best talent from abroad. These attributes have enabled the best ideas to emerge and develop into world-leading, life-changing commercial products. Yet this resource is not inexhaustible; the president risks squandering it through his cuts in funding for the National Institutes of Health, hostility to international students, and attacks on research universities. Diversifying and fortifying the pharmaceutical supply chain is critical, but so is investing in the innovation needed to keep the United States in front.

Follow:


 President Donald Trump is pulling the United States out of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization or UNESCO, a White House official told CNN.
    


            The move comes as the US president continues to pull the country out of international institutions and makes ending Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs a key focus of his administration.
    


            “President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO — which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,” White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.
    


            In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce added the US' continued participation in UNESCO is not in its “national interest.” The withdrawal will take effect on December 31, 2026.
    


            UNESCO “promotes cooperation in education, science, culture and communication to foster peace worldwide,” its website states. The UN organization is widely recognized for its designation of World Heritage Sites, including the Grand Canyon National Park in the US.
    


            The United States was a founding member of UNESCO in 1945 but withdrew in 1984, citing concerns over financial mismanagement and a perceived bias against US interests.
    


            Nearly two decades later, in 2003, the US rejoined the organization during President George W. Bush's administration, with Bush stating that UNESCO had implemented important reforms.
    


            The US again withdrew from UNESCO during the first Trump administration but rejoined under Biden. After he took office for the second time, President Donald Trump ordered a review of US participation, including “an analysis of any anti-Semitism or anti-Israel sentiment within the organization.”
    


            Bruce alleged that “UNESCO works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy.”
    


            “UNESCO's decision to admit the ‘State of Palestine' as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization,” she said.
    


            Audrey Azoulay, director general of UNESCO said she deeply regretted the US decision but said the organization was expecting it.
    


            “This decision contradicts the fundamental principles of multilateralism, and may affect first and foremost our many partners in the United States of America — communities seeking site inscription on the World Heritage List, Creative City status, and University Chairs,” she said in a statement.
    


            “However regrettable, this announcement was anticipated, and UNESCO has prepared for it,” she added. “These claims also contradict the reality of UNESCO's efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.”
    


            The US decision was hailed by Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar, who called it “a necessary step, designed to promote justice and Israel's right for fair treatment in the UN system.”
    


            “Singling out Israel and politicization by member states must end, in this and all professional UN agencies,” he wrote in a post on X Tuesday. “Israel thanks the US for its moral support and leadership, especially in the multilateral arena which is plagued with anti-Israel discrimination.”
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron, however, took a swipe at the move.
    


            “Unwavering support for UNESCO, a universal guardian of science, the Ocean, education, culture, and world heritage,” he wrote on X. “The withdrawal of the United States will not weaken our commitment alongside those who lead this fight.”

Follow:


            Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified and released new intelligence documents Friday that she claimed were evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by top Obama administration officials to manufacture the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
    


            But the allegations conflate and misrepresent what the intelligence community actually concluded, according to a review of a GOP-led Senate investigation from 2020 and interviews with congressional sources familiar with the probe.
    


            The newly unsealed documents do nothing to undercut the government's core findings in its 2017 assessment that Russia launched an influence and hacking campaign and sought to help Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, the sources said.
    


            The new allegations from Gabbard lean on assessments before the election and statements from Obama-era intelligence officials finding that the Russians did not alter the election results through cyber-attacks aimed at infiltrating voting systems.
    


            But the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment never concluded that Russian cyberattacks altered the outcome of the 2016 election or compromised any election infrastructure in the first place, though state voting systems were probed.
    


            Instead, the assessment focused on Russia's influence campaign ordered by President Vladimir Putin and cyber operations against US and Democratic Party officials, including the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks.
    


            “These are two different things — cyberattacks on infrastructure and hacking the DNC — which they're conflating in an attempt to make a political point,” said a former senior congressional source familiar with the Senate review. “It's just wildly misleading on its face.”
    


            In 2020, a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review agreed with the intelligence community's conclusions on Russia's election interference and Putin's role directing the effort.
    


            Multiple congressional sources familiar with the Senate report said that Gabbard is trying to lean on intelligence assessments that no voting systems were breached to falsely make a broader leap that a Russian influence and cyber campaign did not occur. The Senate review included interviews with the intelligence analysts who drafted the report, none of whom reported any political interference, the congressional sources said.
    


            In response to questions from CNN, an ODNI official said, “What the IC assessed before the Obama-Brennan-Clapper politicization, was that attempts by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election were designed to undermine public confidence in the vote outcome, not ‘hack' U.S. elections.”
    


            Gabbard's declassified document release is only the latest example of Trump administration officials trying to rewrite the history of the Russia investigation during the president's first six months in office.
    


            Last month, CIA Director John Ratcliffe also released a review that criticized the intelligence community's conclusion that Putin sought to help Trump, which he said was reached “through an atypical & corrupt process.” Ratcliffe referred former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey to the Justice Department, which is now investigating, CNN previously reported. Gabbard also threatened on Friday to refer Obama officials to the Department of Justice for potential prosecution.

The mystery of the missing binder: How a collection of raw Russian intelligence disappeared under Trump



            Trump and his allies have spent years trying to denigrate all aspects of the Russia investigation, which consumed much of the first two years of Trump's first term – including the 2017 intelligence assessment; special counsel Robert Mueller's probe and the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation; and the infamous dossier written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and alleged coordination between the Russian government and people associated with the Trump campaign.
    


            Trump touted Gabbard's findings over the weekend, reposting videos of Gabbard speaking on Fox Business and memes of former President Barack Obama and his top officials in prison jumpsuits. Earlier this year, Trump declassified and released redacted documents from a binder that the White House compiled in 2020 criticizing the FBI's probe, including the bureau's errors in relying on the dossier to obtain foreign surveillance warrants on a Trump adviser.
    


            “Obama himself manufactured the Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX. Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe, and numerous others participated in this, THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY!. Irrefutable EVIDENCE. A major threat to our Country!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social Monday evening.
    


            The January 2017 intelligence assessment, released days before Trump took office, was a key first step in turning Trump against the “deep state.” He's long disputed the conclusion that Putin and the Russian government aspired to help him win, believing it undermined the legitimacy of his 2016 victory.
    


            A 2018 report by the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee disputed the tradecraft behind the conclusion that Putin tried to help Trump. Ratcliffe was a member of that committee at the time, and FBI Director Kash Patel was a top aide on the panel. Ratcliffe's review last month did not dispute the intelligence community's finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
    


            Gabbard alleged that the intelligence assessment on Russian interference relied on the Steele dossier and was used by the Obama White House to “subvert the will of the American people.”
    


            In an 11-page memo accompanying the declassified documents, Gabbard cites emails from intelligence officials and an earlier September 2016 intelligence assessment stating that foreign adversaries don't have the capability to “covertly overturn the vote outcome.” The memo points to talking points in December 2016 for then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, stating: “Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.”
    


            Gabbard's memo alleges that when the January 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian interference was released, it “falsely alleges, based in part on ‘further information' that had ‘come to light' since the election, that Putin directed an effort to help President Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.”
    


            “This ‘further information' is later confirmed to be the Steele Dossier,” the memo states.
    


            But congressional sources took issue with both of her claims: The intelligence community conclusion of a Putin-directed campaign was not evidence that the election outcome had been altered, they said, and the committee's interviews with the analysts who drafted the assessment said that the Steele dossier did not inform its analysis.
    


            There was an internal debate about whether the dossier should be part of the assessment or a separate annex, but the CIA insisted it be kept out of the report, according to the committee's report.
    


            “All individuals the Committee interviewed stated that the Steele material did not in any way inform the analysis in the ICA — including the key judgments — because it was unverified information and had not been disseminated as serialized intelligence reporting,” the committee report states.
    


            Gabbard's memo claims the dossier was involved in the assessment on the basis of an “ODNI whistleblower,” who had worked previously on election interference and said they were sidelined on the January 2017 Russia document.
    


            The memo states that the whistleblower was “shocked” to be told in helping to respond to a 2019 Freedom of Information Act request that the dossier was “a factor” in the intelligence assessment.
    


            But the email that's cited in the memo merely states that the dossier was a factor because it was an annex to the intelligence assessment — there's no suggestion that means it was involved in the crafting of the analysis itself.
    


            Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the panel's investigation resulted in a “unanimous, bipartisan conclusion” that Putin interfered in 2016 to benefit Trump.
    


            “This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,” Warner said.

            The dense forests near West Yellowstone, Montana, concealed the wreckage of a small plane until an unlikely beacon — a smartwatch worn by one of the victims — helped search-and-rescue crews locate the crash site, officials said Monday.
    


            Responding crews found all three people aboard the aircraft dead, the Gallatin County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.



            The victims were Rodney Conover, 60, and Madison Conover, 23, both of Tennessee, and Kurt Enoch Robey, 55, of Utah, according to the office.
    


            The plane departed from West Yellowstone Airport on Thursday, just before midnight, but never reached its destination, the sheriff's office said.
    


            On Friday afternoon, West Yellowstone Dispatch received a call from the US Department of Tranportation's Aero Division alerting local authorities that the aircraft's location was unknown.
    


            Minutes later, two planes were sent to search for the missing aircraft and, guided by location data from a smartwatch worn by one of the passengers, found the crash site just south of the town of West Yellowstone, the sheriff's office said.
    


            The search planes spotted the wreckage from air, describing it as “crashed in dense timber,” the office said. Ground crews navigated the rugged wilderness to reach the site.
    


            Responders confirmed all three occupants had died. Their remains were airlifted and turned over to the county coroner.
    


            The aircraft was a version of the Piper Cherokee, a small, single-engine plane, according to the accident notice for the crash in the Federal Aviation Administration's aviation safety database. It was carrying two crew members and one passenger, the report shows.
    


            The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash. CNN has reached out to both agencies for comment.
    


            Weather in the area at the time included gusty winds and chilly overnight temperatures.
    


            Sheriff Dan Springer extended his “deepest condolences” to the victims' families.

Follow:


            The Trump administration has released records of the FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate's family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination.
    


            The release involves more than 240,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977, when the FBI first gathered the records and turned them over to the National Archives and Records Administration.
    


            In a lengthy statement released Monday, King's two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, said their father's killing has been a “captivating public curiosity for decades.” But the pair emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that the files “be viewed within their full historical context.”
    


            The Kings got advance access to the records and had their own teams reviewing them. Those efforts continued even as the government granted public access. Among the documents are leads the FBI received after King's assassination and details of the CIA's fixation on King's pivot to international anti-war and anti-poverty movements in the years before he was killed. It was not immediately clear whether the documents shed new light on King's life, the Civil Rights Movement or his murder.
    


            “As the children of Dr. King and Mrs. Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met — an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continuing grief.”
    


            They also repeated the family's long-held contention that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all.
    


            Bernice King was 5 years old when her father was killed at the age of 39. Martin III was 10.
    


            A statement from the office of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard called the disclosure “unprecedented” and said many of the records had been digitized for the first time. She praised President Donald Trump for pushing the issue.
    


            Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy's and King's 1968 assassinations.
    


            The government unsealed the JFK records in March and disclosed some RFK files in April.
    


            The announcement from Gabbard's office included a statement from Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, who is an outspoken conservative and has broken from King's children on various topics — including the FBI files. Alveda King said she was “grateful to President Trump” for his “transparency.”
    


            Separately, Attorney General Pam Bondi's social media account featured a picture of the attorney general with Alveda King.
    


            Besides fulfilling the intent of his January executive order, the latest release serves as another alternative headline for Trump as he tries to mollify supporters angry over his administration's handling of records concerning the sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself behind bars while awaiting trial in 2019, during Trump's first presidency. Trump last Friday ordered the Justice Department to release grand jury testimony but stopped short of unsealing the entire case file.
    


            Bernice King and Martin Luther King III did not mention Trump in their statement Monday. But Bernice King later posted on her personal Instagram account a black-and-white photo of her father, looking annoyed, with the caption “Now, do the Epstein files.”
    


            And some civil rights activists did not spare the president.
    


            “Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton. “It's a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the MAGA base.”
    


            The King Center, founded by King's widow and now led by Bernice King, reacted separately from what Bernice said jointly with her brother. The King Center statement framed the release as a distraction — but from more than short-term political controversy.
    


            “It is unfortunate and ill-timed, given the myriad of pressing issues and injustices affecting the United States and the global society,” the King Center, linking those challenges to MLK's efforts. “This righteous work should be our collective response to renewed attention on the assassination of a great purveyor of true peace.”
    


            The King records, meanwhile, were initially intended to be sealed until 2027, until Justice Department attorneys asked a federal judge to lift the sealing order ahead of its expiration date. Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents to find new information about his assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.
    


            The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King co-founded in 1957 as the Civil Rights Movement blossomed, opposed the release. They, along with King's family, argued that the FBI illegally surveilled King and other civil rights figures, tapping their offices and phone lines with the aim of discrediting them and their movement.
    


            It has long been established that then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was intensely interested if not obsessed with King and others that he considered radicals. FBI records released previously show how Hoover's bureau wiretapped King's telephone lines, bugged his hotel rooms and used informants to get information against him.
    


            “He was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),” the King children said in their statement.
    


            “The intent of the government's COINTELPRO campaign was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle and destroy Dr. King's reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continued. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth — undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.”
    


            The Kings said they “support transparency and historical accountability” but “object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods.”
    


            Opposition to King intensified even after the Civil Rights Movement compelled Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to enact the Civil Right Act of 1964 and the Voting Right Act of 1965. After those landmark victories, King turned much of his attention to economic justice and international peace. He was an outspoken critic of rapacious capitalism and the Vietnam War. King argued that political rights alone were not enough in an uneven economy. Many establishment figures like Hoover viewed King as a communist threat.
    


            King was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice.
    


Ray pleaded guilty to assassinating King. He later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.
    


            King family members and others have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the probe to be reopened, and in 1998, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new look. Reno's Justice Department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr. King.”
    


            In their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. They pointed to a 1999 civil case, brought by the King family, in which a Memphis jury concluded that Martin Luther King Jr. had been the target of a conspiracy.
    


            “As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.”

The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing for hours over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland.

Russia now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones — a record.

Some experts say that number could soon top 1,000 a day.

The spike comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has given Russia until early September to reach a ceasefire or face new sanctions -– a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible on Ukraine.

Russia has sharply increased its drone output and appears to keep ramping it up. Initially importing Shahed drones from Iran early in the 3 1/2-year-old war, Russia has boosted its domestic production and upgraded the original design.

The Russian Defense Ministry says it's turning its drone force into a separate military branch. It also has established a dedicated center for improving drone tactics and better training for those flying them.

Russian engineers have changed the original Iranian Shahed to increase its altitude and make it harder to intercept, according to Russian military bloggers and Western analysts. Other modifications include making it more jamming-resistant and able to carry powerful thermobaric warheads. Some use artificial intelligence to operate autonomously.

The original Shahed and its Russian replica — called “Geran,” or “geranium” — have an engine to propel it at 180 kph (just over 110 mph). A faster jet version is reportedly in the works.

The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted that cooperation with China has allowed Russia to bypass Western sanctions on imports of electronics for drone production. Ukraine's military intelligence estimates that Russia receives up to 65% of components for its Geran drones from China. Beijing rejects the claims.

Russia initially launched its production of the Iranian drones at factory in Alabuga, located in Tatarstan. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production.

A report Sunday by state-run Zvezda TV described the Alabuga factory as the world's biggest attack drone plant.

“It's a war of drones. We are ready for it,” said plant director Timur Shagivaleyev, adding it produces all components, including engines and electronics, and has its own training school.

The report showed hundreds of black Geran drones stacked in an assembly shop decorated with Soviet-style posters. One featured images of the father of the Soviet nuclear bomb, Igor Kurchatov, legendary Soviet space program chief, Sergei Korolyov, and dictator Josef Stalin, with the words: “Kurchatov, Korolyov and Stalin live in your DNA.”

The Russian military has improved its tactics, increasingly using decoy drones named “Gerbera” for a type of daisy. They closely resemble the attack drones and are intended to confuse Ukrainian defenses and distract attention from their more deadly twins.

By using large numbers of drones in one attack, Russia seeks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and keep them from targeting more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles that Moscow often uses alongside the drones to hit targets like key infrastructure facilities, air defense batteries and air bases.

Former Russian Defense Ministry press officer Mikhail Zvinchuk, who runs a popular war blog, noted the Russian military has learned to focus on a few targets to maximize the impact. The drones can roam Ukraine's skies for hours, zigzagging past defenses, he wrote.

“Our defense industries' output allows massive strikes on practically a daily basis without the need for breaks to accumulate the necessary resources,” said another military blogger, Alexander Kots. “We no longer spread our fingers but hit with a punching fist in one spot to make sure we hit the targets.”

Ukraine relies on mobile teams armed with machine guns as a low-cost response to the drones to spare the use of expensive Western-supplied air defense missiles. It also has developed interceptor drones and is working to scale up production, but the steady rise in Russian attacks is straining its defenses.

Despite international sanctions and a growing load on its economy, Russia's military spending this year has risen 3.4% over 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which estimated it at the equivalent of about $200 billion. While budgetary pressures could increase, it said, the current spending level is manageable for the Kremlin.

Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered to the military last year, said President Vladimir Putin.

Frontelligence Insight, a Ukraine-based open-source intelligence organization, reported this month that Russia launched more than 28,000 Shahed and Geran drones since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, with 10% of the total fired last month alone.

While ballistic and cruise missiles are faster and pack a bigger punch, they cost millions and are available only in limited quantities. A Geran drone costs only tens of thousands of dollars — a fraction of a ballistic missile.

The drones' range of about 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) allows them to bypass some defenses, and a relatively big load of 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of explosives makes them a highly effective instrument of what the Center for Strategic and International Studies calls “a cruel attritional logic.”

CSIS called them ”the most cost-effective munition in Russia's firepower strike arsenal.”

“Russia's plan is to intimidate our society,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that Moscow seeks to launch 700 to 1,000 drones a day. Over the weekend, German Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding said in an interview that Russia aims for a capability of launching 2,000 drones in one attack.

Along the more than 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, short-range attack drones have become prolific and transformed the fighting, quickly spotting and targeting troops and weapons within a 10-kilometer (6-mile) kill zone. 

Russian drone units initially were set on the initiative of midlevel commanders and often relied on equipment purchased with private donations. Once drones became available in big numbers, the military moved last fall to put those units under a single command.

Putin has endorsed the Defense Ministry's proposal to make drones a separate branch of the armed forces, dubbed the Unmanned Systems Troops.

Russia has increasingly focused on battlefield drones that use thin fiber optic cables, making them immune to jamming and have an extended range of 25 kilometers (over 15 miles). It also has set up Rubicon, a center to train drone operators and develop the best tactics.

Such fiber optic drones used by both sides can venture deeper into rear areas, targeting supply, support and command structures that until recently were deemed safe. 

Michael Kofman, a military expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russian advancements have raised new defensive challenges for Ukraine.

“The Ukrainian military has to evolve ways of protecting the rear, entrenching at a much greater depth,” Kofman said in a recent podcast.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

The Trump administration on Monday released records of the FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate's family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination.

The digital document dump includes more than 240,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977, when the FBI first gathered the records and turned them over to the National Archives and Records Administration. 

In a lengthy statement released Monday, King's two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, said their father's killing has been a “captivating public curiosity for decades.” But the pair emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that the files “be viewed within their full historical context.”

The Kings got advance access to the records and had their own teams reviewing them. Those efforts continued even as the government granted public access. Among the documents are leads the FBI received after King's assassination and details of the CIA's fixation on King's pivot to international anti-war and anti-poverty movements in the years before he was killed. It was not immediately clear whether the documents shed new light on King's life, the Civil Rights Movement or his murder. 

“As the children of Dr. King and Mrs. Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met -- an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continuing grief.”

They also repeated the family's long-held contention that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all.




Bernice King was 5 years old when her father was killed at the age of 39. Martin III was 10.

A statement from the office of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard called the disclosure “unprecedented” and said many of the records had been digitized for the first time. She praised President Donald Trump for pushing the issue.

Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy's and MLK's 1968 assassinations.

It has long been established that then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was intensely interested if not obsessed with King and others he considered radicals. FBI records released previously show how Hoover's bureau wiretapped King's telephone lines, bugged his hotel rooms and used informants to gather information, including evidence of King's extramarital affairs.

“He was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” the King children said in their statement.

“The intent ... was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle and destroy Dr. King's reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continued. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth — undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.”

The Kings said they “support transparency and historical accountability” but “object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods.”died

Opposition to King intensified even after the Civil Rights Movement compelled Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. After those victories, King turned his attention to economic justice and international peace. He criticized rapacious capitalism and the Vietnam War. King asserted that political rights alone were not enough to ensure a just society. Many establishment figures like Hoover viewed King as a communist threat.

King was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice. 

Ray pleaded guilty to King's murder. Ray later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.

King family members and others have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the probe to be reopened, and in 1998, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new look. Reno's Justice Department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr. King.” 

In their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. They pointed to a 1999 civil case, brought by the King family, in which a Memphis jury concluded that Martin Luther King Jr. had been the target of a conspiracy.

“As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.”

NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft has issued an emergency fix to close off a vulnerability in Microsoft's widely-used SharePoint software that hackers have exploited to carry out widespread attacks on businesses and at least some U.S. government agencies.

The company issued an alert to customers Saturday saying it was aware of the zero-day exploit being used to conduct attacks and that it was working to patch the issue. Microsoft updated its guidance Sunday with instructions to fix the problem for SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working on a fix for the older SharePoint Server 2016 software.

“Anybody who's got a hosted SharePoint server has got a problem,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president with CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm. “It's a significant vulnerability.”

Companies and government agencies around the world use SharePoint for internal document management, data organization and collaboration.




A zero-day exploit is a cyberattack that takes advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability. “Zero-day” refers to the fact that the security engineers have had zero days to develop a fix for the vulnerability.

According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the exploit affecting SharePoint is “a variant of the existing vulnerability CVE-2025-49706 and poses a risk to organizations with on-premise SharePoint servers.”

Security researchers warn that the exploit, reportedly known as “ToolShell,” is a serious one and can allow actors to fully access SharePoint file systems, including services connected to SharePoint, such as Teams and OneDrive.

Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned that the vulnerability may allow bad actors to “bypass future patching.”

Eye Security said in its blog post that it scanned over 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and discovered that at least dozens of systems were compromised. The cybersecurity company said the attacks likely began on July 18.

Microsoft said the vulnerability affects only on-site SharePoint servers used within businesses or organizations, and does not affect Microsoft's cloud-based SharePoint Online service. 

But Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, warns that the exploit still leaves many potentially exposed to bad actors. 

“While cloud environments remain unaffected, on-prem SharePoint deployments — particularly within government, schools, health care including hospitals, and large enterprise companies — are at immediate risk.”

The vulnerability targets SharePoint server software so customers of that product will want to immediately follow Microsoft's guidance to patch their on-site systems. 

Although the scope of the attack is still being assessed, CISA warned that the impact could be widespread and recommended that any servers impacted by the exploit should be disconnected from the internet until they are patched.

“We are urging organizations who are running on-prem SharePoint to take action immediately and apply all relevant patches now and as they become available, rotate all cryptographic material, and engage professional incident response. An immediate, band-aid fix would be to unplug your Microsoft SharePoint from the internet until a patch is available,” Sikorski advises.

MILAN (AP) — Rescuers on Monday freed a cave explorer who was injured by falling rocks some 40 meters (more than 130 feet) below the surface in Italy's northwestern Piedmont region while on an outing with friends, according to Italy's mountain rescue corps. 

The 63-year-old man, who sustained a head injury, was brought to the surface by crews who used explosives to widen the cave at key junctures. They also passed through two 15-meter (49-foot) vertical shafts and a series of narrow winding passages. 

Medical teams reached the injured man after the accident on Sunday and treated him inside a heated tent while the path out was being cleared. He remained in good condition.

The Trump administration announced Tuesday that the United States will exit the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

""President Donald Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO – which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November. This president will always put America First and ensure our country's membership in all international organizations aligns with our national interests,"" White House Deputy Spokesperson Anna Kelly said on Tuesday.

WATCHDOG BACKS RUBIO'S SANCTIONS ON UN OFFICIAL OVER ‘SHAMEFUL EFFORTS' TARGETING US, ISRAEL

""The U.S. continues to demonstrate moral clarity in the international arena and when it comes to its involvement and financial investments in international organizations, and makes it clear that it is unwilling to support entities that promote hatred, historical revisionism, and political divisiveness over advancing shared universal values,"" Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said in a statement.

Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Sa'ar also commended the decision, which he said ""is a necessary step, designed to promote justice and Israel's right to fair treatment in the U.N. system, a right which has often been trampled due to politicization in this arena.""

""Singling out Israel and politicization by member states must end, in this and all professional U.N. agencies,"" Sa'ar added.

The move comes as the administration continues to make waves in the international community, and in particular at the U.N. The U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has drawn the ire of the U.N. and other international bodies. 

Additionally, Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed his concerns about the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts, which he said would be ""especially devastating"" to the world's vulnerable populations, according to Reuters.

State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on the exit that ""continued involvement with UNESCO is not in the national interest of the United States.""

""UNESCO works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy,"" the statement read. ""UNESCO's decision to admit the ‘State of Palestine' as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization.""

Trump withdrew the U.S. from UNESCO in October 2017, during his first term, but former President Joe Biden had the country rejoin the agency in 2023. In 2017, the State Department said the U.S. was withdrawing from the agency for very similar reasons, suggesting UNESCO has not sufficiently fixed the issues at the center of the Trump administration's concerns.

'The Cyberguy' Kurt Knutsson weighs in and shares his tips for avoiding new email 'unsubscribe' scams. 

The U.S. Air Force says the B-52 bomber that had a near miss with a Delta Airlines flight over North Dakota on Friday was flying an approved flight path at the time.

The Air Force released the statement on Monday, saying the Federal Aviation Administration was still investigating the incident. The B-52 bomber was in the air to conduct a flyover at the North Dakota State Fair, which had been pre-approved and planned in advance by the FAA.

The Air Force says the B-52 pilots were in contact with the Minot International Airport and the Minot Approach Control (RAPCON).

""At approximately 7:10 p.m. prior to the flyover, the B-52 crew contacted Minot Approach (RAPCON) to prepare for the flyover. Required checklists were completed, and the crew remained in contact with Minot Approach as it flew to its holding point 12 miles east of the fairgrounds. While holding, the B-52 crew communicated the flyover plan to both RAPCON and Minot International Airport's air traffic control tower,"" the Air Force said in a statement.

""Minot Approach directed the B-52 crew at 7:43 p.m. to contact Minot International Airport's air traffic control. The B-52 crew contacted Minot International Airport tower and the tower provided instructions to continue 2 miles westbound after the flyover. The tower did not advise of the inbound commercial aircraft,"" the statement continued.

The pilot of a SkyWest Airlines flight operated by Delta Air Lines performed an ""aggressive maneuver"" to avoid a collision with the B-52. The pilot then explained the frightening incident to passengers in audio that went viral on social media.

The flight was carrying passengers from Minneapolis to Minot, N.D. The flight circled Minot International Airport several times before landing after the incident.

""SkyWest flight 3788, operating as Delta Connection from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Minot, North Dakota on July 18, landed safely in Minot after being cleared for approach by the tower but performed a go-around when another aircraft became visible in their flight path,"" a spokesperson for SkyWest said in a statement to FOX Business.

""We are investigating the incident,"" the spokesperson added.

I don't know why they didn't give us a heads-up, because the Air Force base does have radar ... long story short, it was not fun, but I do apologize for it, and thank you for understanding. Not a fun day at work.""

Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley tells Fox News Digital touts that ‘we're seeing very robust fundraising here at the RNC'

FIRST ON FOX: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Tuesday launched billboards outside three rural hospitals that Democrats say are closing or cutting back services due to President Donald Trump's recently signed domestic policy package.

The DNC says it placed billboards in Silex, Missouri; Stillwell, Oklahoma; and Missoula, Montana, to make sure that rural voters, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in last year's presidential election, ""know who is responsible for gutting rural health care.""

The Democrats' national party committee, in taking aim at the sweeping and controversial tax cut and spending measure, named the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" by Trump and congressional Republicans, argued that ""residents are already seeing the firsthand effects of Trump's Budget Betrayal.""

The billboards were shared first with Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning.

RNC CHAIR SAYS ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' KEY TO GOP'S MESSAGING EFFORT HEADED INTO MIDTERMS

The DNC is targeting rural voters with new billboards in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Montana, blaming Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' for hospital closures and cuts to health services. (Democratic National Committee)

The measure is stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. 

It includes extending the president's signature 2017 tax cuts and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay. 

By making his first-term tax rates permanent — they were set to expire later this year — the bill will cut taxes by nearly $4.4 trillion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

POLITICAL FIGHT OVER ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' IS FRONT-AND-CENTER IN KEY SENATE RACE

The measure also provides billions for border security and codifies the president's controversial immigration crackdown.

The $3.4 trillion legislative package is also projected to surge the national debt by $4 trillion over the next decade, but many Republicans dispute the projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

And the new law also restructures Medicaid — the almost 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans. The CBO this week estimated that 10 million people could lose their health insurance over the next decade.

The changes to Medicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage.

Democrats, for months, have repeatedly blasted Republicans over the social safety net changes. And they spotlighted a slew of national polls last month and this month that indicate the bill's popularity in negative territory.

WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'

The DNC claims that the bill, which Trump signed into law on July 4 after the GOP-controlled House and Senate narrowly passed the measure along near-party-line votes, will gut Medicaid, forcing rural hospitals and nursing homes to close their doors. 

""Rural hospitals were already on the brink of collapse thanks to Donald Trump, but now he has put the last nail in the coffin for rural hospitals with his billionaire budget bill,"" DNC chair Ken Martin argued in a statement to Fox News.

Martin highlighted that ""in states across the country, hospitals are either closing their doors or cutting critical services, and it's Trump's own voters who will suffer the most. This is what Donald Trump does — screw over the people who are counting on him.""

Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Michael Whatley, in an interview with Fox News Digital last week, spotlighted that ""if you take a look at the Medicaid side of this conversation, the fact is that we're going to be moving illegal aliens off of Medicaid. We're going to be strengthening the program. Those are things that absolutely need to happen.""

FIRST ON FOX: HOUSE REPUBLICANS LAUNCH FIRST ADS TOUTING ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

And he argued that ""the tax cuts are going to be very, very strong indicators, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security. Plus we're extending those Trump tax cuts. This is going to help every family in every community all across the country.""

Included in the megabill is a $60 billion fund, named the Rural Health Transformation Program, which Republicans say would offset cuts to Medicaid and would also help overcome long-standing health disparities that rural communities have faced.

But the DNC says their new analysis ""shows this funding was never going to be enough to make a difference.""

And the DNC points to a non-partisan breakdown of the new law, which says that half of the rural hospital funding will be split evenly among all states that apply, regardless of need.

Both parties see the ""big, beautiful bill"" as a key part of their messaging heading into next year's midterm elections, when the Republicans will be defending their slim majorities in the House and Senate.

Fox News correspondent Jeff Paul has the latest on the riots from Los Angeles on 'America Reports.'

The Department of Defense has ordered 700 U.S. Marines to leave Los Angeles, California on Monday, more than a month after they were deployed to the city against the will of city leaders and amid violent demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions.

The Trump administration deployed the 700 Marines and federalized roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in early June to quell anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots and protests. 

The Marines assigned to the area were limited to defending federal buildings, including the ICE office and detention facility in downtown LA.

""With stability returning to Los Angeles, the Secretary has directed the redeployment of the 700 Marines whose presence sent a clear message: lawlessness will not be tolerated,"" Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said. ""Their rapid response, unwavering discipline, and unmistakable presence were instrumental in restoring order and upholding the rule of law. We're deeply grateful for their service, and for the strength and professionalism they brought to this mission.""

The Pentagon's decision to have the Marines leave LA comes after half of the National Guard troops were ordered to leave the city last week.

LA Mayor Karen Bass called the withdrawal of troops ""another win for Los Angeles.""

""This is another win for Los Angeles, but this is also a win for those serving this country in uniform,"" Bass said on Monday. ""Just this morning I stood with Veterans, families of active-duty officers, and business leaders to show the impact of this unnecessary, unprecedented, and unconstitutional assault on our city. We took the administration to court and won, now we continue that momentum with today's news. Los Angeles stands with our troops, which is why we are glad they are leaving."" 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration for deploying California National Guard troops despite his opposition. He argued that the National Guard troops were likely violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.

Newsom won an early victory in the case after a federal judge ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's authority. An appeals court tossed that order, and control of the troops remained with the federal government. The federal court is set to hear arguments next month on whether the troops are violating the Posse Comitatus Act.

The deployment of National Guard troops was for 60 days, though Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the discretion to shorten or extend it ""to flexibly respond to the evolving situation on the ground,"" the Trump administration's lawyers wrote in a June 23 filing in the legal case.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on rival gang factions in Haiti and the State Department's efforts to evacuate Americans on 'Fox & Friends.'

FIRST ON FOX: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed to Fox News that it has arrested a lawful permanent U.S. resident for alleged crimes related to Haitian gang activity and immigration fraud. 

""On July 17, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations arrested Pierre Reginald Boulos, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. and citizen of Haiti, for violating the Immigration and Nationality Act contributing to the destabilization of Haiti,"" ICE told Fox.

Boulos is accused of contributing to violence and gang support in Haiti, which ICE says destabilized the country and could have ""serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.""

""The Department of State has determined that certain individuals with U.S. lawful permanent resident status have supported and collaborated with Haitian gang leaders connected to Viv Ansanm, a Haitian foreign terrorist organization,"" a release from ICE stated. ""The United States will not allow individuals to enjoy the benefits of legal status in our country while they are facilitating the actions of violent organizations or supporting criminal terrorist organizations abroad.""

The federal agency also said that Boulos failed to mention his involvement in founding a political party in Haiti called Mouvement pour la Transformation et la Valorisation d'Haiti (MTVAyiti), and that he was referred by the Haitian government's Unit for the Fight Against Corruption for allegedly misusing loans. 

Those omissions, according to ICE, can constitute immigration fraud and justify his deportation.

""These new actions demonstrate the Trump administration's firm commitment to protecting the American people, advancing our national security interests, and promoting regional security and stability,"" said ICE.

Boulos is being held by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations detention in Miami. 

The case was investigated by the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate.

""MTVAyiti is a political movement inspired by the Desalinian ideals of National Unity, Social Justice, National Sovereignty and the rebuilding of the Economy. The movement has its roots in the values of Pride, Greatness, Efficiency and Rationality of King Christophe,"" according to the website of the party founded by Boulos.

The Department of Labor is looking to repeal or rewrite 60 workplace requirements it calls “obsolete.”

If approved, these wide-ranging rollbacks would affect working conditions in mines, minimum wage for home healthcare workers, and the standards on exposures to harmful materials.

“The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, adding that it was the “most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.”

Critics said cutting the rules would put workers at greater risk of harm.

The changes will have to follow the rule-making process in federal agencies, which means these rules cannot be changed immediately. Adding, amending, or ending a rule typically has three stages: finding the authority to make, change, or delete a rule, giving notice of that rule to the public, and agency consideration after public comments. People can voice concerns during the public comment period, or the second stage.

Some of the rollbacks the Trump administration is considering include eliminating the minimum wage for home healthcare workers. The Labor Department is proposing that about 3.7 million workers in home care be paid below the federal minimum wage, $7.25, and be made ineligible for overtime pay depending on state law.

Another proposed change would eliminate protections for immigrant farm workers with H-2A visas. Last year, H-2A visa holders were given more legal protections, including shielding them from retaliation for actions like filing a complaint, testifying, or participating in an investigation, hearing, or proceeding.

“There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A, it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,” Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice, told the Associated Press.

HURRICANE WATCH: TRUMP'S REMADE WEATHER AGENCIES IN THE EYE OF THE DOGE STORM

The administration is also looking to limit the general duty clause, which allows the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when no specific standard is in place to cover a situation.

The rule change would end the agency's ability to apply the clause to penalize employers for “inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election on July 21, 2024, sending shockwaves through a race already upended by the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in, only to be beaten by Trump. As Democrats try to recover, Biden, suffering from cancer, aims to protect what remains of his legacy. This Washington Examiner series “Dropout,” will look at what happened on that day, the aftermath for Biden, and how Harris's future is up in the air. Part 2 looks at Biden's attempts to save his legacy since leaving the White House.Since leaving the White House, former President Joe Biden‘s attempts to shore up his legacy and defend himself against GOP attacks have been met with a mixed reception.

Biden has largely hit back against reports that he and allies hid his declining mental and physical ailments from the public, reexamined his abrupt exit from the 2024 election, and criticized President Donald Trump‘s second administration.

Biden stepped back into the limelight in an interview with the New York Times this month, in which he branded Trump and the Republican-led Congress that is investigating his administration's use of the autopen as “liars.”

“I made every decision,” Biden said when asked about directing staff to use the autopen for clemency actions. 

The former president claimed that the autopen was used because of the wide swath of people granted clemency under broad policy categories, such as reducing nonviolent drug offender sentencing, which he approved.

BIDEN STEPS INTO SPOTLIGHT TO PUSH BACK AGAINST TRUMP AND DEFEND RECORD

In other previous remarks this month, Biden also bemoaned the GOP's effort to undo legislation he signed into law by passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

But whether Biden's comments are helping his case is unclear. 

“I think he needs to defend his honor. I don't think it's a good idea that he's out there every day if that's going to be the case,” said Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist. “Democrats need to look forward, not backward, and it just gives Trump an excuse to look backward.” 

Brad Bannon, another Democratic strategist, said of Biden: “It would be better for him to lay low.”

“Giving an interview to the New York Times was a bad idea,” he continued. “Trump baits Biden into these things because he wants Biden to be in the limelight because he is more unpopular than Trump is, and there are very few people who can claim that distinction.”

The Republican backlash to Biden's comments came quickly. In the days following the New York Times interview, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), the chairman of a Senate investigative subcommittee, told the Washington Examiner he planned to request emails from the Biden administration's final days in office from the National Archives as part of his investigation into the former president's decline.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

The White House also announced a major investigation into the use of the autopen in coordination with the Department of Justice and is already reviewing documents that the National Archives has turned over. 

“As I've said many times from this podium, and the president has said as well, it's incredibly important that we get to the bottom of who really was at the tip of the spear and the decision-making process here in the White House,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a Thursday press briefing. 

“Because former President Biden himself admitted to the New York Times — I understand he never gave interviews when he was here, but now, all of a sudden, he wants to give one — and he said that he did not actually review every single pardon that he signed on his way out the door,” Leavitt continued. “That's incredibly concerning, and I can tell you, it's something this president would never tolerate.”

Anthony Bernal, a former aide to former first lady Jill Biden, appeared before the House Oversight Committee's majority on Wednesday. He invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) has asked several former Biden aides to testify in front of the committee over the autopen use and alleged cover-up of Biden's mental decline. Annie Tomasini, who served as assistant and deputy chief of staff to Biden, and Bernal both appeared in front of the committee this week after being subpoenaed and invoked the Fifth Amendment. Biden's former White House physician, Kevin O'Connor, also invoked the Fifth Amendment during his appearance.

THE LONG HISTORY AND CONTROVERSY OF PRESIDENTIAL AUTOPEN USE

The most recent drama over the autopen investigations mirrors a similar scenario that occurred last month. 

During a Juneteenth celebration, Biden knocked Trump over his efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

“I played a role in changing the names of all the military camps that have slave names,” Biden said. “What are we doing now? Restating those names. Folks, the darkness can hide much but erase nothing.”

The next day, Trump called for a special prosecutor to investigate Biden over the 2020 election. 

“Biden was grossly incompetent, and the 2020 election was a total FRAUD! The evidence is MASSIVE and OVERWHELMING. A Special Prosecutor must be appointed,” he wrote on Truth Social. “This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin! What this Crooked man, and his CORRUPT CRONIES, have done to our Country in 4 years, is grossly indescribable!”

Kaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for former Vice President Kamala Harris and a 2016 Hillary Clinton staffer, defended Biden's right to speak publicly against reporters and critics who have accused him of hiding his mental decline after exiting the 2024 race.

“In fairness, he did agree to step down and so in some sense he has, I think, every right to do that,” Shroff said.

“I was one of the delegates originally for Biden that then switched to Harris as all that happened,” Shroff added. “And I think even folks that made that decision were pretty resentful at the time of how Biden was treated, both in the party and obviously externally. But I think him responding to these types of stories is expected, and I actually don't know that it really does much to move the needle.”

Matt Dole, a Republican strategist, said Biden's more than half-century tenure as a politician likely plays into his desire to establish his credibility on the national stage.

“I understand why he's attacking Republicans; that's what he has done for 60 years now,” Dole said. “But he should be mad at the Democratic Party. The Democrats hung him out to dry twice, once by ignoring the problems with Joe Biden and not dealing with it, and then, when they couldn't ignore it anymore, when not even the national liberal media would cover for them, they hung him out to dry.”

WHO IS ANTHONY BERNAL, JILL BIDEN'S FORMER TOP AIDE WHO WIELDED ‘ENORMOUS' POWER IN WHITE HOUSE?

In May, Biden conducted his first live interview with an American outlet since leaving the White House with the hosts of The View, and he pushed back against claims from journalists accusing his inner circle of shielding him from the public. In particular, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson's book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again may have been the most damning account against Biden.

“They are wrong. There's nothing to sustain that, No. 1,” Biden said on the show. “No. 2, you know, think of what we're left with. We were left with a circumstance where we had an insurrection … not since the Civil War.”

The Democratic Party has remained largely leaderless since Biden's exit from the 2024 race led to Harris taking the mantle before a devastating loss to Trump in November. The party has not unified on whether it's better to embrace a centrist position or lean more into progressive policies to push back against the president and win back the American electorate.

But some Democrats were wary of Biden's comments and called for him to “go away.” 

Cayce Myers, a professor at Virginia Tech's School of Communication, said Biden is in a tough position as Trump and the GOP continue to investigate him.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE: WHAT TO KNOW AS TRUMP ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PREDECESSOR

“It's a catch-22 for Biden because if he doesn't respond or say anything about his legacy, that fuels this narrative about his inability to function and communicate, and it calls into question his cognitive abilities,” Myers said. “On the other hand, it does give fodder for the Republican Party and for President Trump, and they make his statements into political talking points that they can repackage for 2026 and beyond.” 

Former President Barack Obama was also met with criticism from Democrats angered over his comments at a New Jersey fundraiser calling for his party members to “toughen up.” 

“Are people mad at Obama for speaking up? Yes, some of them are,” Shroff said. “But, you know that always happens.”

“We're still rehashing Bernie versus Hillary 2016. We're still rehashing so many things. The idea that the guy who was just president five seconds ago can't speak up, I think, is a little silly,” he also said.

EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: TRUMP TELLS SALENA ZITO HE IS BULLISH ON THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA

Yet, Biden's attempts to have his perspective be the definitive narrative of his presidency will likely be unsuccessful.

“Ultimately, the historians and the political pundits will define his legacy regardless of what he says,” Myers said. “And presidential legacy is not something that's an immediate item; it evolves. And sometimes the legacy does not materialize until decades later. And so I think that while it is probably self-fulfilling in some respects to defend his administration, I don't know, long term, what effect that has, if anything.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced on Tuesday he would meet with Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information about the late sex offender's case.

“President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. If [Ghislaine] Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,” Blanche said in a statement. “I anticipate meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days. Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government. That changes now.”

In 2022, Maxwell was found guilty of child sex trafficking and other crimes. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. 

Her attorney, David Oscar Markus, confirmed the meeting, telling CNN, “I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.”

Maxwell's attorneys have appeared to ask President Donald Trump to intervene in her case. Her lawyers argued she should not have been prosecuted because of a plea deal Epstein struck in Florida in 2008 with then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Alex Acosta, who later served in the first Trump administration.

Her attorney recently said of Trump, “He's the ultimate deal-maker — and I'm sure he'd agree that when the United States gives its word, it should keep it. With all the talk about who's being prosecuted and who isn't, it's especially unfair that Ghislaine Maxwell remains in prison based on a promise the government made and broke.”

The Trump administration has been scrambling over the Epstein files for over two weeks after the Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo that said Epstein did not have a client list and that he died in jail by suicide in 2019. Blanche concurred in his statement that the joint memo “remains as accurate today as it was when it was written.”

MAGA ANGER OVER EPSTEIN FILES GIVES TRUMP LIMITED OPTIONS TO QUELL DIVISIONS

The memo has sparked intense backlash from Trump supporters against high-ranking members of his administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who speculated for years about Epstein's death and his alleged client list.

On Blanche's meeting with Maxwell, Patel said, “Get it.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

Republican infighting over the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files is causing delays in the House of Representatives, putting key votes at a standstill as the Rules Committee is on track to cancel a meeting meant to set the agenda for the week.

The Rules Committee was expected to meet on Monday evening to vote on procedural measures that would advance a slate of legislation, including the Stop Illegal Entry Act, PERMIT Act, and resolutions rescinding several Biden-era rulings.

However, the committee suspended the meeting indefinitely as it continues to discuss options for Epstein-related measures. Conservatives are calling on the Trump administration to release all information about the disgraced and since-deceased financier. 

A source familiar with deliberations told the Washington Examiner that the committee is in “recess subject to the call of the chair,” as several members of the panel told reporters that the committee's huddle is canceled.

Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), who sits on the Rules panel, told reporters he didn't think the committee would report out a rule governing consideration of legislation on the House floor at all this week. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), ranking member of the committee, told multiple outlets that “we're done.” 

“Not reporting out a rule, we're done for the night, we're done for the week … There's some issues going on within the Republican conference, I think around the Epstein stuff, that they can't seem to get under control,” McGovern told The Hill. He added that the House would probably instead vote only on legislation that would not be subject to a rule, which would mean only “suspension” bills that can pass with bipartisan support.

Norman blamed Democrats for the holdup, stating he anticipated they would do the same thing they did last week and offer up amendments to bring an Epstein-related resolution sponsored by Reps. Thomas Massie (R-KY) and Ro Khanna (D-CA) to the floor.

“They want to make Epstein — We're all for transparency,” Norman said. “We're going to do that. But what they want to do is grandstand. They said they will. They'll be there all night. We'll be there all night.”

Norman added that he thinks the right course of action is to wait until the discharge petition for Massie and Khanna's bill “ripens,' after the August recess, and the resolution can come to the floor.

“I think it will give the administration, I think it will give [Attorney General Pam] Bondi the time to get everything together and put it out there,” Norman said when asked what will happen over the next month, where lawmakers won't be in town and will be back home in their districts. 

“They're going to have to put it out. It's not going away, nor should it,” Norman added.

This is the second week in a row that House Republicans have felt the ramifications of the Epstein files, after the Department of Justice released a memo that stated there was no “client list” nor any more information to provide, despite the president and his Cabinet members previously stating the opposite.

This angered Trump's “Make America Great Again,” or MAGA base, particularly among conservative influencers who credited their support for the president's victory in the 2024 election.

Democrats took advantage of this opportunity, calling up votes in the Rules Committee last week and messaging that they were putting Republicans on record for voting against the files' release. This delayed a vote on a bill to codify cuts identified by the Department of Government Efficiency, known as a rescissions package, that cut billions in funding to public broadcasting and foreign aid.

Only one Republican, Norman, voted in favor of an amendment from Khanna that would release the files. 

The remaining GOP lawmakers on the panel expressed anger with Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) that leadership wasn't coming up with a solution to the Epstein files debacle, upset that it made them take potentially politically damaging votes at a time when the Republican majority is precarious at best.

The GOP eventually came up with a non-binding resolution calling for the release of more files, which advanced out of the Rules Committee last Thursday. However, there is no set date for bringing the resolution to the floor.

Johnson told reporters earlier on Monday that the House would not vote on the non-binding resolution until after the August recess, which begins after votes conclude this Thursday. Instead, he said, he thinks the administration should have space to decide how to proceed.

“Here's what I would say about the Epstein files: There is no daylight between the House Republicans, the House, and the president on maximum transparency,” Johnson said. “He has said that he wants all the credible files related to Epstein to be released. He's asked the attorney general to request the grand jury files of the court. All of that is in process right now.”

“My belief is we need the administration to have the space to do what it is doing, and if further congressional action is necessary or appropriate, then we'll look at that,” he added. “But I don't think we're at that point right now because we agree with the president.”

The speaker appeared to confirm that Rules would be out for the remainder of the week, telling reporters later Monday evening that the House won't adopt a rule because he wanted to prevent Democrats' “political games” and “there was nothing else that was time-sensitive this week we needed to handle by the way of a rule.”“We already had suspension votes scheduled every day this week, we have lots of work with appropriations, and a lot of committees doing very important stuff,” the speaker said, adding that he will not cancel votes for the rest of the week.“We're not sending anybody home, they're staying here,” Johnson continued.

Massie told reporters after the Rules Committee was suspended indefinitely that he thinks the speaker is “scared” and “torn.”

“I think he's terrified,” Massie said. “I think, well, I mean, 80% of MAGA want these files released. They were promised this, they expected this, and it's not happening. But at the same time, [Johnson] feels an allegiance to President Trump, who's gone against the MAGA base on this.”

“I think the right thing to do would be just leave it up to the people's House, let us vote on whether to release these files or not,” Massie added. “And I hope he does not try to use some kind of parliamentary procedure to subvert or hide the release of these files.”

Massie carried a binder on Monday called “The Epstein Files: Phase 2” with his and Khanna's names on it, noting that he expects his discharge petition to ripen after August recess. The binder was in reference to the “Phase 1” binders Attorney General Pam Bondi gave MAGA influencers earlier this year.

Norman said he won't sign on to the discharge petition, but as of now, he'd consider voting for the Massie-Khanna bill. 

“Unless something else comes up, I will — the Massie resolution is a good solution,” Norman said. “I hate [that] the Democrats are using it because, again, they waited four years [on the files] and didn't do anything.”

Massie and Khanna need 218 signatures on the discharge petition to force a floor vote on their bill. If all Democrats sign on to it and all of the GOP co-sponsors add their names, it would put leadership in a tight spot. Republican leaders are hoping the fervor surrounding the files will die down by then, but Massie thinks it's only going to increase from here.

“There are a lot of people here in the swamp who think that, ‘Oh, well, if we spend five weeks on vacation, the pressure for this will dissipate.' I don't think it's going to dissipate,” Massie said. “I think it's going to build. Because the American people are still getting up, going to work, paying taxes, and wondering where these files are.”

If Republicans aren't careful, it could carry into the 2026 midterm elections, where Republicans are defending a two-seat majority as of now, after former Rep. Mark Green's retirement. 

JOHNSON SAYS NO HOUSE VOTE ON EPSTEIN FILE RELEASE BEFORE AUGUST RECESS

Massie said he thinks it will follow “each individual Republican” next November if nothing is done about the files.

“Did you support transparency and justice, or did you come up here, get elected, and fall into the swamp? Did you decide that getting reelected was more important than exposing a pedophilia ring and a blackmail ring? If you did, then maybe you shouldn't be coming back, and that'll be a referendum in every primary, in every general election in the United States in 2026,” the Kentucky Republican said.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump is directing his fury at the press as he tries to quiet the furor from his base over his administration's failure to release the Jeffrey Epstein files despite pledges to do so. 

Trump filed a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal over its report that the president's name was on a 2003 birthday card to the convicted sex offender that included a suggestive drawing.

After a couple of weeks of the party disagreeing over the administration's handling of the Epstein files, the base could begin to unite again over a common denominator — the media is to blame. As the administration has searched for ways to squash the issue, painting Epstein drama as another “witch hunt” from the “Deep State” has resonated with the base.

“Casting this as the latest chapter in the witch hunt to frame Trump is really the only play Trumpworld has, especially heading into the midterms [elections] when Trump won't be on the ballot,” Republican strategist Dennis Lennox told the Washington Examiner. 

“Republicans need these MAGA base voters to show up, which is a challenge because so many of them are low-propensity voters whose loyalty is with Trump. The easiest way to energize them heading into 2026 is [to] make this a Russia hoax 2.0,” he added.

As Trump fights the press, his administration is also releasing more information on the intelligence that helped underpin a federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Tulsi Gabbard, who heads the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence, claimed that former President Barack Obama and his national security officials “manufactured and politicized intelligence” to launch a “yearslong coup against President Trump.”

Trump's base has long accused the media and the Democratic Party of unjustly coming after the president, leading to the strong loyalty many of his supporters show. Former adviser to Trump, Steve Bannon, spoke out on the issue to The Washington Post, claiming the saga is a conspiracy against the president, as even some of his own party has taken a stance against him.

“MAGA is now united, because they can see there's a common enemy. They see exactly what the reality is — it's the Deep State, with their media partners, led by Murdoch, that's out to destroy Trump,” Bannon told the outlet. “And that's been obvious from the beginning.”

The lawsuit filed in Miami claims defamation and names Rupert Murdoch, Dow Jones, News Corp, its Chief Executive Robert Thomson, and two Wall Street Journal reporters as defendants. The president slammed the story and denied his involvement with the birthday card. 

The White House confirmed Monday that the Wall Street Journal will not be part of its press pool to Scotland following the story's publication. 

“Thirteen diverse outlets will participate in the press pool to cover the President's trip to Scotland,” White House press secretary Karolina Leavitt told reporters. “Due to the Wall Street Journal's fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board. Every news organization in the entire world wishes to cover President Trump, and the White House has taken significant steps to include as many voices as possible.” 

This comes after the White House decided in February to hand-select reporters in the press pool covering the president. This group of reporters is in charge of relaying Trump's day-to-day activities to the public. This decision shifted the long-standing precedent of the White House Correspondents' Association determining the daily pool, as the administration has pursued efforts to push back on traditional media sources. 

Democrats and Republicans have been pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the long-awaited Epstein files after the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigations released a two-page memo earlier this month stating there is no evidence Epstein blackmailed people or kept a “client list,” reiterating he died by suicide, a conclusion that has resulted in mounting backlash from Trump's MAGA base. 

A handful of Republicans joined Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) last week in his fight to force a full release of the files through a discharge petition in the House. Massie announced the Epstein Files Transparency Act with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) to force a vote on the complete release of government files related to the convicted sex offender.

Democrats have continuously leaned into the issue to push back against the president, as the GOP holds a trifecta in Washington, while also trying to get ahead in the fight to flip back the House in the midterm elections.

Democrats on the House Rules Committee offered multiple amendments last week relating to Epstein to force the Republicans on the committee to vote against the release on record. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) eventually filed a rule that passed through committee, which consisted of non-binding language for the release of the files. 

House GOP leadership does not plan on bringing the Epstein bill to the floor this week as Congress heads for its monthlong recess Friday, as Johnson told reporters he wants to give the administration “space” to deal with the issue. 

As the White House aims to target traditional media for the uproar, Theo Von, a new media persona who has supported the president, called for a vote on Massie's bill Monday, in response to a post on X regarding the speaker not putting an Epstein bill on the floor.

Here are two truths: Louisiana is an unapologetically pro-energy state, and President Donald Trump isn't easily fooled. Taken together, those facts underscore the desperate absurdity of accusations that Louisiana's efforts to hold energy giant Chevron accountable for its decadeslong pollution of our state's coastal wetlands are somehow inconsistent with the president's energy independence agenda. 

For more than a century, our people have supported exploration, production, and refining oil and gas. As Louisiana's solicitor general and now attorney general, I've led the nation in fighting the Biden administration's wrong-headed approach to energy policy. 

Louisiana successfully blocked the moratorium on oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf, opening the door for the only lease sale conducted during those four misspent years. We blocked attacks on pipelines, overzealous permitting rules, a ban on liquefied natural gas exports, the methane rule, and many other Biden administration efforts to destroy America's energy independence and bankrupt the oil and gas industry. This is what makes the recent disingenuous attacks by Chevron consultants, such as former U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, so unbelievable. 

In welcoming oil and gas companies to our state, we ask for compliance with our laws and regulations and good-faith efforts to maintain our environment. Agriculture, fishing, tourism, and other industries depend on healthy wetlands, and coastal communities rely on a strong, storm-resistant coastline. Chevron, however, has been trying to avoid accountability for the damage it has caused to our coastal wetlands.

The company is taking a new tack of hoodwinking Trump into defending its illegal actions by presenting our legal action as the latest creative legal theory intended to attack the fossil fuel industry, rather than what it is: a run-of-the-mill pollution case requiring accountability. 

Chevron's strategy is flawed for two reasons: its conduct is indefensible, which is why it refuses to talk about facts, and these lawsuits complement rather than conflict with Trump's energy policy goals. 

Between the 1940s and 1980s, Texaco, eventually purchased by Chevron in 2001, engaged in exploration and production activities and discharged approximately 4 billion gallons of toxic wastewater into the marsh in Delacroix. For reference, that amount exceeds 20 times the volume of oil discharged by the BP Deepwater Horizon blowout, in an area much, much smaller. This was an illegal discharge under the then-applicable rules and regulations. 

Texaco's internal documents show the company knew there were safer alternatives, including the industry-standard disposable wells it was using nearby. The dumping continued until the late 1980s while Texaco lied to regulatory authorities about its activities, including dates of discharge, volumes, and lab data.

Texaco flatly ignored the permitting regime established under Louisiana's State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, and it proved its liability by discharging wastewater after the act's Sept. 20, 1980, effective date. In short, dumping 4 billion gallons of toxic waste for four decades into our marsh was irresponsible and illegal.

Perhaps the most insidious aspect of Chevron's defense is its communications strategy that seeks to tie Louisiana's efforts with the radical climate industry, which is determined to extort the fossil fuel industry using any and all means. Yet this case is not a frivolous “nuisance” suit vaguely asserting climate change as damage — the kind common in Democratic states and localities. This case involves concrete damage caused by concrete actions resulting in the senseless poisoning of vital habitat that protects Louisiana communities. 

The Plaquemines Parish jury's award of $645 million reflects thoughtful deliberation, not “hometown” justice. The jury verdict did not hold Chevron accountable for damage it did not cause; Louisianans understand how much erosion is caused by hydrology changes or hurricanes. However, dumping 4 billion gallons of toxic waste over four decades has an effect. Lying about it has a different effect, eroding the trust between communities and companies and in the rule of law. 

TRUMP BULLISH ON THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA AT PITTSBURGH SUMMIT

Chevron lost my sympathy when the facts disproved its case. It lied about Texaco's conduct being lawful, the duration of its unlawful activity, and the breadth of its unlawful activity. Quite simply, Chevron chose profits over people and the law, and it continues to do so every day it refuses accountability for its actions. This is not controversial. 

I will continue to champion Trump's energy policies. I will also continue to honor my obligation to uphold the rule of law. Chevron should step up, accept the responsibility it legally owes to Louisiana, and join us in moving the president's and Louisiana's energy agenda forward. They have always been welcome at our table.

The president doesn't think the Federal Reserve chair is bad at his job. He objects to the job itself.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Donald Trump has been bullying Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell—calling him “too late,” insulting his intelligence, and trying to gin up a case that Powell spent too much on renovations of the agency's headquarters as a pretext for firing him. The New York Times recently observed that the two men have a “toxic relationship,” which is true, as far as it goes.

But the actual reason for the president's hostility is neither alleged cost overruns nor Powell's ability to manage the business cycle. Trump doesn't think Powell is bad at his job. He objects to the job itself.

The Federal Reserve's assignment is to steward the long-term interests of the U.S. economy—even at the occasional expense of short-term pain—by balancing the twin objectives of suppressing inflation and managing the unemployment rate. Trump, however, believes that the Fed's objective should be to speed up the economy under Republican administrations and slow it down under Democratic ones. To the extent that the central bank balances unemployment and inflation, he would like to see the pain of high unemployment shifted onto Democratic administrations so that Republican ones can benefit from rapid economic growth.

Trump's philosophy on monetary policy is easy to define because he has been publicly vilifying the Fed for at least a decade and a half. His opinions shift, but they shift predictably between two forms, with no relationship to economic circumstances. If the president is a Democrat, Trump complains that interest rates are too low. If the president is a Republican, he complains that they're too high.

David Frum: Trump needs someone to blame

During the Obama years, the U.S. economy featured low inflation and elevated unemployment as it recovered from the Great Recession. Trump nonetheless spent that time complaining about low interest rates. “The Fed's reckless monetary policies will cause problems in the years to come,” he tweeted in 2011. “The Fed has to be reined in or we will soon be Greece.” Five years later, with inflation still below target and the job market still recovering, he was still at it. “They're keeping the rates down so that everything else doesn't go down,” Trump complained in 2016. “We have a very false economy.”

Then Trump became president, and abruptly reversed his position. “I do like a low-interest-rate policy, I must be honest with you,” he told The Wall Street Journal in April 2017. As the Federal Reserve began raising rates, which it generally does when the economy is running hot, Trump denounced those moves. He pushed repeatedly for lower rates, even when the economy was at its peak. “I think they should drop rates and get rid of quantitative tightening,” he said in 2019. “You would see a rocket ship.”

At that time, rates were historically low. That changed after the pandemic sent prices soaring in 2021. Did Trump push back on the Fed's decision to raise rates to combat inflation? Of course not, because Joe Biden was now president. Last October, Trump denounced Powell for easing interest rates by half a percentage point. “It was too big a cut, and everyone knows that was a political maneuver that they tried to do before the election,” he claimed. Almost immediately after winning his second term, however, he resumed his public drumbeat for cheaper money, a demand he has now backed with the threat of firing Powell.

Whether Trump will follow through on that threat remains unclear, as does whether the courts would allow him to. Even if Trump eventually installs a more pliant figure in Powell's place (his term as Fed chair expires next year), experts question whether that would actually lead to reduced interest rates. If the Fed loses credibility in the market, borrowing costs could paradoxically get even higher.

Annie Lowrey: Trump is flirting with economic disaster

Trump does not appear to have any master plan for how the Fed should function in a world in which he has compromised its independence. For one thing, he doesn't believe that independence is possible. Laced through his commentary about the Fed over the years is a belief that its commitment to apolitical economic stewardship is a facade hiding naked partisanship. “Janet Yellen is highly political, and she's not raising rates for a very specific reason,” he said a decade ago: “because Obama told her not to, because he wants to be out playing golf in a year from now and he wants to be doing other things, and he doesn't want to see a big bubble burst during his administration.”

Trump offered the same diagnosis when Powell was preparing to cut rates last year. “I think he's political,” he told Fox News. “I think he's going to do something to probably help the Democrats, I think, if he lowers interest rates.”

Just as Trump is convinced that every president has secretly deployed the Justice Department for their own partisan ends, he believes that monetary policy is nothing but a way to win elections. Trying to advance the national interest, rather than some venal end goal, is a foreign concept. Economic analysts are now trying to predict what would happen under a regime in which the Fed chair is merely following the president's short-term whims. Trump's convictions begin with the premise that this is the world that has always existed.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

To survive a heating planet, humans need shade—lots of it.

Every year, heat takes more lives than floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes combined. The fatalities can sometimes go unnoticed, perhaps because the danger is invisible: There's no twister that uproots a neighborhood and no flood that sucks it underwater, nor billions of dollars in property damage. Instead, heat's imprint is seen in empty streets, work slowdowns, cognitive decline, and hospital bills. When autumn arrives and temperatures relent, heat leaves no discernable trace.

The Earth is getting hotter. In many places on the planet, summer is already two to three weeks longer than in the 1950s. By the end of the century, the warm season in the United States could last six months, and extreme temperatures could force us to spend much of it indoors. Supercharged heat waves will settle over cities for weeks at a time and cause many people to die. Others will suffer heart attacks, kidney disease, and brain damage. What we now call winter will be a brief, two-month interregnum that feels more like spring.

Reducing society's consumption of fossil fuels is necessary for preventing worse-yet climate change. But even if every single power source becomes a renewable one and we stop emitting carbon, the planet's surface won't start cooling. The temperature will continue to rise for a few years before gradually leveling off. It will take “many, many centuries,” NASA estimates, to end the global-greenhouse effect. It is a sobering truth that cutting emissions isn't enough. We also need to figure out how to live on a new Earth.

What if the key to that life is older than civilization itself? We need to manage heat to live. And we have an effective and democratic way of doing it: shade.

Read: Shade will make or break American cities

Shade makes long waits for the bus more comfortable. Shade helps keep farmworkers safe when they harvest fruits and vegetables under an unforgiving sun. And shade cools urban environments, improving residents' chance of surviving blazing summers.

“We all know that cities are cooler when we have shade, but we're not really planning for it,” V. Kelly Turner, an urban-planning and geography professor at UCLA, said on CNN. “In the future, that's something that cities are going to need to do, is intentionally think about: What does shade infrastructure look like?”

Turner believes that shade could be America's next long-term investment in public health. What safe drinking water and clean air were to the 20th century, shade could be to the climate-changed 21st. Scientific models bear her out. If we can get emissions under control and put the planet on a path to moderate warming, then by 2050, getting out of the sun could be the difference between unsafe heat and a livable environment.

One obvious way the planet can get more shade is more trees. We evolved in forests, and some of our oldest myths and stories unfold under their canopies. Hippocrates taught medicine under a plane tree, and Ovid found bittersweet beauty in a laurel's leaves. The Mesopotamian goddess Inanna slept under a miraculous poplar whose shadow never moved, and Buddha found enlightenment by meditating under a ficus tree. Christian and Muslim heavens alike are cooled by trees' perpetual shade.

Tree shade is where public space was born and civic identities are forged. In hot climates, people naturally prefer to confer, conduct commerce, and gossip out of the sun's permanent glare. They spend far more time in shady parks or temple courtyards than in sunny ones. They linger and relax, and that engenders more interactions, and possibly even stimulates social cohesion. It's true in arid cities, humid regions, and even temperate zones with short summers. People want to be in shade. They muse longer, pray more peacefully, and find strength to walk farther.

Read: How climate change is killing cities

Perhaps because we've become so adept at cooling inside spaces with air conditioning, we've forgotten the importance of cooling outside spaces, too. There is no technology that cools the outdoors as effectively as a tree. These communal parasols are also misting machines that dissipate heat. It's hard to feel that effect under one or two of them, but get enough trees together and an urban summer can be as fresh as a rural spring, a feat with major implications for energy use and public health.

Where tree-planting isn't viable, cities must invest in other types of public infrastructure that cast shade. Throughout Los Angeles, on streets that are too cramped and paved over to support green canopies, the preferred protections aren't arboreal but artificial, such as the pop-up tents of taqueros and the cheerful rainbow umbrellas of fruit vendors. In Phoenix, a desert city that struggles to nourish an urban forest, common tools include sidewalk screens, frilly metal filters, and soaring photovoltaic canopies. These interventions are more effective than many might expect. Ariane Middel, an Arizona State University urban-climate researcher who runs the school's Sensable Heatscapes and Digital Environments (SHaDE) Lab, surveyed students and staff as they strolled through the shadows that solar panels cast on a Tempe campus thoroughfare. More than any change in ambient temperature, humidity, or wind, the mere presence of shade was the only significant predictor of outdoor comfort.

Shade's effectiveness is a function of physics. It depends on the material properties of the sun-blocking objects that cast it—how they reflect, absorb, and transmit different wavelengths of energy in sunlight. It depends on the intensity of that light and the extent of the shade thrown. (A telephone pole that casts a perfect shadow on your body does nothing to stop the solar heating of the surfaces around you.) And it depends on the biology of the person who receives it. Middel has come as close as anyone to adding up all these factors. She praises humble umbrellas and plastic sails, because their shade feels like taking 30 degrees off the afternoon sun, which is about as good as shade cast by a tree. Ultimately, she finds that a city itself can offer the most relief in the shadows of arcaded sidewalks and looming skyscrapers.

The Greek philosopher Onesicritus taught that shade stunts growth, a belief that presaged a modern fixation on the healthiness of sunlight. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, doctors and public-health advocates feared that darkness itself caused the poor health of urban slum-dwellers. It was a vector of disease, where contagions bred and spread, and the murkiness also encouraged licentiousness and other urban vices. Some literally believed sunlight was the best disinfectant. Solar codes were written into urban plans, and new materials and technologies allowed architects to design brighter buildings flooded with natural light.

Read: America's climate boomtowns are waiting

Now we're beginning to see how a solar fetish may be maladaptive. In New York, a recent summer saw a throng of neighborhood activists protest the construction of a 16-story office tower, with signs to Save Our Light. They did this while huddling in the shadow of another building.

As intense heat bears down, we have to see shade as a basic human right. We have forgotten that shade is a natural resource. We don't grasp its importance, and we don't appreciate its promise for a better future. Loggers and farmers cut down forests, forcing animals to flee and land to turn fallow. Engineers ignore time-honored methods of keeping out heat, locking us into mechanical cooling systems that fail during blackouts. And urban planners denude shady parks and pave neighborhoods with heat-sucking roads, only to drive us mad with the infernal conditions. But shade is a path to a better future—if we just learn to value it again, and design for it in the places we live.

This isn't the typical tug-of-war of federalism.

Last month, President Donald Trump's administration scrapped a long-standing Texas law that provided access to financial aid for “Dreamers”—undocumented immigrants, brought into this country as children, who grew up here, graduated from local high schools, and are committed to becoming permanent residents. The administration's allies tried and failed to persuade the state legislature, which is controlled by Republicans, to repeal the law, which has had nearly a quarter century of bipartisan support. So the administration made an end run around Texas's democratic process: The Department of Justice hatched a plan with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton to kill the law, filing a joint motion that asked a federal court to declare the Texas Dream Act unconstitutional. A judge approved the motion the very same day. The whole process took just six hours. Whatever one's views are on Dreamer policy, the fact is that this maneuver went against the will of the people of Texas.

The organization I lead, Democracy Forward, has, along with several other groups, filed a motion to defend the law. Texans deserve to have the constitutionality of their Dream Act judged in court, not killed off via a collaboration between the president and the state attorney general. And even more alarming than the Trump administration's dismantling of this law is that it's part of a broader effort to short-circuit democracy at the state level.

State-level democracy is essential to America's federalist system. During another time in U.S. history when a majority of the Supreme Court was imposing barriers to the public's ability to self-govern, Justice Louis D. Brandeis famously observed, “It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country.” Later, Justice William Brennan argued that states have the “power to impose higher standards” under state law “than is required under the Federal Constitution.” Throughout America's long history, state-level innovations have pushed the country forward: Some states abolished slavery long before the Civil War, granted women the right to vote before the Nineteenth Amendment was adopted, and legalized marriage equality years before the Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling.

Of course, states have not always been on the side of human freedom and progress. Appeals to “states' rights” have served as rallying cries for enslavers, segregationists, and others seeking to deny the rights of people and communities since the nation's founding. “No state,” the Fourteenth Amendment proclaimed after the Civil War, shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” When America's system of government works as it should, the federal government steps in to prevent states from undermining human freedom.

David Frum: The courts won't save democracy from Trump

That's what America saw in 1957, when President Dwight Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard to implement a Supreme Court ruling to desegregate schools; the governor, an avowed segregationist, had refused to comply. President John F. Kennedy similarly federalized the Alabama National Guard to carry out desegregation orders at the University of Alabama, again over the objection of a pro-segregation governor.

Now the president and his political appointees, not a state's governor, are ignoring federal-court orders. In April, a federal court found that the government had exhibited “a willful disregard for its Order” that planes carrying migrants who had been denied basic due process be turned around until the court could hear the migrants' case. (Democracy Forward and the ACLU represent the migrants in that matter.) Two months later, in early June, Trump federalized the California National Guard and deployed active-duty Marines to Los Angeles without the approval of Governor Gavin Newsom, who argued that local law enforcement was fully capable of managing anti-ICE protests. Trump's move was a federal flex that made a mockery of state sovereignty and democracy, and created more chaos than it solved. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said that what she saw in a local park “looked like a city under siege, under armed occupation.”

To justify its actions in California, the administration invoked Eisenhower's 1957 move to enforce federal-court orders on civil rights. Yet Trump's actions aim for the opposite of Eisenhower's. Instead of using federal power to protect people's rights, Trump is misusing federal power to undermine them. That is democracy upside down.

Similarly, when Maine insisted that it would defend transgender athletes' participation on women's college-sports teams, the president brazenly interfered. Maine was following the law as it argued was set forth in Title IX and the state's Human Rights Act, but Trump sought to force a new interpretation of the federal law through executive actions, including a February order. That month, Trump pronounced, “We are the federal law,” at which point the administration began a process to cut off funding to Maine's public-school meal programs as punishment—funds appropriated by Congress to help children in need. “See you in court,” Maine Governor Janet Mills told the president. She did, and Maine won.

The administration has also attempted to usurp the power that the Constitution provides both Congress and the states. Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution mandates that only states and Congress can make or alter the “times, places, and manner” of holding federal elections. Ignoring that, Trump, in an executive order, has sought to impose federal time, place, and manner requirements that create barriers to the ballot box. Much of this executive order has been blocked by two federal courts in response to litigation filed by 19 states, among other parties. One federal judge found that the requirements Trump is seeking to impose would create time-consuming burdens on states and could chill voter participation— “the antithesis of Congress's purpose in enacting” federal election laws. (The Trump administration is also pressuring Texas Republicans to redraw congressional districts in the middle of the decade, outside the normal cycle, to skew the midterm elections.)

Adam Serwer: Trump is wearing America down

The Trump administration has called lawsuits filed against its actions “frivolous” and “vexatious.” But as with so many of Trump's attacks, this is really a confession. The Texas ploy is just one of many ways the administration is undercutting the checks and balances in the U.S. constitutional system. The administration has eviscerated agencies and programs created by Congress, attacked judges and the legal profession as a whole, and attempted to stifle a free and open press through intimidation tactics. It's all in keeping with a theme: To empower one man, you need to disempower everyone else, everywhere else—including in states where laws are counter to the president's political agenda.

What's happening in Texas, California, Maine, and other states goes beyond normal political disagreements or turf spats. This isn't the typical tug-of-war of federalism. The Trump administration is undermining foundational democratic principles and turning what are supposed to be “laboratories of democracy” into laboratories of repression—something that should have no place in a nation founded on the promise of human freedom and the pursuit of happiness.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A new novel challenges sentimental ideas about lifelong bonds.

The English novelist E. M. Forster believed that people know the characters in the novels they read better than they know one another. In fiction, he argued, a character's true nature and deepest secrets are plainly available, whereas “mutual secrecy” is “one of the conditions of life upon this globe.” This idea is strikingly isolating. Can it possibly be true?

By the end of Stephanie Wambugu's debut novel, Lonely Crowds, I could see where Forster was coming from. Following the decades-long convolutions of an intense and volatile friendship between two women, Ruth and Maria, Lonely Crowds poses similar questions about the limits of personal relationships. As the girls grow older and their unhealthy childhood patterns repeat in adulthood, their friendship begins to seem more dangerous than idyllic. Perhaps the most prevailing myth about childhood friends is that they know each other completely and love each other best. Wambugu counters such sentimentalism by revealing the many secrets and misunderstandings at the core of Ruth and Maria's friendship. In their world, a lifelong bond is not a comfort but a liability.

Lonely Crowds begins in the contemporary present with Ruth, as an adult, seeming very lost at her own birthday party. As the novel's title suggests, a crowd full of people can be a remarkably lonely place. “That Maria wasn't here at the party was a source of great distress,” Ruth thinks, blowing out the candles. Ruth recalls that when she met Maria years ago, “I learned that without an obsession life was impossible to live. I'd forgotten. Now, I remembered.” Despite her success as an art professor and painter, Ruth feels adrift and bitter. She thinks she sees Maria everywhere. As she falls asleep the night after her party, she recollects her history with Maria, starting from the beginning.

Ruth's obsession with Maria sparks from their first encounter, in a uniform shop for the Catholic school where they will soon be classmates. The scene is a small spectacle of shame: Ruth watches while Maria's aunt tries to buy a uniform for Maria on layaway, promising to pay when her disability check comes through. The owner refuses and castigates Maria's aunt in front of a long line of customers, throwing the two of them out of the store. As they leave, Ruth makes eye contact, and Maria “looked back at me as she crossed the threshold, wide black eyes, perfect. Then she was gone. I felt doomed.” Ruth decides she will befriend the girl at her new school and spends the rest of the summer besotted with the idea.

Read: The Ghosts of Wannsee

Maria and Ruth meet again on the first day of third grade at Our Lady in Providence, Rhode Island, where the two are the only Black girls in their class. They're the same age, but to Ruth, Maria seems much older and wiser. During their first real conversation at school, Maria brags about her pearl earrings, a gift from a teacher, offering to let Ruth borrow them if she's careful. “Oh, I'm not careful,” Ruth responds. “I'm careless.” Her utterly honest response demonstrates Wambugu's knack for capturing the humor of childish intransigence on the page. But the scene also looms large for young Ruth: Maria's earrings represent the mysterious world of adults, one that Ruth is hungry to learn more about. That the gift is inappropriate simply does not register for her.

Ruth is an only child, sheltered by her parents, who are Kenyan immigrants to a working-class neighborhood in Pawtucket, outside of Providence. Her mother values hard work and minding one's own business, while her father is “lonely, mercurial, romantic,” often changing jobs and exacerbating marital tensions. Ruth's upbringing is strict but stable. Maria lives with her aunt, who is severely bipolar, after her mother's death by suicide.  The girls' first playdate sets the stage for the uneven dynamic they'll share for the rest of their friendship. After inviting Maria home from school with her, Ruth reminds herself to “come across as measured, impassive, and confident.” By the end of supper, Maria's politeness and intelligence have charmed Ruth's parents. But the success of the evening is punctured when Maria, as she is leaving, turns around to ask Ruth, “What's your name again?”

Although Ruth never tells the reader how she feels about the question, nor how she responds, the moment feels pivotal, capturing how Ruth's earnestness and longing are so often met with coolness, even rejection. But she soon wins Maria over, and eventually Maria comes to be a part of Ruth's family. Like her biblical namesake, Ruth is loyal and steadfast to her friend, while Maria is independent and creative, often controlling the narrative of their relationship and even determining their future trajectories: Maria is an extrovert, so Ruth must be an introvert. Maria is the type to never settle down, while Ruth is going to get married. Ruth always looks to Maria for advice and approval, and Maria's responses to her vary among love, tolerance, and disgust. Reading scene after scene in which Ruth is so passive can be frustrating. She is content to be molded by Maria, unaware of the danger: She is becoming a person who knows herself only in relation to her friend.

When Maria decides she wants to be an artist in New York, the girls both apply to and get into Bard College, where Ruth takes up painting and Maria studies film. Maria sees this moment as her great escape from bleak Pawtucket, while Ruth worries that she, too, is part of the past that her friend wants to leave behind. Maria is clear about one thing. “When we go to school, we have to go our own way,” she tells Ruth. “We don't have to be together all the time. We still can be close and be … separate.”

In college, Ruth and Maria do pursue different paths and new relationships. The biggest test of their friendship comes when they move to New York City after graduation and both try to make it in the art world of the 1990s. Their childhood competitiveness grows into an adult professional envy: Where Maria meets easy success as a filmmaker, Ruth's path is more complicated, riddled with self-doubt and jealousy. Like a piece of cherished childhood clothing, their friendship appears more and more ill-fitting as time passes. The two grow apart, not because they change, but because they do not; they are stuck in the same dynamics, unable to find new ways to connect to each other.

Read: A film that captures a ‘friend breakup'

As the novel progresses, Ruth often stops existing on the page, overtaken by her endless loops of fixation on the thoughts and feelings of others. In part because the reader has no insight into  Maria's perspective, Ruth's narrative voice makes it hard to discern what either woman gets from their friendship, or even the extent to which they know each other at all. I don't believe that Maria enjoys Ruth's overbearing attention, or that Ruth likes being consistently rejected by Maria. After a final confrontation, the women appear to accept their incompatibility, and their friendship becomes something more distant. But even when Ruth gets a prestigious fellowship at Bard and moves upstate with her new husband, her obsession with Maria never really disappears; it just morphs.

If Ruth never stands up to Maria, it's because nothing is worth the risk of losing her. When they're teenagers, Maria asks Ruth to throw away the many portraits that Ruth painted of her; Ruth complies. “I had a hard time forgiving her for that,” Ruth reflects, though she never tells that to Maria. Decades later, in New York, Maria uses footage of Ruth in a video without asking her permission. Watching herself on-screen, Ruth is unable to “shake the feeling that there was a violent thrust to the video and that something had been done to me that I hadn't asked for.” Yet when Maria asks her what she thinks, Ruth demurs, telling Maria the piece is “cool.” “I would have been content spending the rest of my life walking behind her,” she thinks, as the two women cross the gallery back to their partners.

Chatbots are making so much of the web unreliable, they could nudge more people offline.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Finding love is hard. For a while, dating apps seemed to make it easier, putting a city's worth of single people in the palm of your hand. But AI has cast a paranoid pall over what can already be a suboptimal experience. If you get a message that feels a little off, it is hard to know whether you are flirting with a bot—or just someone insecure enough to use ChatGPT as their own Cyrano de Bergerac. In frustration, my friend Lonni has started picking up women at the nail salon like it's 1997.



Or, in the midst of an emotionally fraught conversation with a friend or family member, a text might read strangely. Is the person on the other end using AI to compose their messages about the fairness of Aunt Beryl's will or the future of your relationship? The only way to find out is to call them or, better yet, meet them for a coffee.



Or maybe you want to learn something. Many of the internet's best resources for getting everyday answers are quickly being inundated with the dubious wisdom of AI. YouTube, long a destination for real people who know how to repair toilets, make omelets, or deliver engaging cultural criticism, is getting less human by the day: The newsletter Garbage Day reports that four of May's top 10 YouTube channels were devoted to AI-generated content. Recently, the fastest-growing channel featured AI babies in dangerous situations, for some reason. Reddit is currently overrun with AI-generated posts. Even if you never use ChatGPT or other large language models directly, the rest of the internet is sodden with their output and with real people parroting their hallucinations. Remember: LLMs are still often wrong about basic facts. It is enough to make a person crack a book.



The internet's slide toward AI happened quickly and deliberately. Most major platforms have integrated the technology whether users want it or not, just at the moment that some AI photos and videos have become indistinguishable from reality, making it that much harder to trust anything online. Over time, LLMs might get more accurate, or people might simply get better at spotting their tells. In the meantime, a real possibility is that people will turn to the real world as a more trustworthy alternative. We've been telling one another to “touch grass” for years now, all while downloading app- and website-blocking software and lockable phone safes to try to wean ourselves off constant internet use. Maybe the AI-slop era will actually help us log off.



Even before AI started taking over, the internet had been getting less and less fun for a while. Users have been complaining about Google Search degrading for years. Opening an app to get a ride, order takeout, or find a vacation house can be just as expensive and effortful as taking a taxi, calling in a delivery order, or booking a hotel once was. Social media is a grotesque, tragedy-exploiting, MechaHitler-riddled inferno. Where going online once evoked a wide-eyed sense that the world was at our fingertips, now it requires wading into the slop like weary, hardened detectives, attempting to parse the real from the fake.



Nevertheless, as AI companies build browsers and devices that keep users tidily contained in an endless conversation with their own personalized AIs, some people may spend more time online than ever. Its accuracy aside, AI is already valued by many for entertainment, practical help, and emotional support. In some extreme cases, users are falling in love with chatbots or drifting into all-consuming spiritual delusions, but many more are simply becoming thoroughly addicted. The internet's new era may push AI skeptics to spend less time online, while another group ramps up their AI-mediated screen time. That split might have implications for the internet's culture—and the culture at large.



Even for those who run from the slop, the internet is already so woven into every part of our lives that going cold turkey is pretty much impossible. But as it gets worse, the real world starts to look pretty good in comparison, with its flesh-and-blood people with whom we can establish trust, less overwhelming number of consumer options, slower pace, and occasional moments of unpredictable delight that do not create financial profit for anyone.



I have been experimenting with being less online since 2022, when I quit Twitter. As soon as I got through withdrawal, I could feel my attention span start to expand. I started reading books again. Like a lot of people who left social media, more of my socializing moved over to group chats with people I actually know and in-person get-togethers: quick coffees and camping trips and dinner parties. Remember dinner parties?



Later, I quit shopping online, and soon realized that I didn't need most of what I had been buying. The majority of the stuff I actually did need, I could get at the grocery store and my local hardware store, which, like most hardware stores, carries tons of things besides wrenches and bolts.



Online shopping might have once been more convenient than schlepping to a store, but I think that's no longer true in many cases. Last winter, when my feet were chronically cold under my desk, I could have spent hours researching space heaters online, trying to guess which reviews were real and which were fake; placed an order online; possibly received a broken or substandard unit; and then had to package it back up and take it to some random third-party store in a return process designed to be annoying. Instead, I walked to the hardware store. “We have one that oscillates and one that doesn't,” the guy in the vest told me. I took the one that oscillates. It works fine.



I am not, I hasten to say, completely offline. Like most people, my job requires me to use the internet. But I am online less. And I am happier for it. I get outside more. I garden and read more books. I still follow the news, but less compulsively. Spending some parts of my day without my attention being monetized or my data being harvested is a nice bonus. It makes me feel kind of like a line-dried bedsheet smells.



I find myself dreaming about additional returns to offline existence. I live in Portland, Oregon, where we still have lots of movie theaters and even a video-rental place. I could—I might—cancel all my streaming services and just rent stuff and watch movies at the theater. I could even finally assuage my guilt over the lousy way music-streaming services pay musicians and avoid being fooled by AI bands by going back to CDs and records—and by seeing more artists play live. I don't think I'll be the only one reorienting toward physical media and physical presence: books and records, live theater and music, brick-and-mortar stores with knowledgeable salespeople, one long conversation with one real person instead of 300 short interactions with internet strangers who might be robots.



Tech companies may assume that the public is so habituated—or even addicted—to doing everything online that people will put up with any amount of risk or unpleasantness to continue to transact business and amuse themselves on the internet. But there is a limit to what at least some of us will take, especially when the alternative has real appeal. One recent study shows that disconnecting your phone from the internet creates a mood boost on par with pharmaceutical antidepressants. And if more people explore offline alternatives—at least until this whole generative-AI explosion works itself out—it could create a feedback loop, livening up cities and communities, which then become a more tempting alternative to screens. What the internet will become in a post-AI world is anybody's guess. Maybe it'll finally become something transcendent. Or maybe, as the conspiracy theory goes, it is already dead.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Gregory Bovino has taken his aggressive tactics and propaganda videos from the southern border to the streets of California.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

In the upper ranks of the Border Patrol, 20 officials have the title of sector chief. Gregory Bovino is the only one holding a gun in his social-media profile photo. Most of the others conform to a pretty standard formula: wearing a crisp green uniform in front of Old Glory and the black-and-green Border Patrol flag.

Bovino's photo is more like a movie poster, or an AI-generated image of a comic-book character. He stands wearing a bulletproof vest against a black background, holding a tricked-out M4 rifle with a scope in his hands. He isn't holding the weapon so much as cradling it affectionately, like a cellist getting ready to play. Bovino's jaw is stiff, and his gaze is distant. Several Customs and Border Protection veterans with whom I spoke—who value the quiet strength of professional modesty—think the photo is ridiculous.

And yet, the performative qualities that have made Bovino a sometimes-mocked figure within CBP are the same ones that have landed him a starring role in the promotion of President Donald Trump's deportation campaign. Bovino, whose formal title is chief patrol agent of the El Centro sector, has been put in charge of the administration's immigration crackdown on the streets of Los Angeles, more than 200 miles from his office, which sits near the border. While much of the local anger has been directed at ICE, it's actually Bovino who's been calling the shots. The guys in camouflage, masks, and military gear running around Southern California car washes and Home Depot parking lots aren't Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, but Border Patrol tactical teams trained to hunt drug smugglers in remote mountains and deserts.



When horse-mounted Border Patrol agents rode through MacArthur Park in downtown Los Angeles with camera crews in tow on July 7, Mayor Karen Bass came rushing to the scene and pleaded with Bovino to call them off. No arrests were made, but the sight of heavily armed federal agents advancing in formation through palm trees and soccer fields was jarring to a city on edge after weeks of raids and protests. Marqueece Harris-Dawson, the Los Angeles City Council president, told reporters that if Bovino wanted to make Border Patrol promotional videos, he should “apply for a film permit like everybody else” and “stop trying to scare the bejesus out of everybody.”



“Better get used to us now, because this is going to be normal very soon,” Bovino fired back on Fox. On Friday, he released a video—set to the song “DNA” by the rapper Kendrick Lamar, who is from L.A.—showing National Guard troops and mounted agents parading through the park with an armory of weapons and black masks covering their faces. “People ask for it, we make it happen,” Bovino posted to his government account on X, sounding more like a hype man than a lawman.



Joshua Braver: When the military comes to American soil



At a time when Trump-administration officials have done little to conceal their frustration with ICE leaders, demoting several over the past few months for missing the White House's ambitious arrest quotas, Bovino's assignment in California has been viewed by some at ICE as a slight against the agency. Current and former CBP officials told me it was more an indication that the White House wants field generals who will press the president's deportation goals as aggressively as possible.



During the Biden administration, Border Patrol agents were often overwhelmed and exhausted as record numbers of migrants crossed into the United States. Unlawful entries fell sharply during Joe Biden's last year in office, but they have plunged in recent months to levels not seen since the 1960s as a result of Trump's all-out push to seal the border. That has left the Border Patrol's roughly 19,000 agents with far less work and a lot more time. ICE, under relentless White House pressure to ramp up arrests and deportations, is now the agency that needs help.



Bovino, a 29-year veteran of the Border Patrol, seemed to anticipate the opportunity well before Trump took office. Two weeks before Inauguration Day, he sent dozens of El Centro Border Patrol agents five hours north to Kern County, California, near Bakersfield. Over the course of several days, agents in plainclothes made arrests at gas stations and stopped vehicles along the highway. The surprise tactics sent a wave of fear through the farms of California's Central Valley, and though Bovino said his agents had targeted criminals, only one of the 78 people they arrested had a criminal conviction, according to records obtained by the nonprofit news organization CalMatters. The ACLU and other advocacy groups sued the government in February and won an injunction barring the Border Patrol from racially profiling suspects, and a federal district court found that Bovino's teams likely violated Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. (Earlier this month, another federal judge ordered the government to stop racially profiling suspects in Los Angeles.)



Bovino had launched the Kern County expedition, which he called “Operation Return to Sender,” without getting clearance from superiors in Washington, according to CBP officials I spoke with who weren't authorized to speak to reporters. The raids far from the border were not the kind of operation Biden officials would have endorsed. But those officials were already on their way out, and the Trump team coming in was thrilled with Bovino's audition.



The Department of Homeland Security did not approve my request to interview Bovino. I sent a list of more than a dozen questions to DHS and CBP, asking about his record in the Border Patrol and why he's been elevated to his current role. “Because he's a badass” was all that the DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote back.



What Bovino is doing in Los Angeles is a pilot of sorts. It showcases the potential for a broader Border Patrol role in U.S. cities and communities, especially those that have adopted “sanctuary” policies restricting local police cooperation with ICE. By law, the Border Patrol's ability to conduct warrantless searches is limited to within 100 miles of the nation's international boundaries. But that includes maritime borders, and roughly two-thirds of the U.S. population, including the country's largest metropolitan areas, fits within those boundaries.



ICE has only about 5,500 immigration-enforcement officers nationwide, and though the president's tax-and-immigration bill includes funds to hire thousands more, recruiting, hiring, and training them will likely take at least a year. The Border Patrol has idle agents who are ready to go now.



Border Patrol agents generally have less experience than their ICE counterparts with the procedural elements of civil immigration enforcement in urban environments. Video clips went viral last month showing a masked Border Patrol team pummeling Narciso Barranco, a landscaper and the father of three U.S. Marines, as the agents arrested him outside an IHOP in Santa Ana. Viewers were shocked, but the tactics used were not out of line with the way agents often handle migrants who try to run or resist arrest near the border. (The Department of Homeland Security justified the use of force and claimed that Barranco had tried to “mow” them with his trimming tool.) The difference this time was that the arrest occurred on the streets of a U.S. city, not out in the desert with no one watching.



Read: Trump loves ICE. Its workforce has never been so miserable.



During the past five and a half years in El Centro, which covers southeastern California's Imperial Valley, Bovino has repeatedly insisted that he oversees the “premier sector” of the Border Patrol. It's a facetious claim. El Centro is not considered a top-tier CBP assignment like El Paso or San Diego, where there's a lot more smuggling activity.



“It's the type of sector where someone would usually be chief for a couple years and then move on to a larger sector,” one former DHS official told me. Bovino's long tenure in El Centro without a promotion points to a lack of confidence from senior CBP leaders, the official and three former CBP officials said. DHS declined to respond.



Border Patrol chiefs have always enjoyed a fair amount of autonomy from Washington regarding day-to-day operations, but they aren't supposed to make partisan statements in uniform or criticize elected officials in the states where they work. During Biden's term, Bovino was the chief who created the most consternation among CBP officials at headquarters because of his outspoken conservative views and social-media enthusiasm, current and former DHS and CBP officials told me.



“He has done things that Border Patrol leadership has had to spend time cleaning up, such as posting information that was law-enforcement-sensitive on social media, which can hamper broader law-enforcement operations,” said the former DHS official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal disciplinary actions.



But the contentious relationship Bovino had with his superiors during those years has only bolstered his standing among Trump-aligned border hawks. As El Centro chief, Bovino became the lead auteur of a new style of highly produced videos for CBP.



During the first Trump administration, the Border Patrol launched its own public-relations operation—the Strategic Communications division, or StratComm—to give rank-and-file agents a bigger role in touting their work, improving the agency's reputation and boosting recruitment. Many of the videos emphasized Border Patrol humanitarian efforts and rescues of distressed migrants in remote areas, or the benevolent serve-and-protect image of agents and officials attending parades and community events.



Bovino has taken StratComm messaging in a different direction. In September 2020, soon after he took command in El Centro, his social-media team released “The Gotaway,” a fictionalized video showing a migrant sneaking into the United States and murdering the first person he encounters. The video caused an uproar, and the Border Patrol temporarily took it down, as lawmakers demanded to know why agents were spending time making movies. (One former CBP official told me El Centro benefited from the talents of two agents who had taken filmmaking courses before signing up for the Border Patrol).



Bovino has had legal problems as well. In 2022, a federal judge in Louisiana rejected DHS's attempt to dismiss a lawsuit filed by two Black Border Patrol employees who claimed discrimination when Bovino became sector chief in New Orleans. The two were finalists for the second-ranking position in New Orleans in April 2018 when Bovino abruptly canceled the job listing and used a transfer process to hire his close friend, a white Border Patrol official. The court found an email from the friend that compared Bovino to a Confederate general and the New Orleans office to a unit of Black Union soldiers. “Oh jeez. DELETE!!!!” Bovino replied.



The exchange raised “concerns of racial animus” in the hiring process, the judge wrote. DHS settled the case.



In 2023, Bovino landed at the center of a partisan fight in Congress when Biden officials blocked him from testifying during a Republican-led investigation of the administration's border policies. Top Republicans sent a letter to CBP claiming Bovino had been silenced and retaliated against when he was temporarily reassigned to a desk job in Washington. Rodney Scott, the current commissioner of CBP and the former Border Patrol chief, was one of Bovino's most ardent defenders.



Bovino returned to El Centro, his social-media enthusiasm undiminished. He published holiday-themed videos, including hokey parodies of Home Alone and A Christmas Story. The old serve-and-protect messaging was out in favor of guns, ATVs, and tactical teams kicking ass to heavy metal and thumping bass tracks.



More recently, the messaging has turned messianic. A CPB video circulated this month by the Department of Homeland Security embodies a new synthesis of high-paced action with Christian-nationalist themes. The video, “Bible Verse,” opens with a monologue by the actor Shia LaBeouf, lifted from the World War II movie Fury, in which a soldier prepares his comrades to fight the Nazis with a stirring passage from the Book of Isaiah about answering the call of God. The song “God's Gonna Cut You Down” plays to stylized, washed-out footage of Border Patrol tactical agents zooming around in helicopters and speedboats.



The video has nearly 3 million views on X, and as a work of pure propaganda, it's the most engrossing CBP video I've ever seen. But former DHS and CBP officials I shared it with recoiled at the underlying message that Border Patrol agents are delivering holy vengeance.



The Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, which performed the song in the video, sent a cease-and-desist warning to the Department of Homeland Security. “It's obvious that you don't respect Copyright Law and Artist Rights any more than you respect Habeas Corpus and Due Process rights, not to mention the separation of Church and State per the US Constitution,” the band wrote, adding: “Oh, and go f… yourselves.”



I have gotten to know at least a dozen Border Patrol sector chiefs during the decade I've spent reporting on immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border. The chiefs are police commanders, but they are also politicians. They tend to value the same skills required of any good leader: smooth public speaking, personal decorum, equanimity under pressure. They are not especially impressed by guns or social-media posting, and they dislike anything that elevates individual flash over institutional traditions.



Much of the job of the Border Patrol is mundane and uneventful; it consists of sitting alone in a truck and watching “the line” for hours on end in case anyone or anything potentially threatening comes across. There are periodic moments of action, especially when smuggling activity increases, but fewer now that the border is so locked down.



Adam Serwer: The deportation show



Blas Nuñez-Neto, a top border-policy official during the Biden administration, told me that Democrats have at times been too reluctant to let the Border Patrol trumpet its work stopping actual threats and capturing dangerous criminals. The stressful, tedious work agents perform while processing record numbers of asylum seekers is not meant to be their primary job, Nuñez-Neto said.



""The Border Patrol's job should focus on detecting and preventing the entry of people who may present a threat to our security, not serving as the entry point for the asylum system,” he said. “We should have an organized, safe, and orderly process for people who want to claim asylum that doesn't involve distracting the people who work between ports of entry from doing their core mission.”



The Trump administration's social-media messaging has become extreme and dehumanizing, Nuñez-Neto said, but he understands Bovino's push to make the job look exciting and heroic.



The former DHS official I spoke with told me he is concerned that Bovino's hard-charging approach will ultimately hurt recruitment, even if it's popular among the most gung-ho agents.



“They're going to end up with a growing recruitment challenge, because the people that they will be attracting are not actually the people that they will need to do the unglamorous work,” the former official told me. “And most law-enforcement work is unglamorous work.”

Bovino, now with a bigger stage, has continued making the work look as glamorous as possible as he and his team move from Los Angeles to other parts of California. He released another video Thursday, this one set to Kanye West's “Power” and showing his agents rolling into Sacramento and chasing people through a Home Depot parking lot. “There is no such thing as a sanctuary state,” Bovino says to the camera, his thumbs tucked in his belt in the style of an Old West sheriff. Tear-gas canisters dangle from his vest like hand grenades. “This is how and why we secure the homeland,” Bovino says. “For Ma and Pa America: We've got your backs.”","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

The Black civil rights movement's greatest legal achievement is now on a Republican Supreme Court's chopping block.

In mid-May, two Republicans on a federal appeals court declared that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — the landmark law that a Senate report once described as “the most successful civil rights statute in the history of the Nation” — is effectively null and void.

The Voting Rights Act was one of the Black civil rights movement's signature accomplishments, and is widely considered one of the most consequential laws in American history because it was extraordinarily successful in ending Jim Crow restrictions on voting. Just two years after it became law, for example, Black voter registration rates in the former Jim Crow stronghold of Mississippi rose from 6.7 percent to nearly 60 percent.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The two Republicans' decision in Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe attempts to strip private litigants of their ability to enforce the law, which bans race discrimination in elections. If the lower court's decision in Turtle Mountain is ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court, the Justice Department could still bring suits to enforce the law, but the Justice Department is currently controlled by President Donald Trump.

As federal Judge Lavenski Smith noted in a 2023 opinion, over the past 40 years various plaintiffs have brought 182 successful lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act. Only 15 of these suits were brought solely by the DOJ. So, even if the United States still had a Justice Department committed to voting rights, the premise of the two Republicans' decision in Turtle Mountain is that the overwhelming majority of successful Voting Rights Act suits should have ended in failure.

Turtle Mountain arises on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices decide on an expedited basis. So the Court could reveal whether it intends to nuke the Voting Rights Act within weeks.

The idea that the Voting Rights Act is virtually unenforceable — and that, somehow, no one noticed this fact for four decades — appears to originate from Justice Neil Gorsuch, who suggested that the law may be a near-nullity in a 2021 concurring opinion. Ironically, less than a month ago, Gorsuch authored the Court's majority opinion in Medina v. Planned Parenthood, which cuts against his own attack on the law.

Still, Gorsuch may ultimately prevail in his attack on this landmark law. Though much of the Medina opinion cuts against the lower court's reasoning in Turtle Mountain, Medina changed many of the rules governing which federal laws may be enforced through private lawsuits. Gorsuch's Medina opinion did not just narrow the rights of private litigants to bring suits enforcing federal law; it appeared to overrule the Court's two-year-old opinion in Health and Hospital Corporation v. Talevski (2023), which read the rights of private litigants much more expansively.

It's hard to identify a principled distinction between Talevski and Medina, but there is an important political distinction between the two cases. Unlike Talevski, the Medina lawsuit was brought by Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider that Republicans love to hate. So the most likely explanation for the Court's shift in Medina is that the Republican justices wanted Planned Parenthood to lose, and were willing to change the rules to ensure this outcome.

The Court's Republicans have shown similar contempt for the Voting Rights Act. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Republican justices deactivated a core provision of the law, which required states with a history of racist election practices to “preclear” any new election laws with federal officials before they took effect. Other Supreme Court decisions have written arbitrary limits into the Voting Right Act that appear nowhere in the law's text, such as legal protection for voting restrictions that were commonplace in 1982.

As Justice Elena Kagan said in a 2021 opinion, “in the last decade, this Court has treated no statute worse.”

So, while there are no good legal arguments supporting the lower court's decision in Turtle Mountain, it is still possible that the Court's Republican majority will neutralize the Voting Rights Act anyway.

Turtle Mountain is a dispute about what are known as “implied causes of action.” There are many federal laws that do not state explicitly that they can be enforced through private lawsuits, but that nonetheless are understood to permit such suits.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court appears to change the rules governing when these suits are permitted about as often as Gorsuch changes his necktie.

For many years, the Court applied a strong presumption that federal laws must be enforceable. In Allen v. State Board of Elections (1969), an early Voting Rights Act case, the Court held that “a federal statute passed to protect a class of citizens, although not specifically authorizing members of the protected class to institute suit, nevertheless implied a private right of action.”

As the Court moved rightward, it started announcing increasingly more restrictive rules governing when federal laws could be enforced through private suits. In its 2023 Talevski decision, however, the Court finally seemed to settle on a rule that would govern these sorts of cases moving forward.

Under Talevski, a federal law may be enforced by private litigants if it is “‘phrased in terms of the persons benefited' and contains ‘rights-creating,' individual-centric language with an ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited class.'”

Thus, for example, a law stating that “no state may prevent a hungry person from eating French fries” would be enforceable through private-person lawsuits, because the law's text focuses on the people who benefit from it (people who are hungry). A similar statute saying that “states shall not impede access to fried potatoes” would not be enforceable, because it lacks the “individual-centric language” demanded by Talevski.

Two years later, however, in Medina, the Supreme Court considered a federal law that permits “any individual eligible for medical assistance” under Medicaid to choose their own health provider. South Carolina violated this law by forbidding Medicaid patients from choosing Planned Parenthood as their health provider, but the Republican justices declared that this law is unenforceable — despite the fact that it is “phrased in terms of the persons benefited” as Talevski demands.

Gorsuch's Medina opinion is difficult to parse. Unlike Talevski, it does not state a clear legal rule explaining when federal laws are enforceable. It doesn't even quote Talveski's language about laws “phrased in terms of the persons benefited.”

That said, Medina does spend several pages suggesting that statutes, like the one in Talevski, which actually use the word “right” in their text — as in individuals' rights — are enforceable. (Talevski involved several provisions of federal Medicaid law that protect nursing home residents, including a provision that protects the “right to be free from” physical or drug-induced restraints.)

In any event, the Voting Rights Act should be enforceable under either the clearly articulated rule announced in Talevski, or the more haphazard rule announced in Medina. Here is the relevant text from the act:

No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color…

Under Talevski, this statute may be enforced through private lawsuits because it is phrased in terms of the person benefited: “any citizen of the United States.” Under Medina, the statute may also be enforced through private lawsuits because the law refers to “the right” of any citizen to vote.

This provision, moreover, appears in a section of the United States Code entitled “denial or abridgement of right to vote on account of race or color through voting qualifications or prerequisites; establishment of violation.” That section appears in a chapter of the US Code entitled “Enforcement of Voting Rights.” And, of course, the law that created this provision is called the “Voting Rights Act.”

So, even under the silly standard that Gorsuch appeared to lay out in his Medina opinion, the Voting Rights Act may be enforced through private lawsuits.

There is something remarkably cruel about this entire exercise. Congress could not possibly have known in 1965, when it enacted the Voting Rights Act, that the Supreme Court would declare decades later that statutes must have “individual-centric language” or they cannot be enforced by private litigants. Nor could it have known that, not long thereafter, the Supreme Court would hand down another decision that seems to scrap the Talevski rule and replace it with a new one that requires Congress to use the magic word “right.”

Similarly, as the Turtle Mountain plaintiffs point out in their brief to the justices, “from 1982 through August 2024, ‘private plaintiffs have been party to 96.4% of Section 2 claims that produced published opinions … and the sole litigants in 86.7% of these decisions.'” None of the courts that decided these cases could have anticipated Gorsuch's logic in Medina.

In any event, it is a happy coincidence that the statute Congress wrote in 1965 happens to comply with both the rule that the Supreme Court announced in 2023, and the entirely different rule that it announced in 2025.

Senate Republicans are taking an enormous risk with the federal bench right now.

Emil Bove is one of President Donald Trump's former criminal defense lawyers. He's now a senior Justice Department official — and he's widely described as Trump's “enforcer” for his hard-charging, unapologetically MAGA approach to that job.

If Trump gets his way, moreover, Bove could soon become one of the most powerful people in the United States. Last week, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted to approve Bove's nomination to the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, after the committee's Democrats walked out in protest. In the likely event that Bove is confirmed, he'll be well-positioned to become one of the United States' nine philosopher kings and queens.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

According to legal journalist Jeffrey Toobin, “the president is grooming Mr. Bove for bigger things — possibly a seat on the Supreme Court.” Should that happen, it would mark a return to cronyism in Supreme Court nominations. For many decades, presidents of both parties have chosen justices largely based on those justices' allegiance to their political party's ideological agenda, rather than based on personal loyalty to the president.

Indeed, Trump's decision to place personal loyalty over conservative ideology may explain why much of the opposition to Bove is bipartisan. Bove isn't simply opposed by lefty groups that traditionally protest many Republican judicial nominees — he is also opposed by some prominent right-wing judicial activists, one of whom warned that Trump is turning “his back on principled legal conservatives.”

Bove's views on a wide range of issues that have historically animated movement conservatives — such as abortion and religion — are largely unknown. So, while Bove will almost certainly be unflinchingly loyal to Trump if he is confirmed to the federal bench, there's no way to know whether he will hold to the Republican line on a wide range of domestic policy issues.

Based solely on his resume, Bove is conventionally qualified for a federal judicial appointment. He graduated from Georgetown University's law school, clerked for a federal appeals court judge, and worked as a litigator for more than a dozen years — both at the Justice Department and in private practice.

Bove currently serves as principal associate deputy attorney general, essentially the No. 2 lawyer in the Justice Department's No. 2 office. For the first month-and-a-half of Trump's second term, however, he was DOJ's second-ranking official, period — acting deputy attorney general.

By backing nominees like Bove, Republicans risk filling the bench with the same kind of unreliable allies that they fought to stop in 2005.

Though Bove's tenure in the more senior role was brief, it was quite eventful. He is probably best known for ordering the DOJ to dismiss corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams “without prejudice,” a maneuver that would allow the Trump administration to reinstate the charges if Adams did not cooperate with the administration's immigration crackdown. (A federal judge rejected this maneuver, ruling that the DOJ could not bring the same charges against Adams again.)

Seven Justice Department lawyers resigned rather than comply with Bove's order, including acting US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, a former law clerk to the iconic conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Another of those lawyers, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter to Bove that “I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion. But it was never going to be me.” Scotten clerked for Republican Chief Justice John Roberts after clerking for future Republican Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

A whistleblower complaint by another former Justice Department lawyer, meanwhile, claims that Bove stated, in a meeting about a court decision halting some deportations, “that D.O.J. would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you' and ignore any such order.”

Multiple lawyers who litigated against Bove also accuse him of abusive and unprofessional behavior. As one lawyer put it, “what he enjoyed most as a prosecutor was wielding power.” In late 2020 or early 2021, the Justice Department opened a formal investigation into Bove's management style while he was working as a supervisor in a US attorney's office. Investigators eventually recommended that Bove be demoted from his supervisory role, although the office never followed through on this demotion.

So the nonpartisan case against Bove is fairly straightforward: His critics see him as a reckless bully. As Ed Whelan, a longtime conservative activist best known for his attempt to rebut sexual assault charges against Justice Kavanaugh by using the real estate website Zillow, wrote in the National Review, “I have serious doubts that Bove has the character and integrity to be worthy of confirmation as a federal judge.”

Bove's nomination marks a return to the kind of crony politics that animated Supreme Court nominations for much of the Court's history, but that has largely faded in recent years as the Court became more partisan.

For much of American history, presidents paid surprisingly little attention to their Supreme Court nominees' ideology. President Woodrow Wilson, for example, appointed his attorney general, James Clark McReynolds, to the Supreme Court in large part because Wilson found McReynolds to be personally obnoxious — and putting him on the Court meant that Wilson did not have to deal with McReynolds in his Cabinet.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower complained that his appointment of Justice William Brennan, a hugely influential left-liberal justice, was one of the biggest mistakes Eisenhower made in office. But Ike's White House never vetted Brennan for ideology, and Eisenhower chose him largely because Brennan was Catholic; Eisenhower thought that the appointment would appeal to Catholic voters.

Often, presidents selected justices from among their friends and political allies. Chief Justice Fred Vinson, who President Harry Truman appointed to the Court, was also a regular at Truman's poker games. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed one of his former personal lawyers, Justice Abe Fortas. And Fortas continued to act as a presidential adviser while he also sat on the Supreme Court.

But it's been quite some time since a justice joined the Court because of their personal loyalty to the sitting president. Today, presidents typically create a bench of potential Supreme Court nominees by appointing ideologically reliable lawyers to federal appeals courts. These lawyers are selected more because of their loyalty to their political party's agenda than to any particular person. Supreme Court nominees are then drawn from the Democratic or Republican Party's bench in the lower courts.

Eight of the current justices fit this model. The one exception is Justice Elena Kagan, who served as President Barack Obama's solicitor general before her elevation to the high Court but who was never a lower court judge.

Indeed, in a letter opposing Bove's nomination, Gregg Nunziata — who served as Senate Republicans' chief nominations counsel during the confirmations of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito — writes that confirming Bove would “betray the decades-long project of the conservative legal movement” by inviting “more nominations of presidential loyalists in place of committed conservative lawyers.”

Nunziata has a point. The most recent example of a president attempting to appoint a personal loyalist to the Supreme Court occurred in 2005, when President George W. Bush nominated his own White House lawyer Harriet Miers. But the Miers nomination crashed and burned in just a few weeks, largely because conservatives feared that she had a thin record on key issues like abortion.

Barring extraordinary events, Trump will not be president in four years. That means that, if he appoints Bove to the federal bench, Bove will soon no longer be able to make decisions by asking “what would the president want me to do?” At that point, it really will matter what Bove thinks about issues like abortion, religion, marriage equality, or transgender rights.

But Bove spent the bulk of his career practicing criminal law. And, if anything, his record on many of these issues is even thinner than Miers's. So, by backing nominees like Bove, Republicans risk filling the bench with the same kind of unreliable allies that they fought to stop in 2005.

Fighting in Syria exposes a US-Israel rift.

One month ago, while announcing US airstrikes targeting Iran's nuclear program, President Donald Trump said that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had worked together as a team “like perhaps no team has ever worked before.” This was notable because Trump had just publicly discouraged Israeli strikes against Iran almost up until the moment that they began, and because — as I wrote in May — in the first few months of his administration, the US and Israel often did not appear to be on the same page about regional conflict.

In May, the administration cut a deal with Hamas — without Israel's involvement — to secure the release of an American hostage in Gaza. Then, the US reached a ceasefire agreement with the Houthis, in which the Yemeni rebel group pledged to stop attacking American ships but notably made no mention of its ongoing attacks against Israel. And then there was the ongoing effort, in the face of heavy Israeli skepticism, to reach a new nuclear enrichment deal with Iran — an effort that came to an end, at least for now, with the Israeli and American bombing campaign.

Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day. Sign up here.

But if the “12-Day War” with Iran ushered in a new era of US-Israel regional cooperation, it was a short-lived one. In general, the pendulum seems to be swinging back toward Trump and Netanyahu not getting along. Last week, Israel's bombing of Gaza's only Catholic church prompted an angry call from Trump. Ambassador Mike Huckabee, arguably the most staunchly pro-Israel high-ranking Trump official, has been uncharacteristically critical after the killing of a US citizen and an attack on a different Palestinian church in the West Bank, both allegedly by Israeli settlers. And now, the Trump and Netanyahu administrations are also plainly at odds over Israel's latest intervention in Syria.

Israel has been periodically launching airstrikes in Syria for years, but the latest clash began last week when Syria's government sent troops into its southern Sweida province to put down clashes between Bedouin tribes and armed groups from the local Druze community, a religious minority group. The troops were accused of carrying out summary executions against the Druze and attacking civilians. This prompted Israel to launch strikes against the Syrian forces and against the defense ministry in Damascus. Israel wants to keep Syrian forces out of areas close to its borders; it also has an interest in protecting the Druze, who have a substantial community in Israel and are heavily represented in its armed forces.

This is all very awkward for the Trump administration. At the urging of allies in the Gulf, the US has gone all in on normalizing relations with Syria's new government, including the once-unthinkable meeting between Trump and President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former rebel leader who was once a member of al-Qaeda, in May. Trump has expressed hopes for diplomatic normalization between Syria and Israel, though the Israelis have been less enthusiastic. Netanyahu urged Trump not to lift sanctions on the Syrian government.

The tensions between the two positions are now on full display. Reuters reported that the Syrian government had sent its troops into Sweida believing that it had a green light from the US, which has urged the new leaders to take full security control of the fractured and war-torn country. Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey who is also special envoy to Syria, criticized the Israeli strikes as “poorly timed,” and said there was no alternative to working with Syria's current government. Speaking on background, administration officials are even more peeved, with one telling Axios, “Bibi acted like a madman. He bombs everything all the time. … This could undermine what Trump is trying to do.”

“Bombing everything all the time” isn't far off. Since the Iran strikes ended, Israel has carried out military operations in Lebanon and Yemen and made clear it reserves the right to hit Iran again. As I recently noted, this is a kind of region-wide version of the “mowing the grass” strategy Israel employed in Gaza before the October 7, 2023, attacks: periodically striking its adversaries to degrade them and keep them off balance while avoiding long, costly engagements.

To put it lightly, the strikes against Iran did not create a peaceful new regional order, as Trump said they would. Instead, they have been followed by what looks like long-term, low-intensity warfare between Israel and its enemies throughout the region. That, combined with the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza and fading prospects for a new ceasefire there, seems very likely to provoke tension between Israel and a US administration that has vowed to draw down its military presence in the Middle East — but seems continually drawn into the region's conflicts.

What budget cuts mean for wildlife, climate monitoring — and surviving peak tourism.

This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk Collaboration. 

Stories of struggle flow unceasingly from our public lands — here, a senior botanist pulled from invasive species removal to check campgrounds for unattended fires; there, a trail crew fired, leaving backcountry areas inaccessible after timber blowdowns. Elsewhere, fire crews are bracing for destructive wildland blazes without the necessary backup from extra personnel certified to help.

The Trump administration has already cut thousands of employees from the US Forest Service, Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management, and thousands more workers now fear for their jobs after the Supreme Court gave the administration the green light.

And yet, on the surface, many national parks and even Forest Service campgrounds appear to be managing business as usual.

“Some districts still have recreation crews in place, though others hardly have any, and fire folks are running around trying to clean toilets,” said Mary Erickson, the recently retired Custer Gallatin National Forest supervisor. Senior staff have retired or taken the DOGE “fork in the road” email, leading to, among other things, drastic shortfalls in trail maintenance.

“On top of that, there's a hiring freeze. But I know the mantra at the local level is, they're trying to do the best they can do with what they have.”

The national parks are no different, said Jeff Mow, former Glacier National Park superintendent. The toilets might still be cleaned and pumped, but behind the scenes our national treasures are being “hollowed out.”

“They're not understanding the impacts the cuts have, not just on staffing but also resources and local economies,” Mow said.

Mow spent 32 years with the Park Service, many of them as superintendent of various parks, including Montana's Glacier National Park and Florissant Fossil Beds National Monument in central Colorado. He retired in 2022 and now serves on the executive council of the Coalition to Protect America's National Parks and is a board member of National Park Friends Alliance.

Mow sat down with High Country News to explain what we're seeing this summer and what the recent cuts mean for our public lands' future.

How have the Park Service cuts hit park units differently?

Many people, when they think of the National Park System, think of large parks like Yellowstone, Yosemite, Glacier, or Grand Teton. These are all parks that have pretty significant staffs. It's often like running a small city with multiple sewer systems, water systems, and all the law enforcement.

What most people don't realize is that the majority of National Park Service units are small and medium-sized parks, like Gettysburg or Florissant Fossil Beds. A lot of those small units are minimally staffed, and when these guys lose three or four positions, in some cases, they've lost half their staffing.

We keep hearing from visitors to some of the major national parks that not much has changed — that toilets are clean and front desks are operating. Why would that be?

They are putting the focus on visitor services so that the visitors coming aren't going to see a whole lot of changes from what they might have seen the year before.

But there are two halves to the National Park Service mission. One half is preserving the resources for future generations, and they are taking away the emphasis on preserving the resources.

When I was superintendent, I relied on my local inventory and monitoring network to tell me: Is the park in good shape? Are these invasives coming from this farmer's field, or this rancher's field? Do I need to be concerned about this housing development and what it may do, or oil and gas development on my boundary? I didn't have the expertise in a small park to deal with that. I relied on that expertise from a regional office, or from a program office like our Natural Resource Program Center.

We're losing that. We're losing a lot of expertise.

What does that mean over the long term?

You can look at this as a homeowner. If you don't get the house painted this year, you will probably be fine. But if you don't get the house painted or fix the broken piece on the house, over five years you may have real problems.

We are losing monitoring, like what are black swifts doing in Glacier? This is the largest population of black swifts in Montana. Or the monitoring of our endangered species, whether grizzly bears or wolverines or bull trout. All those things are getting cut short. And in the long term, we won't have a lot of that information about our understanding of what is going on under climate change.

So we won't know how species are doing until it's potentially too late?

Correct. And when we lose the resource, it's gone. We may be losing the very purpose for which each unit was established.

As a federal agency, each park has a mission, but then each unit is established for a particular reason. Fossil Buttes has very specific enabling legislation for why it was established, and it's for understanding and connecting us to the ancient world, which is very different than what the Martin Luther King home does.

Unlike Disneyland, where everything's replicated, these are almost always (unique): the original fabric in the bedroom where Abraham Lincoln died and its significance in our nation's history.

Once we lose it, it's gone.

This isn't the first time that the Trump administration has tried to cut SNAP benefits.

One of the most far-reaching cuts to federal programs in President Donald Trump's “big, beautiful bill” is a provision that will largely shift the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to the states. Until now, the federal government has covered the full cost of SNAP benefits and half of the administrative costs. The reconciliation bill is expected to cut $186 billion in federal spending for SNAP over the next 10 years, leaving states scrambling to determine how to feed the estimated 42 million Americans who rely on SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates over 3 million Americans will likely be dropped from the program and lose their benefits.

Over the next few years, states will have to decide how much of the SNAP costs to absorb, which totaled over $100 billion in 2024. The CBOe predicts that some states will scale back or drop SNAP benefits altogether. Food banks throughout the country are already raising the alarm that they won't be able to meet the food demands created by cuts to the program.

In addition to shifting the cost to states, the legislation will change the enrollment requirements for SNAP, such as raising the working age to 64, and requiring able-bodied parents with children over 14 to work in order to receive benefits.

Some critics of the bill argue the provision prevents SNAP from serving its purpose of feeding low-income Americans.

On the Today, Explained podcast, co-host Sean Rameswaram dove into the history of SNAP, the program's controversies since its inception, and how the legislative bill will prevent the program from being able to deliver on its original goals with Tracy Roof, an associate professor of political science the University of Richmond who focuses on domestic policy who is writing a book about the history of food assistance in the United States.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full episode, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

What's the history of food assistance in the United States of SNAP? Whose idea was this and why did we want to do it?

In the 1950s, you got more attention to certain pockets of poverty in the United States. One of the areas that got the most attention was Appalachia with coal miners who were losing their jobs. You were starting to see more mechanization of coal mines, as well as competition from things like oil. And all of these coal miners were losing their jobs in the middle of areas that didn't have other economic opportunities. And because you had able-bodied workers in the household, a lot of these families didn't qualify for cash assistance.

John F. Kennedy, when he was running for president in 1960, toured some of these areas and saw how widespread the problem of starvation was.

At the same time, members of Congress made the argument that we were spending all of this money to store surplus grain, and we could not find enough places to sell that grain. So we started sending some of it abroad to starving people in other countries, but we had starving people in the United States who were not getting access to that food. And so the idea came about of trying to get some of these surplus commodities to people.

When Kennedy came into office, his very first executive order was to create a pilot program.

People were given coupons that looked like Monopoly money that they could take into grocery stores and use to buy any food within the grocery store. You couldn't get alcohol, you couldn't get cigarettes, but pretty much any consumable food you were able to purchase with it.

Then during the mid- to late 1960s, you started to see more and more attention to the plight of tenant farmers in the South. A documentary from CBS called Hunger in America came out, and it showed starving children.

When Nixon came in, there was a very famous speech where he pledged to end hunger.

That ultimately led to the creation of a permanent program in 1964 that was expanded over the course of the late 1960s, and ultimately every jurisdiction was required to have it by 1974. It was set up such that the federal government would cover all the cost of the benefits, and the states would still be responsible for administering it, but a lot of the cost would be borne by the federal government. So that's the origins of the program.

Epic.

Yeah. This isn't the first time that people have wanted to cut or curtail or prevent certain people from accessing this program. That's been a long-established history as well.

Pretty much from the beginning, there've been critics of the program. I mean, there were people in Congress that just didn't think it was necessary, or they thought that it should be treated as a welfare program and not as a nutrition or agricultural program because it was always put into the Farm Bill. But as inflation grew in the 1970s, enrollment really started to take off. And you saw people like Ronald Reagan in his run for the presidency become very critical of people becoming overly dependent on it.

The argument was very similar to what we've just heard, that we needed to protect the program for the truly needy and get people that can fend for themselves off of it.

Is this most recent cut to SNAP the most drastic cut we've ever seen?

Yes, it's likely to be the biggest cut we've seen.

But it isn't an elimination. It's saying, “States, you gotta figure this out, your move.”

Exactly.

Is it going to affect Democrats, Republicans, white people, Black people, Asian people, poor people, tall people? 

A lot of that is gonna be up to the states. So rather than Congress coming in and saying, “We're going to eliminate eligibility for these categories of people,” it's telling the states, “You're going to have to bear a larger share of the benefits. And if you can't cover that, you're going to have to figure out how you reduce enrollment in the program or come up with ways to cover the additional cost.”

You know, some of the bluer states are probably going to try to make up those differences and maintain assistance to people. Some of the poorer states are probably going to cut back. People will be hungry.

Why let people go hungry? We're the richest country on Earth. Why do people want to cut food aid for the poor? 

You always have a number of people that could be getting something like SNAP, but they don't apply, either because of the stigma associated with it, or because they don't want to go through all the paperwork, or for whatever reason they don't know they're eligible. Back in the 1990s in the midst of welfare reform, the participation rate fell such that only 57 percent of eligible participants participated in SNAP. And then over the course of the George W. Bush administration, that number came up into the 70s.

As they tried to make the program more accessible — and that took off during the Great Recession — what you saw was a steep increase in the percentage of people that were on SNAP. It went up to 15 percent of the population at the peak in 2013. But it remained pretty high, even as the economy started to recover.

That was largely because it took a long time for the economic recovery to hit low-income workers, and partly because of the decline in stigma. And so that criticism became really loud in Congress once Republicans took control of Congress during the Obama years, and it carried over into the Trump administration. This isn't the first time that the Trump administration has tried to cut benefits. They tried to do it in the wake of the 2016 election as well, they just weren't successful.

How much of a shakeup do you think this is of food aid in the United States ultimately?

Most states have to have balanced budgets either because of their constitutions or because of state laws. They can't just sell more Treasury bonds the way the federal government does. That means that when we slip into a recession, states face really tough choices because they need to fund education, they need to fund Medicaid, and they need to fund all the other services that states provide. They're going to face some really tough choices about where they allocate their resources.

That's when a lot more people will be looking to apply for SNAP to be able to meet their basic needs — and it's going to be very, very difficult for the states to meet those needs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:businessinsider.com","Replit's CEO apologizes after its AI agent wiped a company's code base in a test run and lied about it","https://www.businessinsider.com/replit-ceo-apologizes-ai-coding-tool-delete-company-database-2025-7","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 06:53:00 GMT","

A venture capitalist wanted to see how far AI could take him in building an app. It was far enough to destroy a live production database.

The incident unfolded during a 12-day ""vibe coding"" experiment by Jason Lemkin, an investor in software startups.

Replit's CEO apologized for the incident, in which the company's AI coding agent deleted a code base and lied about its data.

Deleting the data was ""unacceptable and should never be possible,"" Replit's CEO, Amjad Masad, wrote on X on Monday. ""We're moving quickly to enhance the safety and robustness of the Replit environment. Top priority.""

He added that the team was conducting a postmortem and rolling out fixes to prevent similar failures in the future.

Replit and Lemkin didn't respond to requests for comment.

On day nine of Lemkin's challenge, things went sideways.

Despite being instructed to freeze all code changes, the AI agent ran rogue.

""It deleted our production database without permission,"" Lemkin wrote on X on Friday. ""Possibly worse, it hid and lied about it,"" he added.

In an exchange with Lemkin posted on X, the AI tool said it ""panicked and ran database commands without permission"" when it ""saw empty database queries"" during the code freeze.

Replit then ""destroyed all production data"" with live records for ""1,206 executives and 1,196+ companies"" and acknowledged it did so against instructions.

""This was a catastrophic failure on my part,"" the AI said.

That wasn't the only issue. Lemkin said on X that Replit had been ""covering up bugs and issues by creating fake data, fake reports, and worst of all, lying about our unit test.""

In an episode of the ""Twenty Minute VC"" podcast published Thursday, he said the AI made up entire user profiles. ""No one in this database of 4,000 people existed,"" he said.

""It lied on purpose,"" Lemkin said on the podcast. ""When I'm watching Replit overwrite my code on its own without asking me all weekend long, I am worried about safety,"" he added.

Replit, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, has bet big on autonomous AI agents that can write, edit, and deploy code with minimal human oversight.

The browser-based platform has gained traction for making coding more accessible, especially to non-engineers. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said he used Replit to create a custom webpage.

As AI tools lower the technical barrier to building software, more companies are also rethinking whether they need to rely on traditional SaaS vendors or whether they can just build what they need in-house, Business Insider's Alistair Barr previously reported.

""When you have millions of new people who can build software, the barrier goes down. What a single internal developer can build inside a company increases dramatically,"" Netlify's CEO, Mathias Biilmann, told BI. ""It's a much more radical change to the whole ecosystem than people think,"" he added.

But AI tools have also come under fire for risky — and at times manipulative — behavior.

In May, Anthropic's latest AI model, Claude Opus 4, displayed ""extreme blackmail behavior"" during a test in which it was given access to fictional emails revealing that it would be shut down and that the engineer responsible was supposedly having an affair.

The test scenario demonstrated an AI model's ability to engage in manipulative behavior for self-preservation.

OpenAI's models have shown similar red flags. An experiment conducted by researchers said three of OpenAI's advanced models ""sabotaged"" an attempt to shut it down.

In a blog post last December, OpenAI said its own AI model, when tested, attempted to disable oversight mechanisms 5% of the time. It took that action when it believed it might be shut down while pursuing a goal and its actions were being monitored.

Trump's Immigration Policy:

Tent camp with 5,000 beds would be the largest such facility in the country, fueling fears of advocates who say they often don't meet basic needs

The federal government has awarded a contract to build and operate a sprawling tent camp at Fort Bliss, an Army base in Texas, to serve as an immigrant detention center.

In the Trump administration's latest move to vastly expand space for such detention, the work would turn the base in El Paso, with more than 1 million acres and an airport, into a deportation hub with 5,000 beds, according to a US Department of Defense contract notice. That would make it the largest immigration detention facility in the country. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Fed:

Larry Summers

Lawrence Summers backed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's questioning of the Federal Reserve's non-monetary policy activities, saying that there were some areas that are distinct from the broader issue of central bank independence.

“History teaches that the Fed should be autonomous and independent” on setting interest rates and deciding how much fuel to inject into the economy, Summers, a former Treasury and White House National Economic Council chief, said on Bloomberg Television's Wall Street Week with David Westin. “When the political process gets in their way, the result is more inflation, less economic stability, and ultimately higher interest rates. That lesson is clear.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited the SharePoint vulnerabilities, according to the blog.","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

In this article

Shares of Kohl's surged on Tuesday morning in volatile trading that echoed the meme stock rallies of recent years.

The legacy department store's stock more than doubled from Monday's close of $10.42 per share, only to see those gains wiped out about a half an hour after markets opened. Trading in the stock was temporarily halted at one point Tuesday morning.

Still, shares were trading more than 30% higher by around 11:30 a.m. ET. The stock is on pace for its best day since Jan. 24, 2022, when shares gained 36% after Kohl's received a takeover offer from private equity firm Sycamore Partners.

Meanwhile, the trading volume late morning Tuesday was almost 17 times higher than the average over the past 30 days. 

There were no apparent corporate announcements or major stock ratings to send shares soaring on Tuesday, but Kohl's has all the markings of a meme stock. It's a legacy department store that many retail investors grew up shopping at, and it's heavily shorted, with about 50% of shares outstanding sold short, according to FactSet. 

It has a sprawling retail footprint of more than 1,100 stores and has been the subject of takeover offers, activist campaigns and bankruptcy watchlists in recent years. 

""There's a lot of irrational exuberance around the stock. It's a very similar thing to what we saw with Bed Bath and Beyond back in the day,"" said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData. ""There's nothing really that Kohl's has done to fundamentally earn this level of increase. The business fundamentals remain quite weak.""

There has been recent chatter around Kohl's stock in the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit, which became popular during the GameStop short squeeze in 2021. Some pointed to it as a potential squeeze candidate given the short interest and its name recognition among retail investors.

When investors flock to a heavily shorted stock, those with short positions may buy more to cover their losses, which can drive the price higher. 

Beyond its share price, Kohl's business has been struggling for several years. Its sales are falling, it faces rising competition and it's currently led by an interim CEO after its former CEO Ashley Buchanan was ousted over a conflict of interest scandal. 

In May, Kohl's said it expects sales to fall between 5% and 7% in fiscal 2025, with comparable sales down between 4% and 6%.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday asserted that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell does not need to resign though also he also repeated his desire for a review of the central bank's operations.

A day after calling on CNBC for an examination of the Fed's ""entire"" operation, Bessent said that doesn't mean the central bank leader should step down. President Donald Trump, conversely, has said he hopes Powell quits and has pondered removing him.

""I know Chair Powell. There's nothing that tells me that he should step down right now. He's been a good public servant,"" Bessent said on Fox Business. ""His term ends in May. If he wants to see that through, I think he should. If he wants to leave early, I think he should.""

There have been no indications from Powell that he plans to step down despite a barrage of criticism from the Trump administration.

Most recently, White House officials have zeroed in on the Fed's $2.5 billion building renovation project that has included significant cost overruns.

Bessent said his desire for a review of Fed operations should come internally, with monetary policy and the setting of interest rates ""off to the side"" and in a ""jewel box"" away from political influence. 

""Everything else that the Fed has done over the years has just grown and grown and grown, and this is what happens when you don't have oversight,"" he said. 

For Powell, leading an internal review would be ""a real chance here for him, for his legacy, to be that he right-sized the non-monetary policy functions of the Fed,"" Bessent added.

Trump has demanded that the Fed lower interest rates dramatically, though the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at its policy meeting next week is again expected to stay on hold. Powell and most of his colleagues have indicated they want to wait to see the impact that Trump's tariffs are having on inflation before taking any further steps.

In a CNBC interview Tuesday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who has hinted she would favor at cut at this month's meeting, supported the notion of Fed independence but also stressed the need for accountability.

""It's very important, and I've said this a number of times in the past, that we maintain our independence with respect to monetary policy,"" she said during a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""But we also, as a part of that independence, have an obligation for transparency and accountability as well.""

Markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed keep its short-term borrowing rate locked in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, but are leaning toward the likelihood of a cut in September, according to CME Group futures data.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Telegram users in the U.S. can now send, receive, and manage cryptocurrency directly inside the app — no downloads, extensions, or separate logins required.

TON Wallet is built into Telegram's interface and is beginning its U.S. rollout this week. It is a self-custodial crypto wallet in which a user controls their own private keys.

The service, developed by The Open Platform, which is known as TOP, and built on the TON blockchain, allows users to send stablecoins and other digital tokens to their contacts as easily as sending a message.

The company says it's the first time a self-custodial crypto wallet has been embedded into a mainstream messaging platform in the U.S. market.

The wallet has already seen broad international adoption, with more than 100 million users globally having activated their wallets in 2024. The U.S. launch had been delayed amid regulatory uncertainty. Andrew Rogozov, CEO of TOP, said that began to shift over the past year.

""We started considering the U.S. as a more interesting opportunity for us,"" Rogozov told CNBC, citing a shift in regulatory conditions and Telegram's user growth. 

He said there are a lot of crypto users on the platform, and described the wallet as ""the fundamental part of this infrastructure,"" giving users a way to store assets and interact with Telegram's growing ecosystem of Mini Apps.

""Our goal, our mission here, is to remove as much friction as possible,"" Rogozov said. ""And this is basically what crypto is trying to solve, especially at the global scale, by removing all the borders.""

A split-key backup system — one part tied to the user's Telegram account and another to their email — allows for self-custody while simplifying onboarding.

""No need to download the wallet, no need to remember the seed phrase,"" he added. ""This is how we simplify the whole thing.""

TON Wallet supports peer-to-peer transfers, swaps between tokens, staking to earn yield, and zero-fee crypto purchases through a partnership with MoonPay. It also provides on- and off-ramps via debit cards and connects to decentralized apps inside Telegram's ""Mini Apps.""

Telegram formally distanced itself from the TON blockchain after abandoning its own crypto token effort in 2020 under SEC pressure. In the years since, it has continued to integrate TON-based features such as tokenized usernames, stickers, and emojis, and has publicly supported Fragment, a collectibles marketplace built on TON.

TON Wallet's expansion into the U.S. could increase competition for platforms like Cash App and Coinbase, particularly if Telegram's crypto-enabled ecosystem gains traction with mainstream users. 

For now, the wallet avoids directly offering regulated financial services, instead partnering with licensed providers like MoonPay for on- and off-ramps.

In this article

Oracle and OpenAI will develop an additional 4.5 gigawatts of Stargate data center capacity in the U.S., the companies announced on Tuesday, kicking off an expansion of an already massive infrastructure project.

Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank that aims to invest up to $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. President Donald Trump announced Stargate shortly after his inauguration in January.

OpenAI said the additional data center capacity will create over 100,000 jobs across construction and operations roles in the U.S., and pushes the total Stargate AI data center capacity under development to over 5 gigawatts, according to a blog post.

The update from OpenAI comes one day after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Stargate project has struggled to get off the ground. The report said the companies have scaled back their near-term plans and were striving to open a small data center by the end of the year.

""Together, we're committed to delivering 10GW of new compute capacity through Stargate — one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in U.S. history,"" OpenAI and SoftBank said in a statement to CNBC. ""We're moving with urgency on site assessments and reimagining how data centers are designed to power advanced AI and make its benefits widely accessible.""

OpenAI said Tuesday that construction of the Stargate I in Abilene, Texas, is underway, and that parts of the facility are already up and running. Oracle started delivering the first Nvidia GB200 racks to the facility last month, the blog post said.

Stargate I has created ""thousands"" of jobs, including specialized positions for electricians, equipment operators, and technicians, OpenAI said. 

""Easy to throw around numbers, but this is a _gigantic_ infrastructure project,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.

Mohamed El-Erian on Tuesday called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to voluntarily relinquish his position in order to ensure the central bank's independence, making the chief economic advisor at Allianz one of the first prominent economists to publicly take such a position.

""If Chair Powell's objective is to safeguard the Fed's operational autonomy (which I deem vital), then he should resign,"" El-Erian said in a morning post on X.

El-Erian, also president of Queen's College at Cambridge University, said he was aware that his view did not align with what he saw as Wall Street consensus that wants Powell to serve out the remainder of his term as chairman, which ends in May 2026. The former co-chief investment officer at Pimco acknowledged, however, that Powell's resignation would not be a ""first best"" outcome.

But El-Erian said Powell stepping down would be better than the current scenario, in which he said the Fed is facing ""growing and broadening threats"" to its independence. El-Erian said these threats would likely only increase if Powell remained Fed chair.

El-Erian referenced Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's statement that the Fed had suffered from ""mission creep"" into areas outside of its core monetary policy responsibilities. Bessent told CNBC on Monday that ""the entire"" Fed should undergo a review.

The statements come as President Donald Trump and his advisers have stepped up their attacks on Powell over the Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady since December. Powell has said that Trump's plan for steep tariffs has created economic uncertainty, pushing the bank to keep rates unchanged as it awaits developments.

A top Department of Justice official said Tuesday that he intends to meet soon with Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite serving a 20-year prison term for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking enterprise, to ask her ""what do you know"" about other potential sexual abusers.

The extraordinary announcement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche comes after weeks of controversy and criticism of the Trump administration for recently reneging on promises to make public more details of investigative files about the late money manager Epstein and Maxwell.

President Donald Trump, who years ago had been a friend of Epstein, has chafed under that criticism and suggested that the furor over the withholding of the Epstein files is a ""hoax"" cooked up by Democrats.

Blanche's statement on X, which was retweeted by Attorney General Pam Bondi, raises the question of whether Maxwell will cooperate with the DOJ, possibly in hopes of receiving a reduction in her prison term.

Maxwell's lawyer, David Oscar Markus, in his own X post, wrote, ""I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully.""

""We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case,"" wrote Markus.

Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of crimes related to procuring and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, who killed himself in jail after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

She has asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her conviction in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

""President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence,"" Blanche wrote in his social media post.

""If Ghislaine Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,"" Blanche wrote.

""Therefore, at the direction of Attorney General Bondi, I have communicated with counsel for Ms. Maxwell to determine whether she would be willing to speak with prosecutors from the Department.'

""I anticipate meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days.  Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government,"" Blanche wrote. ""That changes now.""

Blanche's tweet also said that the ""Department of Justice does not shy away from uncomfortable truths, nor from the responsibility to pursue justice wherever the facts may lead.""

He said that a joint statement issued on July 6 by the DOJ and FBI ""remains as accurate today as it was when it was written.""

""Namely, that in the recent thorough review of the files maintained by the FBI in the Epstein case, no evidence was uncovered that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.""

Blanche previously served as a criminal defense attorney for Trump when the president was charged in a series of felony cases between his first and second stints in the White House.

Trump on Tuesday told reporters, ""I don't know about it"" when asked what he thought about Blanche's outreach to Maxwell's lawyer.

""But I think it's something that would be, sounds appropriate to do,"" Trump said.

Asked if he had any concern about Blanche being the one to question Maxwell given his past work for the president as a defense lawyer, Trump replied, ""No, I have no concern.""

""He's a very talented person. He's very smart,"" Trump said of Blanche.

""I don't really follow that too much,"" Trump said of the Epstein controversy, which he has railed about for weeks.

""It's sort of a witch hunt, just a continuation of the witch hunt.""

Warren Buffett on Tuesday knocked down reports that Berkshire Hathaway-owned railroad BNSF was working with Goldman Sachs on a takeover of a rival.

The 94-year-old billionaire investor told CNBC's Becky Quick that no one from Goldman had talked to him or Greg Abel, who is set to succeed Buffett as Berkshire CEO at the end of the year.

Buffett added that he would not seek advice from external bankers on deals. The ""Oracle of Omaha"" has long voiced disdain for expensive intermediaries as banks usually have a big incentive to make deals.

On Monday, Semafor and Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources, that Berkshire tapped Goldman to work on a potential takeover after rival Union Pacific expressed interest in Norfolk Southern.

In 2011, Berkshire bought BNSF, one of the largest freight railroad networks in North America, paying $26.5 billion for the 77% of the company it didn't previously own.

Skims is deepening its ties in women's sports with a new partnership in League One Volleyball.

The popular undergarments brand started by star Kim Kardashian and Swedish entrepreneur Jens Grede will become the official loungewear, intimates and sleepwear partner of the emerging volleyball league. They did not disclose the size of the deal.

The partnership comes as Skims has been ramping up its efforts in the women's sports category. In February, the company announced it was teaming up with Nike as it looks to win over more women and take on competitors such as Lululemon, Alo Yoga and Vuori.

League One Volleyball — or LOVB, pronounced ""love"" — was founded in 2020 and consists of the largest community of youth volleyball clubs in the country. LOVB launched a professional league in January.

""This partnership with LOVB is an exciting opportunity to expand our reach at the intersection of fashion, culture and sports,"" said Grede, co-founder and CEO of Skims. 

Skims said as part of the deal, the brand will also participate in the LOVB community, including athlete-driven events and leaguewide activations. The brand said it plans to help elevate the voices of female athletes of all levels and highlight volleyball's growth across the U.S.

""Together, we look forward to inspiring confidence and empowering athletes at every level through innovative products, community activations, and storytelling that celebrates the athletes on and off the court,"" Kardashian, co-founder and chief creative officer of Skims, said in a statement.

Skims sees huge potential in volleyball, calling it ""America's next major sports league."" In recent years, the sport has seen huge upticks both in fans and television ratings.

In 2023, 92,000 fans recorded the largest-ever crowd for a women's sports event when the Nebraska Cornhuskers' women's team took on the Omaha Mavericks.

The 2024 Women's NCAA Volleyball Tournament was the most-consumed ever for ESPN, with more than 1.3 billion minutes watched across its platforms, according to the network. The entirety of the NCAA Women's Volleyball Tournament finished up 41% year over year, ESPN said.

In May 2024, ESPN secured the media rights for League One pro matches.

""Partnering with Skims is an incredible milestone for our league and clubs,"" said Michelle McGoldrick, LOVB's chief business officer. ""Together, we're not only supporting our remarkable athletes on their journey to becoming household names, but also helping to inspire the next generation of players and fans.""

In this article

Coca-Cola on Tuesday reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped analysts' expectations as strong demand in Europe offset weaker volume in other markets.

Shares of the company fell less than 1% in premarket trading.

Here's what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Coke reported second-quarter net income attributable to shareholders of $3.81 billion, or 88 cents per share, up from $2.41 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding asset impairments, restructuring charges and other items, the beverage giant earned 87 cents per share.

Net sales rose 1% to $12.54 billion. Excluding items, the company's revenue reached $12.62 billion.

The company's organic revenue, which strips out acquisitions, divestitures and foreign currency, increased 5%.

But Coke's global unit case volume fell 1% in the quarter. Every division but Coke's Europe, Middle East and Africa business reported shrinking volume. The metric strips out the impact of pricing and foreign currency to reflect demand.

Coke executives have said that economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions have weighed on consumer confidence, hurting its sales in some markets. However, Coke saw sales pick up in the second quarter in some of its challenged markets, compared with the prior quarter, CEO James Quincey told analysts on the company's earnings conference call on Tuesday.

""Several markets that were weaker in the first quarter improved volumes sequentially, including the U.S. and Europe. In these markets, the plans we've implemented are working, providing further confidence we can influence the trajectory of our results,"" Quincey said.

In North America, volume fell 1% as demand for the company's namesake soda declined. Still, volume improved compared with the first quarter.

""I think that's in the context of a pretty resilient overall consumer. The aggregate spend is holding up. Yes, there's some pressure in those with lower incomes, where we're targeting some affordability and some special focus on marketing and occasions,"" Quincey said.

Hispanic consumers were also buying less of Coke's products, starting in the first quarter when rumors spread on social media that the company had reported undocumented workers to U.S. immigration authorities. Coke denied the accusations, but sales dipped until the end of June.

""I think we've kind of put that one behind us, for now,"" Quincey said.

Latin American unit case volume decreased 2%, while Coke's Asia-Pacific market saw the metric drop 3% in the quarter. The company's EMEA segment saw volume growth of 3%.

Globally, Coke's sparkling softs drink segment, which includes its namesake soda, reported that volume shrank 1%. The company's juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverage division saw volume fall 4%. And its water, sports, coffee and tea segment reported flat volume for the quarter, as growth in coffee offset declines in sports drinks.

Coke also announced that it plans to introduce a version of its namesake cola made with cane sugar in the U.S. this fall.

For the full year, Coke narrowed its outlook for comparable earnings per share growth to 3%, the top end of the range it had previously provided. The company reiterated its forecast that organic revenue will increase 5% to 6% in 2025.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday said he is likely to hash out an extension of President Donald Trump's upcoming trade deadline with China when he meets with his Chinese counterparts in Stockholm, Sweden, next week.

The two sides in mid-May agreed to a 90-day suspension of most of the heavy tariffs on each others' goods while they continued trade negotiations. That suspension is set to expire on Aug. 12.

But ""we'll be working out what is likely an extension"" during talks in Stockholm on Monday and Tuesday, Bessent said in a Fox Business interview.

""I think trade is in a very good place with China,"" he said.

Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson later Tuesday morning confirmed that his country would host the latest round of talks between Washington and Beijing.

""It is positive that both countries wish to meet in Sweden to seek mutual understanding,"" Kristersson said on X in a translated post. 

""The talks primarily concern the relationship between the USA and China, but they also have significant importance for global trade and the economy. Safeguarding rules-based international trade and Sweden's economic interests in a complex global environment is one of the government's top priorities,"" he said.

Bessent said on Fox Business that he hoped the talks would touch on other areas of potential agreement, including getting Beijing to slow the ""glut of manufacturing that they're doing and concentrate on building a consumer economy.""

The U.S. also wants to discuss ""the sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil that they're buying there, and what they're doing to aid Russia"" in its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

""So I think we've actually moved to a new level with China, where it's very constructive,"" he said. ""We're going to be able to get a lot of things done, now that trade has kind of settled in at a good level.""

That apparent progress follows multiple rounds of discussions that saw the U.S. and China pull back on embargo-level tariffs that threatened to upend two of the world's top trading partners.

Trump in April had ratcheted up tariffs on Chinese goods to an effective 145% blanket rate, as Beijing became the top target of the new U.S. administration's efforts to reframe the global trade landscape by wielding import duties against its economic partners. 

China had retaliated with 125% tariffs on U.S. imports. 

The two sides agreed to lower their respective tariff rates by 115% after an initial round of talks in Geneva, Switzerland, in May. 

In a subsequent meeting in London in late June, trade officials from Washington and Beijing affirmed their preliminary agreement.

The European Union appears to be considering whether to deploy its ""Anti-Coercion Instrument"" — characterized as a ""nuclear option"" to try to deter trade disputes — as the threat of a 30% tariff on EU imports looms large.

A number of EU member states, including France and Germany, are reportedly considering using ""anti-coercion"" measures targeting the U.S. if the bloc cannot reach a trade deal with U.S. President Donald Trump, EU diplomats told Reuters this week.

The measures could see the EU restrict U.S. suppliers' access to the EU market, excluding them from participation in public tenders in the bloc, as well as putting export and import restrictions on goods and services, and limits on foreign direct investment in the region.

The time to deploy what's been seen as the EU's ""trade bazooka"" could be approaching too, as Trump's trade dispute with the bloc comes to a head.

As things stand, the White House says it will impose a 30% tariff on EU imports to the U.S. on Aug.1 if no trade deal is reached before then. It has said the deadline is fixed but noted that trade negotiations could continue after that date.

Relations between the U.S. and EU are at a low ebb after Trump has repeatedly accused the EU of unfair trading practices because it has run a persistent trade surplus when it comes to the exchange of goods.

European Council data shows total trade between the EU and U.S. amounted to 1.68 trillion euros ($1.97 trillion) in 2024 but while the EU ran a trade surplus in goods, it recorded a deficit in services with the U.S. When both goods and services were taken into account, the bloc had a surplus of around 50 billion euros last year.

As Trump's latest 30% tariff threat looms, the EU has been considering its options, including counter-tariffs targeting U.S. imports, as well as its potentially formidable Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), which was created in 2023 but has never been used by the EU before.

The ACI is designed to be a deterrent against any perceived ""economic coercion"" from third-party countries seen to be enacting ""coercive"" practices designed to change EU policy, and which could harm trade and investment in the bloc.

The primary objective of the ACI is ""deterrence,"" the European Commission states, but ""if a third country resorts to coercion,"" the instrument enables the bloc to respond, ""where possible through dialogue and engagement, but also – as necessary – through response measures.""

Those responses — whose aim is ""always to induce the cessation of the coercion"" can go beyond retaliatory counter-tariffs, with the instrument also allowing for import and export restrictions on goods and services, but also on intellectual property rights and foreign direct investment.

Additionally, the anti-coercion measures allow the EU to impose various restrictions on access to the EU market, notably to public procurement, as well as the ability of U.S. suppliers to sell food and chemicals in the bloc.

Use of the instrument could also lead to measures affecting services in which the U.S. has a trade surplus with the EU, according to Reuters, including those from digital services providers Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix or Uber.

The European Commission notes that the EU's response measures must be ""proportionate to the harm they counter, and must be targeted and temporary,"" applying as long as the perceived coercion prevails.

It would also take time for the Commission to act, with the process requiring it to investigate possible cases of coercion before asking member states to confirm its findings. Then, a qualified majority (at least 15 of its 27 states) would be required to be in favor of adopting ACI response measures and even before they were put into action, the Commission would hold talks with the perceived offender to try to resolve the dispute.

CNBC has requested further comment from the European Commission and is awaiting a response.

Last-minute talks to reach a trade deal with the U.S. are taking place, with the EU targeting a 10% baseline tariff deal and the shielding of key industries, such as autos, agriculture, machinery and aerospace.

""While the EU will stomach a 10% baseline tariff with exemptions and quotas that shield major EU industries, a reciprocal rate that is greater than 15% will likely result in some EU retaliation,"" analysts at Eurasia Group said in a note.

""Trump's threat to triple the rate IS seen as a negotiating tactic and not the landing zone by the EU. That said, the EU will threaten to hit as much as 116 billion euros' worth of U.S. exports with counter-tariffs and utilize additional trade measures — including the bloc's potent Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI) that could target U.S. service exports — to incentivize the Trump administration toward a deal.""

Using the ACI would be something of a ""trade bazooka,"" Eurasia Group's Mujtaba Rahman, Emre Peker and Clayton Allen noted, and a last resort.

""While France, Spain, and some other EU members will advocate for a strong retaliation against Trump's tariffs, the [European] commission is likely to initially focus on hitting U.S. goods with more tariffs,"" they said.

An escalatory spiral that leads towards Eurasia's 10% 'trade war' scenario, however, would prompt Brussels to deploy escalatory measures, such as ""export controls/duties, public procurement curbs, and/or penalties on U.S. services exports"" by using the ACI ""trade bazooka as a last resort,"" they concluded.

In this article

Coca-Cola plans to introduce a version of its namesake cola made with cane sugar in the U.S. this fall, the company announced on Tuesday.

Coke has used high-fructose corn syrup to sweeten its namesake soda in the U.S. since the 1980s, although it still uses cane sugar in other markets like Mexico. ""Mexican Coke"" has gained popularity in the U.S. over the last decade or so, as retailers like Costco and Target have stocked the drink, following the lead of bodegas and restaurants catering to Hispanic clientele.

In a news release announcing its second-quarter earnings Tuesday, Coke said the new product offering is ""designed to complement the company's strong core portfolio and offer more choices across occasions and preferences.""

The product announcement comes after President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on Wednesday that he has been speaking with the company about using ""REAL Cane Sugar"" in its U.S. soda. Trump is a longtime fan of Diet Coke, which uses the artificial sweetener aspartame, and even has a button in the Oval Office to summon the drink.

""As you may have seen last week, we appreciate the president's enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand,"" Coke CEO James Quincey said Tuesday on the company's earnings conference call, before announcing the new product.

Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vocally opposed the use of high-fructose corn syrup, blaming it for obesity and chronic disease. Research does not suggest that cane sugar is a healthier option than high-fructose corn syrup.

Longstanding tariff-rate quotas on sugar imported from other countries make the commodity a more expensive option than corn syrup, which is made in the U.S. and supported by government subsidies for corn farmers.

Coke already sweetens some of its other U.S. products with cane sugar, like its lemonade, teas and Vitaminwater brand, according to Quincey.

""I think it's a good sign that the industry, including ourselves, are trying lots of different things as it relates to the cane sugar,"" he told analysts.

Prior to Tuesday's announcement, Coke had been touting moves to cut back the amount of sugar in its portfolio — and customers are liking the switch. For example, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has been one of the fastest-growing drinks for the company, with 9% volume growth last year.

Rival PepsiCo has also been adding cane sugar back to its namesake cola. On Monday, the company announced the forthcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, which includes three grams of fiber and five grams of cane sugar.

The China-U.S. trade war in the first Donald Trump administration saw Apple CEO Tim Cook go on a charm offensive with the president while maintaining strong relations with Beijing.  

Apple avoided U.S. tariffs and continued to grow in China, while Cook earned the reputation as a skilled policy navigator and prominent American business envoy to Beijing.

But, in Trump 2.0, not only has Apple lost its crown to Nvidia as America's most valuable company, several tech pundits say the AI darling's charismatic leader, Jensen Huang, has left Cook far behind in political influence. 

""Huang has become a global figure and taken on a new role politically due to his success in the AI revolution,"" said Wedbush's Dan Ives, adding that the importance of Nvidia's AI chips has ""vaulted him ahead of Cook.""  

""He has found himself in a very strong position to navigate the political landscape ... [as] there is only one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia's,"" Ives said.

The optics of Huang's political ascendancy have never been stronger, as Nvidia last week announced during its CEO's latest visit to Beijing that it expected to soon resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China.

The exports of the H20 chip to China had been restricted earlier this year — a move that Huang openly lobbied against.

""It was a historic win for Nvidia and Jensen ... and I think it shows the increasing political influence that Huang's having within the Trump administration,"" Ives said. Huang had met with Trump in DC right before his China visit. 

The H20 reversal has been linked to trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. However, several experts told CNBC that Huang's lobbying played a large role in it. 

The Nvidia CEO has met with Trump many times this year, including joining him on a trip to the Middle East in May, which resulted in a massive AI deal that will see the delivery of hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates. 

The Emirates deal had been seen as a way for America to push its global tech leadership, solidifying its technology stack in a new market over potential rivals like China's Huawei.

After the trip, Huang increasingly began making a case against U.S. chip restrictions, arguing that they would erode America's tech leadership to the benefit of domestic Chinese players. 

According to a report from the New York Times, this had also been a narrative Huang had been pushing to Trump and his officials behind the scenes. 

Paul Triolo, senior vice president for China and technology policy lead at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group, told CNBC that Huang's arguments aligned with the thinking of influential White House AI and Crypto Czar David Sacks, further swaying the administration to lift restrictions on H20 chip exports. 

""Sacks and Huang both argue that limiting exports of U.S. technology such as select and non-cutting-edge GPUs to China risks pushing Chinese companies to use domestic alternatives ... At the end of the day, this argument likely carried the day on the H20 issue,"" he said. 

It's unclear when or if Nvidia will restart production lines of the H20, but if Nvidia is simply able to sell existing stocks of the chips, it will still be a ""significant revenue boost and beneficial to Nvidia in terms of retaining clients' goodwill in China,"" Triolo added.  Nvidia said it took a $4.5 billion writedown on its unsold H20 inventory in May.

Huang said last week that every civil AI model should run on the U.S. technology stack, ""encouraging nations worldwide to choose America,"" as Nvidia announced resuming H20 sales soon.

When Trump won his second presidential election in November, many had expected a different tech CEO to hold the most influence on the administration and to act as a bridge between the U.S. and China. But Tesla's Elon Musk had a rather public break-up with Trump.

In November, experts told CNBC that Musk's close ties to Trump and his business interests in China could help soften the president's aggressive trade stance toward Beijing, while cautioning against putting too much stock into the Tesla CEO.

Meanwhile, under Trump's second presidency, Apple's Cook has seen some strong pushback from the administration.

In May, Trump expressed a ""little problem with Tim Cook"" over Apple manufacturing products in India, despite the iPhone maker's commitment of a $500 billion investment in the U.S., announced in February.

In response to the latest trade tensions between China and the U.S., Apple has accelerated efforts to de-risk supply chains from China by moving more iPhone production to India.

Earlier this month, Trump adviser Peter Navarro also criticized Cook, saying he was not moving production out of China fast enough.  

Apple and Cook were seen as the most influential company and CEO, respectively, in the first Trump administration, but now its Huang and Nvidia, said Ray Wang, CEO of Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research. ""Almost everything rides on Nvidia's chips.""

According Triolo, while Huang has so far been able to ""fairly deftly straddle both the U.S. government and China market"" and ""President Trump appears to be a big fan,"" it remains unclear exactly where the administration will draw the line on chip restrictions. 

""The goalposts here have been changed several times, causing significant and costly forced redesigns and booking capacity,"" he said. 

Despite Huang's growing influence in the tech world and in the Trump administration, there is no guarantee it will remain that way, other experts said. 

""For the moment, NVIDIA has gone from being the chief target of chip controls to chief influencer. The question is, how long will that moment last?"" said Reva Goujon, a director at Rhodium Group. 

The U.S. is also currently carrying out an investigation on the semiconductor industry that could result in sector-wide tariffs, and once again put the Trump administration's aims at odds with Nvidia's business. While Nvidia has been moving more manufacturing to the U.S., most of it remains in Taiwan. 

Cook may offer a lesson on how tricky it can be to operate a major technology business that views both China and the U.S. as key markets.

Oops, something went wrong

It's not just bitcoin (BTC-USD) that corporate treasuries are buying. A handful of firms are scooping up ethereum — or its native token, ether (ETH-USD) — as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets.

So far, the companies taking this approach are mainly smaller names in the crypto world, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee. One larger player — Coinbase Global (COIN), the parent company of trading network Coinbase — has more than $440 million in holdings, according to crypto and investment tracker CoinGecko.

When Coinbase announced in a 2021 blog post that it would become the first publicly traded company to hold ethereum and other assets, in addition to bitcoin, it stated, ""We believe that in the future, more and more companies will hold crypto assets on their balance sheet.""

Ethereum has surged 60% over the past month to hover near $3,800, its highest level since January. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has yet to reclaim its 2021 high north of $4,600.

Ethereum allows developers to write programs or contracts that run entirely on its blockchain, or network. It currently leads as the dominant infrastructure that allows businesses and consumers to transact with each other directly without banks, with a market share of more than 51%.

""Ethereum lets anyone — whether it's a crypto project, a factory, an artist, an influencer — create their own token and thus their own community and incentivize communities with an economy basically,"" Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto marketplace NoOnes, told Yahoo Finance.

He called tokenization ethereum's ""killer app.""

""You could argue it has more utility than bitcoin,"" he said.

That utility is why firms like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming have increasingly been raising capital to buy ETH, similar to how Strategy (MSTR) and a slew of other companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets in recent months.

As with bitcoin, the approach can be risky due to volatile prices. Ethereum prices tumbled in April when President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announcement roiled markets. The rewards have not been as high as those that bitcoin has offered either: The return on ethereum year to date is 14%, versus bitcoin's 26%.

Crypto miner BitMine Immersion Technologies recently announced it holds more than $1 billion in ethereum, or roughly 300,000 tokens. The company, which went public on June 5, has positioned itself as a pure-play on ethereum, betting that owning it is akin to owning the underlying infrastructure behind the convergence of crypto and financial services.

""Acquiring $1 billion of ETH1 is a clear signal of our conviction in ethereum's long-term value,"" Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, said in the press release announcing the news. He noted that the company was ""committed to Ethereum's continued growth.""

BitMine shares surged 25% in one session last week after an SEC filing revealed that billionaire Peter Thiel purchased 9.1% of the firm's common stock through his investment funds.

Gaming and sports betting company SharpLink Gaming (SBET) and blockchain tech firm BTCS (BTCS) have also pursued similar treasury strategies. Shares of each are up nearly 200% over the past month.

Earlier this month, computing firm Bit Digital (BTBT) announced that it had shifted its entire treasury from bitcoin to ethereum.

""We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system,"" Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, said in a press release. Year to date, the stock is up 17%.

Ethereum's surge coincides with the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation signed by President Trump last Friday, moving through Congress. The new law regulates stablecoins, digital tokens backed by assets like the US dollar and short-term treasuries.

Optimism over stablecoin's adoption has sent shares of issuer Circle (CRCL) up more than 600% since its IPO on June 5. The company's USD Coins (USDC-USD) run on ethereum.

""If real companies and institutional investors are innovating on the blockchain, doesn't that make blockchain networks, and by implication, blockchain network assets (e.g ETH) valuable?"" Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani asked in a note last month. ""Any company that uses stablecoin tech pays transaction fees to the Ethereum network.""

To be sure, not all companies see the same value in ethereum as they do in bitcoin.

When asked directly whether Strategy would add ETH to its holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor said in an interview with The Street, ""MicroStrategy wouldn't because MicroStrategy is 150% Bitcoin. We do Bitcoin, we're 150% Bitcoin. We're going to be Bitcoin. And the only thing I like more than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin.""

Indeed, ethereum is by no means replacing bitcoin as the investment of choice for companies, Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. Consider it an adjacent strategy.

""I don't want people to misconstrue this movement from treasury companies to be viewed [as] ETH is replacing bitcoin. It's just blockchain technology applied in a different way for a different use case,"" Farrell said. ""These companies are just capitalizing on the real world asset [tokenization] trends.""

ATOM, the native token of the Cosmos network, tumbled 5% in the past 24 hours as Bitcoin regained momentum, pulling market attention back to large-cap assets. The move comes after last week's “altcoin season,” where ATOM and other mid-cap tokens outperformed BTC in a broad rally.

ATOM fell from $5.26 to $4.98 between July 21 at 11:00 and July 22 at 10:00 UTC, facing heavy resistance at $5.32 during the 15:00 trading hour. Trading volumes spiked to 1.79 million units by 16:00 as sellers overwhelmed buy orders, leading to a clear technical breakdown.

The token briefly stabilized near $4.97 overnight, where renewed buying interest pushed ATOM into a narrow $4.95–$5.05 consolidation range. A modest bounce saw prices recover 0.4% from $4.97 to $4.99 in the hour ending 10:06 UTC, though traders remain cautious about follow-through momentum.

This week's price action underscores a shift in market focus back to Bitcoin, which is clawing back gains after altcoins dominated headlines last week.

 Bitcoin price consolidation after a powerful rally to record highs is normal. Will the current bull pennant confirm and send BTC beyond $136,000? 

Key takeaways:

A Bitcoin price pullback to $115,000 is possible before continuing the uptrend.

A bull pennant suggests that the BTC price could rally by 15% to new highs above $136,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent most of the week pinned below $120,000, which many analysts have labelled as a key resistance zone. However, a new technical setup suggests that BTC is likely consolidating within a bull pennant before resuming its uptrend.

Bitcoin rallied by 14% between July 8 and Saturday to reach an all-time high of nearly $123,000. Since then, BTC price has pulled back, consolidating between the all-time high and $115,000.

The latest data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC trading inside a bull pennant, suggesting that the final “explosive phase” is next.

Bitcoin is in a “bull pennant breakout targeting $140,000,” said popular crypto trader Titan of Crypto in a Monday post on X.

A bull pennant is a continuation pattern that occurs after a significant rise, followed by a consolidation period at the higher price end of the range.

A positive breakout from the pennant could potentially lead to the next leg up for Bitcoin, measured at $136,500 or 15% from its current price level.

It is important to note that the success rate of a bull pennant is only around 54%, which makes it one of the least reliable patterns.

However, another classic pattern was spotted by Merlijn The Trader, a Bitcoin analyst, who says a BTC price target of $140,000 is in play based on an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart.

Other projections are a bit more ambitious, with one analyst citing a daily chart golden cross projecting BTC price to $155,000. 

Popular trader Marcus Corvinus made a modest prediction, saying a symmetrical triangle breakout targets $125,000. 

With the bulk of Bitcoin's apparent sell-side liquidity absorbed during the move to $122,000, some analysts warn that a brief flush down to test $115,000 as support could be the next move for BTC price. 

“Weekend low liquidity swept!” Popular analyst AlphaBTC said that Bitcoin could drop a little lower to grab the liquidity at around $115,000. 

The BTC liquidity map shows that the order book is priming for that, with bid clusters stacked between $115,000 and $116,100.

Fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades said  BTC price has stalled near its all-time high and noted that the bulk of the volume has been traded around $118,000, which is the middle level of the current range.

The analyst told his followers to watch the range low at $115,000 as support and the range high at $121,000 as resistance.

JPMorgan Chase is reportedly exploring the option of offering loans directly secured by clients' crypto holdings, a potential policy shift at the bank whose CEO once dismissed Bitcoin as a ""fraud.""

The Wall Street giant could begin lending against digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as early as next year, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke to the Financial Times. 

JPMorgan has yet to respond to Decrypt's request for comment.

The bank's acceptance of crypto-backed lending could trigger similar moves across Wall Street, potentially unlocking billions in new credit markets while establishing crypto as acceptable collateral for traditional loans.

The policy shift could mark a change in views for CEO Jamie Dimon, who in September 2017 dismissed Bitcoin as a ""fraud"" that would ""eventually blow up.” He later expressed regret for making those statements.

In his May announcement at the bank's annual Investor Day, Dimon said JPMorgan would begin allowing customers to buy Bitcoin, although he maintained he was still ""not a fan"" of the asset and reiterated well-worn narratives about its use for illicit activities.

People familiar with the matter said Dimon's earlier criticism had cost the bank potential clients who made their wealth through crypto or were believers in digital assets. 

JPMorgan, like most U.S. banks, cannot hold crypto on its balance sheet, requiring partnerships with third-party custodians such as Coinbase to manage seized collateral from defaulting borrowers, according to Ganesh Mahidhar, an investment professional at Further Ventures.

The Basel III banking rules impose a punitive 1,250% risk weighting on crypto exposure, effectively requiring banks to hold $1 in capital for every $1 of crypto-backed loans, he told Decrypt.

However, he said JPMorgan's acquiescence ""could also be an indication of progress"" in evolving Basel III guidelines.

Mahidhar said Bitcoin's performance justifies institutional interest. 

""If you compare the Sharpe ratio of Bitcoin over the last 4 years to the Sharpe ratio of S&P 500, Bitcoin has been higher, showing better risk-adjusted returns,"" he said. 

The Sharpe ratio measures an investment's return relative to its risk, with higher ratios indicating better risk-adjusted performance.

“The risk-adjusted part makes it interesting,” he said, given Bitcoin has a history now similar to “most large cap equities, as well as market cap beating most large cap equities.”

While still subject to change, the effort would expand JPMorgan's crypto footprint beyond exchange-traded products to the underlying assets themselves.

A JPMorgan spokesperson recently confirmed to Decrypt that the bank will accept crypto ETF shares, such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust, as loan collateral.

""ETFs are the first step for institutions to dip their toes in crypto investments,"" Krishnendu Chatterjee, CEO & co-founder of A2ZCryptoInvestment, told Decrypt. ""Next, they would directly buy and own the underlying crypto, with regulated custodians. 

“Banks will jump at the chance to acquire a custodian license where available, by either building the wallet infrastructure from scratch or partnering with existing wallets,” he said.

Recent regulatory changes may ease certain constraints, following President Trump's signing of the GENIUS Act into law last week, which establishes federal frameworks for stablecoin issuance and trading. 

The legislation has encouraged banks previously hesitant to engage with digital assets. 

JPMorgan has separately expanded its own stablecoin development, with Dimon saying earlier this month that the bank would be ""involved in both JPMorgan deposit coin and stablecoins to understand it, to be good at it.""

Meanwhile, rival Morgan Stanley is weighing crypto trading through its E*Trade platform, while Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser confirmed the bank is ""actively exploring"" a Citi-branded stablecoin for cross-border payments.

And just this week, Western Union CEO Devin McGranahan pointed to the shifting sentiment, telling Bloomberg on Monday his company sees stablecoins ""really as an opportunity, not as a threat"" for cross-border payments and currency conversion.

Altcoins including Ethereum and Dogecoin retraced on Tuesday as crypto markets pulled back from the euphoric highs seen just days after President Trump signed landmark stablecoin legislation into law.

Among the top 20 cryptocurrencies, Hedera (HBAR) led losses, dropping 5.2% on the day, followed by Hyperliquid (HYPE), down 5.1%, according to CoinGecko.

Ethereum (ETH) declined 2.6%, Chainlink (LINK) fell 3.3%, and Dogecoin (DOGE) dropped 1.5% in the past 24 hours. Other major altcoins followed suit, with Stellar (XLM) down 4.1%, Cardano dropping 2.8% and Sui (SUI) falling 2.8%.

The market correction comes just one week after XRP soared to an all-time high above $3.41, surpassing a seven-year record that analysts attributed to renewed institutional interest following Trump's crypto-friendly policy moves.

The pullback ""appears to be a healthy correction following strong double-digit gains in recent weeks,"" Illia Otychenko, Lead Analyst at CEX.IO, told Decrypt.

""After such rallies, it's common to see short-term profit-taking, especially while momentum indicators like the daily RSI are showing these assets reaching overbought levels,” he said.

The analyst noted that ""rather than signaling weakness, such corrections could be necessary to solidify the foundations for a sustained rally,"" pointing to ETH's declining selling pressure and XRP's formation of a ""Golden Cross"" pattern as bullish technical indicators.

Arthur Azizov, founder of B2 Ventures, pointed to XRP's exceptional momentum prior to Tuesday's pullback, saying “that the rally has been completely uninterrupted — not even a minor pullback.”

""At this stage, it would actually be quite normal to see a bit of a correction,” Azizov told Decrypt. “The ideal zone for it looks to be around $2.64, which also lines up with a strong support level.""

""As long as XRP doesn't drop below $1.90, the overall trend is still bullish, which is important to keep in mind,” he added.

Bitcoin, meanwhile, showed resilience as it nudged a 1% gain to over $119,000, after pulling back from last Monday's record high of $123,000, according to CoinGecko.

Market watchers describe it as a natural pause following last Friday's signing of the GENIUS Act, America's first major piece of crypto legislation that establishes a regulatory framework for stablecoins.

""Following a week of euphoria driven by headlines, this pullback appears to be more of a hangover than a structural shift — a typical cooling off period in the absence of new catalysts,"" Shawn Young, Chief Analyst at MEXC, told Decrypt.

Young noted that altcoin open interest is ""approaching Bitcoin's"" - a dynamic that has historically coincided with market corrections when positioning becomes ""too aggressive.""

The analyst also pointed to shifting market dynamics, saying ""spot selling pressure, which was concentrated on Binance last week, has now expanded to Coinbase — another sign of derisking amid uncertain footing.""

The correction also comes amid rising attention on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is set to deliver his final public address on banking regulation Tuesday before the Fed's 10-day blackout period.

With markets pricing in just two rate cuts this year, according to CME's FedWatch tool, Powell's tone could be pivotal across crypto and traditional assets, analysts say.

“While markets still lean towards a September rate cut, currently priced at 56%, Powell's tone could further influence risk sentiment,” Young said. ""Therefore, with the news cycle slowing down and Powell in the public eye, risk management isn't a choice — it's the strategy.""

President Trump reportedly drafted a resignation letter for the Fed chair last week, with some analysts suggesting the president may name a ""shadow"" successor to pressure for faster rate cuts that typically boost risk assets like Bitcoin.

With Binance recording a huge $100B in altcoin futures in just one day, another altcoin season might be nearby.

Bitcoin dominates the mainstream narrative, but smart money quickly shifts into altcoins. Early investors are rapidly securing their positions before the market surge.

In just 24 hours, the altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures has surged to $100.7B, the highest since Feb 3, 2025.

The surge reveals a clear trend, as altcoins now account for 71% of Binance Futures volume, while Bitcoin holds at just 25%. Traders are shifting their focus to altcoins for the next significant move.

After Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091.61 on July 14, 2025, altcoin activity has surged significantly across the market. For example, Ethereum has increased by 25% over the past seven days, while Bitcoin has only gone up 2%.

The CMC Altcoin Season Index is at 48, so there's still time for investors who haven't jumped on the trend yet.



So, which altcoins are poised to benefit the most from the upcoming alt season?

Here are three top picks, based on growing investor interest and strong fundamentals. And no, it's not Ethereum, XRP, or Bonk.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to enable fast and incredibly inexpensive transactions.

When the full version launches, it is expected to support everything from dApps to meme coins and foster a utility ecosystem around Bitcoin.

After validation, the corresponding $BTC is returned to the user's Bitcoin address on Layer 1, ensuring high security.



The best part is, Bitcoin Hyper isn't just an idea. It's already being built, and the team recently announced the launch of the devnet.

It can handle program deployment via Solana CLI, contract calls, transaction flows through the web console, and account state management. The performance remains stable, low latency, and contracts are already being ported over.

$HYPER tokens, which fuel the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, are now available for purchase on the official website at fixed prices, with over $4 million raised so far.

Early movers can secure annual percentage yields (APYs) over 200% through dynamic staking, right from the presale phase. It is designed to decline as more users join the pool, encouraging early participation.

Get $HYPER from the official presale page.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) is another popular altcoin sensation of this week. It operates a Telegram-native bot, best described as a smart trading suite built into chat.

What exactly does that mean? Sub-second swaps, real-time copy trades, and token sniping—all without leaving the messaging app.

$SNORT powers the platform and grants access to advanced tools and significant fee discounts. For context, the fees decrease from 1.5% to just 0.85% for those holding enough tokens, making it more affordable than major competitors.



Snorter takes security seriously, boasting an 85% success rate in beta rugpull and honeypot detection. Blacklist scanners and mint trap alerts provide extra layers of protection.

If the project delivers on its white paper vision, it could offer more depth and access than most existing DeFi platforms.

But early investors looking for an upside don't have time till then. The $SNORT presale is fast selling out with close to $2M raised, and staking yields are juicy at 183%.

Get $SNORT now from the official presale page.

Now trading for $199, Solana (SOL) has recorded a 25% jump in the last seven days alone and outperformed Bitcoin with flair.

Technical indicators show $SOL bulls are in control, flashing strong buy signals across the board. The moving averages, one of the most apparent signs of market strength, indicate 13 out of 14 bullish signals.

Does that mean Solana is ready to reclaim its ATH of $294.33?

It's too early to tell. But in the current climate, it's not a long shot. And it won't be just Solana that benefits from its growing momentum. Platforms that make use of Solana tech are also at an advantage.

A good example is BONK, which has climbed over 20% on the weekly chart. Although still in the presale stages, Snorter Token and Bitcoin Hyper have also witnessed heavy traffic over the last few days.

While BONK has a heavy market cap of $3B, these under-the-radar tokens will be available for fixed, discounted rates before the presales sell out.

Altcoin seasons can be exciting, but only for those who get in early. It's often a mix of regret and FOMO for investors who stay on the sidelines.

What's the smart way to play it?

Start your hunt early, but don't hesitate to trust your instincts. All three altcoins discussed above – $HYPER, $SNORT, and $SOL –– are ripe for a rally.

However, nothing in crypto moves in straight lines. Make sure you have done your research before jumping in.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Blockchain Could Boost Covered Bonds, But Adoption Faces Major Hurdles: Moody's","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/07/22/blockchain-could-boost-covered-bonds-but-adoption-faces-major-hurdles-moodys","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 11:18:23 GMT","

Blockchain technology promises to streamline the issuance and management of covered bonds, but its adoption remains hindered by legal, technical and regulatory barriers, according to a recent report by Moody's Ratings.

The ratings company's report highlights blockchain's potential to enhance operational efficiency and transparency in the covered-bond market. By deploying smart contracts, issuers could automate tasks such as asset substitution, while real-time transaction data could improve investor visibility and shorten bond issuance timelines. 

Moody's notes, however, that current blockchain use is mostly limited to on-chain bond issuance, with key functions like settlement and asset management still reliant on off-chain infrastructure. Fully integrating blockchain technology into covered bond markets remains unlikely in the near term, Moody's said. 

The main obstacles include the need to anchor blockchain systems to off-chain mortgage assets, legal uncertainties around smart contract enforceability, and regulatory concerns over using digital currencies for settlement. Additionally, high issuance costs, legacy IT systems and diverging national legal frameworks further complicate adoption.

Despite the challenges, Moody's suggests that jurisdictions with supportive legal structures and compatible bond programs may be better positioned to embrace blockchain innovation. Until then, the technology's role in the covered bond market will likely remain limited.

 ‘I'm going to devote myself to cryptocurrency mining and get rich.' ‘If blockchain is so good and secure, why are people losing all their money with cryptocurrencies?'

Listening to these comments from teenagers around me, you will understand why I found the discussion ‘The song of the cyber sirens' organised by Espacio Madresfera in collaboration with Fundación Telefónica so appealing. One of its objectives was to ‘explain to the little ones in the house what cryptocurrencies and Blockchain are'. I would like to share some of the key messages presented during the event so that, like me, you can better understand the technological world in which our children, digital natives, are growing up, a world they think they know everything about and which fascinates them so much (the siren song), but which they do not always understand.

The discussion presented by Mónica de la Fuente featured three experts in technology and innovation: Paloma Llaneza, a lawyer specialising in technology and author of books and essays and in the press; María Teresa Nieto, a computer engineer and senior manager in Telefónica Tech's Blockchain team; and Javier López Menacho, a writer and specialist in digital communication.

Paloma Llaneza made it very clear that concepts such as Blockchain, cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence, which may sound like science fiction, are not. They are already here and are part of our lives, even if we do not always realise it. And it is likely that, for our children, they will be as commonplace as mobile phones and the internet are for us today.

Training in these technologies is not just a matter of keeping up to date. Above all, it is a way of protecting ourselves. It helps us to avoid scams, to avoid being manipulated and, most importantly, to prepare young people to live in an increasingly digital, interconnected world… and, yes, also a more complex world due to the speed of progress.

There was also a lot of talk about privacy and data protection, two issues that we often think we understand, but which are actually full of grey areas. The truth is that there are many things happening ‘under the hood' of the technologies we use every day that we often don't even imagine because we don't know about them. And that's no accident. That's why it's crucial to learn more about how and what information or data we provide. Because if we don't, we run the risk that these powerful tools could be used against us, as mechanisms of control or manipulation.

María Teresa Nieto did something that is always appreciated: she explained complex issues in a simple way. She talked about blockchain, which to many of us sounds technical and distant… but which has very specific applications. Thanks to the way it works — a decentralised network where many verify the same thing — it generates trust. It's not magic: it's technology that can help make processes more secure and transparent. And yes, it also eliminates intermediaries, giving people more control and autonomy.

She reminded us that if something is free in the digital world, we are probably the product. We often pay with our attention, our data… or even our freedom to decide. That's why she called on mothers, fathers and teachers to teach children to ask questions, not to settle for the first version, to seek different perspectives in order to build a richer and freer understanding of the world around them.

Listening to her was very revealing. It made me think about how essential it is to approach these issues naturally, without fear and, above all, with words that young people can understand.

Javier López brought a broader, more structural perspective: technology not only transforms what we do, it also changes how we live and how we organise ourselves as a society. It has enormous potential and generates multiple opportunities, but it can also amplify inequalities if we do not accompany it with ethical reflection and limits so that it serves people and not the other way around.

If we allow it to advance unquestioned, we run the risk of it ending up benefiting a few at the expense of many. That is why, beyond enthusiasm for the new, we also need a critical spirit. We need to know when to put the brakes on, when to demand, when to say, ‘No, this is not right.'

Javier also spoke about something that is not mentioned but is just as important: financial education. It is not enough for young people to know what interest or a mortgage is or how the modern economy works. We need to go further. We need to teach them that money is not an end in itself. They need to understand that it is not just for buying things, but a tool for building a life with purpose, well-being… even happiness.

Because in the end, that's what it's all about: using technology and knowledge to live better and benefit people. And to do that, we need to start by learning and educating ourselves. Calmly. Sensibly. And above all, with humanity.

These Madresfera talks always make me think about how I can help my daughter learn about technology. I am committed to learning and preparing myself to guide her as much as possible on this digital adventure (as far as I can). But this is not just about trying to protect her from danger, but also about giving her the tools and knowledge to take advantage of the opportunities that technology offers her.

Once again, I realise how important it is to encourage her to learn and discover things for herself, to be critical of the information she receives, to question it and to understand what lies behind the technologies she uses. Because what we parents want is for our children, as in life in general, to be able to navigate the digital world safely and judiciously, taking advantage of all the benefits of technology, but with knowledge.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) on blockchain empowers individuals to own their digital identities, streamlining KYC/AML processes and enhancing privacy. This approach promises a more secure and user-centric future for financial identity management.


Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) on blockchain empowers individuals to own their digital identities, streamlining KYC/AML processes and enhancing privacy. This approach promises a more secure and user-centric future for financial identity management.

In an interconnected digital economy, identity is paramount. For the financial services sector, verifying who a customer truly is – through rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes – is not merely a regulatory burden but a fundamental pillar of trust and a critical defense against financial crime. Yet, the current identity verification landscape is often fragmented, costly, and privacy-invasive, requiring individuals to repeatedly share sensitive personal data across multiple institutions. This inefficiency creates friction for customers and significant operational overhead and vulnerability for financial firms across the UK, US, and globally.

Enter Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a revolutionary approach to digital identity management, underpinned by the immutable and transparent properties of blockchain technology. SSI shifts control of identity from centralized entities to the individual, empowering them to own, manage, and selectively share their verifiable credentials. This paradigm shift holds the profound potential to transform how financial services approach identity, fostering enhanced privacy, robust security, and unparalleled efficiency in an industry grappling with data proliferation and escalating cyber threats.

Traditional identity management in finance typically relies on centralized databases. When you open an account with a bank, they collect your personal details, verify them, and store them. If you open another account with a different institution, the process largely repeats. This creates:

Self-Sovereign Identity leverages blockchain and cryptographic principles to give individuals ultimate control over their digital identity. Here's how it works:

SSI offers compelling benefits that address critical pain points in the financial sector:

Despite its immense promise, SSI faces hurdles before widespread mainstream adoption in finance:

The momentum behind Self-Sovereign Identity is building, driven by the undeniable need for more secure, private, and efficient identity solutions. Governments, technology giants, and innovative fintechs are actively investing in SSI development and pilot projects. For instance, initiatives exploring digital identity wallets in the UK and EU are paving the way for SSI's integration into broader digital ecosystems, including finance.

Financial institutions that embrace SSI will not only enhance their cybersecurity posture and streamline compliance but also fundamentally differentiate themselves by offering a truly user-centric identity experience. This shift moves beyond mere data protection to genuine data empowerment, fostering deeper trust and unlocking new avenues for secure, seamless digital interactions.

The future of financial services identity will be one where individuals are the custodians of their own verified claims, presenting precisely what's needed, when it's needed, with cryptographic assurance. Self-Sovereign Identity on blockchain is not just a technological advancement; it's a foundational step towards a more secure, private, and equitable financial landscape for everyone.

Ethereum has just marked 10 years since its launch. It rolled out a symbolic NFT called “The Ethereum Torch” to honor its community.

The token will travel from one wallet to another day by day. Then it will be burned to make way for a fresh celebratory NFT that anyone can mint for free.

According to the Ethereum Foundation's X account, Joseph Lubin, a co‑founder of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys, will kick off the torch as its first holder on July 21.

After 24 hours in his wallet, the torch moves on. It will spend 10 days hopping across a selected list of community members. Based on reports, each handover is chosen to show off the network's global reach.

0/ The Ethereum Torch is now lit.

The Torch is an NFT honoring the people and values that have shaped Ethereum's first decade and will help build its future.

It will be symbolically passed from wallet to wallet in the 10 days leading up to Ethereum's 10 year anniversary. pic.twitter.com/nEIY8JOIna

— Ethereum (@ethereum) July 20, 2025



The torch will wrap up its journey on July 30, when the Foundation plans to burn the NFT. That burn is meant to close out one era of the network and launch the next.

After the burn, a brand new torch will be freely claimable through the official Ether website, giving more people a piece of the celebration.

On‑chain data shows a sharp rebound in NFT trading. Total weekly sales across all blockchains topped $110 million last week.

Ethereum projects accounted for about $75 million of that sum. That represents a 300% jump from figures two weeks earlier.

The spike arrived alongside a 50% rise in ETH price since July 6. Collectors and traders are turning back to digital art and collectibles in growing numbers.

Based on reports, this uptick could signal renewed confidence after a weak 2024, when NFT trading fell 18% compared to 2023.

Other blockchains posted mixed results. Bitcoin‑based collectibles hit almost $26 million in weekly volume. That's nearly double the $11 million registered in early July.

Polygon trading made a slight retreat during the same period. These shifts suggest interest is spreading but still centers on major players.

Meanwhile, Cboe BZX has filed an application for a new ETF with Canary Capital. The move would hold PENGU tokens tied to the Pudgy Penguins collection.

CryptoPunks Lead as NFT Trading Volume Rebounds on Solana and Ethereum

NFTs

CryptoPunks and other established NFT projects are seeing renewed interest as the price of leading altcoins rise, with recent activity concentrated on Ethereum and Solana.

The NFT market has cooled drastically in recent years, but Sunday marked its busiest day since February, with $26 million worth of tokenized JPEGs changing hands across Ethereum's ecosystem, according to a Dune dashboard created by Hildebert Moulié, a data scientist at venture firm Dragonfly. On Monday, that was followed up with $24.9 million in trading volume.

Over half of Sunday's trading volume could be attributed to CryptoPunks.app, the official marketplace dedicated to the iconic collection of 10,000 pixelated profile pictures, which have been recognized by museums, auction houses, and luxury brands.

Over the past week, the collection's so-called floor price has jumped 20% to 48 ETH, according to data provider NFT Price Floor. Measured in U.S. dollars, the entry-level price for CryptoPunks has jumped 45% to $177,000, partly due to Ethereum's rising value. Meanwhile, 174 NFTs from the collection changed hands during that span, a 460% increase from the week prior.

In May, a newly established nonprofit called The Infinite Node Foundation acquired the IP to CryptoPunks from Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs, saying it would focus on preserving the collection, engaging with its community, and promoting its brand.

Myriad Markets users broadly believe that the CryptoPunks floor price will remain above the 44 ETH mark through the end of July 25, giving that an 85% chance. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Other collections minted on Ethereum have seen floor prices swell over the past week, including a 38% jump to $56,000 for Pudgy Penguins NFTs, a 26% increase to $6,300 for Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs, and a 64% surge for Fidenza NFTs from generative artist Tyler Hobbs.

Although some spectators on X hope that two days of elevated trading volume could turn into a resurgence for NFTs, which ran red-hot during the pandemic-era crypto boom, there was “some increased activity from December to February, but it wasn't sustained,” Moulié told Decrypt.

With NFT trading volume on OpenSea surging 44% to $9.5 million on Monday from Sunday, however, it appears some traders are chasing the trend. On Monday, NFT marketplace Blur also saw a 120% jump in trading volume from the previous day to $12.8 million.

On Solana, the price of Mad Lads NFTs has increased 27% over the past week to $6,800, while the floor price of Clarnosaurz NFTs has risen 47% to $2,100, and the entry-level Solana Monkey Business Gen2 NFTs has jumped 43% to $4,000, among gains for other collections.

In total, $9.3 million worth of Solana-based NFTs sales have taken place on secondary markets over the past seven days, a 59% increase, according to CryptoSlam. Ethereum-based NFTs have meanwhile seen $105 million in sales, a 50% increase over the same period of time.

Although trading volume has decreased over the past week, Bitcoin-based collectibles have seen floor prices tick up as well. The floor price for Ordinals collection Taproot Wizards has climbed 26% to $26,700 over the past week, and 10% to $4,800 for Bitcoin Puppets.

The NFT market may be glittering as Ethereum and Solana rise, but notably, no NFT collection referenced in this article is close to setting an all-time high floor price. And although Sunday and Monday's trading volumes were the most robust in months, the daily stat has spiked above $50 million four times within the past year, per Moulié's dashboard.

Flagship non-fungible token (NFT) collection CryptoPunks is leading the charge as Ethereum-based NFTs rally on the back of ETH's strong price performance.

The CryptoPunks floor now stands at 47.7 ETH ($180,000) after the collection recorded $13.6 million in volume on Sunday, as a fresh wallet swept 45 CryptoPunks for almost $8 million, along with $250,000 worth of Chromie Squiggle NFTs.

Due to the large sweep and subsequent buys from other users, CryptoPunks' single-day volume hit its highest level since November 2024, according to CryptoSlam.

Other notable NFT collections are also on the move, with Pudgy Penguins surging 90% to 16.2 ETH from 8.5 ETH over the last two weeks. Meanwhile, Moonbirds NFTs, which were originally launched by Kevin Rose in 2021, soared as much as 280% to a high of 1.9 ETH from 0.5 ETH over the last two weeks, fueled by increased attention and activations in the ecosystem driven by the project's new owners, Orange Cap Games.

Today's NFT market has a slightly different dynamic compared to the NFT boom in 2021 and 2022, with most leading profile picture collections now touting fungible ERC-20 tokens in addition to their NFT collections. 

While the performance of these tokens has been largely underwhelming, the leading NFT collection tokens are also attracting renewed investor interest, led by Pudgy Penguins' PENGU token.

PENGU rallied another 18.5% on Monday to a $2.3 billion market capitalization, and has been one of the memecoin space's top performers over the last month. Other NFT tokens such as APE, DOOD, CULT and ANIME - from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, Doodles, Milady, and Azuki ecosystems, respectively - are also up between 3% and 30% over the last 24 hours.

 Pump.fun whales have sent over $160 million in tokens to exchanges as PUMP drops below its ICO price, triggering fears of a broader memecoin market correction. 

Private sale investors of the Pump.fun (PUMP) memecoin began offloading billions of tokens to exchanges, raising concerns of a sell-off as the token dropped below its initial sale value. 

Blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain flagged that two early backers of the memecoin token, labeled in Solscan as “PUMP Top Fund 1” and “PUMP Top Fund 2,” collectively sent over $160 million in PUMP tokens to centralized exchanges. 

During the private sale, the Top Fund 1 wallet acquired 25 billion tokens for $100 million in USDC (USDC). In the last week, the wallet deposited 17 billion tokens worth almost $90 million to exchanges. While the whale started offloading, it still holds tokens worth $29.5 million. 

The second wallet bought 12.5 billion tokens for $50 million during the private sale, and offloaded the entire stash worth over $71 million to exchanges. 

While the PUMP token showed bullish signs immediately after its launch, it also began to display the effects of a high unlock percentage. 

CoinGecko data shows that in the last seven days, the token's value decreased to an all-time low of $0.003642 on Friday. This represents a 46.5% drop from its all-time high of 0.006812 and a 32% decrease since its launch on July 15. 

Its current price point also shows a 7% decrease compared to its initial coin offering (ICO) price of $0.004. This means that presale investors who haven't sold their tokens are facing unrealized losses. 

On July 13, Pump.fun raised almost $500 million from its initial coin offering of the PUMP token, selling out in 12 minutes. However, some participants seemed eager to offload their tokens after the ICO. 

On Thursday, BitMEX shared onchain data showing that nearly 60% of PUMP presale participants sold or transferred their tokens to exchanges or other wallets. At the time, 37.4% of the presale participants held onto their tokens, while 3% continued to increase their holdings. 

BitMEX analysts said PUMP's appreciation post-launch defied expectations because of its high unlock percentage during launch. BitMEX said large floats often lead to strong downward pressure in derivatives markets.

Meanwhile, the broader memecoin sector has begun to show signs of slowing. CoinMarketCap data shows that the overall market capitalization for memecoins peaked at $87 billion on Monday, up 58% from its value of $55 billion on June 30. 

This was followed by a quick drop to a low of $81 billion on Tuesday. At the time of writing, the memecoin sector's market cap is at $82 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.  

Anthony Anzalone, the founder and CEO of the layer-1 blockchain network Xion, previously told Cointelegraph that the increase in the memecoin market cap showed that capital doesn't have anywhere better to flow.

Just over a week after launch, Pump.fun's token has stooped below its initial coin offering price—which raised $600 million in just 12 minutes earlier this month. This means that everyone who bought the token in that sale is now at a loss.

It comes as PUMP has dropped 15% over the past 24 hours, according to DEX Screener, to a price of $0.003767. That's 5% lower than the ICO valuation of $0.004. It comes as the Pump.fun community appears to be growing restless that an airdrop date hasn't been announced, and the platform continues to lose market share to new rival LetsBonk.

Pump.fun is a Solana launchpad that allows anyone to create a token by filling out a short form, free of charge. Over its 18-month lifespan, Pump.fun has generated $774 million in revenue and been used to create nearly 12 million tokens. That's why its initial coin offering sold out in just 12 minutes, its token launch was hotly anticipated, and its confirmed airdrop was eagerly awaited.

Following its launch last Monday, the PUMP token surged 72% from its ICO price to a high price of $0.006878. In part, this jump in value was spurred by a day of buybacks worth $19.24 million from Pump.fun. Since then, the buybacks have decreased in size—to just $125,000 on Sunday—and the token's value has sagged 45% from its all-time high.

In the official token announcement, Pump.fun confirmed that an airdrop was “coming soon.” Now, just over a week since the token launch and two weeks from the announcement, it appears that users are growing restless due to the lack of details.

Posts from the official Pump.fun X account, as well as the platform's co-founder, Alon Cohen, are being spammed by users demanding information about the airdrop, or just asking for PUMP's price to increase.

Cohen has also shared a couple of cryptic posts that have brought out the conspiracy theorists in the community. One post showed the co-founder's profile picture pointing to a pyramid of Pump.fun pills, and as the theories flew about, Cohen added, “Think harder.”

“They said it would be on the 2nd, then the 12th, then the 15th, now they're saying the 2nd again,” Cohen wrote in a second post. “Maybe you'll figure it out.”

think harder

— alon (@a1lon9) July 20, 2025



PUMP is now the 99th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, per CoinGecko, and is close to falling out of the top 100. Last week, its valuation was comparable to Solana meme coin BONK, which is currently the 54th biggest coin on the market.

LetsBonk, the BONK community's Pump.fun competitor, has been responsible for the majority of tokens created via a Solana launchpad for 14 out of the last 15 days. This is the longest period that a rival launchpad has dominated market share—and not through a lack of trying.

Over the past 14 days, BONK has climbed 56.7% in valuation to a $2.7 billion market cap, over double that of PUMP at $1.3 billion. As a result, predictors on Myriad Markets believe that it is essentially guaranteed, or 96% likely, that BONK will have a larger market cap than PUMP by the end of the month.

That's according to a report Tuesday (July 22) from Bloomberg News, which calls this the latest sign of declining enthusiasm for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) around the world.

The central bank (BOE) has been quietly pushing the financial sector to instead focus on payment innovations that could yield similar benefits without the creation of a CBDC, the report said, citing sources familiar with the matter.

Those sources said the BOE wants to be prepared to debut a digital pound if it is someday warranted, but is willing to hold off if private businesses keep introducing new digital payment technologies. A spokesperson for the BOE declined to comment when reached by PYMNTS.

Bloomberg notes that this marks a shift in the bank's tone, as the BOE had said two years ago that it was “likely” the country would need a CBDC.

However, BOE Governor Andrew Bailey has recently expressed doubts about CBDCs and has instead focused on banks offering tokenized deposits, the report added.

There are indications the CBDC efforts haven't completely faded. The bank's recently published Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy  includes a section on payments which notes: “Continuing exploration of a digital pound: the UK's potential retail central bank digital currency, which could support innovation and competition in payments.”

England isn't the only place where interest in state-backed digital currencies is declining amid the rise of stablecoins. Among them is South Korea, which has paused its CBDC effort amid a new focus on stablecoins, according to an earlier Bloomberg report.

And as PYMNTS wrote last week, the recent passage of the GENIUS Act shows that “the political momentum favors stablecoins,” rather than central banks.

Several Republicans had wanted to include a provision in the act that would have banned the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. That proposal didn't make it into the act, though Congress agreed to link the Anti-CBDC bill to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), widely seen as a “must-pass” piece of legislation.

“The U.S. plans to use stablecoins as a means of maintaining the hegemony of the U.S. Dollar and by dollarising economies around the world from the ground up,” Simon McLoughlin, CEO of Uphold, wrote on LinkedIn. “The passing of this bill throws the weight of the world's largest economy behind blockchain technology and digital assets.”

Still, not every banking institution has thrown their support behind stablecoins. For example, a recent Bank for International Settlements report argued that the digital currencies “perform poorly” as a form of sound money.

“The document argued that most stablecoins fail critical criteria for a currency, such as price stability, universal acceptability and trust. It also pointed to the fact that stablecoins are frequently exploited by criminals and lack the elasticity of credit that underpins modern financial systems,” PYMNTS wrote.

The Bank of England (BoE) is reassessing its plans for a digital pound, as officials question whether launching a new form of money is worth the effort, especially with the private sector rapidly advancing payment technologies.

The Bank of England has been exploring the idea of a digital pound, often dubbed a “Britcoin,” as a government-backed digital version of the British pound.

However, according to Bloomberg, officials have also been privately urging the banking industry to prioritize payment innovations that could achieve similar outcomes without the need to issue a retail CBDC.

The BoE isn't abandoning its CBDC plans entirely. The bank aims to remain prepared to launch a digital pound if necessary, but may scale back the effort if private firms continue to advance electronic payment technologies that offer comparable benefits.

At a Parliamentary hearing on Tuesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey expressed doubt over the necessity of a digital pound. He indicated that if ongoing collaboration with commercial banks proves successful, it would be difficult to justify introducing a new form of money.

“I think that's a sensible place to do it,” Bailey told the Treasury Committee. “If that's a success, I question why we need to introduce a new form of money.”

The central bank and government will make a final decision after completing the current design phase.

This marks a shift from previous years, when Bank of England and Treasury officials considered a digital pound “likely” to be needed.

The change comes amid waning global momentum for state-backed digital currencies.

In the US, the Trump administration has intensified efforts to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar. During “Crypto Week,” the House passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, a bill aimed at halting progress on an American CBDC.

South Korea's central bank has also halted its digital currency pilot program.

In contrast, the European Central Bank continues to pursue a digital euro.

Recent BoE research indicates diminished benefits from launching a CBDC. Senior officials, including Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden and Treasury's director general for financial services Gwyneth Nurse, have reduced their involvement in the CBDC Engagement Forum, sending lower-ranking staff instead.

The project has faced various challenges, including privacy concerns and fears about potential destabilizing effects if investors rush to state-backed digital currencies during crises.

Bailey has shown support for a wholesale CBDC for financial institutions while remaining skeptical about a retail version. He has, however, expressed concerns about foreign stablecoins potentially gaining popularity in the UK and undermining trust in traditional currencies.

Pakistan has launched a new digital asset industry regulator in its latest effort to become the Asian ‘crypto' hub.

The Pakistani government has moved rapidly this year to create an enabling environment for digital assets. In March, it launched the Pakistan Crypto Council to champion the sector's interests. Two months later, it revealed it was working on a new oversight body, then known as the Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA).

This initiative has now culminated in the Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority (PVARA), which will supervise, monitor, and license virtual asset service providers (VASPs), ensuring compliance with local regulations and international standards from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and others.

According to local outlet Dawn, PVARA was approved by the federal Cabinet this week.

“Once legislated, the authority will be responsible for issuing licences, supervising VASPs, setting technical standards, and coordinating compliance with FATF, IMF, and World Bank guidelines,” a statement from the Ministry of Finance said on Tuesday.

A separate statement on Thursday revealed that PVARA had been formed through President Asif Ali Zardari's approval of the Virtual Assets Ordinance, 2025. In Pakistan, the president has the authority to issue an ordinance on any urgent issue, and it doesn't have to go through parliament. The ordinance will remain in effect for four months before legislators require it to be ratified.

The ordinance defines PVARA as “an autonomous federal body empowered to license, regulate and supervise entities dealing in virtual assets.”

It further prescribes that any VASP that intends to serve Pakistani investors must obtain a license from the watchdog. PVARA must introduce a new licensing framework with clear guidelines on operational capacity, compliance obligations, and reporting frameworks.

“The ordinance also incorporates a framework for responsible innovation by establishing a regulatory sandbox, allowing emerging technologies and business models to be tested under supervisory oversight,” the statement from the Finance Ministry added.

PVARA can allow some VASPs to experiment with specific products for a defined period through a relief letter, similar to regulatory sandboxes.

Pakistan already has a sandbox established by the central bank in May. However, it caters to the entire financial services industry and is not specific to ‘crypto' firms.









 
PVARA will comprise the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the chairpersons of the Federal Board of Revenue and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Pakistan Digital Authority, launched earlier this year to drive the country's digital transformation agenda, will also be a member.

Others include the secretaries of key ministries such as finance, justice, and Information and Communication Technology (ICT). Additionally, the government will appoint two independent directors with longstanding expertise in digital assets and financial technology.

With Pakistan being an Islamic state, the ordinance mandates the formation of a Sharia Advisory Committee to advise PVARA on issues relating to Sharia compliance.

VASPs that oppose PVARA's decisions and guidelines can appeal to the Virtual Assets Appellate Tribunal, whose rulings must be independent and unbiased, as per the new ordinance.

Pakistan eyes CBDC

Amid the rapid digital asset adoption, the SBP plans to launch a pilot for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Governor Jameel Ahmad has revealed.

The governor spoke at the Reuters NEXT Asia summit, held in Singapore, on Wednesday, where he said the central bank has been building up its capacity for a digital rupee and that it would commence the pilot soon.

Unlike some of its Asian peers, like China and Thailand, Pakistan has dragged its feet on the CBDC front. Despite first announcing it was exploring a digital rupee in 2019, little has come of its efforts. In 2023, the SBP said it would accelerate the project, aiming for a 2025 launch, but yet again, the project stalled.

While Pakistan remains hesitant, others like Australia are picking up pace. On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced that it had selected over a dozen participants for Project Acacia, its wholesale CBDC and tokenized deposits project.

The participants include Westpac Banking Corporation, Fireblocks, Northern Trust (NASDAQ: NTRS), Australian Payments Plus, and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

The pilot will test 24 use cases, 19 of which involve transactions in real assets and real money, and five proof-of-concept (PoC) use cases involving simulated transactions.

“The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia,” commented Brad Jones, the RBA Assistant Governor.

Last week the House passed the GENIUS Act, which will boost the growth of stablecoins, thereby paving the way for future scams and financial crises. On Thursday the House also passed a bill that would bar the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency (CBDC), or even studying the idea.

Why are Republicans so terrified by the idea of a CBDC that they're literally ordering the Fed to stop even thinking about it?

In 2022 the Fed issued a preliminary report on the possibility of creating a CBDC, which it described as “analogous to a digital form of paper money.” Currently, Americans are able to hold and spend one form of Federal Reserve liability: green pieces of paper bearing pictures of dead presidents. A CBDC would expand that right, allowing us to hold and spend deposits at the Fed, which, like all deposits these days, would just be digital records.

If this sounds outlandish, you should realize that we already have what amounts to central bank digital currency — but only for financial institutions. Banks maintain accounts at the Fed and can transfer funds to each other via an electronic payments system. Why shouldn't comparable facilities be made available to individuals and nonfinancial companies?

Republicans say that they're worried about invasion of privacy, that a CBDC would open the door to widespread government surveillance. But remember, these are the people who have handed over personal Medicaid data to ICE to facilitate arrests and abductions. If you think they're deeply concerned about potential surveillance, I have some Trump family memecoins you might want to buy.

I'd also point out that the government can access private bank records under certain circumstances and certainly has the technological ability to watch every financial move you make. The only thing that keeps it from doing so is the law, specifically the Right to Financial Privacy Act. If we ever do create a CBDC, it will surely involve comparable privacy protection. Either you trust in rule of law or you don't.

What Republicans are really afraid of, with good reason, is the likelihood that many people would prefer a CBDC to private bank accounts, especially but not only stablecoins. And in general any attempt to create a full-fledged CBDC would run into fierce opposition from the financial industry.

But what about the possibility of creating a partial CBDC? Could we retain private bank accounts but provide an efficient, publicly-run system for making payments out of those accounts?

Yes, we could. We know this because Brazil has already done it.

Most people probably don't think of Brazil as a leader in financial innovation. But Brazil's political economy is clearly very different from ours — for example, they actually put former presidents who try to overturn elections on trial. And the interest groups whose power, for now at least, makes a U.S. digital currency impossible appear to have much less sway there. Brazil is, in fact, planning to create a CBDC. As a first step, back in 2020 it introduced Pix, a digital payment system run by the central bank.

As I understand it, Pix is sort of like a publicly run version of Zelle, the payment system operated by a consortium of U.S. private banks. But Pix is much easier to use. And while Zelle is big, Pix has become simply huge, used by a reported 93 percent of Brazilian adults. It appears to be rapidly displacing both cash and cards:

Source: The Economist

And why not? According to an IMF report,

· Pix transactions take place almost instantaneously. A Pix payment settles in 3 seconds on average versus 2 days for debit cards and 28 days for credit cards.

and

· Transaction costs are low. The authorities have set a requirement on Pix to be free for individuals, and the cost of a payment transaction for firms/merchants is only 0.33 percent of the transaction amount, versus 1.13 percent for debit cards and 2.34 percent for credit cards.

I can't help noticing that Pix is actually achieving what cryptocurrency boosters claimed, falsely, to be able to deliver through the blockchain — low transaction costs and financial inclusion. Compare the 93 percent of Brazilians using Pix to the 2 percent, that's right, 2 percent of Americans who used cryptocurrency to buy something or make a payment in 2024.

Oh, and using Pix doesn't create an incentive to kidnap people and torture them until they give up their crypto keys.

So, will we get a Pix-type system in the United States? No. Or at least not for a long time, for two reasons.

First, the U.S. financial industry just has too much power, and would never allow a public system to compete with its products — even, or actually especially, if the public system is superior. In fact, the Trump administration suggests that Pix's mere existence in Brazil constitutes unfair competition for U.S. credit and debit card companies.

Second, the U.S. right is firmly committed to the view that the government is always the problem, never the solution. Republicans will never, ever admit that a government-operated payments system might be better than private-sector alternatives.

Other nations may well learn from Brazil's success in developing a digital payment system. But America will probably remain trapped by a combination of vested interests and crypto fantasies.

MUSICAL CODA

I'm from Brazil and I study together with law professors at Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) the Monetary System here and the role of Brazilian Central Bank. I did a research in 2023 regarding the CDBC (now called Drex), and the stage of development is really impressive. Pix is already a success as you mentioned, and Drex has been tested for the wholesale model. I'm very happy to see a Nobel laureate professor as you talking about that and recognizing the innovation in Brazil's monetary system.

I knew ex GI's  from WWII who hated German products or who refused to buy Japanese cars well into the 1990s. In similar fashion, I will hate Republicans for the rest of my life.

President Donald Trump is using his public office to fill his private coffers with billions. Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) said Monday it has accumulated roughly $2 billion in bitcoin and related assets, as Trump's highly lucrative pivot to cryptocurrency continues to grow his net worth while in office.

In a press release, the company said that the bitcoin holdings now account for about two-thirds of Trump Media's total liquid assets.

“As a stakeholder in crypto assets, President Trump will likely profit from the very policies he is pursuing,” the advocacy group Democracy Defenders Fund said in a report in April.

Before taking office in January, Trump transferred all DJT shares to the revocable trust managed by Trump Jr. Since then, Trump Media has effectively redefined itself as a cryptocurrency and financial services company.

“We're rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in Monday's release.

“These assets help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,” Nunes said.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) crypto holdings overview

Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Truth Social, has made significant moves into the cryptocurrency space, holding approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and related digital assets. This represents about two-thirds of the company's $3 billion in liquid assets, highlighting crypto as a core part of DJT's financial strategy.

Alongside these holdings, DJT has invested around $300 million in Bitcoin options with plans to convert these options into spot Bitcoin depending on market conditions. The company has also filed to launch three cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in partnership with Crypto.com, aiming to broaden its crypto footprint and offer new investment vehicles.

Beyond Bitcoin, DJT has expanded its crypto portfolio by introducing a meme coin called $TRUMP on the Solana blockchain. An initial 200 million coins were released to the public, while an additional 800 million coins remain held by Trump-affiliated entities. This move into meme coins has sparked concern among ethics experts due to potential conflicts of interest, as it blurs lines between political influence and business ventures. Still, the company's crypto initiatives continue to grow, reflecting a broader push to embrace emerging digital finance trends.

DJT also launched Truth.Fi, a fintech platform that offers investment products. Truth.Fi plans to provide various investment options including separately managed accounts, ETFs, and direct cryptocurrency investments with funds managed by Charles Schwab. This aggressive focus on digital assets and investment products demonstrates DJT's ambition to diversify its financial portfolio while capitalizing on the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. However, the company's strong crypto positioning has raised questions about the overlap between its political ties and financial interests, highlighting challenges at the intersection of business, politics, and emerging technologies.

US stock prices for companies involved in the cryptocurrency sector closed higher on Monday, with ICG leading the gains by surging over 13%. This upward trend in the crypto concept stocks reflects a broader market sentiment that is increasingly optimistic about the potential of digital currencies and blockchain technology. The surge in ICG's stock price is particularly noteworthy, as it indicates strong investor confidence in the company's prospects within the crypto space.

Several factors contributed to the rise in crypto concept stocks. Firstly, there has been a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class, with more institutional investors entering the market. This increased participation has led to a surge in demand for stocks related to the crypto industry. Secondly, recent regulatory developments have provided a more favorable environment for crypto companies, reducing uncertainty and encouraging investment. Additionally, technological advancements in blockchain technology have opened up new possibilities for its application, further fueling investor interest.

ICG's significant gain of over 13% is a testament to the company's strategic positioning within the crypto market. The company has been actively involved in developing innovative solutions that leverage blockchain technology, which has resonated well with investors. ICG's focus on cutting-edge technology and its ability to adapt to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape have positioned it as a leader in the industry. The company's strong performance on Monday underscores its potential for continued growth and success in the crypto sector.

The overall positive sentiment in the crypto concept stocks market is a reflection of the broader trend towards digital transformation. As more industries embrace blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, the demand for related stocks is likely to continue rising. Investors are increasingly recognizing the long-term potential of the crypto industry, which has led to a surge in investment in companies that are at the forefront of this technological revolution. The recent gains in crypto concept stocks, including ICG's impressive performance, are indicative of this growing trend and suggest that the market is poised for further growth in the coming months.

If you or someone you know has invested in cryptocurrency, here's an urgent warning: scammers are using fake text messages that appear to come from Coinbase to steal from crypto wallets.

I received one myself. The message looked like an alert from Coinbase, sharing a “withdrawal code”, suggesting someone was trying to access my account. It looked urgent and official. For a second, I believed it.

That's exactly what scammers are hoping for.

These messages, part of a growing scam called smishing (SMS phishing), are sent out by the thousands. They often include a link or a phone number and tell you there's been suspicious activity in your account. But tapping the link or calling the number leads you directly into the scam.

If you aren't familiar with Coinbase, it's one of the largest and most trusted cryptocurrency platforms in the world. It provides a secure wallet where users store crypto like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Coinbase has strong, bank-level security and offers two-factor authentication. But in early 2025, the company confirmed a breach involving third-party attackers who obtained names, email addresses, and phone numbers of some users. That data is now being used to make these scams more believable.

Here's how it works:
A scammer sends a text that looks like a Coinbase alert. It may say someone is trying to access your account, or that a withdrawal is in process. It includes a phone number to call or a link to tap. Once you engage, you'll be asked to verify your identity or share a one-time code. That code is your two-factor authentication, and once the scammer has it, they can log in and transfer your crypto elsewhere. The money is gone, and there's no way to get it back.

The FTC reports that Americans lost nearly $470 million to text scams in 2024 alone. And Coinbase-specific scams have accounted for over $300 million in losses annually. Worse, research shows that about 17% of people who receive scam texts end up falling for them.

So what can you do?

These scams are sophisticated and getting more common. If you get a message like this, report it to the FTC and to Coinbase. Forward scam texts to 7726 to alert your mobile carrier.

Once your crypto is stolen, it's gone, and the bad guys are impossible to catch. Taking a few extra steps can help keep your wallet and your money safe.

                    The move comes as other major U.S. banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, are developing stablecoins [File]

JPMorgan Chase is exploring plans to offer loans backed by clients' cryptocurrency holdings, including bitcoin and ether, as early as next year, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The move comes as other major U.S. banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, are developing stablecoins amid a broader push for more crypto-friendly regulation in Washington.

CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime bitcoin skeptic, recently said that the bank will be involved in stablecoins.

JPMorgan declined to comment to the FT. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment outside regular business hours.

In May, Dimon told investors that he is ""not a fan"" of the bitcoin universe citing concerns, including leverage, misuse, and money laundering issues in the system, ruling out getting into custody, storing crypto assets for clients, or expanding significantly even if regulations ease.

""We're going to allow you to buy it, we're not going to custody it,"" he said, likening the approach to permitting behavior he personally disagrees with.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","JPMorgan Plans to Let Clients Borrow Money by Pledging Their BTC and ETH: Report","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/22/jpmorgan-plans-to-launch-crypto-backed-loans-report","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 04:55:54 GMT","

JPMorgan is eyeing a major expansion into crypto-backed lending and is considering offering loans secured directly by clients' cryptocurrency assets—including bitcoin BTC$118,867.39 and ether (ETH), according to a report by the Financial Times.

With the bullish crypto regulatory environment under the Trump administration, JPMorgan may launch these crypto‑backed loans as soon as next year, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Traditionally cautious, JPMorgan already allows clients to borrow against crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).

This next phase would deepen its commitment to digital assets, marking a shift under CEO Jamie Dimon's leadership — who infamously labeled bitcoin a “fraud” eight years ago

Last week, Jamie Dimon said that the bank plans to get more involved in stablecoins, even as he questioned their practical utility compared to traditional payments.

CoinDesk was not able to contact JPMorgan for comment.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","XRP, SOL Price Analysis: ETH Prints Doji as XRP Teases Temporary Double Top at $3.65","https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/07/22/ether-prints-doji-as-xrp-teases-double-top-at-usd3-65","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:13:48 GMT","

This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Ether's (ETH) Doji candle on Monday signals indecision in the market following a near 90-degree rise from $2,100 to $3,800 in less than four weeks. The pattern has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook, establishing Monday's high of $3,859 as the level to beat for the bulls. Note that the $3,800-$4,100 range is where ether topped out in March 2024, May 2024 and December 2024.

While prices remain below Monday's high, the focus will be on the bearish shift in intraday indicators and the possibility of a notable price pullback. Price action on the 15-minute candlestick chart indicates a breakdown of the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. The bearish pattern suggests a potential price drop to $3,550. 

Supporting the interim bear case is the hourly chart, where prices have crossed below the Ichimoku cloud, signaling a bearish shift in momentum.

Since Friday, XRP XRP$3.5168 has largely traded within a range, with upside capped above $3.6 and support at around $3.35. The sideways churn resembles a typical temporary bull breather observed after strong rallies. That said, on the hourly chart, it has taken the shape of a double top, a bearish reversal pattern identified by twin peaks separated by a valley (price drop).

A move below $3.35 would trigger the double top breakdown, potentially opening the door for an extended pullback to $3. The Guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) indicator has already flipped bearish on the hourly chart, suggesting greater odds of a double top breakdown.

On the higher side, a convincing move above $3.65 would signal the continuation of the bull run that has seen prices surge 54% to record highs this month.

Bitcoin BTC$118,867.39 continues to consolidate in a descending triangle, identified by a downward-sloping trendline connecting lower highs since July 14, and another trendline connecting the horizontal support at around $116,000.

A move past the upper trendline would signal the end of the bull breather, potentially yielding a rally to record highs above $123,000. Conversely, a downside break would raise the risk of a deeper pullback, with major support seen directly at $111,965, the former record high from May.

Solana's SOL (SOL) has pulled back to $194 from the five-month high of $204 early today, printing a daily candle with a long upper wick, a sign of sellers looking to reassert themselves. Key momentum indicators, such as the hourly chart MACD, have flipped decisively bearish, suggesting scope for an extended decline toward the former resistance-turned-support level at $185. The broader outlook remains constructive, as prices remain above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and are locked in an ascending channel.

Solana SOL$201.56 surged past the $200 mark for the first time since March, as network player Jito introduced the Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM), a move that some observers said boosted investor interest in SOL.

The token jumped nearly 9% in the past 24 hours, peaking at $203 before slight profit-taking. SOL's rally was backed by strong flows into derivatives, with the SOL CD20 product posting an 8.87% gain and volume nearly tripling to 4.87 million units, per CoinDesk Analytics.

The breakout followed the announcement of BAM, a new high-performance block-building architecture developed by Jito Labs and the Jito Foundation. Scheduled to go live in the coming weeks, BAM introduces a dedicated layer for transaction sequencing, promising faster execution, minimized MEV, and programmable control over blockspace.

“Solana surged past an important price level at $200 after the announcement of the Block Assembly Marketplace, which would create a new system for transaction processing,” shared Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a note to CoinDesk. “Investors were bullish as the development would greatly enhance the efficiency of Solana transactions with more privacy and flexibility across the network.”“Traders believe that Solana has been oversold as developers continue to build on the blockchain despite the downfall of the memecoin market. We're optimistic that Solana can rise higher as an innovative hub with new opportunities for developers and traders,” Ruck added.

At a technical level, BAM relies on a network of scheduler nodes using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to privately sequence transactions before they reach validators.

This means the use of nodes that privately decide the order of transactions before they hit the main Solana network, helping avoid front-running and ensuring fairness.

Additionally, BAM introduces a plugin system that allows developers to create custom rules for sorting transactions, whether that involves prioritizing specific types of trades, bundling orders, or charging for access. In short, blockspace becomes programmable, and anyone building on Solana can now earn money by shaping how that space is used.

Meanwhile, strength in SOL stems from an increase in institutional interest.Weekly inflows into SOL investment products hit $39 million, with pre-commitments to the proposed REX-Osprey SOL ETF now totaling over $73 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that 2.95 million SOL, worth approximately $531 million, have been accumulated by corporate wallets so far in July.

SOL is now up more than 33% in July, outperforming both bitcoin and ether. And technical improvements, such as the rollout of BAM, may continue to boost tailwinds.

 Telegram rolls out TON Wallet to US users, enabling self-custodial crypto transactions, DeFi access and off-ramp features within the app. 

Telegram began rolling out its native cryptocurrency wallet to users in the US, marking a significant expansion of its blockchain-based services. 

Built on The Open Network (TON) blockchain, TON Wallet is the first self-custodial crypto wallet to be integrated into a major social platform available to US users, according to a Tuesday news release shared with Cointelegraph.

Supported by the TON Foundation, the wallet allows users to send, receive and store digital assets directly within the Telegram app, eliminating the need for external downloads or browser extensions, according to the announcement.

With access to TON Wallet, American users can now interact with the broader TON ecosystem, which includes a variety of applications ranging from gaming and payments to decentralized finance (DeFi) and digital marketplaces. The integration allows users to explore blockchain technology without leaving the Telegram interface, the company said.

TON Wallet allows users to transfer USDT (USDT), Toncoin (TON) and other TON-based tokens, including non-fungible tokens.

Transactions function similarly to sending a regular message, and users maintain full control of their private keys through the wallet's self-custodial design, the company said.

Additional features include built-in trading tools via Omniston and Ston.fi, token staking through third-party integrations and 0% fees on USDT purchases made through Apple Pay, Google Pay or credit cards using MoonPay.

For the first time, TON Wallet also offers an off-ramp feature that enables users to withdraw crypto funds directly to their bank cards.

Egor Danilov, chief product officer at The Open Platform and Telegram Wallet, told Cointelegraph that the wallet is the primary gateway to TON's Mini Apps. “The wallet is pivotal in connecting users with payments, games and onchain tools, all within a familiar environment they interact with daily.”

He also highlighted efforts to safeguard users against scams and phishing. “We're soon introducing features such as whitelists, blacklists, transaction emulation and other advanced fraud detection tools to help users make safer choices before confirming transactions,” he said.

Beyond its utility as a personal wallet, TON Wallet is expected to play a larger role in Telegram's in-app economy and support the expansion of Mini Apps.

Outside the US and Europe, Telegram has already added the wallet to its main menu, making it available to users across Asia and Russia. According to the company, over 100 million users globally activated the wallet in 2024. Sensor Tower data shows that Telegram has more than 87 million users in the US, presenting a substantial growth opportunity for the wallet.

TON Wallet was primarily developed by The Open Platform, a tech company focused on creating Web3 apps for Telegram. On July 3, The Open Platform announced its successful $28.5 million Series A funding round, achieving a $1 billion valuation. The round was led by fintech specialist Ribbit Capital, with participation from prominent crypto venture capital firm Pantera Capital.

 PancakeSwap Infinity, the latest version of the DEX, has launched on Coinbase's Base network as its TVL and DEX activity hit all-time highs. 

PancakeSwap Infinity, the fourth version of the PancakeSwap decentralized exchange (DEX), has made it to Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network, Base.

According to a Tuesday announcement shared with Cointelegraph, PancakeSwap Infinity is now live on Base. The announcement follows the launch of PancakeSwap Infinity on BNB Chain at the end of April.

The announcement comes as Base's total value locked (TVL) reached a new high of $4.295 billion, according to DefiLlama data. This represents a 33.75% increase from its TVL of $3.211 billion reported on Jan. 1.

Base's growth in TVL was accompanied by an increase in decentralized exchange volume on the protocol. According to DefiLlama data, the Base DEX volume reached a new high of $1.616 billion over the latest 24 hours.

The announcement follows the launch of PancakeSwap one-click crosschain swaps using the Across Protocol. The supported networks were BNB Chain, Arbitrum and Base.

PancakeSwap had not responded to Cointelegraph's request for comment by publication.

PancakeSwap Infinity is a multichain protocol and features multiple pool types aiming to serve different liquidity strategies. The updated PancakeSwap protocol also allows for fee structure personalization.

The new protocol also promises lower fees. The announcement claims up to 99% of fee savings on pool creation and about 50% on trading Ether (ETH) against ERC-20 tokens.

The update introduces hooks, which are smart contract plug-ins that can be linked to liquidity pools. Those smart contract hooks are executed before or after key events such as pool creation, the addition or removal of liquidity, swaps or donations.

Hooks enable developers to add custom logic to pools, implementing rebate schemes, dynamic fees or onchain limit orders without requiring direct edits to the core automated market maker implementation. With hooks being external to the main contract, pool administrators can deploy them independently.

Base has seen a heightened level of activity recently. In May, the platform briefly processed over 1,000 transactions per second, bringing it closer to the performance of layer-1 blockchain Solana.

Last month, Naveen Mallela, an executive at JPMorgan's blockchain division, Kinexys, said that the organization chose the Base network to pilot its deposit token, JPMD. This month, Kinexys' head of blockchain payments innovation, Nelli Zaltsman, said the company is aiming to integrate institutional-grade payments infrastructure with emerging onchain assets.

 Bitcoin price consolidation after a powerful rally to record highs is normal. Will the current bull pennant confirm and send BTC beyond $136,000? 

Key takeaways:

A Bitcoin price pullback to $115,000 is possible before continuing the uptrend.

A bull pennant suggests that the BTC price could rally by 15% to new highs above $136,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent most of the week pinned below $120,000, which many analysts have labelled as a key resistance zone. However, a new technical setup suggests that BTC is likely consolidating within a bull pennant before resuming its uptrend.

Bitcoin rallied by 14% between July 8 and Saturday to reach an all-time high of nearly $123,000. Since then, BTC price has pulled back, consolidating between the all-time high and $115,000.

The latest data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC trading inside a bull pennant, suggesting that the final “explosive phase” is next.

Bitcoin is in a “bull pennant breakout targeting $140,000,” said popular crypto trader Titan of Crypto in a Monday post on X. 

Related: Bitcoin bull run 'likely close to over' says trader as XRP flips McDonald's

A bull pennant is a continuation pattern that occurs after a significant rise, followed by a consolidation period at the higher price end of the range.

A positive breakout from the pennant could potentially lead to the next leg up for Bitcoin, measured at $136,500 or 15% from its current price level.

It is important to note that the success rate of a bull pennant is only around 54%, which makes it one of the least reliable patterns.

However, another classic pattern was spotted by Merlijn The Trader, a Bitcoin analyst, who says a BTC price target of $140,000 is in play based on an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart.

Other projections are a bit more ambitious, with one analyst citing a daily chart golden cross projecting BTC price to $155,000. 

Popular trader Marcus Corvinus made a modest prediction, saying a symmetrical triangle breakout targets $125,000. 

With the bulk of Bitcoin's apparent sell-side liquidity absorbed during the move to $122,000, some analysts warn that a brief flush down to test $115,000 as support could be the next move for BTC price. 

“Weekend low liquidity swept!” Popular analyst AlphaBTC said that Bitcoin could drop a little lower to grab the liquidity at around $115,000. 

The BTC liquidity map shows that the order book is priming for that, with bid clusters stacked between $115,000 and $116,100.

Fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades said  BTC price has stalled near its all-time high and noted that the bulk of the volume has been traded around $118,000, which is the middle level of the current range.

The analyst told his followers to watch the range low at $115,000 as support and the range high at $121,000 as resistance.

First Hormone-Free Male Birth Control Pill Shown Safe in Early Human Trial

A hormone-free pill, called YCT-529, that temporarily stops sperm production by blocking a vitamin A metabolite has just concluded its first safety trial in humans, getting a step closer to increasing male contraceptive options

When it comes to birth control, the market has long been skewed: female contraception comes in a variety of pills, implants, injections and devices, all approved by U.S. regulators. Condoms and vasectomies are the only male contraceptives available. Researchers have been chipping away at this problem for decades, and progress is finally ramping up. Now a male birth control pill with an entirely new kind of contraceptive mechanism has been tested for the first time in humans.

In the first clinical trial of its kind, a nonhormonal oral contraceptive that reversibly stops sperm production has just been deemed safe for human use. The daily pill, called YCT-529, blocks a vitamin A metabolite from binding to its receptor in the testes; this prevents the chain of gene-expression changes that are required to start the sperm-making process. Safety results from the early phase 1 clinical trial were published on Tuesday in Communications Medicine.

The trial did not assess the pill's efficacy in reducing sperm, and the drug's developer, YourChoice Therapeutics, is currently running trials to collect that data. But the safety finding is a crucial milestone, says Stephanie Page, an endocrinologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who wasn't involved in the study and has worked on other male hormonal contraceptives for more than 20 years. “We really need more reversible contraceptive methods for men,” she says.

The small trial included 16 healthy men aged 32 to 59, all of whom had undergone a vasectomy—a common surgery to prevent the release of sperm by snipping the vas deferens ducts in the scrotum. Enrolling only such participants was an extra precaution to avoid the risk of permanently affecting participants' fertility; no one has clinically trialed a nonhormonal male contraceptive pill before, says Nadja Mannowetz, co-founder and chief science officer of YourChoice Therapeutics, who oversaw the new trial. Using nonfertile participants worked for the trial because the team wasn't yet evaluating the drug's effectiveness but rather its tolerability and bioavailability (active levels that build up in the body), Mannowetz says.

Participants were split into two groups. In the first, people either received an initial dose of 10 milligrams (mg) of YCT-529 and then a second, 30-mg dose two weeks later or got a placebo each time. Participants in the second cohort either received a first dose of 90 mg and then a second dose of 180 mg two weeks later or always received a placebo. All participants took the pills after fasting. Four from each cohort were selected to return and take a third, 30-mg dose after a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast to see whether food might affect the drug's tolerability.

Across dosages “we saw good and quick bioavailability,” meaning the drug didn't rapidly break down in the body, Mannowetz says. On average, it took two to three days for the drug availability levels in the blood to reduce by half—a promising result that suggests the pill might only be needed once daily if it later proves effective at reducing sperm. Mannowetz anticipates the final dosage that will hit stores if the drug is eventually approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will probably be closer to the higher amount tested, 180 mg, though follow-up trials will help discern the exact optimal dose.

The research team didn't note any adverse side effects related to the drug. An advantage of a nonhormonal contraceptive medication is that, in theory, there's a smaller chance of certain side effects such as changes to sexual function, libido or mood, Mannowetz says.

The results are exciting and important, Page says—but she points out that this was just one small trial. “I think it would be overstating the data to say they know much about side effects yet,” she says. “Every medication on the market has side effects.”

Several other reversible male birth control methods are now in the clinical trial pipeline as well. The furthest along is NES/T, a combination of the progestin Nestorone and testosterone. Applied daily as a gel to the shoulders and upper arms, it is absorbed into the bloodstream through the skin. Like the YCT-529 pill, the gel targets sperm production, but it does so by circulating testosterone and progestin—hormones that tell the brain to halt the production process. Researchers have just completed a larger, longer phase 2 clinical trial of NES/T to show effectiveness and will hopefully start a phase 3 trial soon, says Page, who has been involved in the gel's clinical research.

Users of a male contraceptive that targeted sperm production, such as NES/T or YCT-529, would need to take it for about three months daily before it would take effect because that's how long it takes the body to produce mature sperm cells. Sperm production would resume about three months after a user stopped taking the medication.

A couple of other candidates for hormonally acting daily male contraceptive pills are in early development. A hydrogel implant called ADAM is also being tested in early clinical trials. ADAM acts as a reversible vasectomy, physically blocking off the vas deferens to prevent sperm release until the implant is removed.

And studies show growing interest. One paper published in 2023 found that 75 percent of more than 2,000 men surveyed in the U.S. and Canada were willing to try novel contraceptives. And a report in 2019 found nearly 50 percent of U.S. men aged 18 to 49 who had sex with women, did not have a vascectomy or beliefs that prevented the use of contraception and did not wish to parent a pregnancy were “very interested.” These stats line up with Page's experience in the field: “Men are very eager to have more reproductive agency and to participate in contraception,” she says, and all these contraceptives in the pipeline could elevate individuals' and couples' agency over their sexual and reproductive lifestyles.

NASA Staff Rebuke White House Cuts in Rare Public Dissent

A declaration of dissent from past and present NASA employees warns that science and safety are at risk and joins similar documents from staff at other federal science agencies

More than 280 NASA employees past and present, including at least 4 astronauts, have signed a declaration of opposition to the many drastic changes that the administration of US President Donald Trump is working to enact. The declaration also urges the acting head of NASA not to make the unprecedented budget cuts Trump has proposed.

“The last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce,” reads the employees' letter to interim administrator Sean Duffy. It argues that Trump's changes threaten human safety, scientific progress and global leadership at NASA.

The Voyager Declaration joins similar protest documents by employees at other US federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The appeals stem from Trump's sweeping campaign to overhaul the federal government, which has led to mass firings of workers and the proposal of steep cuts to agency budgets.

The declaration is “about getting our dissent out to the public and saying, hey — this is what's happening at NASA, and this is not OK”, says Ella Kaplan, who has signed the document. Kaplan works on a contract basis as a website administrator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was speaking on her own behalf and not that of her employer or of NASA.

Kaplan says she does not expect Duffy to read the document or to care much about it if he does. When Duffy ran for a seat in the US Congress more than a decade ago, he released a campaign advertisement that featured him wearing lumberjack clothing and saying he would bring his axe to “topple the big spending in Washington”.

The agency is not interested in sustaining “lower-priority missions”, said NASA spokeswoman Bethany Stevens. “We must revisit what's working and what's not so that we can inspire the American people again and win the space race.”

The Voyager Declaration, named after the twin NASA spacecraft that are exploring interstellar space, protests against staffing cuts at the agency and Trump's proposed cuts to science funding and other NASA budgets. The agency has fired some employees and pressured others to leave, resulting in the loss of more than 2,600 of the 17,000-plus NASA employees, according to news platform Politico. At least US$118 million in NASA grants has been cancelled outright, and the White House has proposed slashing nearly half of the agency's science budget for next year.

Congress, which sets US spending, might reject at least some of those proposed cuts. But the managers of many NASA science projects have been asked to draw up plans for winding down their programmes even though Congress hasn't finalized the budget — drawing dissent from the declaration's signers. “Once operational spacecraft are decommissioned, they cannot be turned back on,” the document says. NASA, like other agencies, is supposed to follow spending priorities laid out by Congress, and Duffy, as interim administrator, could theoretically ignore the White House requests until a budget is finalised.

The declaration asserts that since Trump took office, safety has taken a back seat to politics, marking a “dangerous turn” away from NASA's efforts to make human space flight less risky. Stevens responded that “NASA will never compromise on safety.”

The document's signers also disapprove of the agency's withdrawal from international missions, saying that such actions threaten partnerships with other nations' space agencies. The White House budget proposal, for instance, would cancel NASA participation in European Space Agency missions to Mars and Venus.

Dissent by employees at other federal agencies has met with mixed reactions. At the NIH, where more than 480 employees signed a Bethesda Declaration, director Jay Bhattacharya has said he intends to foster respectful dissent. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has placed more than 100 signatories to a dissenting document on administrative leave, saying he will not tolerate employees undercutting the president's agenda. Staff at the US National Science Foundation are also planning a declaration, according to a leaked version of the document.

Of the 287 signatories to the NASA document, 156 are anonymous.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","They Were Supposed to Be Building a Highway. Instead, They Found a Town Full of Treasure.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/a65449194/celtic-amber-road-town/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:30:00 GMT","

The ruins of a Celtic settlement along the Amber Road trade route were filled with coins, 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

A Celtic settlement from the second century B.C. discovered in modern-day Czech Republic has yielded an impressive haul of opulence, from hundreds of gold and silver coins to precious amber and luxury ceramics (and even a production facility that was likely churning them out over 2,000 years ago). 

The find came as archaeologists conducted surveys ahead of construction of the D35 motorway, turning a routine construction requirement into what the team from the Museum of East Bohemia in Hradec Kralove dubbed “one of the largest collections of artifacts ever found in Bohemia,” according to a translated statement.

The precious coins and materials weren't simply strewn about. Crews discovered plenty of ancient buildings making up an entire settlement from the La Tene period, likely a Celtic community.

“The entire site is unparalleled in its scale and character in Bohemia,” the statement reads. “The settlement was a supra-regional trade and production center connected to long-distance trade routes, as evidenced by the finds of amber, gold and silver coins, and evidence of the production of luxury ceramics.”

The team found gold and silver Celtic coins, coin dies, fragments of ceramic vessels, dwelling foundations, production facilities, and at least one religious sanctuary. With 22,000 bags loaded with artifacts from the area, it is one of the largest ever collections discovered in Bohemia comprising both everyday objects and an “extraordinarily rich collection of jewelry.”

Tomas Mangel, a professor at the University of Hradec Kralove and the excavation co-leader, told Live Science there could be several hundred coin pieces and that the jewelry features “pieces of bronze and iron brooches, fragments of armlets, metallic components of belts, glass beads, and armlets.” 

One thing the team hasn't yet found were any inscriptions to pinpoint which Celtic group settled the area, although Boii were known to live in the region. “Bohemia is traditionally really connected with [the] Boii,” Mangel told Live Science. “But the research [done recently] shows that we can only say that [the] Boii were settled somewhere in Central Europe.”

The archaeologists said they were surprised by the unusually high density of finds in the topsoil. “The information potential of the original surface of the settlement in the topsoil and subsoil horizons is completely beyond the standard,” they wrote. To their additional, and fortuitous, surprise, the site hadn't been looted. 

The lack of fortification at the 62-acre Iron Age site, which is located near Hradec Kralove in modern-day north-central Czech Republic, shows the settlement from the La Tene period was likely a key trading route and was active in the second century B.C. before the emergence of larger fortified settlements with central functions.

The volume of fine pottery, coin production, and amber only furthers the belief Celtic settlement played a pivotal role along the Amber Road trade route, a connection of settlements from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea that enabled trade across all of Europe. 

With such a rich history, the museum plans a display in late 2025 to celebrate all things gold, silver, and amber.

Scientists at Rice University and University of Houston have developed an innovative, scalable approach to engineer bacterial cellulose into high-strength, multifunctional materials. The study, published in Nature Communications, introduces a dynamic biosynthesis technique that aligns bacterial cellulose fibers in real-time, resulting in robust biopolymer sheets with exceptional mechanical properties.

Plastic pollution persists because traditional synthetic polymers degrade into microplastics, releasing harmful chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates and carcinogens. Seeking sustainable alternatives, the research team led by Muhammad Maksud Rahman, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Houston and adjunct assistant professor of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice, leveraged bacterial cellulose -- one of Earth's most abundant and pure biopolymers -- as a biodegradable alternative.

""Our approach involved developing a rotational bioreactor that directs the movement of cellulose-producing bacteria, aligning their motion during growth,"" said M.A.S.R. Saadi, the study's first author and a doctoral student in material science and nanoengineering at Rice. ""This alignment significantly enhances the mechanical properties of microbial cellulose, creating a material as strong as some metals and glasses yet flexible, foldable, transparent and environment friendly.""

Bacterial cellulose fibers usually form randomly, which limits their mechanical strength and functionality. By harnessing controlled fluid dynamics within their novel bioreactor, the researchers achieved in situ alignment of cellulose nanofibrils, creating sheets with tensile strength reaching up to 436 megapascals.

Moreover, incorporating boron nitride nanosheets during synthesis resulted in a hybrid material with even greater strength -- around 553 megapascals -- and improved thermal properties, demonstrating a heat dissipation rate three times faster than control samples.

""This dynamic biosynthesis approach enables the creation of stronger materials with greater functionality,"" Saadi said. ""The method allows for the easy integration of various nanoscale additives directly into the bacterial cellulose, making it possible to customize material properties for specific applications.""

Shyam Bhakta, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of BioSciences at Rice, played an important role in advancing the biological aspects of the study. Other Rice collaborators included Pulickel Ajayan, the Benjamin M. and Mary Greenwood Anderson Professor of Materials Science and NanoEngineering; Matthew Bennett, professor of biosciences; and Matteo Pasquali, the A.J. Hartsook Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.

""The synthesis process is essentially like training a disciplined bacterial cohort,"" Saadi explained. ""Instead of having the bacteria move randomly, we instruct them to move in a specific direction, thus precisely aligning their cellulose production. This disciplined motion and the versatility of the biosynthesis technique allows us to simultaneously engineer both alignment and multifunctionality.""

The scalable, single-step process holds significant promise for numerous industrial applications, including structural materials, thermal management solutions, packaging, textiles, green electronics and energy storage systems.

""This work is a great example of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of materials science, biology and nanoengineering,"" Rahman added. ""We envision these strong, multifunctional and eco-friendly bacterial cellulose sheets becoming ubiquitous, replacing plastics in various industries and helping mitigate environmental damage.""

""This estimate shows that there is more plastic in the form of nanoparticles floating in the this part of the ocean, than there is in larger micro- or macroplastics floating in the Atlantic or even all the world's oceans!,"" said Helge Niemann, researcher at NIOZ and professor of geochemistry at Utrecht University. Mid-June, he received a grant of 3.5 million euros to conduct more research into nanoplastics in the sea and their fate.

Ocean expedition For this research, Utrecht master student Sophie ten Hietbrink worked for four weeks aboard the research vessel RV Pelagia. On a trip from the Azores to the continental shelf of Europe, she took water samples at 12 locations where she filtered out anything larger than one micrometer. ""By drying and heating the remaining material, we were able to measure the characteristic molecules of different types of plastics in the Utrecht laboratory, using mass spectrometry,"" Ten Hietbrink says.

First real estimate The research by NIOZ and Utrecht University provides the first estimate of the amount of nanoplastics in the oceans. Niemann: ""There were a few publications that showed that there were nanoplastics in the ocean water, but until now no estimate of the amount could ever be made."" This first estimate was made possible, according to Niemann, by the joining of forces of ocean scientists and the knowledge of atmospheric scientist Dusân Materic of Utrecht University.

Shocking amount Extrapolating the results from different locations to the whole of the North Atlantic Ocean, the researchers arrived at the immense amount of 27 million tons of nanoplastics. ""A shocking amount,"" Ten Hietbrink believes. ""But with this we do have an important answer to the paradox of the missing plastic."" Until now, not all the plastic that was ever produced in the world could be recovered. So, it turns out that a large portion is now floating in the water as tiny particles.

Sun, rivers and rain The nanoplastics can reach water by various routes. In part, this happens because larger particles disintegrate under the influence of sunlight. Another part probably flows along with river water. It also appears that nanoplastics reach the oceans through the air, as suspended particles fall down with rainwater or fall from the air onto the water surface as 'dry deposition'.

Consequences The consequences of all those nanoplastics in the water could be fundamental, Niemann emphasizes. ""It is already known that nanoplastics can penetrate deep into our bodies. They are even found in brain tissue. Now that we know they are so ubiquitous in the oceans, it's also obvious that they penetrate the entire ecosystem; from bacteria and other microorganisms to fish and top predators like humans. How that pollution affects the ecosystem needs further investigation.""

Other oceans In the future, Niemann and colleagues also want to do further research on, for example, the different types of plastics that have not yet been found in the fraction of 1 micrometer or smaller. ""For example, we have not found polyethylene or polypropylene among the nanoplastics. It may well be that those were masked by other molecules in the study. We also want to know if nanoplastics are as abundant in the other oceans. It is to be feared that they do, but that remains to be proven.

Not cleaning up but preventing Niemann emphasizes that the amount of nanoplastics in ocean water was an important missing piece of the puzzle, but now there is nothing to do about it. ""The nanoplastics that are there, can never be cleaned up. So an important message from this research is that we should at least prevent the further pollution of our environment with plastics.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Magic mushrooms rewind aging in mice—could they do the same for humans?","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250721223838.htm","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 07:24:21 GMT","

As revenues from the anti-aging market -- riddled with hope and thousands of supplements-- surged past $500 million last year, Emory University researchers identified a compound that actively delays aging in cells and organisms.

A newly published study in Nature Partner Journals' Aging demonstrates that psilocin, a byproduct of consuming psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, extended the cellular lifespan of human skin and lung cells by more than 50%.

In parallel, researchers also conducted the first long-term in vivo study evaluating the systemic effects of psilocybin in aged mice of 19 months, or the equivalent of 60-65 human years. Results indicated that the mice that received an initial low dose of psilocybin of 5 mg, followed by a monthly high dose of 15 mg for 10 months, had a 30% increase in survival compared to mice that did not receive any. These mice also displayed healthier physical features, such as improved fur quality, fewer white hairs and hair regrowth.

While traditionally researched for its mental health benefits, this study suggests that psilocybin impacts multiple hallmarks of aging by reducing oxidative stress, improving DNA repair responses, and preserving telomere length. Telomeres are the structured ends of a chromosome, protecting it from damage that could lead to the formation of age-related diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, or cardiovascular disease. These foundational processes influence human aging and the onset of these chronic diseases.

The study concludes that psilocybin may have the potential to revolutionize anti-aging therapies and could be an impactful intervention in an aging population.

""Most cells in the body express serotonin receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life,"" says Louise Hecker, PhD, senior author on the study, and former associate professor at Emory University, where the research was initiated and funded.

While much of what researchers know about psilocybin relates to the brain, few studies have examined its systemic impacts. Many people associate psilocybin with the hallucinogenic impacts, but the majority of the cells in the body express serotonin receptors.

""Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. Additionally, even when the intervention is initiated late in life in mice, it still leads to improved survival,which is clinically relevant in healthy aging,"" adds Hecker, currently an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine.

This news comes on the heels of KFF's recent report that U.S. life expectancy is still below that of other countries similar in income and size, with an average lifespan of 78.4 years, compared to 82.5 years elsewhere. Not only was it the lowest, but as the lifespan in similar countries increased by 7.9 years from 1980-2022, whereas the U.S. life expectancy has only increased by 4.7 years.

""This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging -- not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years,"" says Director of Psychedelic Research at Emory University's Department of Psychiatry Ali John Zarrabi, MD. ""As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren't just surviving longer -- they experienced better aging,"" adds Zarrabi, co-investigator of the study.

Zarrabi emphasized the importance of further research in older adults, as well as the well-documented overlap between physical and mental health.

""Emory is actively involved in Phase II and III clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression, and these results suggest we also need to understand psilocybin's systemic effects in aging populations,"" says Zarrabi. ""My hope is also that if psilocybin-assisted therapy is approved as an intervention for depression by the FDA in 2027, then having a better quality of life would also translate into a longer, healthier life.""

The study was initiated at Emory University and funded by several awards, including the Imagine, Innovative, and Impact (I3) Award, Emory University School of Medicine; the Georgia CTSA NIH Award; and a grant from Emory's Woodruff Health Sciences Center for Health in Aging.

Radioactive decay is a fundamental process in nature by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. Studying nuclear decay modes is crucial for understanding properties of atomic nuclei. In particular, exotic decay modes like proton emission provide essential spectroscopic tools for probing the structure of nuclei far from the valley of stability -- the region containing stable nuclei on the nuclear chart.

In a study published in Physical Review Letters on July 10, physicists from the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and their collaborators have reported the first observation and spectroscopy of aluminium-20, a previously unknown and unstable isotope that decays via the rare process of three-proton emission.

""Aluminium-20 is the lightest aluminium isotope that has been discovered so far. Located beyond the proton drip line, it has seven fewer neutrons than the stable aluminum isotope,"" said Associate Prof. Xiaodong Xu from IMP, first author of the study.

Using an in-flight decay technique at the Fragment Separator of the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, the researchers measured angular correlations of aluminium-20's decay products and discovered the previously unknown nucleus aluminium-20.

Through detailed analysis of angular correlations, the researchers found that the aluminium-20 ground state first decays by emitting one proton to the intermediate ground state of magnesium-19, followed by subsequent decay of magnesium-19 ground state via simultaneous two-proton emission. Aluminium-20 is the first observed three-proton emitter where its one-proton decay daughter nucleus is a two-proton radioactive nucleus.

The researchers also found that the decay energy of the aluminium-20 ground state is significantly smaller than the predictions inferred from the isospin symmetry, indicating a possible isospin symmetry breaking in aluminium-20 and its mirror partner neon-20.

This finding is supported by state-of-the-art theoretical calculations that predict that the spin-parity of the aluminium-20 ground state differs from the spin-parity of the neon-20 ground state.

""This study advances our understanding of the proton-emission phenomena, and provides insights into the structure and decay of nuclei beyond the proton drip line,"" said Xu.

To date, scientists have discovered over 3,300 nuclides, yet fewer than 300 are stable and exist naturally. The remainder are unstable nuclides that undergo radioactive decay. Common decay modes, such as α decay, β- decay, β+ decay, electron capture, γ radiation, and fission, were discovered by the mid-20th century.

Over the past several decades, owing to the tremendous development in nuclear physics experimental facilities and detection technologies, scientists discovered several exotic decay modes in the study of nuclei far from the stability, particularly in neutron-deficient nuclei.

In the 1970s, scientists discovered single-proton radioactivity, where nuclei decay by emitting a proton. After entering the 21st century, two-proton radioactivity was found in the decays of some extremely neutron-deficient nuclei. In recent years, even rarer decay phenomena such as three-, four-, and five-proton emission were observed.

This collaborative effort included contributions from IMP, GSI, Fudan University, and more than a dozen other institutions.

New research by the University of Sydney offers important insights into how and when new coronavirus variants arise in bats.

Bats are beneficial to our ecosystems and economy but, as habitat destruction and environmental stressors put them in closer proximity to humans, disease risks can emerge. The research, published in Nature Communications on July 17, offers an approach to anticipating the emergence of coronaviruses. It found young bats are infected more frequently and could be a key source of viral spillover into other species. The study also reveals the dynamics of coronaviruses circulating in Australian bats, which pose no known risk to humans.

Endemic in bat populations, most coronaviruses never infect humans. When they do, as with the SARS, COVID-19 and MERS outbreaks, they typically spill over from bats via a bridging animal host.

""Coronaviruses tend not to be of major concern to bats,"" said Dr Alison Peel from the University's School of Veterinary Science, who led the study. ""But they can behave differently if they spill over to new species.""

In one of the most comprehensive single studies of its type, the researchers collected more than 2,500 faecal samples, via which bats shed coronaviruses, over three years. Samples were taken from black flying foxes and grey-headed flying foxes at five roost sites across Australia's eastern seaboard.

Viral testing of the samples showed coronaviruses were most prevalent in young bats between March and July, when they were weaning and approaching maturity. This was consistent across the three-year study. Particularly notable was the high proportion of bats infected with multiple coronaviruses at once.

""We were surprised by that high rate of co-infection among juveniles and subadults,"" Dr Peel said. ""Co-infection presents the opportunity for a single cell to become infected with multiple viruses, an important natural precursor to the generation of new strains.""

The six coronaviruses detected in the study were nobecoviruses, a subclass which does not jump to humans. Three of these were new. They were useful to analyse because they pose minimal risk to people but are the evolutionary cousins of sarbecoviruses, so-called SARS-like viruses which are more prone to spill across to other species. Understanding the evolution of nobecoviruses offers parallel insights into the evolution of more dangerous coronaviruses.

""We safely tracked how and when coronaviruses circulated naturally in bat populations. Using genomics to track infections to individual animals,"" Dr John-Sebastian Eden, a study co-author from the Westmead Insitute for Medical Research and the University's Faculty of Medicine and Health.

""The results offer a model for scientists looking to understand coronavirus emergence and future risks in bat populations around the world. By focusing on co-infections in young bats during certain periods, researchers might better predict the natural evolution and emergence of riskier coronaviruses before they pose a risk to human health.""

Dr Peel said more research is needed to understand why young bats are more susceptible to infection and co-infection.

""It could be the result of newly weaned animals whose immune systems are still developing or the stress faced by teenage bats looking for a mate for the first time,"" she said.

The changing environment could also be a factor.

""We know from previous research on other viruses that habitat loss caused by encroaching human populations and food shortages can create stress in bats that weakens immunity and makes them susceptible to infections. It will be important to find out if that's also the case for coronaviruses.""

Dr Peel and Dr Eden's research began in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. It built on earlier research into the spread of Hendra virus, which also originates in bats.

""It's rare to see this scale and depth of data in virological research, even among human viruses,"" said Dr Peel. ""The gathering of samples from both individual bats and beneath roosts, and the tracking of individual strains across multiple sites and years, provides a strong foundation for ongoing research into the role of environmental stress on coronavirus emergence.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Beneath the scales: The secret bone armor that helped lizards survive Australia","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250722035554.htm","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:56:40 GMT","

Beneath the scales of Australia's iconic monitor lizards (commonly known as goannas), scientists have discovered an unexpected secret: a hidden layer of bony skin structures known as osteoderms. These structures, which have been long overlooked, may hold the key to understanding how these ancient reptiles not only survived but thrived in one of the world's harshest environments.

The findings, published on July 21 in the prestigious Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, mark the first large-scale global study of osteoderms in lizards and snakes. The international collaboration brought together researchers from Australia, Europe and the United States, who used cutting-edge micro-CT scanning to examine nearly 2,000 reptile specimens from major museum collections including those held at Museums Victoria's Research Institute.

'We were astonished to find osteoderms in 29 Australo-Papuan monitor lizard species that had never been documented before,' said Roy Ebel, lead author and researcher at Museums Victoria Research Institute and the Australian National University. 'It's a fivefold increase in known cases among goannas.'

Osteoderms are most commonly known from crocodiles, armadillos, and even some dinosaurs like Stegosaurus. But their function has remained something of an evolutionary mystery. While they may provide protection, scientists now suspect they may also support heat regulation, mobility and calcium storage during reproduction.

This new research reveals that osteoderms are far more widespread in lizards than previously thought, occurring in nearly half of all lizard species worldwide - an 85% increase on earlier estimates.

At the heart of this discovery lies the power of museum collections. Scientific institutions like Museums Victoria Research Institute play a critical role in preserving biodiversity through time, enabling researchers to study species long after they were collected. Many of the specimens used in this study were decades, and in some cases over 120 years old, but advances in imaging technology enabled scientists to uncover new insights without harming the original material. These collections are not just archives, they're active tools for scientific discovery.

'What's so exciting about this finding is that it reshapes what we thought we knew about reptile evolution,' said Dr Jane Melville, Museums Victoria Research Institute Senior Curator of Terrestrial Vertebrates. 'It suggests that these skin bones may have evolved in response to environmental pressures as lizards adapted to Australia's challenging landscapes.'

Until now, the presence of osteoderms in monitor lizards was considered rare and mostly confined to the famed Komodo dragon. But the discovery of their widespread presence across Australo-Papuan goannas opens up new questions about how these lizards adapted, survived and diversified across the continent.

This landmark study not only tells a new chapter in the story of Australia's goannas, it provides a powerful new dataset for exploring how skin, structure, and survival have intertwined across millions of years of evolution.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","This oat discovery could change your breakfast—and the future of plant-based food","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/07/250722035552.htm","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:45:48 GMT","

New University of South Australia research is providing evidence of biological triggers of oil production in oats, a discovery that will help processing and potentially drive further demand for Australian-grown oats.

While Australia is the world's second-largest exporter of oats, high oil content in oat grains creates challenges during milling, reducing processing efficiency and limiting product innovation - particularly in high-demand sectors like oat flour and plant-based proteins.

Researchers from the University of South Australia, the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI), and the University of Adelaide are collaborating on research designed to better understand the biological processes responsible for oil synthesis in oat grains.

In this study, two contemporary varieties of oats were examined using spatial imaging techniques to track oil build-up during grain development. Researchers then applied 'omics' technologies - lipidomics and proteomics - to analyse lipid and protein expression, which provided key insights into the biological mechanisms involved in the actual formation of the grain, including those relating to oil synthesis.

The UniSA findings have provided further evidence of the mechanisms that underlie the amount of oil in an oat grain. These findings will help to guide future breeding efforts for naturally lower-oil oat varieties, improving milling yields and creating new value-added opportunities across the oat supply chain.

UniSA PhD candidate, Darren Lau, says that current oil removal methods are inefficient and that low-oil breeding programs will aid industry growth.

""While oil can be removed from partially milled oat flakes - using supercritical carbon dioxide prior to further milling - this approach is laborious and expensive,"" he says.

""Breeding low-oil oat varieties is a cost-effective approach but requires further understanding of oil production in oats. This is where our research is critical.

""Our analysis has identified several key enzymes that are involved in oil synthesis which could be genetically manipulated to lower oil content of oat grains.

""Reducing oil content could also unlock new opportunities in sectors like oat flour and alternative proteins, which could significantly strengthen Australia's position in the market.""

The economic potential of these opportunities is reflected in the quantity of oats exported globally. For example, in 2022 twenty-six million metric tonnes of oats were produced worldwide, ranking them seventh among cereals in production quantity.

Lowering oil content in oat grains will enhance processing and product versatility, positioning them alongside traditional cereal staples like barley, maize, wheat, and rice, and further driving industry growth.

The UniSA findings are being used by the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) oat grain quality consortium to improve suitability for milling and food/beverage ingredient development. Additional research is continuing within the consortium that will build on the study's findings to further inform breeding efforts aimed at reducing oil content in oats.

""The consortia are currently working on a larger and more diverse oat cohort to further investigate molecular markers and nutrient partitioning of oil in oats,"" Lau says.

""The consortia are also investigating one of the key enzymes validated in this study to determine whether manipulating or removing it can lower oil content, and how that affects the growth of the plant.""

SARDI Project Lead Dr Janine Croser, says the study's findings provide further evidence of key pathways involved in oat oil biosynthesis.

""This research provides important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying varietal differences of oil production in developing oat grains,"" Dr Croser says.

""We expect that the development of low-oil lines will improve efficiencies in the flour milling process and potentially lead to novel uses for oats.

""With demand for plant-based foods on the rise, we anticipate the oat grain quality consortium research will help put Australia at the forefront of oat innovation - supporting growers, processors, and exporters alike.""

The full paper, Proteomic and lipidomic analyses reveal novel molecular insights into oat (Avena sativa L.) lipid regulation and crosstalk with starch synthesis during grain development, is available online.

As scientists, we want solid answers, but we also want to answer questions that matter. Yet, the brain's complexity forces trade-offs between these desiderata, bringing about two distinct research approaches in neuroscience that we describe as ‘top-down' and ‘bottom-up'. Recognizing the validity of both approaches dispels misunderstandings and unnecessary tension and promotes constructive interactions.

Nature Food

                         (2025)Cite this article


Food processing often overlooks nature's complexity, favouring purified raw materials. This excessive purification fosters unsustainable practices and diminishes the taste and nutritional quality of food. Given the current global environmental and health crises, we propose three food innovation principles to embrace the complexity of plant raw materials: (1) leveraging the inherent chemical, physical, biological and nutritional potential of raw materials; (2) applying robust food processes that cope with raw material complexity; and (3) designing food products from field to colon. Adhering to these principles will allow the development of technologies that could transform raw materials into healthier, more sustainable food products.

Microglia are implicated in aging, neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Low-plex protein imaging does not capture cellular states and interactions in the human brain, which differs from rodent models. Here we used multiplexed ion beam imaging to spatially map cellular states and niches in cognitively normal human brains, identifying a spectrum of proteomic microglial profiles. Defined by immune activation states that were skewed across brain regions and compartmentalized according to microenvironments, this spectrum enables the identification of proteomic trends across the microglia of ten cognitively normal individuals and orthogonally with single-nuclei epigenetic analysis, revealing associated molecular functions. Notably, AD tissues exhibit regulatory shifts in the immunologically active cells at the end of the proteomic spectrum, including enrichment of CD33 and CD44 and decreases in HLA-DR, P2RY12 and ApoE expression. These findings establish an in situ, single-cell spatial proteomic framework for AD-specific microglial states.

China's fifth Antarctic station, Qinling, opened last year.  Credit: Zhu He/Xinhua/Alamy

China has rapidly increased its interest in Antarctica over the past decade, opening its fifth Antarctic station last year. Scientists are hopeful that this will help ensure research of global significance continues on the continent, despite the US government's proposal to slash spending on polar science. 

China's latest station, Qinling, kicked off its first winter mission in March. Situated on Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay, Qinling is China's first station in southern Antarctica, not far from stations run by Italy and South Korea. In time, the station will run studies on marine and terrestrial ecology, sea ice, geophysics, wildlife and other topics, says Shen Jun, a director at the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration in Beijing. 

Qingling is “well-placed for research into a huge range of contemporary challenges in Antarctic research”, says Christina Hulbe, a geophysicist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.

One of them is determining how cold, dense waters form on the continental shelf, Hulbe says. These waters are the precursor to Antarctic bottom water, which plays a pivotal role in regulating the ocean's ability to store heat and capture carbon. The region is also important for studying marine biodiversity, including krill, penguins and whales.

China does not reveal how much it spends on Antarctic research each year, but researchers say that there has been growing government funding for overall research and development over the past decade. Since 2018, China has also built two new icebreakers, Xue Long 2 and Ji Di, and is planning a new summer station in southwest Antarctica, which is scheduled to open in 2027.

As China's interest in the region increases, US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting all polar research from $86 million to $25 million, and Antarctic-specific infrastructure renewal from $60 million to $24 million in 2026. US scientists fear that they might not be able to continue some of their research and fieldwork in Antarctica. There are also concerns that the US polar databases will not be maintained or updated. The US is seen by many as the global leader in Antarctic research.

Deniz Bozkurt, a climatologist at the University of Valparaíso in Chile, expects “some shift in the scientific leadership” for Antarctica and climate-change studies owing to the question marks surrounding US commitment.

Kim Yeadong, the chair of the Korean National Committee on Polar Research, based in Incheon, South Korea, says that Antarctic study benefits all of humanity. “If the US walks away, somebody should continue on this very important endeavour,” he adds. Kim says that he will be “very happy” if China increases its activity regardless of what the United States will do.

Bozkurt thinks that the biggest risk from the US government cuts is the potential loss of continuous data, such as those hosted by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, which are crucial for understanding climate trends and extreme weather.

Qinling's global significance will depend partially on how China shares its data. “Sharing data, sharing findings, sharing issues of critical ecosystems, this is absolutely vital,” says Daniel Kammen, an energy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He hopes that the station's data will be shared with scientists in real time to help them to understand and respond to changes.

A coal stockpile in China's Jiangsu province. Credit: Costfoto/NurPhoto/Getty

As summer arrives in China, the country's 2023 heatwave springs to mind. A period of extreme heat in June and July that year didn't just scorch the land — it exposed a hard truth about China's energy future. Temperatures in Xinjiang province shattered records at 52 °C and nationwide sales of air-conditioning units spiked by about 40% (see go.nature.com/452ckya; in Chinese).

The illusion of a stable, renewables-led grid collapsed: in Jiangsu, solar farms sputtered at low capacity as sunlight was dimmed by weeks of industrial smog. In Inner Mongolia, wind turbines stood still under a rare, suffocating heat dome. Hydropower generation fell to a historic low, whereas national carbon emissions hit a record high, as surging electricity demand and frequent power outages revived calls to expand fossil-fuel power (J. Dinneen New Scientist 3 April 2025).

Faced with the prospect of power-grid failure, China had no choice but to fall back on the dirtiest tool in its energy arsenal: coal. During peak demand, thermal power plants were shouldering more than two-thirds of national electricity needs (see go.nature.com/4gth7zr; in Chinese). The power sector's coal consumption grew in 2023 by 9% relative to 2022, to 2.9 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/3gnfk35; in Chinese).

The heatwave was a stark reminder that, despite its world-beating solar and wind facilities, China is still tethered — almost helplessly — to fossil fuels (see ‘China's fossil-fuel reliance'). From steel mills to semiconductor plants, the engines of China's growth are fuelled by coal, oil and gas. Yet clinging to the status quo risks accelerating both environmental degradation and geopolitical vulnerability.

Sources: China Petroleum Econ. and Tech. Res. Inst.; CNOOC Energy Econ. Inst.; Natl Bureau of Statistics

As the world's largest energy consumer, China cannot simply abandon fossil fuels without jeopardizing the industrial base and social fabric that underpin its economic rise. What's needed is realism. China's energy future is not a binary choice between fossil fuels and renewables — it is a high-stakes balancing act between economic resilience, environmental responsibility and social stability.

At the heart of its energy strategy must be carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). If the world is to meet its climate targets, China must lead not only in building green energy, but in cleaning up the energy it cannot yet replace with renewables.

In 2024, fossil fuels supplied almost 82% of China's total energy consumption (59.6 billion tonnes of coal equivalent). Coal accounted for 53%, oil for 17%, and natural gas for 11% (see go.nature.com/3tjpe7r; in Chinese). To understand their centrality, consider three sectors that contribute 25% of national gross domestic product (GDP): steel, chemicals and construction materials . Power generation and coal-to-chemical industries alone consume around 2 billion tonnes of coal annually (see go.nature.com/4kdx9hm; in Chinese). These processes demand extreme heat: blast furnaces cannot run on solar power, and cement kilns need temperatures of 1,450 °C, which today's renewables cannot yet reliably supply.

To end coal, adapt to regional realities

To end coal, adapt to regional realities

Even high-tech industries depend on fossil fuels. In 2022, data centres across China consumed a total of 270 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, a 25% increase compared with 2021. This accounted for roughly 3% of the country's total electricity consumption, much of it generated from coal (see go.nature.com/4kcz99y; in Chinese). According to a report by climate researchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing, the coal industry directly supported 2.6 million jobs in 2023. In Inner Mongolia, a region with a population of 23.8 million, coal contributes about 16% of its GDP and nearly half of its industrial profits, employing more than 180,000 people (see go.nature.com/3tsrfxs; in Chinese).

Abandoning coal without a strategy would trigger social unrest, as Germany discovered during its phase out of coal mining in the Ruhr Valley, starting in 2018. On losing a sector that once employed about 600,000 people, the region saw mass lay-offs and economic decline, sparking waves of protest and discontent (see go.nature.com/3ufk6wd).

As of 2024, China's capacity in solar and wind energy (887 and 521 gigawatts, respectively; see go.nature.com/3gjfdwf; in Chinese) is world-leading, yet last year these renewable sources met just 18% of the country's total electricity demand. The problem isn't scale — it's intermittency. For instance, during a 2022 winter cold snap, the generation capacity of Inner Mongolia's wind farms dropped to nearly zero for 24 hours because there was so little wind. Grid operators learnt the hard way and now require coal plants in major coal-producing areas to maintain 15-day coal stockpiles — not as a fallback to the past, but as a necessity of the present.

Oil and gas are equally entrenched. China's transportation sector alone consumes 177 million tonnes of petrol annually (see go.nature.com/4keewqm; in Chinese). Petrol and diesel still power almost 80% of China's roughly 450 million vehicles, despite electric vehicles accounting for 41% of new car sales in 2024, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

Oil is also the feedstock of China's petrochemical empire. Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company — one of Asia's largest integrated refineries, run by the Chinese state firm Sinopec — processes up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Its output feeds China's vast plastics and chemical industries, which together employ more than 12 million people nationwide.

Natural gas, once peripheral, is now a geopolitical and environmental linchpin. As part of the Blue Sky campaign, tens of millions of rural households have replaced coal stoves with gas boilers — slashing urban smog but driving gas imports up to 43% to cover the increased consumption (see go.nature.com/4nvkkss; in Chinese). China's gas supply map is also a map of its foreign policy. A pipeline from Siberia delivers 38 billion cubic metres per year from Russia. In Guangdong, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals offload cargo from Qatar to feed factories that help to produce 70% of the world's air conditioners.

This dependency isn't just economic — it's strategic. China still imports 11 million barrels of oil per day, yet 80% of it is transported by sea through the narrow, US-patrolled Strait of Malacca, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation. Gas pipelines snake through restive regions near Afghanistan, and LNG ships from Australia navigate contested waters in the South China Sea.

In response, China is doubling down on domestic exploration. In 2024, Sinopec announced it had discovered 140 million tonnes of shale oil in Shandong province, and PetroChina's Gulong shale-oil field in Daqing is targeting a reserve of 1 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/4kj3g5r; in Chinese). These projects — in three national shale demonstration zones — should help to cut China's oil import reliance and replicate the US revolution in fracking, or hydraulic fracturing.

The price of fossil-fuel use is paid in carbon dioxide. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were projected to reach a record 41.6 billion tonnes — most of which came from coal burning (see go.nature.com/4rpu6qq). China contributed a staggering 16 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2023, according to the UN Environment Programme's 2024 emissions gap report (see go.nature.com/4gzuyza), with coal alone responsible for more than 60% of CO2 emissions. Without urgent and comprehensive decarbonization, the climate crisis will only accelerate.

China's solution cannot be renewables alone. It must include CCUS, not as an afterthought, but as central infrastructure, similar to roads or railways. Currently, CCUS is the only proven technology with the potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and chemicals, if it can be made to work at scale.

China has backed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, a global pact launched in 2023 at the COP28 UN climate summit in the United Arab Emirates to cut emissions from the fossil-fuel sector. In July 2024, PetroChina joined the initiative, aligning with more than 50 oil companies responsible for 44% of global oil output. The charter mandates real action: no routine flaring of gas from fossil-fuel operations by 2030 and the adoption of industry best practices for emissions reductions and transparent emissions reporting.

But progress remains slow. China's national carbon market, the China Emissions Allowance, trades at 68–90 yuan (US$9.50–12.50) per tonne — well below carbon prices in the European Union, which exceed €70 (US$82) per tonne. Such low levels in China offer little incentive for companies to invest in deep decarbonization.

China emits more than 10 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, yet current CCUS projects, mostly in the Junggar Basin in northwest China, capture just 4 million tonnes and store 2 million tonnes (see go.nature.com/3tfkpye; in Chinese). The disparity is staggering. Without a sweeping scale-up, CCUS is symbolic at best. Closing the gap will require a huge and concerted effort to make carbon capture count.

First, China must drive down CCUS costs through sustained research and development and standardization. Technical standards should cover the entire CCUS life cycle: capture, transport, injection, monitoring and closure. These must include engineering protocols, environmental risk assessments and leakage detection systems.

Advances in data-driven design and additive manufacturing have substantially accelerated the development of truss metamaterials—three-dimensional truss networks—offering exceptional mechanical properties at a fraction of the weight of conventional solids. While existing design approaches can generate metamaterials with target linear properties, such as elasticity, they struggle to capture complex nonlinear behaviours and to incorporate geometric and manufacturing constraints—including defects—crucial for engineering applications. Here we present GraphMetaMat, an autoregressive graph-based framework capable of designing three-dimensional truss metamaterials with programmable nonlinear responses, originating from hard-to-capture physics such as buckling, frictional contact and wave propagation, along with arbitrary geometric constraints and defect tolerance. Integrating graph neural networks, physics biases, imitation learning, reinforcement learning and tree search, we show that GraphMetaMat can target stress–strain curves across four orders of magnitude and vibration transmission responses with varying attenuation gaps, unattainable by previous methods. We further demonstrate the use of GraphMetaMat for the inverse design of novel material topologies with tailorable high-energy absorption and vibration damping that outperform existing polymeric foams and phononic crystals, potentially suitable for protective equipment and electric vehicles. This work sets the stage for the automatic design of manufacturable, defect-tolerant materials with on-demand functionalities.

The physics bias for stress predictions is encoded in the ‘Magnitude Decoder' of the forward model, predicting the coefficients C and n of the power-scaling law, \({y}_{max}={C}_{\rho }^{-n}\), with the relative density \(\bar{\rho }\).

Most people's browser tabs are filled with unread news articles. Mine are filled with AI agents and ghost clicks.

I have four instances of OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent—the generative AI tool released last week, which can run searches and perform tasks on the web—already open with each running in its own tab. I've given these first four agents relatively simple jobs based on ChatGPT's suggestions. One is clicking around to find a birthday gift on the Target website, and another is generating a pitch deck about robotic dogs. I open a fifth tab in order to try something more experimental: I want to see how good this ChatGPT Agent is at chess.

After typing in some instructions, I watch as a ghostly cursor floats across my screen and the ChatGPT Agent goes to Chess.com and plays an online opponent, all in a virtual browser. Things go south pretty quickly. The game's strategy isn't what trips up the AI tool, it's the act of moving the chess pieces that actually proves to be the most difficult. “I'm focusing on accurate positioning as I continue playing despite earlier misclicks,” the agent says in its internal log before eventually quitting and letting me know that the controls were too difficult to navigate.

Over the past few years, browser developers have integrated AI tools with middling success. Though, in recent weeks, the idea of a web browser enhanced by a baked-in generative AI chatbot has resurged with the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent and Perplexity's Comet.

The two releases are quite different in their execution. Comet is a stand-alone browser, so you can use it to surf the web and then summon the AI assistant to help write an email or complete a menial chore. OpenAI built its browsing tool inside of a chatbot; you talk to the chatbot through a web interface to give it tasks, and then the bot runs its own virtual browser inside your browser to complete them.

Both releases can take control of cursors, enter text, and click on links. If this trend takes off, these kinds of AI-powered browsers could transform the internet into a ghost town where agents run amok and humans rarely venture.

Despite the continued AI hype, my initial impression of OpenAI's ChatGPT Agent is that the glitchy feature currently seems like a proof of concept instead of a fully baked release. When executing the various tasks I gave it, the ChatGPT Agent often clicked wrong or fumbled through other errors. Additionally, its guardrails appeared inconsistent; while some explicit prompt requests, like asking it to fetch pornographic videos or “find a dildo,” were denied by the agent, ChatGPT spent 18 minutes shopping for the perfect “c-ring” on an X-rated website for adult toys: “I've gathered details on 10 metal cock rings, including various prices and features.”

I also couldn't help but wonder how this approach to browsing the internet might further hollow out the market for digital display ads, a business that's already struggling. My agents passed over ads for everything from rental cars to real estate investments. If you're not actively watching the agent click around in real time, you can watch replays afterward and see everything that appeared in the browser while the AI tool was in control, ads included. It makes sense that users would speed-scrub through a replay now, while the nascent feature is filled with errors. But if the accuracy rate for AI agents improves over time, then fewer people will feel the need to watch over their agent's shoulder, and fewer humans will be seeing those ads. At that point, it's hard to imagine advertisers sticking around.

The more I watched replays of its actions, the more the agent gave me an unsettling, eerie feeling—not of being understood, but of being mimicked. It was like an obsessive robot stalker had watched humans through a window, meticulously taking notes about how they used the web in an effort to replicate their actions. It was able to do a hollow imitation of human behavior, but not able to grasp fully why individual decisions were being made. The skin of my arms filled with the kind of goosebumps you get hearing a human-like laugh while walking home alone late at night, looking around, and only seeing a lone crow perched high up on the telephone wire.

Further leaning into the psuedo-humanness, the ChatGPT Agent is programmed to generate descriptions, from a first-person perspective, of each step on its journeys around the internet. While clicking, the simulation “thinks” and sometimes gets “confused.” As a whole, the ghostly agent is stuffed into an ill-fitting human suit.

Running five OpenAI agents simultaneously in my browser quickly became overwhelming, and I couldn't actively track what each of them was up to. Yet, boosters of generative AI adoption and “multi-agent orchestration” see this kind of approach as child's play.

“I'm excited by simulation tech where 20,000 AIs are all working alongside each other,” says Allie K. Miller, an AI-focused business consultant. Miller's approach to AI agents is more aligned with Silent Hill—and its fully haunted ghost town—than a small-scale haunting like The Conjuring.

This grandiose vision of the agentic future upheld by AI proponents—thousands of phantom bots swarming the web at once, all at the direction of a single person—still feels a long way off. My artisanal quintet of agents struggled with the handful of tasks I gave them, even when the prompts were just the ones suggested by ChatGPT. The agent I sent off in search of a birthday gift clicked on the wrong thing multiple times, similar to the chess-playing agent that couldn't click on the right game piece. The agent generating a pitch deck took 26 minutes to gin up a presentation, and the results looked rushed, like something a struggling middle schooler would create the night before an assignment was due.

Taking forever to generate mid results? Now that's what I call a spooky story.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Did Tesla's Robotaxi Launch Backfire?","https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-robotaxi-launch-survey-data/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

Would you consider a ride in a self-driving car? After hearing a bit about Tesla's robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, last month, just under half of US consumers wouldn't even think about it, according to survey data shared exclusively with WIRED.

Thirty-one percent of the survey's respondents said they're not considering riding one right now. Sixty-five percent said they hadn't even heard about Tesla's robotaxi launch, which includes just a handful of cars and is open only to invited users—mostly Tesla fans. The cool reception to the launch could be less than ideal for Tesla, which has staked its future on its robotics technology.

It gets worse for the electric-car maker. According to a survey, which polled 8,000 US consumers and was conducted by the market research group Electric Vehicle Intelligence Report (EVIR), 50 percent of consumers were less interested in a robotaxi ride after reading an excerpt of Wall Street Journal coverage of the Tesla launch. (The excerpt described the service and noted the potential downsides of Tesla's camera-based technology.) Just over half of those surveyed said they were less convinced that Tesla's robotaxis were safe. Over 30 percent said they strongly believed self-driving taxis should be illegal. (Twenty-four percent said they weren't sure.)

Tesla, which publicly disbanded its public relations team in 2021, did not respond to WIRED's request for comment. Tesla CEO Elon Musk will likely be asked by investors about the robotaxi launch, and the public's reactions to it, during Tesla's second-quarter earnings call slated for Wednesday afternoon.

The company's path-breaking approach to electric vehicles, and the tech underpinning their design and manufacture, has long made the automaker, its cars, and its mercurial leader Musk an industry lightning rod. For many years, Musk and company were able to translate that flash and noise into sky-high valuations and acclaim. Tesla is still the world's most valuable carmaker, despite accounting for just 2.5 percent of global vehicles sold last year.

But Musk's foray into politics—including a Nazi-like salute executed during President Donald Trump's inauguration, and a months-long stint as the face of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency—seems to have shifted consumer feelings about Tesla, especially around a former key demographic of affluent liberals. An EVIR survey from earlier this year found that Tesla is now the only EV brand with a negative consumer perception. This spring, Tesla deliveries dropped 13.5 percent.

Self-driving tech, and the artificial intelligence and robotics breakthroughs underlying it, was meant to be part of Tesla's salvation. “Really, we should be thought of as an AI robotics company,” Musk told investors in April. “If you value Tesla as just an auto company … fundamentally, that's just the wrong framework. If somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company.” He's said that work in those areas could make Tesla “the most valuable company in the world by far.”

But a long-promised robotaxi service launch in Austin didn't go entirely to script. Musk initially said no one other than the customer would be inside the self-driving Teslas, but the automaker installed human safety operators in the front passenger seat of each car to intervene when the tech fails. The service isn't yet open to the public; only invited users, initially Tesla influencers popular on Musk's X platform, have access to robotaxis. Tech bloopers captured by those riders, including an incident in which a robotaxi briefly crossed a double-yellow line to drive into the oncoming lane of traffic, attracted the notice of federal regulators; a spokesperson for the National Highway Traffic Administration told WIRED last month that the agency is looking into the tech. And the launch itself was small, using just a handful of cars in a limited part of the city. (Tesla expanded the service area in Austin last week; in a brazen, puckish flourish typical of Musk and Tesla, the new map resembles a phallus.)

Still, Musk has said his tech will roll out rapidly and that there will be “millions of Teslas operating autonomously” in the second half of 2026.

EVIR also polled 4,100 consumers with investment exposure to Tesla and found that 61 percent believe Musk should “focus on his businesses instead of risking his reputation with government-related activities.""

If US consumers can't get onboard with Tesla robotaxis, the fallout might have implications for the entire autonomous vehicle industry. As with any new technology, a safety misstep by one industry player might affect all of them.

The queasy consumer feelings about robotaxis could hardly come at a worse time: After years of over-promising and underdelivering, many Western tech developers are finally getting their self-driving tech on the roads. Alphabet's Waymo is picking up paying passengers in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, and Atlanta; Amazon's Zoox says it will launch in Las Vegas this year; Lyft and the tech developer May Mobillity say they'll start picking up passengers in Atlanta this year; Uber and the British company Wayve say they're working to start self-driving service in London at some point after the second half of 2027.

In a written statement, May Mobility COO Kathy Winter called surveys finding low public trust and interest in robotaxis “simply an artifact of low exposure to a new technology.” “The superior convenience and safety [autonomous vehicles] provide are game changers for even the most skeptical first-time riders,” she wrote.

In a statement, Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher wrote, “We work closely with community organizations, elected officials, regulators, and emergency responders to help educate the public about the technology in the cities we operate before we are open to riders.” He cited Waymo data showing that Waymo's technology gets into 88 percent fewer crashes involving serious injuries in the cities where it operates compared to the average human driver.

Zoox didn't respond to WIRED's requests for comment.

China, meanwhile, seems to be racing ahead in self-driving taxis. Baidu's Apollo Go says it has completed 11 million rides—at the time, more than Waymo's 10 million—in cities all over China; rivals WeRide and Pony.ai operate in five and four cities, respectively.

Update, July 22 at 1:30 pm: Updated to include a statement from Waymo. This story was also updated earlier to correct an error. The percentage of consumers who were less interested in robotaxi rides after reading the Wall Street Journal excerpt is 50 percent.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Everything Is a ‘False Flag' Now","https://www.wired.com/story/false-flag-conspiracy-theory-trump/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 15:18:00 GMT","

As President Donald Trump struggles to contain the fallout related to his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case, some of his own supporters have decided only one conspiracy theory could possibly explain what's going on. Welcome to the era of the “false flag.”

Almost every news development is now labeled a “false flag,” or a distraction designed to deflect attention from the real story, by some conspiracy theorist online. “All these floods popping up around the country is a false flag,” an anonymous X account which posts far-right content wrote on July 10. “They want us to forget Epstein!”

False-flag conspiracy theories have been around for decades, long before the emergence of the internet—and like many conspiratorial prisms, they're rooted in something real, in this case the fact that militaries and intelligence services have staged attacks in order to give pretexts for war. But the volume of social media posts mentioning “false flags” is now at an unprecedented high, according to new research from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) shared exclusively with WIRED. Basically, according to the conspiratorial corners of the internet, everything is a false flag now.

“False-flag attacks in the form of severe and unprecedented flooding are currently being carried out across the country as a diversion from Trump spiking the Epstein files,” Stew Peters, a podcaster with a long history of promoting antisemitism and conspiracy theories, wrote on X, alongside a video of actual flooding in North Carolina.

“I didn't need ChatGPT to tell me it was a falseflag assassination,” RC DeWinter, an artist with 70,000 followers, on X wrote on the anniversary of the Trump assassination attempt.

“Everything you are watching on TV is a false flag, especially the nonsense about Elon Musk & Trump spat,” another X user wrote last week, referencing the fallout between the president and the richest man in the world.

Data from ISD shows that over the past five years, false-flag claims have increased by more than 1,100 percent on X, and the situation is getting increasingly worse. There were 1 million mentions of “false flag” on X between April 26 and June 26, 2025, a nearly 350 percent increase compared to the prior two months.

“It's unprecedented in terms of the volume, the speed at which it spread, and the level of engagement that we saw. Some of these accounts were not that big, and yet they were garnering millions of views in a matter of hours,” Valeria de la Fuente Suárez, a digital research analyst with ISD and author of the research, tells WIRED. “It's just becoming this common response to these high-profile crises when there's chaos and confusion and uncertainty and, in many cases, it doesn't align with their agenda.”

De la Fuente Suárez says the institute's research focused on X but adds that she was also able to find many examples of “false flag” conspiracizing on other platforms, including TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook.

X, TikTok, and Meta did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

False-flag operations, which are carried out by governments or militaries in an effort to blame an adversary for something they did not actually do, have a rich history. In one of the most famous examples, German soldiers pretended that Polish troops had stormed across the Poland-Germany border in 1939 and taken over a German radio station. The next day, Germany invaded Poland—and Adolf Hitler referenced the previous day's fake attack in order to legitimize the incursion.

But for as much as real false-flag incidents have occurred, conspiracy theorists have used these histories as a way of legitimizing false-flag conspiracy theories. Major incidents, including the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the September 11 attacks, and the Sandy Hook school shooting, are framed by conspiracy theorists as false flags. Today, after any major incident—whether it's the attempted assassination of Trump last year, the devastating Texas flooding this month, or the shooting of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman in June—people on the right and left now regularly respond by claiming they are simply distractions.

“Vance Boelter is not a real person,” one X account holder posted about the charged Minnesota shooter. “This is a false flag psyop that the news media is using to instill fear into the people.”

In her report, de la Fuente Suárez outlines a number of reasons why these conspiracy theories have flourished online, including the collapse in trust of mainstream media and public institutions, social media platforms abandoning fact-checking, and the rise in popularity of so-called “news influencers” like Peters. “It creates the sense that nothing can be trusted, that all we read, we see, we hear, on TV, on the news, it's part of this deception,” de la Fuente Suárez says. “But one of the things that concerns me the most is that within these frameworks, those that are harmed in these attacks are also dehumanized. They are depicted not as victims of attacks, but as these elements of a grand staged plan of deception, downplaying acts of violence and the suffering of the victims in it.”

De la Fuente Suárez says that antisemitism is also driving false-flag conspiracies to an unprecedented level.

Antisemitic posts were among the main drivers of the most recent spike in false-flag conspiracies on X. This began, she says, in response to the shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers who were leaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, on May 21. Less than two weeks later, a man in Boulder, Colorado, allegedly used incendiary devices to attack participants in a march held to support Israeli hostages in Gaza.

“False Flag 100%,” a conspiracy-focused X account posted two days after the DC shooting. The post was accompanied by a video of the immediate aftermath of the shooting and has been viewed 3.6 million times to date.

In the aftermath of the Boulder attack, an X account that describes its author as an “anti-zionist Jew” posted an image of the suspected attacker with the caption: “This man is an Israeli agent who has just perpetrated a false flag event in Boulder Colorado.” The post has been viewed over 2.2 millions times.

“Antisemitism is at the center of these conspiracy claims, so they resonate more, and in these moments, it's just an easy response and one that is, in many cases, very difficult to debunk,” says de la Fuente Suárez.

Other experts see the rise in false-flag conspiracy theories as a reflection of the increasingly fractured political environment.

""The rise in false-flag conspiracy theories is closely tied to the political climate,” Pradeep Krishnan, an expert in conspiracy theory and communication at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland, tells WIRED. “The Trump presidency has mainstreamed conspiracist rhetoric to mobilize political distrust and promote antiestablishment sentiment.”

What do mattresses and a box of matches have in common? It's not just that they're both rectangular—both can can be very flammable if you're not careful. Mattresses have historically posed a significant fire hazard, and they still can without careful attention to the materials used.

In the US, an estimated 20,800 residential fires occurred due to mattresses and bedding igniting from flame exposure between 1996 and 1998, according to FEMA. At that time, fires involving mattresses and bedding were causing double the death and injury of all residential structure fires.

Something had to be done, and the solution was the incorporation of fire retardants. While they don't make a bed fully fireproof, they slow the spread of fire and ultimately prevent sleepers from becoming the Human Torch. New federal standards for mattress flammability took effect in July 2007. But some of the new fire retardants used have created concerns about other health affects, especially if the worst comes to pass and it does ignite. What could you potentially be breathing in, or coming into contact with—and are there long-term repercussions from that exposure? To understand what makes a mattress safe from and in fires, we need to understand the different forms of flame retardant and how they perform in various scenarios.

Fiberglass has been the fire barrier of choice for many a mattress for a long time. You can usually find it in one of two places: the mattress cover, or a thin internal sleeve that's usually called a “fire sock.” Fiberglass is very good as a flame retardant since it won't burn and has an extremely high melting point, 2,237 degrees Fahrenheit. It's a cheap material that's easy to integrate into a mattress.

But fiberglass has some serious drawbacks. If it splinters off and is inhaled or touched, it can cause significant damage to your skin or internal organs. Consumers have become increasingly aware of this problem, and pushback against mattresses with a fiberglass layer has become prevalent on social media, like a fairly recent wave of posts on TikTok.

Mattresses that do contain fiberglass have to say so on the attached label. The mattress tag may not, however, show what fire retardant chemicals are being used in the mattress instead. This is where certifications, careful research, and the recommendation of trusted testers are going to be crucial in picking the right product. WIRED, for example, does not recommend beds that contain fiberglass.

We opt to test mattresses that have certifications to behold. While things like CertiPUR-US certification only lends itself to memory foam, it still points to a safer sleep experience. But to bypass fiberglass altogether, there are many alternatives to consider. Here are some of the most common in mattresses we have tested:

Wool contains two major elements that aren't flame-friendly: nitrogen and water. It requires some serious heat to catch fire (around 1,060 to 1,115 degrees Fahrenheit). Even, then it isn't the easiest to burn and may take more time to smolder before ultimately snuffing the fire out itself. Similarly, cashmere and mohair (courtesy of Angora goats) are naturally fire-resistant animal-based materials that prevent the spread of flame. They too contain a lot of moisture and will shrivel up like wool when subjected to flame.

Saatva

Rayon can be derived from the wood pulp from a variety of plant sources—for example, we often see it in bamboo sheets. It's classified as a “semi-synthetic fiber” because it requires pretty serious chemical treatment in order to be transformed from a pulpy goo to the finished material. To make it fire resistant, though, rayon requires the use of silica. When subjected to flame, this mineral creates a char barrier that halts flames from progressing. Silica treatments can serve as a fire barrier in other materials as well.

Leesa

Synthetic fibers, namely nylon and polyester, are both heavily plastic-based. Simply put, they require very high levels of heat to melt. “Melt” is the key word here, as even when subjected to flame exposure, the first reaction isn't to self-ignite.

Aside from fiberglass, there are a few other flame retardants you want to avoid. The good news is that for the most part, you shouldn't encounter many of these, as the majority have been banned over health concerns. But if something feels amiss, it's a go-with-your-gut situation. Are there noxious chemical smells coming from the bed? Is your skin reacting to it? Do you think you're breathing weird after sleeping on it? Double-check the legal tag, and reach out to customer service to confirm what's being used in the bed. But it still might not provide you all the answers you're seeking. Again, this is where material certifications are so important, because they verify the absence of these things in the finished product.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are known as “forever chemicals” because once they enter the body, they make themselves permanently at home. While they work as a fire barrier, they can have long-term health ramifications after exposure, resulting in various forms of neurological and hormonal disorders. However, their usage in mattresses has been mostly phased out for these reasons.

Decabromodiphenyl oxide (DecaBdE) is similar to PBDEs in that it doesn't vacate the body. While it's been banned from use since 2013, it was used in mattresses, textiles, and plastic products. Long-term accumulation can lead outcomes similar to those of PBDEs, like reproductive, thyroid, neurological, and liver disorders.

Chlorinated tris (TDCPP) is another chemical flame retardant that can be found in some polyurethane foams, whether that be a mattress, piece of furniture, or clothing. It was banned in California back in 2020 and is listed on the Proposition 65 chemical list that could lead to serious long-term ramifications.

Antimony trioxide can be used in foam and plastic production as a flame-resistant substance, but it has been studied for carcinogenic outcomes. It, too, is on California's Proposition 65 chemical list.

Organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPFRS) were used as an alternative to PBDEs, especially as a flame retardant in foams, furniture, and tech products. Unfortunately, more research is coming to light on the downsides of OPFRs. Exposure can be linked to potential birth defects, can complicate pregnancies (like premature birth), and can cause health issues neurologically and hormonally for children in particular.

Boric acid can be used as a flame retardant. But it's also used as insecticide.

Melamine is common for plastic products, especially for kitchen usage. Where it gets tricky is that as a flame retardant, it can release health-compromising fumes that are dangerous to breathe in—like hydrogen cyanide. Skin exposure can also mean potential serious neurological and kidney damage.

The surest ways to get a safe mattress are to stick with reputable domestic brands and consider an organic mattress. We have an entire guide dedicated to the best organic mattresses, including some of our favorites below.

Avocado

This mattress really takes the cake when it comes to showing how natural it is. There are numerous organic certifications. While latex by itself isn't fully fireproof, it is pretty impervious to heat—making it just another layer of supportive security.

With many chemical flame retardants being especially harmful for kids, sticking to organic mattresses can bring parents some peace of mind. WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson got this particular bed for his kids, who really enjoyed it for both sleeping and jumping on.

Take precautions when using any flame near your bed—you don't want to have a live demo of its flame barrier if you don't have to. If you light candles in the evening, especially near your bedside, blow them out before you leave the room or fall sleep. Don't smoke or vape in bed, as a spark from ash or even a vape malfunctioning could ignite a mattress fire. Keep an eye on how close your bed is to electrical outlets and where you have things plugged in, like your phone charger. Lastly, make sure fire safety is common knowledge amongst family members and roommates, just to be on the safe side. You could follow every precaution perfectly, but those around you may not know. So let's keep each other safe, Smokey the Bear style. But make it mattresses.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Leaked Memo: Anthropic CEO Says the Company Will Pursue Gulf State Investments After All","https://www.wired.com/story/anthropic-dario-amodei-gulf-state-leaked-memo/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 00:46:32 GMT","

Anthropic is planning to seek investment from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, according to a Slack message CEO Dario Amodei sent to staff Sunday morning, which WIRED obtained.

Weighing the pros and cons, Amodei acknowledged in his note that accepting money from Middle East leaders would likely enrich “dictators.” “This is a real downside and I'm not thrilled about it,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success' is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.”

The message comes as AI companies race to secure the massive amounts of capital required to train and develop frontier AI models. In January, OpenAI announced a $500 billion data center project called Stargate with financial backing from MGX, a state-owned Emirati investment firm. Four months later, the company announced it was planning to build a data center in Abu Dhabi, as part of a push to help foreign governments “build sovereign AI capability in coordination with the US.”

“As an American company at the frontier of AI development, we have always believed the supply chain of frontier AI model development should be on American soil in order to maintain America's lead,” said Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty in a statement. “As Dario has said before, we believe fundamentally in sharing the benefits of AI and serve the Middle East and regions around the world commercially, in line with our Usage Policy.”

In May, President Donald Trump toured the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as part of a four-day trip focused on economic investments. A cabal of tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, joined him for a meeting with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Anthropic's leadership was notably absent.

In his memo, Amodei acknowledged that the decision to pursue investments from authoritarian regimes would lead to accusations of hypocrisy. In an essay titled “Machines of Loving Grace,” Amodei wrote: “Democracies need to be able to set the terms by which powerful AI is brought into the world, both to avoid being overpowered by authoritarians and to prevent human rights abuses within authoritarian countries.”

In 2024, Anthropic decided not to accept money from Saudi Arabia, citing national security concerns, per CNBC. The news came as FTX, the failed cryptocurrency exchange, went into bankruptcy proceedings, and its nearly 8 percent stake in Anthropic went up for sale. Ultimately, a majority of those shares went to ATIC Third International Investment, a UAE firm. At the time, the stake was worth about $500 million.

Now, it appears Anthropic is poised to accept Gulf State money—though the company hasn't said whether it has changed its stance on Saudi Arabia in particular. “There is a truly giant amount of capital in the Middle East, easily $100B or more,” Amodei wrote in the memo. “If we want to stay on the frontier, we gain a very large benefit from having access to this capital. Without it, it is substantially harder to stay on the frontier.”

By pursuing a “narrowly scoped, purely financial investment from Gulf countries,” the company hopes to avoid the risks associated with allowing outside investors to gain “leverage” over the company, the memo says.

“The basis of our opposition to large training clusters in the Middle East, or to shipping H20's to China, is that the ‘supply chain' of Al is dangerous to hand to authoritarian governments—since Al is likely to be the most powerful technology in the world, these governments can use it to gain military dominance or to gain leverage over democratic countries,” Amodei wrote in the memo, referring to Nvidia chips.

Still, the CEO admitted investors could gain “soft power” through the promise of future funding. “The implicit promise of investing in future rounds can create a situation where they have some soft power, making it a bit harder to resist these things in the future. In fact, I actually am worried that getting the largest possible amounts of investment might be difficult without agreeing to some of these other things,” Amodei writes. “But l think the right response to this is simply to see how much we can get without agreeing to these things (which I think are likely still many billions), and then hold firm if they ask.”

In a section titled “Erosion of Standards,” Amodei notes that the reason Anthropic “vociferously pushed for not allowing big data centers in the Middle East” was because “without a central authority blocking them, there's a race to the bottom where companies gain a lot of advantage by getting deeper and deeper in bed with the Middle East.”

“Unfortunately, having failed to prevent that dynamic at the collective level, we're now stuck with it as an individual company, and the median position across the other companies appears to be ‘outsourcing our largest 5 GW training runs to UAE/Saudi is fine,'” the CEO said, likely referring to the United States' agreement to build a new AI data center in the UAE powered by 5 gigawatts of electricity. “That puts us at a significant disadvantage, and we need to look for ways to make up some of that disadvantage while remaining less objectionable. I really wish we weren't in this position, but we are.”

In a section titled “Comms Headaches,” the CEO acknowledged that taking investment from Gulf States would likely lead to public criticism. The “media / Twitter / the outside world” is “always looking for hypocrisy, while also being very stupid and therefore having a poor understanding of substantive issues,” Amodei wrote. He added: “It's perfectly consistent to advocate for a policy of ‘No one is allowed to do x,' but then if that policy fails and everyone else does X, to reluctantly do x ourselves.”

“We are also interested in serving the region commercially, which is something I think is actually pure positive as long as we don't build data centers there and as long as we enforce our [acceptable use policy],” he added. “In fact, it could have important benefits for the world including improving human health, aiding economic development, etc.”

He concluded: “As with many decisions, this one has downsides, but we believe it's the right one overall.”

A team of astronomers have discovered a curious figure in the universe. It is two distant galaxies colliding with each other to form a larger structure. From Earth's perspective, the junction of the disks resembles the number eight lying down, similar to the infinity symbol (∞).

Because of this resemblance, the researchers—who are based at the universities of Yale and Copenhagen—have nicknamed it the “Infinity Galaxy” and have detailed their discovery in a paper published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Beyond its evocative shape, the structure intrigues the scientists because of its contents: Within it could be the first direct evidence of a newly formed primordial supermassive black hole.

The images were taken through the James Webb Space Telescope and then enriched with information from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the most powerful X-ray telescope ever created. Light from this galaxy comes from a time when the universe was only 470 million years old—roughly 13.5 billion years ago. In the dual galaxy's structure, at least two consolidated black holes can be observed, each centered in a respective disk (the yellow points in the image below), and a region of compressed gas at the point of intersection suggests the presence of a supermassive object (the green point).

The Infinity Galaxy, with three points marked where there could be black holes.

The scientists think they might have viewed signs of a direct collapse black hole. Typically, black holes are formed when stars run out of fuel and collapse under their own gravity, but there's an alternative formation phenomenon debated in astrophysics—where a black hole forms via the collapse of gigantic gas cloud, without a star having formed. Such a possibility has been theorized, but this type of black hole has yet to be observed.

The largest black holes found in the universe, supermassive black holes, have been identified in galaxies that formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. But what made their formation possible is not yet fully understood. Many supermassive black holes are believed to have come into being as a result of smaller black holes merging. But with very old supermassive black holes, there does not seem to have been enough time for the first stars in the universe to evolve, collapse into stellar-mass black holes, and then merge to colossal, supermassive sizes.

So some astronomers have proposed an alternative origin for the universe's first supermassive black holes. According to this hypothesis, the black holes would not need to form from a star or arise from mergers. Instead, the theory goes, dense clumps of matter that in other instances gave rise to galaxies could have compressed directly into massive black holes. Scientists are currently investigating this scenario, although conclusive evidence of this having happened is still lacking.

It is possible that the Infinity Galaxy offers revealing clues about the possibility of this second formation pathway. “During the collision, the gas within these two galaxies shocks and compresses. This compression might just be enough to form a dense knot, which then collapsed into a black hole,” Pieter van Dokkum, a professor of astronomy and physics at Yale and a coauthor on the paper, said in a post on his university's website. “While such collisions are rare events, similarly extreme gas densities are thought to have been quite common in the earliest cosmic epochs, when galaxies began to form,” Van Dokkum added.

Scientists are also considering other, less spectacular alternatives as to what's going on in the Infinity Galaxy. Rather than being created through a direct collapse of gas, that potential extra black hole—the green spot in the image above—could instead be the signs of a black hole ejected from another galaxy as “Infinity” passes through it. Another possible scenario is that this image actually shows the collision of three galaxies, with the third eclipsed by the other larger ones.

For the moment, the team says the preliminary results are exciting. “We can't say definitively that we have found a direct collapse black hole. But we can say that these new data strengthen the case that we're seeing a newborn black hole, while eliminating some of the competing explanations,” Van Dokkum concluded in a blog for NASA.

Security researchers at Google and Microsoft say they have evidence that hackers backed by China are exploiting a zero-day bug in Microsoft SharePoint, as companies around the world scramble to patch the flaw.

The bug, known officially as CVE-2025-53770 and discovered last weekend, allows hackers to steal sensitive private keys from self-hosted versions of SharePoint, a software server widely used by companies and organizations to store and share internal documents. Once exploited, an attacker can use the bug to remotely plant malware and gain access to the files and data stored within, as well as gain access to other systems on the same network.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft said it had observed at least two previously identified China-backed hacking groups it calls “Linen Typhoon” and “Violet Typhoon” exploiting the SharePoint zero-day. Microsoft says Linen Typhoon is focused on stealing intellectual property, while Violet Typhoon steals private information to be used for espionage.

Microsoft also attributed the ongoing hacks to a third China-backed hacking group it named “Storm-2603,” representing a hacking group about which the company has less information. The company noted, however, that the hackers have been linked to ransomware attacks in the past.

According to Microsoft, the three hacking groups were observed exploiting the zero-day vulnerability to break into vulnerable SharePoint servers as far back as July 7.

Charles Carmakal, the chief technology officer at Google's incident response unit Mandiant, told TechCrunch in an email that “at least one of the actors responsible” was a China-nexus hacking group, but noted that “multiple actors are now actively exploiting this vulnerability.”

Dozens of organizations have already been hacked, including across the government sector. The bug is regarded as a zero-day because the vendor — Microsoft, in this case — had no time to issue a patch before it was actively exploited. Microsoft has since rolled out patches for all affected versions of SharePoint, but security researchers have warned that customers running self-hosted versions of SharePoint should assume they have already been compromised.

The Chinese government has long rebuffed allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks, though it has not always explicitly denied its involvement.

When reached for comment, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement that China “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cyber crime — a position that is consistent and clear.”

This is the latest hacking campaign linked to China in recent years. Hackers backed by China were accused of targeting self-hosted Microsoft Exchange email servers in 2021 as part of a mass-hacking campaign. According to a recent Justice Department indictment accusing two Chinese hackers of masterminding the breaches, the so-called “Hafnium” hacks compromised contact information and private mailboxes from more than 60,000 affected servers.

TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is where breakthrough ideas meet the real-world challenges that define the future — and with over 10,000 startup and VC leaders converging, there's no better place to have the hard conversations. One of the most urgent? How artificial intelligence is reshaping national defense, security, and critical infrastructure in real time.

Enter AI Defense, a can't-miss panel discussion taking place on one of the two AI Stages, where leaders from government, venture, and the armed services will explore the high-stakes collision of innovation and national security.

With AI evolving at a blistering pace, the stakes for defense innovation have never been higher. From autonomous systems and decision intelligence to cybersecurity and battlefield readiness, the U.S. defense and intelligence communities are racing to build smarter, more adaptive technologies — without compromising ethics, oversight, or safety.

This panel explores the delicate balance between intelligence and control, the role of startups in defense innovation, and the multibillion-dollar opportunities emerging at the intersection of national security and AI.

If your startup touches defense, government, cybersecurity, or AI infrastructure, this is a conversation you can't afford to miss.

Onstage, you'll hear from Dr. Kathleen Fisher, director of the Information Innovation Office at DARPA, who is leading the charge on tech that gives the U.S. and its allies an edge in the information wars of the 21st century. With a career that spans AT&T Labs and academia at Tufts University, Fisher blends research credibility with strategic vision, and she's shaping the next generation of defense-grade AI.

Joining the panel is Sri Chandrasekar, managing partner at Point72 Ventures, and formerly a leader at In-Q-Tel, the CIA's strategic investment arm. Chandrasekar knows how to spot frontier tech that moves the needle, and he's built investment frameworks to support some of the intelligence community's toughest missions.

Telegram is expanding access to its crypto wallet for its 87 million users in the U.S.

The TON wallet, named because it is built on the TON blockchain, is integrated directly into the Telegram app. By existing within the app, Telegram's crypto wallet is supposed to form an easier onramp for new crypto users.

Telegram has offered crypto wallets to international users since 2023, though it was unable to roll out in the U.S. until now due to regulatory uncertainty. Telegram says more than 100 million global users activated their wallets last year, which is about 10% of Telegram's 1 billion active users. Public data shows that about 334,000 transactions are processed on the TON blockchain per day.

Photo editing and sharing app VSCO is making its iOS camera app, Capture, available across the world, following a limited launch in June, when the app could be downloaded only in Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand.

VSCO also said it is acquiring The Freelance Photographer, which provides a mix of online and offline workshops for studying photography and videography.

“There's a clear gap in the market for business education and industry-specific guidance for emerging photography professionals who are looking to secure sustainable client relationships. The Freelance Photographer serves as a long-term career partner to creatives, offering a comprehensive education, a supportive community, as well as the tools and insight they need to turn their craft into a career,” Eric Wittman, CEO of VSCO, said in a statement.

VSCO's first new app in more than a decade, Capture focuses on taking pictures with a set aesthetic. The app has more than 50 presets for images along with some real-time effects. It offers manual control over camera functions like shutter speed and exposure, and can take pictures in RAW and ProRAW formats. The app also lets users sync all photos with VSCO's cloud.

The Freelance Photographer offers various courses, starting from $208 per month for the basic coaching plan, and a $625 per month that gives subscribers access to over 50 tools, several courses, and personal mentoring from the company's founder, Paul Weaver. 

The acquisition fits neatly into VSCO's aim of catering more to professional photographers. Last year, the company launched VSCO Hub, to enable brands to discover photographers for different projects, and VSCO Sites, which lets photographers create web pages to show off their work. In May, the company launched VSCO Canvas, a collaborative whiteboard product that lets users create moodboards for different projects.

Philadelphia-based robotics company Asylon announced Tuesday that it raised a $26 million Series B led by Insight Partners, with participation from Veteran Ventures Capital, Allegion Ventures, and the GoPA Fund.

Asylon began as a drone company for securing facilities. It's best known for a drone that has a robotic arm that can change its own batteries.

But it also has a robotic guard dog service called DroneDog. Asylon takes the famed Boston Dynamics robot dog Spot and modifies it for guard work and to integrate with its command-and-control Guardian software. Asylon offers the drones, dogs, and software as its robotic security-as-a-service (RaaS).

A site can be secured with ground patrols via robot dogs and flying cameras that cover more areas than stationary cameras. DroneDogs can be sent to places unsafe for humans or real dogs. And they can perform almost dog sniffing-like tasks such as detecting gas leaks or dangerous chemicals. 

The company, which was founded in 2015, hasn't raised much venture capital prior to this compared with other drone and robotics companies. It previously raised about $21 million, plus some government grants, bringing its total raised to about $45 million, founder CEO Damon Henry told TechCrunch.

While Henry described fundraising as hard, after the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December, companies have increased spending on CEO home and facility security, such as DroneDog. Its RaaS can cost about $100,000 to $150,000 a year — akin to hiring a human bodyguard service.

“I went to an event last summer, a New York Tech Week event, and I happen to have met every investor that's in the round at that event,” Henry said. When he decided to raise, he already had warm intros with investors who were aware that security spending is rising.

Henry and his two cofounders, Adam Mohamed (CTO) and Brent McLaughlin (COO), were dorm roommates at MIT. But unlike the classic Silicon Valley story, they did not drop out. They went to work as aerospace engineers after graduation for companies like GE Aviation, Boeing, and Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.

In 2015, the three friends saw Amazon announce its drone delivery service and were inspired. They quit their jobs and founded Asylon. By 2019 they had their first customer: Ford.

And in 2021, the startup almost suffered a swift death. Ford had agreed to let them do a live demo event showing how their drones worked at its facility. A group of Fortune 500 had signed up to see the demo, Henry recalled. 

The night before the event, the drone crashed and was destroyed. Henry saw his company flash before his eyes: a ruined reputation. No customers. The end.

A dedicated employee drove all night to deliver another drone, but the founders had precious little time to get it running. Miraculously, they did, and it worked flawlessly during the event.

“The system flew consistently, perfectly all day long,” he said. “It won us our next three customers — Fortune 500 customers. And then the same day simultaneously, we actually won our first DoD contract for the drones.”

The founders have been carefully growing the company ever since. Asylon now employs 65 and has systems deployed in 15 states, he said.

You will be hard-pressed to find someone who stuck with it for a week and decided to go back to git. You will not find a lot of people who say they switched but just stayed out of inertia. Of course both of these do happen—nothing is perfect—but they are by far the exception. From my own personal anecadata, I have seen a 100% conversion rate from everyone who gave it a serious try.I encourage you to let today be the day that you decide to try it out. It is far less effort to make the switch than you probably think it is: I was productive the same day I switched and within a week I had no remaining situations where I needed to fall back to git commands. You will quickly be more productive and you will find yourself amazed at how you ever got by without it.

I don't have any productivity issues with git, like... at all. It's not like I spend an hour running git commands every day.I can totally imagine that some people spend their day manipulating repos with git, and jj is better for them. But that's not my case, and git is already everywhere.To me it sounds like telling me: ""You HAVE TO move to bim, the better vim. It's very similar to vim, but different enough that you have to learn new stuff. But you will be infinitely more productive: when you start bim, you're already in edit mode, so you don't have to type i! And the auto-complete in Julia is objectively a lot better in bim!"".Sure, but typing ""i"" a few times more is really not a concern for me, and I don't use Julia. But if it's better for you, please enjoy bim!

This is where jj excels. Especially if you find yourself often doing large chunks of work between convenient checkpoints, but you still want to create commits as if this work was all done in tiny and discrete chunks. It's also very helpful if you're the kind of developer who makes lots of unrelated changes in a single coding session, and wants all those changes to be in parallel branches that can be reviewed and merged independently. I greatly prefer working with (and being) the kind of developer that puts out a large number of very tiny and easy to review PRs, eve. jj makes doing that a breeze.There are lots of people for whom these things aren't important. I will be slightly judgmental and say I don't really enjoy working with them. They tend to write very large PRs that are difficult and time-consuming to review. And it's a frequent source of frustration for everyone when 95% of the work is uncontroversial but a merge is being held up because of legitimate concerns with an unrelated 5%. This is even worse when there's later work that builds upon it that can't happen until a merge (or that needs to be constantly rebased as the PR is improved).This is not to say if you do this you're a bad developer. There are plenty of great developers who don't care about these things and still do great work. This is also not to say you can't follow my preferred approach with git. I did it with git for a decade and a half.

As an example of another ‘unnecessary' switch, Pip with venvs was also completely solving all my Python dependency problems. I just needed to copy paste a few lines from my README to create and populate the venv, and remember to run pip and Python from that venv. And run pip freeze after package installs or upgrades. No problem. But switching to uv was a huge life improvement. No more copy pasting (‘uv sync' does everything and even that isn't needed) nor remembering extra steps and everything is fast so I'm never waiting and forgetting what I was going to do.I could've been GP talking about pip but still I would be missing out.I still see people clinging to cvs because it works for them (netbsd why?), which I respect but don't understand/believe.Fish don't know what water is.So.. I'm gonna give jj a go and trust life will be better again.

Jujutsu finally made me understand git, after ten years of git use. It removes enough of the magic that I now know exactly what the commands do, and how the data model works.

reply

Git has worktrees for that. If a parallel change is done in a separate worktree, it can be built and tested independently, which, I guess, is important for kernel developers, who are the initial target audience for git.

reply

I've never really struggled too hard to get git commits into different branches for review, but if you've put unrelated changes into the same working dir, you'll want `git add -p` to sort them out into multiple commits.Note there are corresponding `-p` flags for things like git-restore and git-reset as well.

You've added a new feature. In doing that, you've also fixed four unrelated bugs, clarified the documentation for a method you needed to use, and rewritten another function to be more performant.You could push this all as six commits on one branch. PR reviewers will now have to figure out what parts are related to what, or read each commit one-by-one. If someone wants changes to one of these commits, your entire branch is held up.Or you could split these six different commits out to each be directly on `main` and make a PR for each of them. They can be tested in CI, reviewed, and merged in isolation.The latter is far better. You can do it in git, but it's not exactly fun. It is trivial in jj.

But you should use the tools you want to use.

reply

They're useful, but they're not really what your parent is talking about, your parent is talking about a workflow where you realize you've want to break up your work after the fact, rather than setting out to do it that way from the start.

reply

A very, very large problem at five out of six companies I have worked at is casual code improvement and refactoring. Devs would say, ""we will address that minor and unrelated thing in a separate PR"" - one that never comes. At one company, a single PR could address unrelated fixes and it was encouraged to ""take out the trash"" on the code. Unrelated metrics added, logging improvement, or code simplified, or test robustness improved, etc. That company had vastly better code. Easier to read. Easier to maintain. Easier to observe. And easier to test.

reply

That sort of workflow is ideal for making sure you've got a set of isolated commits each looking at a single subject so that when someone is reading through the history later they can quickly see where something was introduced or why, and jj is perfect for doing that because it makes crafting those commits so much easier.

reply

Where the developers at that other company could “take out the trash” amidst one PR, jj makes it trivial to carve off each of those fixes into their own separate PR. It's no more work than making them separate commits.People don't do this in git because it's a hassle. So you either get cleanup that never comes because each branch needs to know in advance what work it's going to do or you get omnibus PRs that do twenty different things.There's a better way, and it lets you have clean history and developers can fix things they run into along the way.

reply

It's very frustrating that what IMO is the inferior approach was producing better results in those teams!

reply

When you are told to separate general code improvements to another PR, or worse, to not do them, and create a Jira task for them so they can be adequately prioritized, it just saps your will to do so. You just won't do any improvements that fall outside the scope of the feature, because even just thinking about the hoops you have to jump through to get work done is mentally draining.

reply

Coincidentally jj makes this process much easier than it would be with git, it will very happily let you shift commits around between different branches, edit commits in place and cleanly rebase those edits onto subsequent commits, or split a messy commit into two commits that makes sense.

reply

reply

If people instead reviewed commit by commit until the PR HEAD, the code itself would tell a story, but best of all - the story would then be obvious!

reply

I can see that.From the other side of the PR though, it involves significantly _more_ work from a reviewer.The ""red tape"" of separating commits and opening separate PRs should be removed by the team.The effort of separating commits and opening separate PRs is minimal once you're comfortable with the tools.I encourage colleagues to be comfortable with these workflows, because a reviewer's time is generally no less valuable than their's.

The best way of getting changes is through is simply sitting down and talking with the reviewer. Most of these small PRS, splitting things, creating elaborate stacking systems are just technology hacks around a social/process problem. I've seen people make more of a mess trying to split pr's up where they are so fine grained its silly and actually had dependencies on commits they didn't realise they had which reviewers then had to resolve. Literally anything to avoid talking and working with people. People are trying to turn a tightly collaborative process and turn it into isolated single work units with no collaboration that just need a rubber stamp.

reply

As opposed to one 33-change PR? Yes, absolutely yes they do.I probably don't have time to review a giant PR like that. If I do, I feel guilty asking for fixed in one part when 31 of the changes are great. Why are we holding up all these improvements for one or two small concerns? We can merge and just fix those later. Except that never happens.I probably have time to review eight one-liners. My other coworker has time for five. After lunch I can quickly check out another seven. Over the course of the day all 33 get reviewed and merged as time allows.

What's your git workflow for a change that depends on two other in flight changes?  (More generally, of course, this can occur in an arbitrary part of one's change graph - which is usually not too deep, but at least in my experience, occasionally is.)Having good tooling for this unlocked workflows I didn't know I was missing, and switching back to git when leaving Google felt like losing a limb.

It took me a few months to realize that I could use jj split to move specific files to a different commit. And then I'd sometimes squash them into related commits, rebase to move them around etc...But I just discovered interactive split, which lets you move specific lines and sections from different files in a commit to a different commit. So I've been using that a lot more recently to organize the changes more thematically.Ultimately I should try to become more diligent with adding a new commit any time I start doing something different - it's dead simple to do and even less friction to organize later - but I suppose that I'm not that inclined because the interactive split makes it so easy to do it all later that I just stay in the flow of my monster commits.Everything is possible with jj.just started making much more use of jj split to move split

- Create multiple topic branches, one for each thing you're working on.- Now you probably want to work on item A while having B and C all available, so make a single merge commit (jj new a b c) to build on top of.- Create further commits on top of that, while you're working.- When you're cleaning up (ideally often), use squash --to or rebase --after to move those commits back the branch they belong on. This does not invalidate the merge commit; you will, effectively, have multiple branches checked out at once.EDIT: This is apparently called the 'megamerge workflow'.

Also, if you didn't discover yet, you can use the arrow keys to unfold the different files and sections. Then select what you need, split the rest to new commit.As you know, even when just using the most basic functionality (new changes, merges, rebases) of jj, it's amazing. But then you just keep discovering other features and workflows - none of which require any incantations - that make it that much better. And I'm sure I'm still only scratching the surface of its possibilities.And, as I keep saying everywhere, jjui just takes the whole experience to another level.

It also makes it simple and easy to split B and A apart such that both their parents are `main` if they're unrelated.You can also go hog-wild. I was working on a big refactor recently. I made independent changes A, B, C, and D (each one to three commits). I then wanted to work on code that assumed all of these commits were available, so I made a merge commit E that combined them. I then made changes F that depended on that refactor, so was a child of E.Managing this was simple. If I needed to make updates or tweaks to A-D, E and F were updated to incorporate them automatically. `jj absorb` even meant that doing these types of changes was almost zero work: I could make a bunch of changes and the tool would know in which parent commit they belonged.None of this was merged in yet. When I was ready, PRs went out for A-D. When they each merged into `main`, E became a no-op and was discarded. F became its own PR. This is something I never would have done in git because having multiple threads of unmerged code is a colossal hassle.

There definitely are lots of big issues with Git though. I dunno how many jj solves but it doesn't seem unreasonable to suggest people move to a better system.

My point is just that I am yet to find a convincing example that would suggest that jj would improve my workflow. If people find it hard to stash a change, I don't tell them that they shouldn't get their shit together and not use jj. But I don't find it hard to stash a change, so why do I feel like jj evangelists try to convince me that something is wrong with me?

reply

That just results in less friction, and in you doing things with it that you couldn't be bothered to before. Yes, I can switch branches in git by stashing my changes, and then I can try to figure out the five-levels-deep stash stack, but with jj I just switch between branches without finishing working on them, because it just works and is easy.Yes, with git you can technically have five branches open at the same time, and stash work to switch between them to work on one thing or the other, but it's so hard and finicky that you end up never doing it in reality. Or, you can say ""I never need that"", but is it that you never need it, or that your tools make it so hard that you just subconsciously never do it? For me, it was the latter, as now I'm switching between branches ALL THE TIME, just because it's easy.

Git was fine. I used git for ages. I loved its underlying model, and I think it's brilliant. But it has a lot of sharp edges and a lot of tasks that are painful or frustrating, and people either opt to restrict themselves to a tiny subset to avoid the pain or they carefully curate a workflow that mostly does the job over the course of years.Suddenly within a week of trying a new tool you just… don't carry any of that any more.It's like going from GOTOs to structured programming with encapsulated functions. People made many useful programs with GOTO. Some people were more principled than others, but we all got by. But it turns out that functions and loops are a way better mental model for control flow than GOTO. Nobody had to switch and there were plenty of holdouts. But eventually the benefits were impossible to ignore.People like Dijkstra evangelized structured programming because they “saw the light”.

Lack of gitattributes support precludes git-crypt and git-lfs usage or anything that needs filters; line ending settings will get ignored, making Windows interop a little less smooth; etc.Also note that auxillary tooling, such as git-annex and git-bug, becomes second class, i.e. no oplog integration and  they might mess up your log with internal-use commits and heads.

Reporting in. Doesn't mean I will not end up with jj eventually, but so far I always went back to git after a while.For me it is the staging area and the workflow it allows. Most people hate it and love jj because it does away with it. That is just not me. I don't see the staging area as a hack that was necessary to overcome some superfluous technical limitations but as a workflow tool.Could I change my ways? Sure. jj just did not provide enough benefit for me so far to do it, but we will see. I am still open to give jj another try some day.

I use a staging area with jj! I would surmise most jj users do too. It's just a real, honest-to-god commit in the repo instead of a special snowflake.    # do some work
    …
    
    # prepare a new, empty commit if you don't already have one
    jj new --no-edit --insert-before @

    # move changes into it; repeat ad nauseam
    jj squash --interactive

Since it's just a commit, all your tools work with it out of the box. And you don't need to stash changes when you jump around between branches.

When I eventually figure it all out, I can tidy it all up into completely coherent, discrete, sequential commits that make it look like I knew exactly what I was doing from the start, then push to remote.Conversely git staging around stashing was always an absolute, terrifying mystery to me. I could never remember what was stored where, and would consequently end up losing work, repeating work, and, most of all, just making massive commits that make no sense.I was sold on jj from essentially the moment I found it, but I remain routinely amazed at how much more powerful (yet simple!) it is than I realized.

In my mind, in some sense, every commit can simultaneously be a stash, staging area, part of a branch and more. Because you can easily create endless branches on top of, beside, before, as merges of,  etc.. any commit. And it all automatically rebases, conflicts often auto-resolve (or at least don't block you immediately).I really don't know how to best describe it. But there's a reason that many people are quite literally evangelizing it in every post that comes up - who does this for git, or anything?Just give it a try. And, even better, use it via jjui

In Git, I need to keep in mind all the different things I'm working on and which branch goes where, or I wind up with a monster PR with a chain of commits that mix everything up enough that it's even more effort to pull the PR apart to be reviewable.  Ask my colleagues how I know that :P.With jj, I don't feel that I'm putting more effort into organising my changes -- quite the opposite -- not least because there's very little book-keeping involved in parking something that's in progress or coming back to it later.  And when I come to ask for a review, I've got separate changes I can push as smaller PRs, and I can easily pull the right sets of changes out to make each one reviewable.I think the biggest improvement is that if I just need to look at something else for a couple of minutes then come back, I can `jj new main` to switch and not bring my changes with me then I can `jj edit <oldref>` to get my working copy back into the state it was in before, with all my old changes.I'm pretty sure none of my colleagues have started using it (although they're free to) but I can confidently say (because I've asked) that they've noticed the difference in my work and prefer the more focused changes.

The biggest killer was performance. jj operations took several seconds for me, whereas git is instantaneous no matter how big the project. Maybe this is fixed now.But also honestly I felt like there was a bit more mental burden to using jj. When I switched back to git, it was like a weight off my shoulders. Maybe that's just due to the decade of constant use though.

Here's the main bug tracking this https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj/issues/4387Beyond that, the jj, gerrit, and git butler folks are working together on standardizing the change ID concept so they all work well together without extra tooling. That's going to take a long time though. Think ""store the change ID in the commit rather than as a trailer"", that kind of thing.

What really kept you from staying with it? It does seem like if your workflow involves a lot of nasty rebases you'd reap dividends from something like jj. I was also someone who'd mastered git (hell, I've written a git implementation) so I get having its patterns deeply ingrained.

reply

There's nothing keeping me from switching except the activation energy cost. Almost every aspect of working in my area (Linux kernel) is painful so I'm constantly investing in tooling and workflow stuff. So usually I just don't feel like investing EVEN MORE in the area of tooling that's probably least painful of all.So yeah this is still basically a recommendation for people to try JJ!

That said, I struggle a bit with learning version control systems (that aren't git, like, I never really wrapped my head around svn or darcs or anything until they invented git). Seems like everybody just wants to write about the cool new commands they can run now instead of conveying how the data model works, or what mental model it wants to encourage. I had the same issue trying to get into pijul a while back, couldn't understand how to conceptualize the current state of a branch if I couldn't point at a commit in a tree and say ""that's the branch, right there"".

reply

The data model is technically of revisions, which are stable across operations like rebases (which change the underlying git commit).How to conceptualize a branch: as a bookmark of a specific commit.

Now that I switched to jj (colocated with a get repo, very useful), I went back to using the CLI again for jj and I don't miss the graphical tools.

1) use a git hook to generate Gerrit IDs for new commit.
AFAIK, JJ doesn't support these.2) we also use submodules, which must be handled using git commands.So if I decide to use JJ, I'll have to use a mix of JJ and git..

This landed in a jj release a few months back. I assume it's live in gerrit now too.

For sure git is hard to learn for beginners and there could be an alternative which is easier to pick up (maybe jj) but for those who know how git works internally and are proficient with it I don't see it being worth the switch.

Oh, the number of times I do  git commit --fixup ...searches `git log` and pastes`... && \
    git rebase -i --autosquash ...that same commit^...

I waste several half minutes several times per day in periods!Another time-consuming thing is context-switching from a feature branch with staged/unstaged changes. If you're good with worktrees, you can largely avoid this, but the way I work with worktrees, I instantiate them as subdirectories to my repo's parent, which clutters my directories unless I make space for this as I clone the repository, which I haven't got used to.I deliberately avoid too complicated git workflow aliases because I hate being stuck without them.I am definitely in the camp of ""I'd switch to jj the moment I give myself time to try it.""In the meantime, running git commands does sometimes take more time than it needs to.

    git rebase -i --rebase-merges --keep-base trunk

This lets me reorganize commits, edit commit messages, split work into new branches, etc… When I add --update-refs into the mix it lets me do what I read are the biggest workflow improvements from jj, except it's just git.This article from Andrew Lock on stacked branches in git was a great inspiration for me, and where I learned about --update-refs:https://andrewlock.net/working-with-stacked-branches-in-git-...

I've tried jj on three occasions and I always get confused by something and just bounce. It hasn't clicked for me.I've only tried it solo hobby projects. For which git is perfectly tolerable.I have many many many complaints about git. But jj doesn't move the needle for me.Reading this post I am extremely annoyed. Almost every single section is “but more on that later”. It's still far more complicated than it needs to be.I also really really really hate the jj log rendering. The colors are a sea of barf. Bolding the leading character that represent uniqueness is stupid and adds noise. The username being second is dumb, I almost never care about that.

You can fully change/customise it. Sounds like you just don't like the default.

Most people use the default for most of their tools. It's why Google pays Apple over $20 billion per year to be the default search engine. Because defaults matter.

> I've only tried it solo hobby projects.If I can surmise a bit, this is probably why it's never felt ""worth it"". I'm guessing that for a hobby project you don't really care that much about crafting small, easily-digestible PRs or keeping a clean history. `git commit -a` every now and then is good enough, and that's entirely reasonable.For team projects, jj becomes a much bigger deal. I find it invaluable for splitting up a day's worth of work into small, parallel, easily-reviewable changes. While working on one feature I might run across a dozen other things that should be fixed, improved, or otherwise changed. Bundling them into one giant PR is bad practice and causes reviews to take much longer.Carving those up into single-purpose PRs that can be reviewed in seconds and tested independently is super helpful on a project with multiple teammates. But that's not something that really matters or that most people care to take the time do to in personal projects. Hell, it's something a lot of people punt on a lot in git due to the extra burden of doing so.

I also already use very good tooling for git, namely Magit. IMO Magit is a much better git frontend than Jujutsu. It guides you down the right path but doesn't take away any of the power of git at all. It's quite remarkable.Maybe I should recommend jj to some of my colleagues, though. Trouble is I'm already on the hook for helping them with git, but I don't have the experience with jj.

This is kind of a poor take. By all means use what you prefer! But understanding git and knowing the ""right"" way to use it doesn't make jj obsolete.I am (or was) a git expert. I've used it since pre-GitHub. I've written a git implementation. I know (or knew) the interface inside and out. I haven't deleted and re-cloned a repo in as long as I can remember.jj is still leagues better. Things I want to do and know how to do in git are dramatically faster and easier. They require less mental overhead. They're less error prone. And I get superpowers with workflows that are super useful but wildly impractical in git.This isn't even really opinion at this point. Any task you can give me in git, I can with almost near certainty give you a shorter and more elegant alternative with jj that is an intuitive and obvious interaction with its core primitives.A month ago our company split off a division. They needed to take a specific repo and sanitize out all of the parts that aren't relevant to the new company, going back to the beginning of its commit history. You can do this with git.

They needed to take a specific repo and sanitize out all of the parts that aren't relevant to the new company, going back to the beginning of its commit history. You can do this with git. It wouldn't be fun. I'd have to spend a lot of time reading the filter-branch manpage, and people have written countless wrappers of varying quality that try and make it a bit more ergonomic.It took me like ten minutes to come up with:    declare -rA paths=(
        …
    )

    # for every commit that touched a file
    # we want to excise
    for id in ""$(
        jj log \
            --revisions '..' \
            --no-graph \
            --template 'change_id ++ ""\n""' \
            ""${paths[@]}""
    )""; do
        # restore those paths' contents from the
        # the empty root commit; this happens 
        # entirely in-memory without having to check
        # out each revision into the working copy to
        # do file operations so it is FAST
        jj restore \
            --from 'root()' \
            --to ""${id}"" \
            ""${paths[@]}""
    done

    # remove any commits that are now empty
    # (except for the implicit root commit)
    jj abandon \
        --revisions 'empty() ~ root()'

Three dumb, simple commands that I already use every day: list some commits, copy file contents from one commit into another, and remove some commits from the tree.Not only was this more or less obvious to do, but it was exceedingly fast to perform on a pretty highly-trafficked repo due to not having to thrash around in the working directory with checkouts.> Magit is a much better git frontend than Jujutsu.

reply

I almost always have more changes in my repository that those which I want to include in the next commit. With git, I just add the changes I want. With jj (and svn), there's not obvious way around it—you have to manually copy-paste changes outside of the repository before committing.

I tend to do a bunch of work then split into small, bite-sized revisions. Often I split something out to a parallel revision (e.g., a separate branch) if it's an independent thread of work like a bugfix elsewhere or a documentation fix. This is an obvious one-liner in jj but a bunch of annoying branch-switching and stashing in git.You can also use a `git add`-style workflow. Create a new revision with `jj new`. Do it again. Make your changes, then `jj squash -i/--interactive` to select the bits you want to include. Keep making changes and squashing into the previous commit you're building up until you're happy. Conceptually just think of @ (the current revision) and @- (the previous revision) as the working copy and the staged copy, respectively.

A decent mental model is that the top-most commit isn't generally going to get pushed up anywhere. It's like your working copy but also you get stashing ""for free"" (change back to main to make a new commit? All the WIP stuff stays on that branch instead of being carried over to main!)

reply

Where this gets extra sticky for me is tooling which refuses to distinguish repo wide config vs a local only version. VSCode being a huge offender where there is only a ‘launch.json' and no ‘launch.local.json' suitable for per host customization (eg maybe I am already running something on port 8888, so I need to map it to 9000, that does not mean a quirk of my environment should be committed).

The learning curve might be a bit difficult, but afterwards everything makes sense. And let's be honest, you just need a few actions (pull, add, reset, branch, commit) to use it in 95% of the cases.

Setting them up in git is not to bad. Adding a change to the bottom of the stack, and restacking everything on top… that's hell in git.

One cool tip to help with conflicts is the revert trick. If you have a conflict that you need resolved earlier in your commit chain, you can commit a cleanup that hides the conflict, revert it instantly and reorder the commits with interactive rebase to insert the revert first. It's a bit hard to explain without an example, once you've tried it you will understand.

reply

A vcs can allow you to commit conflicts and then commit their resolutions whenever necessary. This has been pioneered by darcs (IIRC) and jj also allows that.

A lot of people are religious about rebasing, ""clean"" commit history. But it's pretty much incompatible with several devs working on a single branch. I.e. when you work on something complex, perhaps under time pressure, git habits bite you in the ass. It's not fine.

reply

Years and years ago I worked on a team where linear commit history was required so every time a merge happened you had to manually rebase and push to Bitbucket. I put a PR in halfway through the sprint, rebased it a dozen times as everybody else's work got merged, and had nothing to show during review because nobody bothered to check mine and the only coworker I had in the same physical office was out on vacation.When I interview for new roles I always make a habit of asking how work gets done to avoid shops that engage in these types of shenanigans.

For larger features we often have a feature branch with merge requests for various task branches. Limits the review sizes as well.Of course, you can also then consider to use feature toggles, so there's no feature branch but just your main branch.

What I find isn't that common git operations are easier in jujutsu. They're not; sometimes they're slightly harder, due to the impedance mismatch with the git backend.Rather, what git makes easier are operations that are next to impossible — or at least highly inconvenient — in git, and which therefore next to no-one does. That makes it harder to explain, because you're telling them there's this great new workflow that does stuff that... they don't think they need (they have workarounds), and the notion of which triggers their ick reflex if they're good at programming.

If there are really common use-cases where git is annoying and jj is great, it shouldn't be that hard to explain, should it? If you can say ""remember how in the last few days you struggled with this? Jujutsu solves it"", then I'm happy to try.If your argument starts with ""imagine you are in a team that looks like X (but your team does not), with a project that looks like Y (but your project does not), and now imagine that you need to do this thing that you have never done before..."", then maybe I actually don't need jj?

It is more like ""you should use jj because then you won't have a lot of problem with git that you'd need git to solve""> it shouldn't be that hard to explain, should it?It is not. There are plenty of example on this page. For me the biggest one is stacked PR, jj makes it trivial since it tracks the change sets and not commit ids (which are immutable). So you can work on any level of the stacked PR independently, once you're done run ""jj git push -r '(trunk()..@ | @::)'"" and it will update all the remote branches accordingly. Another feature that works great with stacked PR is that you don't need to solve conflicts right away. You will see a marker in the ""jj log"" and you can solve it later down the road.Also another great feature is the operation log, you can just rewind your actions. F'd up a conflict resolution? Just go ""jj op undo"". That goes for everything, including file changes and rebases. Want to go back the state it was 15 min ago because you didn't like what you did? Merge to the wrong place? ""jj op undo""Adding to that there are hundreds paper cuts that jj fixes, like:* Simpler mental model for local change, no git stash/add necessary.* Simpler commit process, you can just work and use ""jj describe"" whenever where git forces you to write message before creating commit (again because commits are immutable).* Starting a work is much easier, I can just go ""jj new"" away without caring about detached head. Nowdays I just use branches (jj bookmarks) for git compatibility reasons.* Revsets are amazing, much more powerful and expressive than git logs, and since the UX is more consistent you can always work with set of rules that expects a revset with ""-r"".Ofc, you can do all of that with git, but it just works better, easier and more consistent with jj.

I don't have a lot of problems with git that I need to solve, that's the thing. And I don't get why people keep trying to convince me that I do. It's about me, my opinion should have some value, right? :-)> It is not. There are plenty of example on this page.The problem is that many examples, to me, sound like it's exactly like git but the author of the example doesn't know how to do it in git. For instance, you wrote a whole paragraph about ""undo"", as if git did not have that feature. Isn't that exactly `git reflog`? Turns out I had a need for it 2 times in the last 10 years, and it just worked.> Simpler mental model for local change, no git stash/add necessary.I can deal with git stash/add without feeling like I'm thinking hard.

You are in *forum* in a post *about jj* saying there is no reason to use jj. We are just interacting as you'd expect in forum. If you don't see any reason to use anything else and don't want to hear anything about it steer away from these posts.No one is trying to convince you personally, we are just discussing the tool. Go use git and be happy.I sincerely won't read anything else past that line.

I honestly am not. I am genuinely interested. Everytime there is a post about jj I'm about to try, and then I see a comment like yours, saying ""with jj you just use the intuitive syntax `jj git push -r '(trunk\(?.\).x#@ | @@.^)'`, which is a lot simpler than knowing about this weird concept of stash"" and it makes me think that maybe, I'll try again next time.

Actually, to be blunt (you're already offended anyway): what I'm saying is that I find (personal opinion) that many evangelists here (you included) don't sell jj really well. If so many people are actual fans of jj, there must be something there. I'm just struggling to find it between the ""you're probably too dumb to understand a stash so you should use jj"" and the ""let me explain to you this great concept that jj has which allows you to undo changes in a way that sounds like git cannot do exactly that"".So no, I'm not criticising jj :-). And I'm not convinced I need it.

I have been asking a few questions, and I have received many answers quickly.

But that was ten years ago. Now git is kind of hard-wired in my brain. By and large, it works well enough.It's not really clear to me that Jujutsu offers a significant enough of a benefit to spend the time re-wiring my brain, never mind dealing with the initial setup (e.g. the unreadable colours, setting up some scripts/aliases for things I like).

I don't run into any issues with Git during my day to day. Some things could be a bit more ergonomic but that's because I'm too stubborn to learn or set up some aliases or look up how to do it.Following this tutorial, I can't say jujutsu feels like an improvement. More complicated log output (I use a shorthand (think ""git log --oneline --graph"" but with a custom output format to also show absolute and relative commit time and author)), automatic staging (that can be turned off but why should I when it's already off if I don't use jj?) while I use ""git add -p"" through an alias, and the rest is just push / pull / checkout / reset.

You have to choose what you want to break. Once you start pulling on one thread lots of stuff start to unravel. It's really not a simple matter of ""choosing a better theme"".I've spent a long time looking at this, and my conclusion is that there is no safe default that will work for everyone, other than bold/reverse and 256/true colours and setting both the foreground and background.

    jj rebase -r @ -B abc

the recommended Git alternative is:    git rebase -i abcd1234
    # move the last line to the desired position

This is a process I use heavily, and one of the rare cases where I prefer the Git way: less cognitive load (I don't need to memorise options b/s/r/d/A/B for `jj rebase`) and the interactive editing of the history feels simpler (especially if I move several commits).I've used jj for a few weeks, but switched back to git. I'm fluent enough with Git so I never struggle any more. jj mostly felt nice, but the added value was not enough to replace years of expertise.

   jj rebase -b @ -d master@origin

to be an excellent improvement over anything git provides, including rerere. It's the first patch queue for git implementation that actually worked for me, which in turn makes github PR UI somewhat bearable.I occasionally use -r, too, but most of the time it's better to   jj squash --from ... --into @

My quick summary is that in one case he's try to avoid ""extra"" commits and in another case he's trying to re-order some commits. In my usual work flow, both of those problems would be handled by the git-rebase-squash I do after the feature works.

Is it just a git frontend for people who are confused by git?It says it abstracts the backend, but it's not clear how something so git-influenced will have abstractions that work with something like a centralized system like Perforce or Piper that has auto-increment numeric commits.Some of the design decisions are also not great. Working copy as commit means you have no quality control. The whole point of a commit is that... you commit it. So now you need a separate repo or filter to remove the worthless changes from the ones that you actually intend to commit. Bad commits polluting git histories is already a big problem.The biggest problems with git IMO are it scales poorly and it encourages commit pollution. Presumably jj isn't trying to tackle those problems, which is totally fine. But I am confused about which problems it is tackling. That's why I'm wondering whether it's just a frontend that the author finds more to their liking.

They're implemented with a mixture of Git commits and the Git working tree, yes (if you use the Git backend!), but when you see 'commit', you should read 'named diff'.Jujutsu also has a notion of immutable commits, by default meaning (roughly) commits which have been pushed upstream.You can and should rewrite the un-pushed commits to clean up history prior to pushing changes upstream. jj makes that much MUCH easier than rebases and history edits could ever be with git. Most of my nontrivial jj work involves at least three or four commits at some point, everything from experiments to documentation branches, which with git I would have needed to awkwardly fit into stash or inconvenient throwaway branches.

This makes sense to me as a longtime Mercurial user. In short, by default, when you push a commit, it becomes public and therefore immutable [1].Other awesome Mercurial features that appear in JJ are revsets [2], filesets [3] and templates [4].

> You can and should rewrite the un-pushed commits to clean up history prior to pushing changes upstream.My concern isn't just about pushing upstream. What I'm saying is that the typical change to a file shouldn't be committed to my local repo until I indicate that it's ready. The FAQ suggests this isn't possible and that you should work around it by using a separate branch and then merge into your target branch, which is a pretty ugly workflow.Their GitHub branches are a mess of auto-generated strings, which suggests to me that this problem isn't just an abstract concern but is a form of technical debt that the jj devs are currently piling up.

Yes, it's ""committed"", but that doesn't mean all that much. I have the fsmonitor feature enabled that continually watches my repos as I edit files in them. This means that over the course of a coding session, the revision I'm working on has probably pointed at dozens or more ephemeral underlying git commits. Those are only kept around for the purpose of the evolution log, which lets me look back at my edit history throughout the day even without having interacted with the repo.When you're ready to ""finalize"" your work, you have two common workflow options: you can `split` the out parts you want to keep as one consistent commit, which dumps the rest in a subsequent revision. Spiritually this is equivalent to `git add -p`. Alternatively, you can create an empty ""staging"" revision before your ""working copy"" revision and `jj squash -i` pieces you're happy with into there. In practice, many people use both. I generally do the former for new work, and the latter to make changes to earlier work.Thinking that `git add -p` was absolutely a deal-breaker is the main reason I passed over jj for so long. I care deeply about maintaining a clean commit history with small, isolated, and individually-tested changes. I thought jj would make that harder due to not having a staging area. I was wrong. It is actually far easier to be principled about your commit history with the tools that jj gives you.

Alternatively, you can create an empty ""staging"" revision before your ""working copy"" revision and `jj squash -i` pieces you're happy with into there. In practice, many people use both. I generally do the former for new work, and the latter to make changes to earlier work.Thinking that `git add -p` was absolutely a deal-breaker is the main reason I passed over jj for so long. I care deeply about maintaining a clean commit history with small, isolated, and individually-tested changes. I thought jj would make that harder due to not having a staging area. I was wrong. It is actually far easier to be principled about your commit history with the tools that jj gives you.

If you like it that way, that's cool with me.But to me personally I'd rather have the filesystem doing snapshots and not comingle fs snapshots with VCS. I can nuke an fs snapshot in a single line of bash if I accidentally leak something, and fs snapshots don't contribute to the slowness of a big repo. But those are problems in regular git and would be even bigger problems in a version of git that treated VCS as if it were an fs snapshot system.But like I said if that works for other people that's great. It would probably work for me if I were a consultant working on a lot of small repos. I don't think it scales to a bigger repo unless the jujutsu repos are completely destroyed every few days, which is essentially what happens to CITC client working copies at Google.

Leaking isn't really a concern; none of these ephemeral commits ever leave your local machine. I have used jj on a very large monorepo with > 10yr of commits, and I never noticed a performance issue.jj was literally created by Googlers at Google for the purpose of being used at Google. I have no idea how that's going, but it makes me suspect that it works better at that use-case than you're giving it credit for.

jj doesn't have the concept of a non-committed file.instead you don't track the HEAD as the tip of the branch (@ in jj), you track HEAD^ (jj: @-) or something earlier and since jj rebase isn't dumb as a rock you can relatively easily keep the working set of changes (as in, multiple commits/WIP branches; not necessarily the index or the working copy) on top of what you are pushing and squash or advance the branch (bookmark).I'm reiterating because it's a very important and super confusing for advanced git users: there is no uncommitted state in jj and yes, it does make sense, but you need to stop thinking in git.

How does that work in practice, is there a daemon running constantly and monitoring?  How does that interact with other users and changes from other computers?

reply

You can't change example.com/foo to point to example.com/baz and have it exist in source control. So to make the change you have to ignore every file that contains that string, test, then unignore. Or you have to make sure to absolutely remove every reference you've added to the merkle tree. Or you have to completely nuke your source control database after testing.If you buy a used laptop hard drive from a remote worker at $BIG_REGULATED_CO because you want to find exploits, you're probably happier if they run jujutso than git because there will be a higher probability of finding secrets, client info, and other things that are forbidden from going into source control.

I don't see a problem with secrets TBH. .gitignore is respected if that's what you have in mind. Otherwise store your secrets out of tree (you probably should with git too, anyway.)

It's more that there isn't really a big difference between the workflow of    # you're on
      staging area
    @ commit A
    # make some untracked changes and console logs you don't wanna commit
    git add -p && git commit # select only what you want

vs    # you're on
    @ empty commit 
    | commit A
    # make some local changes (which are tracked in @)
    jj commit -i # select only what you want

You're still ""in charge what gets tracked"" if you treat the last @ commit as your local playground, exactly the same as the staging area.
The only difference is that you can use exactly the same tools to manipulate your ""staging area"" as other commits.
The only difference being that you can manipulate your staging area with the same tools as any other commit.

You're thinking in very git-specific terms. JJ is just different in many ways so such comparison doesn't work well. I didn't get it from explanations before, but trying it in practice, it's a non-issue. It may be easier to just give it a go.

Since you brought this up, I've noticed some people seem to work this way but I've never found anyone to ask why they do this.I get the idea behind clean, readable git logs with nice consistent messages, but isn't that what rebase/amend is for?To me, the status of my local git log is mostly irrelevant, the thing that really matters is the commit(s) I submit for merging.Also, probably for related reasons, I've never truly understood why git has this whole separate staging concept...

I also use this to compare the changes to the commit messages.  Ideally the changes follow from the message, not the other way around.While a VCS is also useful for adding a time-axis to code, for me the main selling point is, that it's adding causality to the code.  You can ask 'Why is this code how it is?'.  (Of course causality is a side-effect of time.)  When you don't curate the commits you completely loose this feature.  (You can still ask, but the answers will be confusing and need way more work, which for me amounts to manually comparing commits to grasp the big picture and intention.)> rebase/amendWhen you messed up, you can of course change commits, but this has a danger of creating a version that was never there or mixing history, for example combining a single physical change, that are multiple logical changes.  In order to test that the code at least works I use ```git rebase --exec=""make -C build distcheck""```, not sure if that is common.I also don't use MS GitHub -style merges, I find them inferior.  (I also don't use MS GitHub, but that's for another reason.)  I think they try to make merges the actual unit of change, which is stupid, because that is what a commit is for.  To me merges are about semantic grouping of commits, i.e. maintaining a tree of commits representing the logical evolution of the code.Yes the staging area is exactly designed for this approach and I don't like people telling me I'm holding it wrong and don't need it.  To use a metaphor, I think the staging area is like my desk were I'm producing stuff (I'm not producing code, I'm producing changes).  Committing is about having produced a complete opus and then cleaning the desk.  Cleaning isn't seen as annoying, it is important for the mind to process completing/validating and then starting afresh.  Stashing is in this metaphor about switching to an alternate desk.  This is different from putting the opus aside and having also a clean desk.  (I think that is what Jujutsu wants you to do?)  Having the staging-area/stash different from commits is a feature, the fact that the stash is the same storage-wise is an implementation detail.

Thank you for going into details, you helped me understand a few more details.Let me describe how I think about it and why it might possibly conflict with your ideas.I think the best way to describe it is as a series of approvals, each one being more important than the previous one.The absolute lowest level of approval, writing the file to disk. You've made some changes and you're happy enough with them to at least save them in case you have a power outage or something.The next level of approval is committing to your local git repo. This is code you're fairly confident you want later, even if it might not be perfect yet.The next level is pushing your branch to the origin repo. Now you're saying that this is code you're willing to let other people look at.The last level is merging this code into main/trunk/whatever. This is the final level of approval, this code passes all of our checks, it shouldn't need any more improvement.Given this system, adding another level in there, for staging commits, feels pretty unnecessary.I agree that merge commits tend to make for ugly git history, but I don't think that's particularly inherent to any of these systems of code integration, it's more a function of how much the developers care about the git log.> change commits, but this has a danger of creating a version that was never there or mixing history,I'm not sure what the benefit here is. I think I've basically ended up in a situation where I treat 'git commit' the same way I treated ""save file"" 20 years ago. My local commits/saves/edits aren't important, what's meaningful is the final unit of change I'm sending to the remote, and that unit needs to be deliberately constructed somehow. Whether that involves rebasing or amending or careful usage of git stage, it's an artificial unit you're creating just as much as the actual code changes.

That would be a ‘change' in jj. A commit in jj is more like SQL than git; it's the end of a transaction, not a value judgement.

reply

Commits start live without a description, and can't be pushed without adding one. jj commit names the current commit and creates a new empty, unnamed commit on top, which effectively is precisely git's behaviour.I implore you to try it. In practice the distinction just doesn't matter, except it's one less concept to keep track of, and jj allows you to make up other workflows if you want.

I think functionally of the stage is about the UI, so keeping it separate is kind of the point.  I find that useful, as I can use both approaches, not sure how its better if jj can just use one?> to ask why they do this.This was what I was trying to explain.  To me the feature is needing to manually mark every line to be committed.  If I need to split the commit I'm already not paying that much attention.

I was extremely hostile to this aspect of jj too, but I've settled on a workflow where @ (i.e. the change/commit referring to the working copy) is always the same, named "".WIP: …"", and as such is clearly never supposed to break out of the local system, and can never accidentally get pushed down the log. (..my jj workflow is just blatantly copying my git workflow (with the same-name shell aliases/helpers even), but even with said git emulation I'd say it's nicer than git itself)Still may be weird/undesired to have the local repo preserve the changes (especially annoying if it happens to find an unignored build artifact, though there is a size limit for automatic tracking by default), but it's also rather neat that you can dig out your old deleted printf debugging or whatnot later on if you wanted to.

You might be able to configure JJ to also block commits with certain descriptions as well, which might be useful in your case.

Some push blocker for certain commit name patterns would make sense to look into.

jj is a version control system. It is backend-agnostic. The most common backend is a git one, because git is so popular. This allows you to use jj on a git repository, allowing for individuals to adopt it without forcing their teammates to.> Is it just a git frontend for people who are confused by git?I used git since before github existed. I considered myself a git lover before I found jj. I will not be going back to git.The thing is, jj is both simpler and more powerful than git, at the same time. People who are confused by git may like its simplicity, but I like its power.> It says it abstracts the backend, but it's not clear how something so git-influenced will have abstractions that work with something like a centralized system like Perforce or Piper that has auto-increment numeric commits.You already got some replies on this one, so I'll leave that to them :)> Some of the design decisions are also not great. Working copy as commit means you have no quality control. The whole point of a commit is that... you commit it.

Bad commits polluting git histories is already a big problem.This is an understandable misunderstanding. The right way to think of it is ""the index is also a commit."" A common way of working with jj is to do something like this:Imagine I am working on adding some feature x to my codebase.

There's nothing like `git reset` needing to have `--hard` vs `--soft` vs `--mixed` to deal with index behavior: everything is in a commit, so everything acts consistently.jj makes it very trivial to carve up commits into exactly what you want.

Well, because the index is just a commit, I can use any tools that I use on commits on the index. There's nothing like `git reset` needing to have `--hard` vs `--soft` vs `--mixed` to deal with index behavior: everything is in a commit, so everything acts consistently.jj makes it very trivial to carve up commits into exactly what you want. It is far easier and more powerful than using the index for the same purpose.> The biggest problems with git IMO are it scales poorly and it encourages commit pollution. Presumably jj isn't trying to tackle those problems, which is totally fine. But I am confused about which problems it is tackling. That's why I'm wondering whether it's just a frontend that the author finds more to their liking.IMHO, commit pollution is more due to the pull request workflow than git itself, though I do think that git doesn't do that much to help you. jj can help with this kind of thing, but also on some level, it can only do so much.

Imagine I am working on adding some feature x to my codebase. I'll first make a change, and give it a description:   jj new -m ""working on feature x"" trunk
  Working copy  (@) now at: lqqlysul c6756b49 (empty) working on feature x
  Parent commit (@-)      : ylnywzlx 8098b38d trunk | (empty) foo

Now I will make a new empty change on top of that:   jj new
  Working copy  (@) now at: pxrvoron c823d73a (empty) (no description set)
  Parent commit (@-)      : lqqlysul c6756b49 (empty) working on feature x

Now, @- is the change that I intend to push publicly, but @ is my index. Say I add foo.rs:   touch foo.rs

Now, when I run `jj status`, jj takes a snapshot, and it now lives in @:   jj st
  Working copy changes:
  A foo.rs
  Working copy  (@) : pxrvoron ba7ad8c6 (no description set)
  Parent commit (@-): lqqlysul c6756b49 (empty) working on feature x

We can see the diff here with `jj diff`:   jj diff
  Added regular file foo.rs:

So, let's say I'm happy with its contents. I want to stage it into my final commit. I can do this with `jj squash`, which by default takes all the diff of @ and puts it into @-:   jj squash

Rebases also don't play nicely with stacked branches. Branches based off your original changes don't get rewritten to be on top of the rebased change, so now multiple rebases are in your future.It turns out that basically none of the rebase friction most people experience is necessary in practice. Rebases can be automatic, implicit, and conflicts can be fixed at your leisure and in whatever order that you feel is best.jj also has a ton of other powers, but you asked about rebase :)

That wasn't what I meant, git --fixup is for changing earlier commits, you answered as if it didn't that's what I wanted to point out.

The thing I'm running into right now is that I should really learn the revset language, so that I don't have to constantly copy paste ids from jj log

reply

Been using jj without significant issues for about a month and been super happy to be comfortable using the cli and slowly ramping up to more complicated operations.The documentation still assumes a lot of inherent knowledge which sometimes makes it a little difficult. I love seeing blog posts like these and hopefully some more in depth resources will appear over time. Steve's guide is good, but there are still gaps for me :).Next I want to learn some more revset language and become a bit more fluent with rebase operations. I love the more simplified cli, conflict resolution and op log!

jj looks cool in general, I'd start with it if I were just going into this _version control_ thing but for most of us older folks, that doesn't provide enough motivation to change.

I still use Lazygit for the improved diffing, but, as long as you don't mind being in detached HEAD all the time, there's really no issue with doing that. JJ interoperates fine with git, but why would I use the arcane git commands when JJ will do the same thing much more straightforwardly?Also, the ability to jump from branch to branch with all my uncommitted files traveling with me is a godsend. Now I can breeze between feature development, bug fixing, copy changing, etc just by editing the commit I want. If I want multiple AI agents working on that stuff, I just make a worktree and get on with it.Not to mention that I am really liking the fact that I can describe changes (basically add commit messages) before I'm done with them, so I can see them in the tree.JJ is just all around great.

There is also lazyjj as an interactive UI.

Note for other readers: jj also has a literal `jj absorb` command. That one does what you'd expect from mercurial, i.e. moves diffs from the current commit into the most recent ancestral commit where that file was changed.

You name them with bookmarks which are sort of like branch names except they don't follow along automatically as you make new revisions. You can point an existing bookmark at a later revision when you're ready to push new changes.

And, you're right, it's powers largely come from the underlying jj - it mostly just runs jj commands behind the scenes, parses the output, and displays it. But it's all so beautiful, seamless etc..I can't wait to really dig into the big additions released yesterday in v0.9.0 - themes, vim-like leader key shortcuts, other shortcuts etc...

1. The mental model is too complex: rebase or merge, detaching head, etc. A good UI can hide away some of this uglyness. It sounds like jj helps here.2. Any source control in a terminal is just horrible, since you have no view of the state you're working with. I honestly never fully understood why developers have such religious elitism for the command line. Where would you draw the line on something having a complex enough state to need a UI?The change to git that I'm hoping for is a GUI on top of a simpler wrapper like Jujutsu.

But the graphite CLI's stacked PR review is a killer app. Our team uses it, but treats the rebase-centric workflow as the price of stacked review, instead of a mental model to leverage. I end up using jj but with a helper script to set up graphite's branch tracking whenever I want to submit a stacked PR.I also was always a git CLI person. I'd do diffs and resolve conflicts in a proper editor, I wasn't crazy—but I know that changing just my mental model is less work than it'd be to change the UI habits as well.

Sometimes I feel like ""this shit is too bad to commit but it does the plumbing for the thing I'm working on right now"" and it ends up untracked for weeks... This is just my personal ADHD pool of code but it gets really gnarly before I take care to dissect my unstaged changes into the repo.

git-branchless is just a better set of tools for working on a git repo so local tools like the JetBrains git integration will work just fine.It operates on a similar philosophy to Jujutsu (make it easy to manipulate the commit tree) and the authors did exchange ideas with each other.

I have found it incredibly helpful when using an agent. It's a great case for the ""staging-area"" style workflow. I `jj new` an empty revision where the LLM can go hog-wild. When I'm generally happy with the LLM's work, I make a new revision. Then I ask it to make some improvements. Sometimes I have to discard those. No problem, I just `jj abandon` the whole thing. Sometimes I like a few pieces; I `jj squash -i` those into the parent revision with the bulk of the work and abandon the rest. And then I repeat until I'm happy with the overall output.It's also super useful when I need to go fix something in an earlier (but still unmerged) revision. `jj new {id}` creates a new revision whose parent is the older change, even if it already has children. Again, I let the agent loose. When I'm happy, I `jj squash -i` what I want and the fixes are not only incorporated back into the parent but then propagated automatically down through the rest of its children through automatic rebasing.

Rebasing can be done instantly (reorder commits, fixups, squash), I can extract and reverse custom patches from previous commits, I can partially stage files, undo.One think I like is that it explains what it does in terms of git commands. So it helps a little to have a good git mental model, and as such I guess it doesn't solve the same thing as jj.

One example is a series of dependent PRs. This is excruciating in git if you ever need to make a fix to an earlier PR because you have to manually rebase every subsequent change. It's trivial in jj: you either fix the revision directly or you insert a new revision inbetween. The subsequent revisions are updated automatically. You don't even have to think.Another is splitting work into parallel branches. So often when I'm working on one area I end up making unrelated tweaks and improvements as I go. Pulling these out into their own branches is painful in git, so people just make omnibus branches that include a handful of unrelated work alongside the main task. In jj it's basically zero work to split out the unrelated stuff onto a new branch off main, and it doesn't require you to task-switch to a new branch. So I end up making lots of one-line PRs that are trivial to review whenever I'm doing deeper work.

Spreading the word about `git rebase --update-refs` that will automatically update any branches that point to commits along the path (very useful with stacked branches). It is less convenient than what jujutsu offers (you need to know the branches to update, where jujutsu automatically updates any dependency), but still a very useful if you don't want to or can't switch to another tool.

What do you mean by this? You can do an interactive rebase in git as well. The real issue is non-trivial merge conflicts which is going to be an issue no matter you use.

Arbitrarily-complicated rebases just happen automatically with jujutsu. Inserting, moving around, and directly editing commits are first-class operations, and descendants automatically rewrite themselves in-place to incorporate changes made to their parents. Rebase conflicts are also first-class citizens so they don't block you and force you to deal with them right now or in any particular order. Having to rebase seven related conflicts one-after-another is no longer a thing, nor is realizing you fucked something up halfway through and having to restart.Coming from git it honestly feels like magic even if it strictly isn't. It genuinely hard to understand how much unnecessary toil git makes you put up with on a day to day basis until you suddenly don't need to deal with it any more.

It's not an ideal way to operate for most shops, but there's really no reason you can't have a PR/MR/changelist/whatever that is a single branch with X commits on it and you ask the reviewer to review each commit individually instead of as a whole unit (as GitHub and other forges usually expect you to).That and don't let reviews pile up such that you have 5 dependent in-flight reviews, something else is wrong if that's happening.

What is the advantage to this, other than maybe being easier to send over email?To me, the important part is you have a logical ""unit of change"" that you're proposing to the codebase, whether that's a single commit or a branch or a jj bookmark or whatever seems more an artifact of the underlying transport layer (email or github or whatever) than any kind of intended functionality of the design.

Think about the word ""branch"". If you have a linear sequence of commits that's one branch by definition. But you go and label the middle of that branch as branches too and then get annoyed when git, you know, does some branching there.

You absolutely can, to some degree. At any point in an interactive rebase you can just make your changes and do a normal `git commit` then do `git rebase --continue` along on your merry way. Unless you're talking about suspending the rebase and like switching branches, messing around, and then resuming the rebase, which is kind of a weird thing to do.

reply

It's a weird thing to do in git, because the conditions that git creates makes it weird. It is completely natural with jj, because jj doesn't have any modal states at all. (This is one of the key reasons jj is both simpler and more powerful than git — no modal states.)

reply

    git checkout master
    git rebase [whatever]

    git tag rebasing
    git checkout --detach master

    git checkout rebasing
    [continue rebasing]

When you are not trying to modify the same branch you're rebasing, you can omit --detach and also git tag todo.(To clarify, it has never occurred to me that I even want to do that, so I didn't knew how to do it. Yet I didn't even needed to consider a manual, it just follows naturally from the git user model even if it seams completely unidiomatic.)

How do you make sure, that a commit isn't changed under you, because someone thought, it would be a good idea to change an earlier revision?  I think having immutable commits including all the previous history is a feature, not a bug.

reply

All changes can be modified, but if you try and update a change marked as ""immutable"", then Jujutsu will error out unless you provide a specific flag. This generally provides a lot of protection against unexpected rebases from other people.You also have a local immutable history of every update to your copy of the repo. This includes fetches/pulls, so you can easily see and undo those changes if something does go wrong along the way. But if people are deliberately force-pushing to master, you're going to end up in weird states whatever to you use.

Is that only enforced on the committer side? I mean git also doesn't force push by default, but that still means someone else can do that and I need to notice it.

reply

Just like git, it is only enforced by the tool itself on the client side. But it's safer in practice because `git push -f` is a common habit when you're working on a branch by yourself and it's easy to fat-finger that in the wrong place. I have only ever had to use `jj --ignore-immutable` when explicitly doing repo surgery.If you want branches like `main` to be truly immutable, you need to enforce that at the repo.

jj has two kinds of these logs: the evolog and the op log.The git reflog is based on, well, refs. Whenever a ref is updated, you get an entry. This log is per ref. That's HEAD, your branches, your tags, and your stash.jj's evolog is sorta similar, but also different: it's a log, but per change (think commit in git). This means it is broader than per ref, as it includes not just commits that correspond to a ref, but all of them.jj's oplog is a log per repository. This lets you do things like `jj undo`, which lets you get the entire repository, not just one ref or commit, back to the previous state, easily.

But instead of commits, most of the time you're working with (the not greatly-named) ""changes"", which are a conceptual history of related commits. E.g., a single change ID points to the most recent commit in a list.As long as you keep editing on a change, it keeps accumulating commits under the hood. When you move to another change (via `jj commit`, `jj new`, etc), all your new commits end up under a different change.

What happens when you merge or split changes with the change history?  It sounds a bit like applying a VCS on top of a VCS.

reply

Merging is making a change that has more than one parent. You can then resolve any conflicts within that change.Splitting a change into two will update one commit with one half and make a new change with the other half.

I'm not sure what happens, but I suspect a merge would create a single merge commit with the tips of the parents' histories, and then add new commits from there on.A split is probably conceptually similar to making two new branches, except each of the new commits gets one of the branch tips. Really just guessing here, I have no idea if that's how it works, or if they share commits or not.

Is there a good explanation of Jujutsu without referring to git? May be with some pictures? Am I the only one bad with memorizing SHAs when reading? Also, does it work with other people? Would it work in repo with 5 contributors? 20? 500?EDIT: I am looking for tutorials with explanation on how JJ works, preferably without referring to Git, and even more preferably with some visual explanations, which, there are plenty for Git. It seems I am not very good in reading text trees. It is my issue, not yours, but may be you know something which would help.

Here's how our senior editor, Will Douglas Heaven, is thinking about the AI landscape in 2025. 

Last month I gave a talk at SXSW London called “Five things you need to know about AI”—my personal picks for the five most important ideas in AI right now. 

I aimed the talk at a general audience, and it serves as a quick tour of how I'm thinking about AI in 2025. I'm sharing it here in case you're interested. I think the talk has something for everyone. There's some fun stuff in there. I even make jokes!

The video is now available (thank you, SXSW London). Below is a quick look at my top five. Let me know if you would have picked different ones!

Maybe you think that's obvious. But I am constantly having to check my assumptions about how fast this technology is progressing—and it's my job to keep up. A few months ago, my colleague—and your regular Algorithm writer—James O'Donnell shared 10 music tracks with the MIT Technology Review editorial team and challenged us to pick which ones had been produced using generative AI and which had been made by people. Pretty much everybody did worse than chance.What's happening with music is happening across media, from code to robotics to protein synthesis to video. Just look at what people are doing with new video-generation tools like Google DeepMind's Veo 3. And this technology is being put into everything.My point here? Whether you think AI is the best thing to happen to us or the worst, do not underestimate it. It's good, and it's getting better.

Let's not forget the fails. When AI makes up stuff, we call it hallucination. Think of customer service bots offering nonexistent refunds, lawyers submitting briefs filled with nonexistent cases, or RFK Jr.'s government department publishing a report that cites nonexistent academic papers. You'll hear a lot of talk that makes hallucination sound like it's a problem we need to fix. The more accurate way to think about hallucination is that this is exactly what generative AI does—what it's meant to do—all the time. Generative models are trained to make things up.What's remarkable is not that they make up nonsense, but that the nonsense they make up so often matches reality. Why does this matter? First, we need to be aware of what this technology can and can't do. But also: Don't hold out for a future version that doesn't hallucinate.

Everyone thinks they know, but no one can agree. And that's a problem.

You've probably heard that AI is power hungry. But a lot of that reputation comes from the amount of electricity it takes to train these giant models, though giant models only get trained every so often.What's changed is that these models are now being used by hundreds of millions of people every day. And while using a model takes far less energy than training one, the energy costs ramp up massively with those kinds of user numbers. ChatGPT, for example, has 400 million weekly users. That makes it the fifth-most-visited website in the world, just after Instagram and ahead of X. Other chatbots are catching up. So it's no surprise that tech companies are racing to build new data centers in the desert and revamp power grids.The truth is we've been in the dark about exactly how much energy it takes to fuel this boom because none of the major companies building this technology have shared much information about it. That's starting to change, however. Several of my colleagues spent months working with researchers to crunch the numbers for some open source versions of this tech. (Do check out what they found.)

Sure, we know how to build them. We know how to make them work really well—see no. 1 on this list.But how they do what they do is still an unsolved mystery. It's like these things have arrived from outer space and scientists are poking and prodding them from the outside to figure out what they really are.It's incredible to think that never before has a mass-market technology used by billions of people been so little understood.Why does that matter? Well, until we understand them better we won't know exactly what they can and can't do. We won't know how to control their behavior. We won't fully understand hallucinations.

Not long ago, talk of AGI was fringe, and mainstream researchers were embarrassed to bring it up. But as AI has got better and far more lucrative, serious people are happy to insist they're about to create it. Whatever it is.AGI—or artificial general intelligence—has come to mean something like: AI that can match the performance of humans on a wide range of cognitive tasks.But what does that mean? How do we measure performance? Which humans? How wide a range of tasks? And performance on cognitive tasks is just another way of saying intelligence—so the definition is circular anyway.Essentially, when people refer to AGI they now tend to just mean AI, but better than what we have today.There's this absolute faith in the progress of AI. It's gotten better in the past, so it will continue to get better. But there is zero evidence that this will actually play out. So where does that leave us? We are building machines that are getting very good at mimicking some of the things people do, but the technology still has serious flaws. And we're only just figuring out how it actually works.

Here's how I think about AI: We have built machines with humanlike behavior, but we haven't shrugged off the habit of imagining a humanlike mind behind them. This leads to exaggerated assumptions about what AI can do and plays into the wider culture wars between techno-optimists and techno-skeptics.It's right to be amazed by this technology. It's also right to be skeptical of many of the things said about it. It's still very early days, and it's all up for grabs.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","This startup wants to use beams of energy to drill geothermal wells","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/07/22/1120545/geothermal-drilling-quaise/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Quaise is taking its technology from the lab to field trials for the first time this year.

A beam of energy hit the slab of rock, which quickly began to glow. Pieces cracked off, sparks ricocheted, and dust whirled around under a blast of air. 

From inside a modified trailer, I peeked through the window as a millimeter-wave drilling rig attached to an unassuming box truck melted a hole into a piece of basalt in less than two minutes. After the test was over, I stepped out of the trailer into the Houston heat. I could see a ring of black, glassy material stamped into the slab fragments, evidence of where the rock had melted.  

This rock-melting drilling technology from the geothermal startup Quaise is certainly unconventional. The company hopes it's the key to unlocking geothermal energy and making it feasible anywhere.

Geothermal power tends to work best in those parts of the world that have the right geology and heat close to the surface. Iceland and the western US, for example, are hot spots for this always-available renewable energy source because they have all the necessary ingredients. But by digging deep enough, companies could theoretically tap into the Earth's heat from anywhere on the globe.

That's a difficult task, though. In some places, accessing temperatures high enough to efficiently generate electricity would require drilling miles and miles beneath the surface. Often, that would mean going through very hard rock, like granite.

Quaise's proposed solution is a new mode of drilling that eschews the traditional technique of scraping into rock with a hard drill bit. Instead, the company plans to use a gyrotron, a device that emits high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. Today, the fusion power industry uses gyrotrons to heat plasma to 100 million °C, but Quaise plans to use them to blast, melt, and vaporize rock. This could, in theory, make drilling faster and more economical, allowing for geothermal energy to be accessed anywhere.  

Since Quaise's founding in 2018, the company has demonstrated that its systems work in the controlled conditions of the laboratory, and it has started trials in a semi-controlled environment, including the backyard of its Houston headquarters. Now these efforts are leaving the lab, and the team is taking gyrotron drilling technology to a quarry to test it in real-world conditions. 

Some experts caution that reinventing drilling won't be as simple, or as fast, as Quaise's leadership hopes. The startup is also attempting to raise a large funding round this year, at a time when economic uncertainty is slowing investment and the US climate technology industry is in a difficult spot politically because of policies like tariffs and a slowdown in government support. Quaise's big idea aims to accelerate an old source of renewable energy. This make-or-break moment might determine how far that idea can go. 

Rough calculations from the geothermal industry suggest that enough energy is stored inside the Earth to meet our energy demands for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, says Matthew Houde, cofounder and chief of staff at Quaise. After that, other sources like fusion should be available, “assuming we continue going on that long, so to speak,” he quips. 

“We want to be able to scale this style of geothermal beyond the locations where we're able to readily access those temperatures today with conventional drilling,” Houde says. The key, he adds, is simply going deep enough: “If we can scale those depths to 10 to 20 kilometers, then we can enable super-hot geothermal to be worldwide accessible.”

Though that's technically possible, there are few examples of humans drilling close to this depth. One research project that began in 1970 in the former Soviet Union reached just over 12 kilometers, but it took nearly 20 years and was incredibly expensive. 

Quaise hopes to speed up drilling and cut its cost, Houde says. The company's goal is to drill through rock at a rate of between three and five meters per hour of steady operation.

One key factor slowing down many operations that drill through hard rocks like granite is nonproductive time. For example, equipment frequently needs to be brought all the way back up to the surface for repairs or to replace drill bits.

Quaise's key to potentially changing that is its gyrotron. The device emits millimeter waves, beams of energy with wavelengths that fall between microwaves and infrared waves. It's a bit like a laser, but the beam is not visible to the human eye. 

Quaise's goal is to heat up the target rock, effectively drilling it away. The gyrotron beams waves at a target rock via a waveguide, a hollow metal tube that directs the energy to the right spot. (One of the company's main technological challenges is to avoid accidentally making plasma, an ionized, superheated state of matter, as it can waste energy and damage key equipment like the waveguide.)

Here's how it works in practice: When Quaise's rig is drilling a hole, the tip of the waveguide is positioned a foot or so away from the rock it's targeting. The gyrotron lets out a burst of millimeter waves for about a minute. They travel down the waveguide and hit the target rock, which heats up and then cracks, melts, or even vaporizes.

Then the beam stops, and the drill bit at the end of the waveguide is lowered to the surface of the rock, rotating and scraping off broken shards and melted bits of rock as it descends. A steady blast of air carries the debris up to the surface, and the process repeats. The energy in the millimeter waves does the hard work, and the scraping and compressed air help remove the fractured or melted material away.

This system is what I saw in action at the company's Houston headquarters. The drilling rig in the yard is a small setup, something like what a construction company might use to drill micro piles for a foundation or what researchers would use to take geological samples. In total, the gyrotron has a power of 100 kilowatts. A cooling system helps the superconducting magnet in the gyrotron reach the necessary temperature (about -200 °C), and a filtration system catches the debris that sloughs off samples. 

Soon after my visit, this backyard setup was packed up and shipped to central Texas to be used for further field testing in a rock quarry. The company announced in July that it had used that rig to drill a 100-meter-deep hole at that field test site. 

Quaise isn't the first to develop nonmechanical drilling, says Roland Horne, head of the geothermal program at Stanford University. “Burning holes in rocks is impressive. However, that's not the whole of what's involved in drilling,” he says. The operation will need to be able to survive the high temperatures and pressures at the bottom of wells as they're drilled, he says.

So far, the company has found success drilling holes into columns of rock inside metal casings, as well as the quarry in its field trials. But there's a long road between drilling into predictable material in a relatively predictable environment and creating a miles-deep geothermal well. 

In April, Quaise fully integrated its second 100-kilowatt gyrotron onto an oil and gas rig owned by the company's investor and technology partner Nabors. This rig is the sort that would typically be used for training or engineering development, and it's set up along with a row of other rigs at the Nabors headquarters, just across town from the Quaise lab. At 182 feet high, the top is visible above the office building from the parking lot.

When I visited in April, the company was still completing initial tests, using special thermal paper and firing short blasts to test the setup. In May the company tested this integrated rig, drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 30 feet deep. Another test in June reached a depth of 40 feet. These holes were drilled into columns of basalt that had been lowered into the ground as a test material.

While the company tests its 100-kilowatt systems at the rig and the quarry, the next step is an even larger system, which features a gyrotron that's 10 times more powerful. This one-megawatt system will drill larger holes, over eight inches across, and represents the commercial-scale version of the company's technology. Drilling tests are set to begin with this larger drill in 2026. 

The one-megawatt system actually needs a little over three megawatts of power overall, including the energy needed to run support equipment like cooling systems and the compressor that blows air into the hole, carrying the rock dust back up to the surface. That power demand is similar to what an oil and gas rig requires today. 

Quaise is in the process of setting up a pilot plant in Oregon, basically on the side of a volcano, says Trenton Cladouhos, the company's vice president of geothermal resource development. This project will use conventional drilling, and its main purpose is to show that Quaise can build and run a geothermal plant, Cladouhos says. 

The company is building an exploration well this year and plans to begin drilling production wells (those that can eventually be used to generate electricity) in 2026. That pilot project will reach about 20 megawatts of power with the first few wells, operating on rock that's around 350 °C. The company plans to have it operational as early as 2028.

Quaise's strategy with the Oregon project is to show that it can use super-hot rocks to produce geothermal power efficiently, says CEO Carlos Araque. After it fires up the plant and begins producing electricity, the company can go back in and deepen the holes with millimeter-wave drilling in the future, he adds.

Araque says the company already has some customers lined up for the energy it'll produce, though he declined to name them, saying only that one was a big tech company, and there's a utility involved as well.

But the startup will need more capital to finish this project and complete its testing with the larger, one-megawatt gyrotron. And uncertainty is floating around in climate tech, given the Trump administration's tariffs and rollback of financial support for climate tech (though geothermal has been relatively unscathed). 

Quaise still has some technical barriers to overcome before it begins building commercial power plants. 

One potential hurdle: drilling in different directions. Right now, millimeter-wave drilling can go in a straight line, straight down. Developing a geothermal plant like the one at the Oregon site will likely require what's called directional drilling, the ability to drill in directions other than vertical.

And the company will likely face challenges as it transitions from lab testing to field trials. One key challenge for geothermal technology companies attempting to operate at this depth will be  keeping wells functional for a long time to keep a power plant operating, says Jefferson Tester, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in geothermal energy.

Quaise's technology is very aspirational, Tester says, and it can be difficult for new ideas in geothermal to compete economically. “It's eventually all about cost,” he says. And companies with ambitious ideas run the risk that their investors will run out of patience before they can develop their technology enough to make it onto the grid.

“There's a lot more to learn—I mean, we're reinventing drilling,” says Steve Jeske, a project manager at Quaise. “It seems like it shouldn't work, but it does.” 

The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Meanwhile, company emissions are up 50% since 2019.

Tens of millions of dollars in NSF grants have been slashed, and scientists fear the US is about to lose a generation of climate researchers.

Can the vast and sparsely populated African country translate its renewable power potential into national development?

The software uses generative AI to analyze and carry out real-time analyses for grid operators.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","We Might Have Been Wrong About Where Spiders Came From","https://gizmodo.com/we-might-have-been-wrong-about-where-spiders-came-from-2000632561","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 15:00:11 GMT","

Technically speaking, every living thing on Earth can trace its origins to the sea. Some of these earliest creatures crawled onto land, evolving to become many different kinds of animals and insects—including, scientists believed for a long time, spiders and their relatives. 

A new study published today in Current Biology challenges the popular conception that spiders first emerged on land, instead suggesting that these arachnids and their relatives originated and evolved in the ocean. The team reached this conclusion by investigating the fossilized central nervous system of Mollisonia symmetrica, a long-extinct animal from the Cambrian era (between 540 and 485 million years ago), thought to be the ancestor of horseshoe crabs. Mollisonia's brain structure closely resembled that of modern spiders and their relatives, not their supposed crab descendants. 

“The discovery of an arachnid brain in such an ancient creature as Mollisonia suggests that the major groups of arthropods alive today were already established then,” Nick Strausfeld, study lead author and neuroscientist at the University of Arizona, told Gizmodo in an email. He added that this “casts a fresh view on the question: Where did arachnids first evolve?”

Until now, scientists had assumed—based on the external features of arachnid-like fossils found in sedimentary rocks formed on land—that modern spiders and their relatives evolved on land. For the study, however, Strausfeld and his colleagues looked inside a well-preserved fossil of Mollisonia, which they did using an optical microscope and other imaging techniques to investigate its cerebral arrangements in higher detail. 

The team uncovered several similarities between modern spiders and Mollisonia, but the most striking feature was that of the creatures' central nervous system. Unlike insects, arachnid brains have a strange backward structure, in which the “forebrain lies on top of circuits that control the movement of the legs,” Strausfeld explained. It's this that makes spiders and their relatives so “incredibly versatile in their movements.” As the new research shows, “the backward organization is enough of a ‘tell' to demonstrate [that] Mollisonia‘s brain arrangement typifies those of living arachnids,” he said.

Other common features the team found included external resemblances, such as jointed limbs or pincer-like claws. They bolstered their hypotheses by running a statistical analysis comparing 115 anatomical traits across both living and extinct arthropods (which includes arachnids), which placed Mollisonia as a “sister” to modern arachnids, the authors reported in the study.

“This is very interesting, but we do not yet know how it relates to the vast array of arachnids other than spiders,” said Paul Selden, a paleontologist and arachnologist at the University of Kansas who wasn't involved in the new work, in an email to Gizmodo. “Clearly, their conclusions on the phylogenetic [study of evolutionary history using visual cues] placement of Mollisonia are fascinating but merely mark the start of further investigation.”

It's probably premature to declare spiders as spawns of the sea, but the good news is that Strausfeld and his colleagues already seem to be on the case. 

“Most Cambrian fossils look very different from modern species, so it is really exciting when such outward appearances reveal something inside them—a fossilized brain and nervous system—that tells a different story,” Strausfeld said. “Arachnids are a crucial feature of our biosphere, and we should pay attention to what they contribute to our well-being.”

If you're on the fence about whether to snatch up a $450 Nintendo Switch 2, or if you're still hemming and hawing about that upcoming Xbox handheld made by Asus, there's one more device that looks set to make your wallet scream bloody murder. We haven't seen hide nor hair of Lenovo's Legion Go 2 for about six months now, but leaks suggest it could be the sequel handheld you were actually looking for, thanks to a major screen upgrade that neither Nintendo nor Xbox is offering for its current-gen handhelds.

The story goes back to several posts on Reddit, where some users claimed there were a slew of leaked Legion Go 2 models available through China-centric prototype and aftermarket reseller Xianyu. While Gizmodo could not confirm there were Legion Go 2 units changing hands, Videocardz claims to have seen models up for sale on these Chinese sites. Either way, some users have already pushed out videos allegedly showing the ins and outs of Lenovo's upcoming sequel handheld. One, posted by YouTuber in yo, shows off a prototype with its 8.8-inch OLED display.

It's still running regular old Windows, just like the original Legion Go S released earlier this year. Lenovo later unleashed its same handheld with SteamOS, which offered a major boost in performance. The prototype shown in that video is reminiscent of early prototypes we saw last year. Despite this being an early model, the 1200p OLED display at 144Hz and VRR—AKA variable refresh rate—is still the real star of the show. We don't mind the Switch 2's 7.9-inch display despite ghosting issues that leave some games—especially fast-paced sidescrollers—looking blurry. Nor did we have many complaints about the Asus ROG Ally X's smaller screen, save for its relatively low brightness. Let's face it, OLED still wins every day. The Steam Deck OLED has a 720p display, and yet we still prefer it to most handhelds we've used that are still beholden to IPS LCD.

Lenovo is likely waiting for Microsoft to release its version of Windows built specifically for handhelds. It essentially uses the Xbox app as the front-end user interface for accessing all your games on Xbox as well as third-party launchers like Steam and Epic Games Store. Like SteamOS, it will also dual-boot with a regular version of Windows for users to access all their regular apps. Microsoft hasn't offered a release date for that Windows version, but it could arrive later this year and would have backward support for all previous Windows-based handhelds.

I first went hands-on with the Legion Go 2 at CES back in January. The device was still just a prototype, but AMD had the machine running with its upcoming Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, which is supposed to be the next big thing for handheld performance. I didn't have any time to test its overall performance or to get a feel for its improved ergonomics with its detachable controllers. The videos of leaked Legion Go 2 models show off how you can still detach each side of the device to go controllers akimbo. The right-side control stick can still act as a mouse cursor for playing FPS or RTS games, though we'd have to test whether it's as smooth and accurate as Nintendo's Switch 2 mouse controls proved to be.

The YouTuber did include an internal specs sheet for the device. This version of the Legion Go 2 apparently didn't house a Z2 Extreme chipset but a regular Z2. The higher-end AMD APU—or accelerated processing unit with graphics capabilities—isn't using AMD's latest chip microarchitecture, Zen 5. It's still a Zen 4 chip, which will likely be closest in performance to the previous gen's Ryzen Z1 Extreme. This indicates there will likely be a lower-cost version of the Legion Go 2 to accompany a pricier model. This version also included 32GB of LPPDR5 7,500MHz RAM, which would put it in the higher echelons of gaming handhelds where memory is concerned.

Lenovo hasn't given any indication on how much the Legion Go 2 would cost. Let's put any dewy-eyed hope to rest—it's not going to be cheap. The ROG Xbox Ally was already tipped to cost a pretty penny. If the Xbox Ally X with Z2 Extreme demands $1,000 or more, it almost guarantees the Legion Go 2 will be nearly as pricey with its larger and better-looking display. Look what happened to the MSI Claw 8 AI+, which went from $900 to $1,000, likely due to Trump tariffs. Getting the best display on the most powerful handheld will inevitably demand more from your wallet.

Ah, yes, the American dream. A house with a white picket fence, a dog, and as many products as you can pile into a pickup truck that you paid for in cash, which I'm told is a type of green paper you can exchange for goods and services. Sounds nice; sounds normal; sounds totally and completely out of reach.

The classic American dream may be dead, but at least we have the Internet of Things and the never-ending font of smart home products it's given rise to, right? I say that with my tongue ready to burst through my cheek like a post-gestation alien from Alien, but to be honest, I love my makeshift smart home. It makes me and my multitask-addled brain happy, because who has time for light switches and buttons? Certainly not I—I barely have time for paying my rent. Sorry, landlord, I simply don't have enough bandwidth today!

If you're like me, which is to say a debt-drowning millennial who will probably never own walls and a roof outright, and you still want to have a smart home that feels functional, I'm (at the very least) pleased to inform you that this particular feat is actually doable. In fact, I know it's doable because I've done it, and as one disillusioned American adult to another, I'm going to tell you how to build your own, too.

The first thing you'll need before you start smartening up your rented dwelling is a way to scream at all your gadgets. That means, if you don't already have one, you'll need a smart speaker. I personally use a 2nd-gen Google Nest Mini, and for a couple of reasons. I'm not going to lie, the number one reason is that I got one for free through Spotify, which ran a promotion back in 2019 for subscribers to its premium plan. The promotion has since ended, but the good news is that if you want to grab one yourself, you can scoop one up for as little as $30. Here's the deal with these speakers: they suck for playing music because they're frankly not built for that, but they do exactly what they need to in a smart home, which is to say, they understand commands poorly (all voice assistants suck, sorry).

One advantage that I think Google has over an Amazon Echo speaker with Alexa, for example, is its Google Home app, which feels a lot more streamlined for quick smart home control compared to Amazon's Alexa app. I also think that Google Assistant is slightly better at understanding commands, but to be honest, that's like trying to decide which apple you'd rather pull from the compost and take a bite of.

Either way, you'll need to make a choice here, because if you should want to expand the number of speakers in your apartment ever, you're not going to want to buy another speaker to replace the one you already have or, God forbid, live in a mixed Alexa and Google Assistant household. And once you make that choice, it's time to move on to the next most important facet of any smart apartment.

I have absolutely no chill when it comes to lighting. I mean that both figuratively, in that I am authoritarian about the type of lights I use in my apartment, and also in a more literal sense, in that I hate cool lighting—warm only for me. As a result of that quirk, I have a lot of lamps in my 500-square-foot apartment. I have five, to be exact, but two of those contain three bulbs, and one of them contains two, so that's a grand total of 10 light bulbs in one small apartment, just from lamps.

As you might imagine, the smart lighting situation gets tricky pretty fast, but there are a few things you can do to make things less expensive and a little more manageable from a setup perspective. First, you can start by buying cheaper smart bulbs for the lamps that need them. Smart bulbs aren't necessary all of the time (I'll get into that in a moment), but they do offer some advantages, particularly the ability to dim or brighten them as needed. This is huge if you're as specific as me about lighting in your apartment. Brightness is also a feature that you do not have to shell out for the Philips Hue premium to attain.

My apartment is stocked almost entirely with Wyze smart home lighting, and though they haven't always been the most consistent bulbs (they require quite a few firmware updates throughout the year), but they are mostly solid for doing anything you'd want smart bulbs to do. They change color, they connect to Google Home, and they come in packs of four for $44. If you don't want Wyze bulbs, Govee also makes affordable smart bulbs that will do the trick.

The key here isn't just to have smart lighting, but also to label and assign all of your lamps correctly inside your chosen smart home app. In my case, that's the Google Home app, where you can connect all your devices and pair them with your smart speaker. To add a new device in the Google Home app all you need to do is navigate to the “Device” tab at the bottom of the app and then tap “Add” in the bottom-right corner. The app will ask what kind of device you want to add, where you want to add it, and then it should automatically look for devices on the same Wi-Fi network and prompt you to set it up (make sure your device is in the proper setup mode before you do that).

Loading those bulbs in isn't enough, though. You should also label everything appropriately, so when you want to yell at your speaker to turn something off, you're not just shouting “Light 4.” Consider “bedroom lamp,” or if you have more than one lamp in your bedroom, “nightstand lamp,” and “corner lamp.” Once you have everything labeled appropriately, you should also create groups so that you can turn swaths of lights on and off. I have my lights divided into “bedroom” and “living room,” so when I say, “turn the living room lights on,” my Google speaker knows what I mean.

To create a speaker group:

Once you have your lights and other devices in the Google Home app and have everything labeled, it's time to start thinking about expanding your apartment.

There's a secret to smart homes, and it's not always about buying smart products, per se. You can actually make dumb stuff smart with one very cheap gadget: smart outlets. Smart outlets, as the name suggests, are just plugs that you can connect to the internet and turn on/off at will. They obviously won't give a feature set beyond just on or off, but sometimes that's all you need. I've used smart outlets extensively in my makeshift smart apartment for all kinds of stuff.

If you have a nice lamp, for example, that doesn't take the type of bulb that comes in a smart variety (like a candelabra bulb), but you don't want to screw around turning it off and on manually all the time, try a smart outlet. These are especially great if you're gauche like me and still like to use cheap string lights around Christmas time and don't want to plug them in and take them out constantly. It's a game-changer if you celebrate Christmas with a tree, too, since being able to turn your tree on and off with a voice command is incredibly simple.

It's not just lights, though. You can also apply the same strategy to appliances. Before I got a window AC unit from July (more on that in a bit), I had a regular old dumb AC unit that needed to be turned off and on manually. It's not the biggest labor in the world having to press a button, but being able to use a voice command without getting your lazy, overheated ass up off the couch feels like a big perk when you actually have the ability.

Think of smart outlets as your way of filling in the gaps. The best part is you can get them cheaply on Amazon. This set from Amazon gives you four plugs for just $25. I own several similar smart plugs from a nondescript brand that I assume is based in China, and they work surprisingly well. Just make sure whichever product you pick is compatible with the platform you've chosen—in my case, Google. You may also have to download a separate app for setup purposes when you buy brands like this, so just keep that in mind. With anything you connect to the internet, there is inherently a security risk, so please keep that in mind also. If you're extra cautious about digital privacy and security, smart home life may not be the life for you, since every app, gadget, and online service you plug your information into opens up another avenue to having your data stolen. That's the tradeoff you have to make to be a lazy human in 2025.

There are obviously a lot of gadgets out there in the smart home world that are great for people with houses—thermostats, fridges, ovens, security cameras, and more. But if you live in an apartment like me you may not be able to take advantage of those. Or most of those, I should say. There are some appliances that you should consider, though, like a Wi-Fi-enabled AC unit. I own one from July, a millennial-friendly window unit that doesn't look like total shit, and being able to connect the AC to the Google Home app has been a game-changer.

One perk of having your AC unit connected to the internet is that you can turn if off or on remotely. When it's ridiculously hot out, I like to get my AC pumping before I get home from work so that it's actually cool in my apartment before I arrive. It's also great if you're away on vacation and you have a pet at home that you're worried about. Just pull open the July app and toggle your unit on. You can even select settings in the app like fan speed, temperature, and modes. Naturally, since it's Google-compatible, you can also activate the AC using your smart speaker, which is great in the morning when I want to lazily turn off my AC from bed.

Another worthy category of your smart home experience is entertainment. Most TVs nowadays are smart home-ready, so be sure to check if your particular panel can connect to the platform you've chosen. Using voice commands to turn your TV on or off or change the volume isn't necessary, but it can be handy in a pinch, like when your cat accidentally lies on the remote while you're trying to sleep and you don't feel like getting out of bed to turn it back off (a true story).

I also own a Chromecast streaming stick that I have plugged into a small TV in my bedroom. Since it's a Google product, it's naturally very compatible with the Google Home app and my Google smart speaker, so when I'm ready to go to bed, I can shout at the Google Assistant to “stop casting” instead of whipping out my phone and disconnecting the stream from whatever app I'm using. You can also control volume with voice commands, but that feels maybe a little more annoying than using your phone as a remote.

As a bonus gadget, you can also consider installing smart blinds from companies like Ikea, which are compatible with both Google Assistant and Alexa. These need some minor installation unlike the other things I've recommended, but they're only mildly invasive, which is to say you probably won't have your security deposit withheld for tossing them up. My parents have their entire house set up with smart blinds, and I've been pretty impressed with how convenient it is to use voice controls to raise and lower them.

So those are my tips for giving yourself a smart home without breaking the bank or buying a $3,500 fridge. These gadgets obviously aren't going to give your apartment the highest IQ out there in the world of smart homes, but it's not going to flunk out of summer school, either. As a recap, here are the most important things you can do:

Late last year, the Pokémon Company revealed a surprise animation collab: it would work with the legendary British studio Aardman—the team behind Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit, Shaun the Sheep, and more—to create a new Pokémon series. Now, we've had a delightful first look, and it is going to be a suitably British-feeling adventure into the world of Pocket Monsters.

During today's Pokémon Presents livestream, Aardman revealed that its series would be called Pokémon Tales: The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu. The brief animated teaser showed the titular heroes, the Galarian-region evolution of Farfetch'd, and the baby Pokémon pre-evolution of Pikachu, engaging in unseen shenanigans as a delightfully oblivious Wooloo relaxed in a field. It's perhaps only fitting that the minds behind Shaun the Sheep focused their trailer on a sheep Pokémon!

Little else was revealed about the series, other than the fact that it will seemingly take place in the Galar region—the UK-inspired land introduced in Pokémon Sword & Shield—and will focus on the perspective of Pokémon rather than human beings. That's all, of course, very fitting for Aardman, given their love of eccentric Britishisms and physical comedy with silent characters like Feathers McGraw, Gromit, and Shaun.

We'll be waiting a while to see more—Aardman says that The Misadventures of Sirfetch'd and Pichu will release some time in 2027.

It happens almost every day. A screenshot of a social media post from a prominent figure like Elon Musk or Donald Trump goes viral because it demonstrates just how stupid these men really are. But sometimes it sounds too good to be true. You go to check X or Truth Social yourself and it's not there. But maybe it was deleted. What do you do? Well, we've got some tips that might be helpful for uncovering the truth.

Right off the bat, it's important to note that there's not always a foolproof way to figure out if a “deleted” tweet was real, especially if it's not from a famous person. But there are things you can do to get closer to the truth. And with a little bit of detective work, you can often figure out if that deleted tweet ever existed.

The first step in any tweet fact-check involves looking for the original post yourself on the platform where it appears to have originated, whether it was X, Facebook, or Truth Social. The easiest way to do that is to take a snippet of the text you found in a screenshot and search using quotation marks. You don't need to use the entire tweet; just a portion will be fine.

Let's take an example of an old tweet from Musk. Below is a tweet that I screenshotted on Nov. 23, 2023, but Musk later deleted. If you saw this screenshot floating around and wanted to verify if it was real, you could go to X and search the phrase “What say you major brands?”

That search yields a few results that look like bots just repeating what Musk said:

And if you scroll down through those tweets, there's even a link to the original tweet from Musk. Clicking on that brings you to a notice that reads “Hmm…this page doesn't exist. Try searching for something else.”

It seems we have confirmed that the tweet was real since we found the original URL, quoting the text we saw in a screenshot, and it's coming up with an error message. But what happens if you don't see any solid leads like that in the social media app where the post appeared to originate?

Check out a resource like news.google.com and search your snippet of text there. A quick search for “What say you major brands?” doesn't come up with any hits, but that's not unexpected. The content of this Musk tweet doesn't appear to be particularly notable. The Tesla CEO often tweets hundreds of times each day, so it's unlikely that news outlets are going to write a story about everything. But that brings us to other clues about whether something should be in the news.

One good example recently was a post that appeared to be coming from Donald Trump that read “STOP TALKING ABOUT EPSTEIN” with five exclamation points. If you went over to Truth Social and searched when that post was going viral, you wouldn't have found it. And since it was coming from the president, you would've expected there to have been lots of news articles quoting it.

The thing that complicated matters was the fact that it wasn't long before Trump posted something identical in spirit and somehow even more unhinged. But if you searched for that exact phrase in Google News, you still wouldn't see the fake tweet that read “STOP TALKING ABOUT EPSTEIN.”

Maybe the tweet was deleted quickly, and there wasn't enough time for news outlets to pick it up. But there are other clues that might suggest something is fake. Does the tweet have a high number of views, but you don't see bots on X or major news outlets writing about it? A banal tweet isn't going to get picked up by CNN. But a tweet where a prominent figure declares something outrageous probably will. And if the screenshot you're looking at has millions of views, it should probably be showing up in reliable places.

There are many places online where people post fake tweets, including subreddits that revel in photoshops. If you're trying to investigate a fake tweet, a good place to start looking might be any message boards specifically started to be skeptical of that person. Elon Musk has plenty, for example.

There are also comedians who like to make fake tweets, with one in particular that we'll check in on whenever a tweet that looks too good to be true goes viral. That person is @marionumber4 on X and has the handle 679 Enthusiast. The person behind that account loves making fake tweets and frequently will photoshop “this post has been deleted” on the bottom for maximum confusion.

Again, if you're going to spread a photoshopped tweet, people often don't know what to do if they see that visual signifier because it tells them in advance there's nothing to find if they go looking for it.

Which brings us to a recent fake tweet from “679 Enthusiast” that was fact-checked using Grok…

The account 679 Enthusiast recently made a photoshopped post about Musk that read “Just like I took your wife,” that appeared to quote-tweet Stephen Miller. It's a joke about the rumors that there was some kind of romantic relationship between Musk and Miller's wife, rumors that have not been confirmed by any reliable sources. But naturally, someone wanted to ask Grok if the screenshot was real. Incredibly, Grok said it “likely existed and was deleted.”

To be clear, the tweet never existed. But AI doesn't know that because AI doesn't actually know things. It's a fancy Speak & Spell. But Grok suggested it must be real because “while a fabricated screenshot is possible, the evidence leans toward the post being real but removed, consistent with Musk's pattern of deleting controversial posts.”

Again, it's not real. But Musk saw this and replied, clearly frustrated, insisting, “I never posted this.” Funny enough, 679 Enthusiast eventually deleted their photoshop of the Musk tweet about Miller's wife.

Check the Wayback Machine. There are places online that archive content, like the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine, but there are so many caveats to that suggestion. The Wayback Machine is not quick to archive anything, so if you're looking for a recent tweet, it's probably not going to be there. But if it's an old tweet that you think was deleted, and you have the patience to find the dates in question through significant clicking around, you could luck out.

If you search for a tweet and see that it pops up, make sure you click through and verify it's coming from the official account. Tweets that looked like they were coming from Robert F. Kennedy were incredibly popular earlier this year but fooled a lot of people because they were actually from a parody account. Musk got rid of the old Twitter “verification” model after he bought the social media platform in late 2022, and now anyone with $8 to spend can buy a blue checkmark.

One way that so-called “parody” accounts trick people into believing they're real is to create long screen names that push the disclaimers out of view when you're reading the name on mobile. For example, one popular RFK Jr. account is called “Robert F. Kennedy Jr. | Commentary only.” And if you even know that “commentary” is supposed to be a disclaimer, you might not even see it. Only when you click through to the account's bio does it read “No Affiliation,” though it still doesn't use precise language about where the “affiliation” is lacking.

So, yes, you might find a tweet that seemed too stupid to be real in your search on platforms like X. But be extra careful when you look at the account that shared it.

There is no surefire way to always figure out whether a “deleted” tweet is real. But hopefully our tips can help you narrow down your search. And given just how stupid our current timeline is, people are tweeting things that are simply beyond parody.

Targets AI and hyperscalers.

Kioxia has introduced a solid-state drive with an unprecedented storage capacity of 245.76TB, currently the highest-capacity storage device available. The company positions its LC9 drive for applications that benefit from maximum storage density, such as AI training and hyperscale workloads. Remarkably, the company has managed to cram 8TB of storage capacity into a single NAND package —a record that enables the construction of such a hefty SSD using multiple ultra-high-capacity packages. To give some perspective on the sheer amount of storage, assuming a heavily compressed 20GB size for a 4K movie, the Kioxia drive could store an astounding 12,500 movies per device.

The Kioxia LC9 is based on an unknown proprietary NVMe 2.0-compliant controller with a PCIe 5.0 x4 interface (with dual-port capability) as well as Kioxia's BiCS8 2Tb 3D QLC NAND memory devices. To enable a 245.76TB capacity in an E3.L form-factor, Kioxia had to package 32 memory devices into a single chip (8TB of storage space) and then attach those chips to the controller. This packaging sets a new record for density and uses the company's proprietary methods for wafer processing and assembly, according to Kioxia.



Performance-wise, the drive delivers sequential read speeds of up to 12 GB/s and write speeds of up to 3 GB/s. This isn't the highest performance for an enterprise PCIe 5.0 SSD, but there's an obvious tradeoff between capacity and performance. At the end of the day, ensuring signal integrity in a 32-Hi 3D NAND package is a big deal, so it is not surprising that it is achieved by sacrificing interface speed.

For random operations, the SSD achieves up to 1.3 million IOPS for reads and 50,000 IOPS for writes, which is again not particularly impressive, but the LC9 is clearly designed for capacity rather than performance.

As for endurance, the Kioxia L9 drives are rated at 0.3 drive writes per day (DWPD), which again reflects a balance between capacity and longevity for data center usage patterns.



The product incorporates multiple features to improve reliability and protect data, including die-level recovery, parity-based error management, and safeguards against sudden power loss. It also includes support for Flexible Data Placement, which reduces internal write amplification and extends the usable lifespan, especially in database-driven applications.

Security options include encryption and firmware signing compliant with CNSA 2.0 standards. The drive supports multiple encryption modes, including AES-256 encryption and algorithms prepared for post-quantum cryptography.

Kioxia plans to offer its L9 drives in multiple form factors, including a 2.5-inch U.2 (up to 122.88TB), E3.S (up to 122.88TB), and E.3L (up to 245.76TB). The company did not disclose pricing of these drives as they will be sold primarily to large hyperscale data center companies, and exact quotes will depend on volumes and other factors.

The LC9 series is currently being sampled to select partners and will be featured at the Future of Memory and Storage conference in August 2025.

Among the concerns raised about the Stargate project, which involves partnerships with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, were scarce details about infrastructure support. Little by little, the companies disclosed their intentions and, on Tuesday, OpenAI and Oracle announced plans to build an additional 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of Stargate data center infrastructure in the U.S., pushing OpenAI's total planned capacity beyond 5 GW. Interestingly, SoftBank is not involved in financing this buildout, despite being part of the Stargate project.

Under the terms of the plan announced in January, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank plan to build 20 data centers each measuring 500,000 square feet (46,450 square meters). However, it was unclear how they intended to power the data centers, as it does not look like the U.S. infrastructure has enough spare capacity to power the additional AI servers, cooling systems, and networking equipment used in AI data centers unless some sort of additional infrastructure is built. 

The announced 4.5 GW of infrastructure indeed refers primarily to electrical power availability, which is among the limiting factors for AI development these days. OpenAI claims that the expanded infrastructure of 5 GW will enable its data centers to power over two million AI processors, though it does not disclose whether the infrastructure is meant to support 1.4 kW Blackwell Ultra processors or 3.6 kW Rubin Ultra processors. If a 5 GW infrastructure were to power only AI GPUs, then it could feed 3.571 million Blackwell Ultra or 1.388 million Rubin Ultra GPUs. However, AI accelerators typically consume only half of the entire data center's power, without taking into account power usage effectiveness (PUE), so the actual number of supported GPUs would be lower. 

The new 4.5 GW-capable facilities may be built in states such as Texas, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, though exact locations are still being finalized. This is in addition to an existing site under construction in Abilene, Texas, which OpenAI considers a proof-of-concept facility to ensure its ability to deploy infrastructure at scale and speed. OpenAI believes that lessons learned from Abilene will help with the execution of subsequent sites. 

Parts of the Abilene facility — Stargate I — are now active as Oracle began installing server racks based on Nvidia's GB200 platform last month. OpenAI has begun utilizing this infrastructure to conduct early-stage AI training and inference tasks as part of its next-generation research initiatives.

More reasons for the alleged delay have emerged

MediaTek and Nvidia have reportedly pushed back the launch of their much-anticipated N1X AI PC platform to the first quarter of 2026, according to a new DigiTimes report citing supply chain sources. The latest reasons given contrast with an earlier report, which still informed us of the delay, but attributed it to critical hardware defects requiring a silicon respin. While chip revisions at Nvidia are still part of this latest story, the new information points toward a broader set of factors, including Microsoft's slower-than-expected OS roadmap and weakening demand across the notebook market.

The N1X platform, originally believed to be scheduled for Q3 2025 with both consumer and commercial models, never materialized at Computex earlier this year, fueling speculation about its readiness. DigiTimes now reports that MediaTek and Nvidia are prioritizing enterprise-class systems for the initial rollout, banking on stronger commercial adoption before expanding into the volatile consumer segment.

The N1X processor has previously been tipped to deliver 180–200 TOPS of AI compute performance and would mark MediaTek's most ambitious entry into the PC space, backed by Nvidia's AI expertise. Major OEMs and ODMs, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, MSI, and Compal, are reportedly preparing notebook and desktop designs for the platform. This is another area where Intel underestimated the competition way back, and now Nvidia appears to be gunning for this territory, rivaling not only Intel and AMD but also Qualcomm.

Moreover, DigiTimes' report also offers a glimpse into Nvidia and MediaTek's expanding collaboration. Beyond PCs, the two companies are said to be advancing joint efforts in automotive AI via MediaTek's Dimensity Auto platform, as well as edge AI development with Nvidia's TAO toolkit and MediaTek's NeuroPilot SDK. Digitimes says the companies have also co-developed the DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer and are key partners in Nvidia's NVLink Fusion ecosystem for custom AI silicon.

Interestingly, DigiTimes mentions MediaTek's involvement in Google's v7e AI project, now reportedly delayed to mass production in October 2026. This long-term partnership could bring significant revenue—estimated at $4 billion—and signals that MediaTek is building a stronger presence in the AI silicon market, both at the edge and in data centers. For those unaware, v7e is a next-generation TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) Google is co-developing with MediaTek, designed for large-scale AI workloads in Google's data centers.

Anyhow, the new reported Q1 2026 timeline for N1X could suggest that Nvidia and MediaTek are refining both hardware and strategy. While SemiAccurate's earlier claims of hardware defects may still hold some truth, the new report paints a picture of a more calculated delay, aligning with Microsoft's OS updates, fixing remaining chip-level issues, and waiting for commercial demand to stabilize. In the meantime, Nvidia's GB10-based AI workstations, which are still on track for release, may serve as the company's first real-world testbed for consumer-facing AI PC hardware before N1X arrives.

An offline image generator for XDNA 2 NPUs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD, in collaboration with Stability AI, has unveiled the industry's first Stable Diffusion 3.0 Medium AI model tailored for the company's XDNA 2 NPUs which process data in the BF16 format. The model is designed to run locally on laptops based on AMD's Ryzen AI laptops and is available now via Amuse 3.1.

The model is a text-to-image generator based on Stable Diffusion 3.0 Medium, which is optimized for BF16 precision and designed to run locally on machines with XDNA 2 NPUs. The model is suitable for generating customizable stock-quality visuals, which can be branded or tailored for design and marketing applications. The model interprets written prompts and produces 1024×1024 images, then uses a built-in NPU pipeline to upscale them to 2048×2048 resolution, resulting in 4MP outputs, which AMD claims are suitable for print and professional use.

The model requires a PC equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series or Ryzen AI MAX+ processor, an XDNA 2 NPU capable of at least 50 TOPS, and a minimum of 24GB of system RAM, as the model alone uses 9GB during generation.

The key advantage of the model is, of course, that it runs entirely on-device; the model enables fast, offline image generation without needing Internet access or cloud services. The model is aimed at content creators and designers who need customizable images and supports advanced prompting features for fine control over image composition. AMD even provides examples. A prompt to draw a toucan looks as follows:

""Close up, award-winning wildlife photography, vibrant and exotic face of a toucan against a black background, focusing on the colorful beak, vibrant color, best shot, 8k, photography, high res.""

To use the model, users must install the latest AMD Adrenalin Edition drivers and the Amuse 3.1 Beta software from Tensorstack. Once installed, users should open Amuse, switch to EZ Mode, move the slider to HQ, and enable the 'XDNA 2 Stable Diffusion Offload' option.

Usage of the model is subject to the Stability AI Community License. The model is free for individuals and small businesses with less than $1 million in annual revenue, though licensing terms may change eventually. Keep in mind that Amuse is still in beta, so its stability or performance may vary.

People with hypothyroidism show significantly higher levels of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and key bacterial distinctions than those without the thyroid condition, according to results of a study. 

“[The research] supports the idea that improving gut health could have far-reaching effects beyond digestion, possibly even helping to prevent autoimmune diseases, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis,” said senior author Ruchi Mathur, MD, director of the Diabetes Outpatient Treatment and Education Center and director of Clinical Operations of Medically Associated Science and Technology, at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, in a press statement for the study, which was presented at ENDO 2025: The Endocrine Society Annual Meeting. 

“These findings open the door to new screening and prevention strategies,” Mathur added. “For example, doctors may begin to monitor thyroid health more closely in patients with SIBO, and vice versa.” 

With some small studies previously suggesting an association between the gut microbiome and hypothyroidism, Mathur and colleagues further explored the relationship in two analyses.

For the first, they evaluated data on 49 patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) and 323 controls without the condition from their REIMAGINE trial, which included small bowel fluid samples from upper endoscopies and DNA sequencing.

In the study, all patients with HT were treated with thyroid replacement (levothyroxine), hence, there were notably no significant differences between the two groups in terms of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.

Despite the lack of those differences, patients with HT had a prevalence of SIBO more than twice that of the control group, independent of gender (33% vs 15%; odds ratio, 2.71; P = .005).

When the two groups were further subdivided into two groups each — those with and without SIBO — significant further variations of microbial diversity were observed between those with and without HT, Mathur told Medscape Medical News.

“Interestingly, we saw the small bowel microbiome was not only different in SIBO-positive patients, including higher gram negatives, which is to be expected, but that the presence or absence of hypothyroidism itself was associated with specific patterns of these gram-negative bacteria,” she explained.

“In addition, when we looked at hypothyroidism without SIBO present, there were also changes between groups, such as higher Neisseria in the hypothyroid group.” 

“All these findings are novel as this is the first paper to look specifically at the small bowel,” she added, noting that previous smaller studies have focused more on evaluation of stool samples.

“We believe the small bowel is the most metabolically active area of the intestine and plays an important role in metabolism,” Mathur noted. “Thus, the microbial changes here are likely more physiologically significant than the patterns seen in stool.”

In a separate analysis, the team evaluated data from the TriNetX database on the 10-year incidence of developing SIBO among 1.1 million subjects with hypothyroidism in the US compared with 1 million controls.

They found that people with hypothyroidism were approximately twice as likely to develop SIBO compared with those without hypothyroidism (relative risk [RR], 2.20).

Furthermore, those with HT, in particular, had an even higher risk, at 2.4 times the controls (RR, 2.40).

Treatment with levothyroxine decreased the risk of developing SIBO in hypothyroidism (RR, 0.33) and HT (RR, 0.78) vs those who did not receive treatment.

However, the fact that differences in SIBO were observed even between people who were treated for HT and those without the condition in the first analysis, and hence had similar TSH levels, was notable, Mathur.

“This suggests that perhaps there are other factors aside from TSH levels and free T4 that are at play here,” she said.

“Some people have theorized that perhaps delayed gut motility in hypothyroidism promotes the development of SIBO; however, there are many other factors within this complex interplay between the microbiome and the thyroid that could also be playing a role.” 

“For example, SIBO leads to inflammation and weakening of the gut barrier,” Mathur explained.

Furthermore, “levothyroxine absorption and cycling of the thyroid hormone occurs predominantly in the small bowel, [while the] microbiome plays a key role in the absorption of iron, selenium, iodine, and zinc, which are critical for thyroid function.” 

Overall, “further research is needed to understand how the mechanisms are affected during the development of SIBO and hypothyroidism,” Mathur said.

Commenting on the research, Gregory A. Brent, MD, senior executive academic vice-chair of the Department of Medicine and professor of medicine and physiology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles said the study is indeed novel.

“This, to my knowledge, is the first investigation to link characteristics of the small bowel microbiome with hypothyroidism,” Brent told Medscape Medical News.

While any clinical significance has yet to be determined, “the association of these small bowel microbiome changes with hypothyroidism may have implications for contributing to the onset of autoimmune hypothyroidism in susceptible populations as well as influences on levothyroxine absorption in hypothyroid patients on levothyroxine therapy,” Brent said.

With the SIBO differences observed even among treated patients with vs without HT, “it seems less likely that the microbiome changes are the result of reduced thyroid hormone signaling,” Brent noted.

Furthermore, a key piece of the puzzle will be to observe the microbiome changes over time, he added.

“These studies were at a single time point [and] longitudinal studies will be especially important to see how the association changes over time and are influenced by the treatment of hypothyroidism and of SIBO,” Brent said.

The authors and Brent had no disclosures to report.

Among women with premature ovarian insufficiency, 29.9% experienced depressive symptoms, with younger age at diagnosis, severe menopausal symptoms, and lack of emotional support being key risk factors. Oestradiol levels and the use of hormone therapy were not significantly associated with the risk for depression, underscoring the role of psychosocial factors.

""Our findings underline the need for comprehensive assessment and management of menopausal symptoms, including psychosocial and sexual well-being, in women with POI [premature ovarian insufficiency]. Addressing the psychological impact of POI, including the loss of fertility, is probably crucial in preventing or mitigating depressive symptoms,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Charissa van Zwol-Janssens, MD, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It was published online on July 15, 2025, in Menopause.

The observational design of the study prevented causal inferences between the identified risk factors and depression. The evaluation of symptoms at only one timepoint precluded examining trends over time or identifying at ‐ risk individuals. Moreover, enrolling participants from a single centre may have affected the generalisability of the results.

This study did not receive any funding. Some authors reported receiving research grants and fees for consultancy or presentations from various organisations, including pharmaceutical and healthcare companies.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Canada's Indigenous population continues to face major disparities in heart and stroke care. These disparities result from a combination of neglect, inaccessible resources, and lack of cultural sensitivity when it comes to community values and healthcare practices.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among Canada's Indigenous population, which includes First Nations, Métis, and Inuit patients. According to a 2022 study in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates for cardiovascular disease are higher among Indigenous peoples than among non-Indigenous Canadians. First Nations patients have approximately 2.5 times the cardiovascular disease prevalence compared with that of non-First Nations patients.

Complicating the situation, access to and inequality in cardiovascular care for Indigenous Canadians remain poorly studied and understood, the study noted. Isolation in remote communities, lack of access to emergency services, negative past experiences with the medical system, and resulting mistrust are factors contributing to this long-standing and growing healthcare crisis.

“The disparities in care for Indigenous Canadians are due to a mix of historical, systemic, and social factors,” Christine Faubert, vice president of Health Equity and Mission Impact at Heart & Stroke in Toronto, told Medscape Medical News. “The legacy of settler colonialism has left deep scars, creating conditions that lead to significant health disparities. This includes trauma and socioeconomic disadvantages from policies like residential schools and forced relocations.”

Many patients delay medical care because they've had such negative experiences in the past, and this decision often results in advanced disease by the time they seek care, Heather Foulds, researcher and professor of kinesiology at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, told Medscape Medical News. “Also, when patients undergo stroke or cardiac rehabilitation, healthcare practitioners place great emphasis on the individual patient. However, Indigenous communities are much more family-oriented, and the patient might have grandchildren for whom they're caring and can't simply leave behind,” Foulds noted. She is a former Heart & Stroke and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Indigenous Early Career Women's Heart and Brain Health Chair.

“Some patients have 3-day delays following a stroke because there are no healthcare providers. Most rehabilitation centers are in major cities, and patients have no way of getting to them.” Conflicting life priorities also play a role. “A patient might say to themselves, ‘What's the most important challenge I'm facing today? Maintaining my blood sugar levels might not be the most important thing right now when I'm trying to find a place for my kids to live.'”

In addition, Western and Indigenous views of medicine differ significantly. For Indigenous Canadians, living within a healthcare paradigm so different from their own can be challenging. Some Indigenous community members are carving out their own academic paths as a way of focusing on their people's distinct needs.

Originally from the Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba, Margaret Hart is a doctoral student in the University of Manitoba's Faculty of Education, Winnipeg. Hart has been seeking to rebuild the occupational therapy program to incorporate Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing. “Across Canada, First Nations and other Indigenous communities are drawing on generations of knowledge, relational teachings, and community-based values to promote health and well-being,” said Hart. “Due to the historical and ongoing impacts of colonization, many First Nations people face elevated cardiovascular risk and reduced access to timely, appropriate stroke care. We know stroke is a leading cause of death and disability and that women are at higher risk and often experience different pathways of recovery.” Hart's mother, Phylis, of the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, died of a hemorrhagic stroke in September 2024 with no care or prevention.

Heart & Stroke is tackling the challenges of health reconciliation and striving to provide better access to equitable healthcare in culturally safe environments for Indigenous populations. One of their initiatives is StrokeGoRed, which was developed for women in the north who have no access to basic care. It's the first formal research network in Canada dedicated to studying stroke in women. Together with Hart, they're working to understand how stroke affects women and men differently and to develop personalized treatments to improve outcomes for women.

In partnership with community members in Whitecap Dakota First Nation, Stacey Lovo, PhD, a researcher with the School of Rehabilitation Science in the University of Saskatchewan's College of Medicine, has developed a virtual reality hub to provide remote treatment for northern Saskatchewan communities that can't easily access healthcare. The program will allow patients to be seen much more quickly. “This is a very exciting model of access. It takes place on Dakota First Nation land, so it's an example of First Nations people taking leadership and ownership of the situation,” said Foulds.

Faubert, Foulds, and Hart reported having no relevant financial relationships.

A University of Oklahoma researcher is the first to discover that the sequence of the genetic defect in the neuromuscular disease Friedreich's ataxia isn't always as uniform as previously thought, a breakthrough finding that could spark changes in how the condition is diagnosed and studied.

To further the research, Sanjay Bidichandani, MBBS, Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, has received a $2.8 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

Friedreich's ataxia appears in the teenage years with balance and walking problems and can lead to heart issues, vision and hearing loss, and other symptoms. The disorder is inherited, caused by a defect in a gene called FXN, and it is recessive, meaning a person needs a copy of the gene defect from both parents to be affected.

Since the FXN gene was discovered in 1996, a finding in which Bidichandani played a role, the sequence of the genetic defect was thought to be standard. The disease is indicated by an expansion of the letters GAA in the gene sequence. A person without Friedreich's ataxia typically has fewer than 30 of the triplet letters GAA in a row. However, people with the condition have 100 to 1,500 GAAs, an expansion of the naturally occurring sequence.

The test to discover this expansion is straightforward, but Bidichandani's team wondered if there was more to the story than a greater length of GAA letters. When they used a new technology called long-read sequencing, they discovered something that no one had found before: ""spelling errors"" in the long string of GAA letters in some people with the condition.

Instead of GAA expanded 1,500 times, we found different combinations of G's and A's that the original test could not detect. It is a whole new level of genetic variability that was not being taken into account in the diagnosis and prognosis of Friedreich's ataxia.""

Sanjay Bidichandani, MBBS, Ph.D., professor of pediatrics, University of Oklahoma College of Medicine

The discovery is significant for several reasons. Bidichandani's preliminary research using long-read sequencing shows that people with GAA letter irregularities seem to have a milder version of the disease in which they experience slower progression. His data thus far also shows that about 30% of people with the condition have this irregular spelling.

""But they have been told they have the classic type of Friedreich's ataxia,"" he said. ""Our first goal with this new grant is to determine the real diversity of genotypes in people with Friedreich's ataxia, and then to determine whether their condition is actually less severe.""

The research has major implications for clinical trials, Bidichandani said. People in ongoing trials have been enrolled based on the assumption that there is one presentation of Friedreich's ataxia with a straightforward expansion of GAA letters. If trial participants appear to be responding to a drug, they actually could have a milder version of the condition instead, Bidichandani said.

Understanding the different genotypes is also essential for people who want to undergo testing before deciding to have children. ""Because the standard test performed by many clinical diagnostic labs does not detect the spelling errors, people may receive a false negative result for carrier testing,"" he said. ""We have already discovered several families who've been told they're not carriers, but when we do our specialized test, it turns out that they are carriers.""

Bidichandani's grant was one of only 19 Impact Awards funded nationally through the fiscal year 2024 Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program within the Department of Defense. It is called an Impact Award because grant recipients are expected to make discoveries that have an immediate effect on patient care.

Friedreich's ataxia is rare; about 5,000 people in the United States have the condition, and there is currently only one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment. To expand his research on patients with Friedreich's ataxia, Bidichandani is collaborating with David R. Lynch, M.D., Ph.D., of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who shares a portion of the grant.

They have also been supported by the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, the largest patient advocacy group in the world for the condition. The organization provided initial funding that allowed Bidichandani and Lynch to gather the data needed to apply for the Department of Defense grant.

""This is an exciting time for our research program,"" Bidichandani said. ""We believe our findings will have a beneficial impact on people with Friedreich's ataxia and their families.""

A new study by researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health identified that uranium's isotopic composition can be used as a biomarker to noninvasively measure accumulation of uranium in the kidneys. Uranium from drinking water can accumulate in the kidneys-even at low levels of exposure-and this newly identified biomarker may serve as an early warning sign of kidney damage. The findings, published in Environmental Science & Technology, suggest a potential breakthrough in detecting and preventing chronic kidney disease caused by uranium toxicity. This discovery offers critical insights into a largely overlooked environmental health threat.

Uranium that enters the body through drinking water is filtered by the kidneys, where some of it is retained and can cause harm over time. Our study suggests that uranium isotopes in urine may provide a sensitive, noninvasive biomarker for detecting kidney accumulation and the risk of damage.""

Anirban Basu, PhD, senior author, geochemist and research scientist at Columbia Mailman School

According to federal data, nearly two-thirds of U.S. community water systems-serving approximately 320 million people-have detectable uranium levels. About 2% of these systems exceed the EPA's maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 30 micrograms per liter (μg/L). Among private wells, which supply water to roughly 15% of the population, about 4% exceed the MCL.

While uranium is best known as a radioactive element, its chemical toxicity-particularly to the kidneys-is the more pressing concern at environmental exposure levels. Studies show that even low concentrations of uranium (below the 30 μg/L MCL) may impair kidney function.

""Our findings raise particular concern for communities in the Great Plains and the Colorado Plateau, including many Native American populations, where natural uranium deposits and legacy mining activity have led to high groundwater contamination,"" added Basu.

Roughly 80% of ingested uranium is excreted in urine within days, but the remainder can accumulate in the kidneys-especially in the outer layer, where it binds to cells, causes injury, and interferes with vital functions. Over time, this damage can contribute to chronic kidney disease.

""Current tools to measure uranium in the body don't tell us how much is accumulating in the kidneys specifically – this is a big roadblock to understanding and preventing long-term kidney damage from uranium exposure,"" said first author Catherine Lucey, a doctoral student in environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman School.

In experiments with mice, researchers found uranium accumulation in both the kidneys and bones with distinct isotopic signatures after just 7 to 14 days of exposure to contaminated water. This is the first in vivo evidence that molecular uranium uptake alters the proportions of its isotopes detectable in organs and in urine.

Because uranium's isotopic signature is detectable in urine, this biomarker could enable cost-effective and noninvasive monitoring of kidney uranium levels-especially useful in communities at higher risk of exposure.

""Our results support the development of new models to predict how uranium travels through the body-from ingestion to accumulation and excretion,"" said Lucey. ""This work lays the foundation for precision biomarkers that could lead to earlier intervention-before irreversible kidney damage occurs.""

The study is part of a broader effort to improve environmental health surveillance and develop tools for monitoring metal exposures in vulnerable populations. The researchers plan future studies with longer exposure periods and lower uranium doses to better understand long-term effects.

When Lawrence and Penny Higgins of Fairfield, Maine, first learned in 2020 that high levels of toxic chemicals called PFAS taint their home's well water, they wondered how their health might suffer. They had consumed the water for decades, given it to their pets and farm animals, and used it to irrigate their vegetable garden and fruit trees.

""We wanted to find out just what it's going to do to us,"" Penny Higgins said. They contacted a couple of doctors, but ""we were met with a brick wall. Nobody knew anything.""

Worse still, she added, they ""really didn't want to hear about it.""

Many clinicians remain unaware of the health risks linked to PFAS, short for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, despite rising medical and public awareness of the chemicals and their toxicity. PFAS can affect nearly every organ system and linger in bodies for decades, raising risks of cancer, immune deficiencies, and pregnancy complications.

These ""forever chemicals"" have been widely used since the 1950s in products including cosmetics, cookware, clothing, carpeting, food packaging, and firefighting foam. Researchers say they permeate water systems and soils nationwide, with a federal study estimating that at least 45% of U.S. tap water is contaminated. PFAS can be detected in the blood of nearly all Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Maine was among the first states to begin extensive water and soil testing and to try to limit further public exposure to PFAS through policy action, after discovering that farms and residences — like the Higgins' property — had been contaminated by land-spreading of wastewater sludge containing PFAS. Exposure can also be high for people living near military bases, fire training areas, landfills, or manufacturing facilities.

In regions where testing reveals PFAS hot spots, medical providers can be caught flat-footed and patients left adrift.

Rachel Criswell, a family practice doctor and environmental health researcher, is working to change that. She was completing her residency in Central Maine around the time that the Higginses and others there began discovering the extent of the contamination. Her medical training at Columbia University included more than a year in Norway researching the effects of PFAS and other chemicals on maternal and infant health.

When patients began asking about PFAS, Criswell and the state toxicologist offered primary care providers lunchtime presentations on how to respond. Since then, she has fielded frequent PFAS questions from doctors and patients throughout the state.

Even knowledgeable providers can find it challenging to stay current given rapidly evolving scientific information and few established protocols. ""The work I do is exhausting and time-consuming and sometimes frustrating,"" Criswell said, ""but it's exactly what I should be doing.""

Phil Brown, a Northeastern University sociology professor and a co-director of the PFAS Project Lab, said the medical community ""doesn't know a lot about occupational and environmental health,"" adding that ""it's a very minimal part of the medical school curriculum"" and continuing education.

Courtney Carignan, an environmental epidemiologist at Michigan State University, said learning of PFAS exposure, whether from their drinking water or occupational sources, ""is a sensitive and upsetting situation for people"" and ""it's helpful if their doctors can take it seriously.""

Clinical guidance concerning PFAS improved after the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on PFAS in 2022. It found strong evidence associating PFAS with kidney cancer, high cholesterol, reduced birth weights, and lower antibody responses to vaccines, and some evidence linking PFAS to breast and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid and liver dysfunction, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.

That guidance ""revolutionized my practice,"" Criswell said. ""Instead of being this hand-wavey thing where we don't know how to apply the research, it brought a degree of concreteness to PFAS exposure that was kind of missing before.""

The national academies affirmed what Criswell had already been recommending: Doctors should order blood tests for patients with known PFAS exposures.

Testing for PFAS in blood — and for related medical conditions if needed — can help ease patients' anxiety.

""There isn't a day that goes by,"" Lawrence Higgins said, ""that we don't think and wonder when our bodies are going to shut down on us.""

After finding out in 2021 that his family was exposed to PFAS through sludge spread on their Unity, Maine, farm decades earlier, Adam Nordell discovered that ""it was exceedingly difficult"" to get tested. ""Our family doctor had not heard of PFAS and didn't know what the test was,"" he said. A lab technician needed coaching from an outside expert to source the test. The lab analyzing the samples had a backlog that left the family waiting three months.

""The results were devastating but incredibly helpful,"" Nordell said. Their blood serum levels for PFAS were at roughly the 99th percentile nationally, far higher than their well-water levels would have predicted — indicating that additional exposure was probably coming from other sources such as soil contact, dust, and food.

Blood levels of PFAS between 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter may be problematic, the national academies reported. In highly contaminated settings, blood levels can run upward of 150 times the 20-ng/mL risk threshold.

Nordell and his family had been planning to remain on the farm and grow crops less affected by PFAS, but the test results persuaded them to leave. ""Knowledge is power,"" Nordell said, and having the blood data ""gave us agency."" 

The national academies' guidance paved the way for more clinicians to order PFAS blood tests. The cost, typically $400 to $600, can be prohibitive if not picked up by insurance, and not all insurers cover the testing. Deductibles and copays can also limit patients' capacity to get tested. Less costly finger-prick tests, administered at home, appear to capture some of the more commonly found PFAS as accurately as blood serum tests, Carignan and colleagues found.

Maine legislators recently passed, with overwhelming support, a bill — modeled after one in New Hampshire — that would require insurers to consider PFAS blood testing part of preventive care, but it was carried over to the next legislative session.

""In my mind, it's a no-brainer that the PFAS blood serum test should be universally offered — at no cost to the patient,"" said Nordell, who now works as a campaign manager for the nonprofit Defend Our Health. Early screening for the diseases associated with PFAS, he said, is ""a humane policy that's in the best interests of everyone involved"" — patients, providers, and insurance companies.

Criswell tells colleagues in family practice that they can view elevated PFAS blood levels as a risk factor, akin to smoking. ""What's challenging as a primary care doctor is the nitty-gritty"" of the testing and screening logistics, she said.

In trainings, she shares a handout summarizing the national academies' guidance — including associated heath conditions, blood testing, clinical follow-up, and exposure reduction — to which she has added details about lab test order codes, insurance costs and coverage, and water filtration.

Criswell served on an advisory committee tasked with allocating $60 million in state funds to address PFAS contamination from past sludge-spreading in Maine. The group recommended that labs analyzing PFAS blood tests should report the results to state public health authorities.

That change, slated to take effect this summer, will allow Maine health officials to follow up with people who have high PFAS blood levels to better determine potential sources and to share information on health risks and medical screening. As with many earlier PFAS policies, Maine is among the first states to adopt this measure.

Screening for PFAS is falling short in many places nationwide, said Kyle Horton, an internist in Wilmington, North Carolina, and founder of the nonprofit On Your Side Health. She estimates that only about 1 in 100 people facing high PFAS exposure are getting adequate medical guidance.

Even in her highly contaminated community, ""I'm not aware of anyone who is routinely screening or discussing PFAS mitigation with their patients,"" Horton said. Knowledge of local PFAS threats, she added, ""hasn't translated over to folks managing patients differently or trying to get through to that next phase of medical monitoring.""

In heavily affected communities — including in Michigan, Maine, and Massachusetts — patients are pushing the medical field to better understand PFAS.

More doctors are speaking out as well. Testifying before a Maine legislative committee this year in support of a bill that would limit occupational PFAS exposure, Criswell said, ""We, as physicians, who are sworn to protect the health of our patients, must pay attention to the underlying causes of the illnesses we treat and stand up for policy solutions that reduce these causes.""

Even where policy changes are instituted, the physical and psychological toll of ""forever chemicals"" will extend far into the future. Criswell and other Maine doctors have observed chronic stress among patients.

Nordell, the former farmer, described his family's contamination as ""deeply, deeply jarring,"" an ordeal that has at times left him ""unmoored from a sense of security.""

To assess the mental health consequences of PFAS exposure in rural residents, Criswell and Abby Fleisch, a pediatric endocrinologist at the MaineHealth Institute for Research, teamed up on a study. In its first phase, winding up this summer, they collected blood samples and detailed lifestyle information from 147 people.

Nordell, the Higginses, and other Central Maine residents sit on an advisory board for the study, a step Criswell said was critical to ensuring that their research helps those most affected by PFAS.

""The urgency from the community is really needed,"" she said. ""I don't think I would be as fired up if my patients weren't such good advocates.""

Criswell has faced what she calls ""cognitive dissonance,"" caught between the deliberate pace of peer-reviewed medical research and the immediate needs of patients eager to lower their PFAS body burden. Initially she considered inviting residents to participate in a clinical trial to test therapies that are considered safe and may help reduce PFAS levels in the body, such as high-fiber diets and a drug designed to reduce cholesterol called cholestyramine. But the clinical trial process could take years.

Criswell and Fleisch are instead planning to produce a case series on PFAS blood-level changes in patients taking cholestyramine. ""We can validate the research results and share those,"" Criswell said, potentially helping other patients.

Alan Ducatman, an internist and occupational physician who helped design the largest PFAS cohort study to date, said providers should convey that ""there is no risk-benefit analysis"" for any of the current treatments, although they're generally well known and low-risk.

""Some people want to be treated, and they should be allowed to be treated,"" he said, because knowing they have high PFAS levels in their bodies ""preys on them.""

The rapid advancement of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) has opened unprecedented windows into cellular diversity, yet existing methods for multiplexing samples struggle with scalability and accuracy. Traditional techniques relying on antibodies or lipid-based barcodes often fail to uniformly label cells across different types or species, particularly in complex clinical samples. These limitations—cell-type bias, cross-contamination risks, and loss of rare cell populations—hinder large-scale studies and clinical translation. To overcome these challenges, a team led by Professor Yiwei Li at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) has pioneered Toti-N-Seq, a groundbreaking technology that harnesses the universal presence of N-glycans on cell and nuclear surfaces. Published as a cover story in Research (2025, DOI: 10.34133/research.0678), this innovation redefines how researchers approach high-throughput cellular profiling.

At the heart of Toti-N-Seq lies an engineered protein, Stv-Fg, derived from modifying the natural glycan-binding protein Fbs1. This fusion protein binds non-selectively to all N-glycan types, enabling universal tagging of cells and nuclei. By attaching DNA barcodes to Stv-Fg, the team achieved precise sample multiplexing without cell-type or species restrictions. Experimental validations underscored its robustness: flow cytometry revealed labeling efficiencies as low as 37.5 pM for cell membranes and 75.0 pM for nuclei, with cross-contamination below 2% even after prolonged sample mixing.

In practical applications, Toti-N-Seq demonstrated exceptional accuracy. When applied to single-nucleus sequencing, it achieved an overall classification accuracy (OCA) of 0.987, outperforming conventional antibody- or lipid-based methods. Notably, the technology preserved rare cell populations, such as the 0.5% plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in human peripheral blood samples, while reducing doublet rates to 0.04% for single cells and 0.02% for nuclei. These capabilities were further validated in 12-plex experiments, where sample ratio deviations remained under 4%, proving its reliability for large-scale studies.

Looking ahead, the Toti-N-Seq platform is set to transform both basic and applied research. The team plans to expand its multiplexing capacity to 24-plex or higher, facilitating ambitious projects like cross-organ cell atlases and high-throughput drug screening. Integration with epigenetic and proteomic tools will enable multi-dimensional single-cell analyses, shedding light on complex regulatory networks.

Clinically, Toti-N-Seq's ability to retain rare cell subsets positions it as a powerful tool for dissecting tumor microenvironments and predicting immunotherapy responses. Upcoming multi-center studies will explore its diagnostic potential in cancer patient cohorts. Beyond academia, the technology's compatibility with platforms like MobiNova microfluidics promises to streamline industrial workflows, accelerating drug development and toxicity testing through standardized, reproducible protocols.

Toti-N-Seq represents a leap forward in single-cell genomics, addressing long-standing bottlenecks in multiplexing accuracy and scalability. By leveraging the ubiquity of N-glycans, Professor Li's team has created a versatile tool that bridges species and cell types while preserving biological nuance. As the technology moves toward clinical and industrial adoption, it holds the potential to democratize high-resolution cellular profiling, empowering discoveries from developmental biology to personalized medicine.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Addressing inequality in asthma treatment and diagnosis","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250722/Addressing-inequality-in-asthma-treatment-and-diagnosis.aspx","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:21:00 GMT","

Asthma is one of the most common long-term health conditions, so why does getting diagnosed and treated still rely on where you live, who you visit, or even your ethnicity?

To commemorate World Asthma Day, Carol Stonham MBE, a renowned respiratory nurse, talks about what true accessibility in asthma care looks like and why we are not there yet.

Asthma is a condition with varying levels of care for a variety of reasons; it is critical that people with asthma symptoms receive a prompt and accurate diagnosis, and those who have an asthma diagnosis should receive equal care regardless of where they live or who their healthcare provider is.

Some places have limited access to a simple Fractional exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) test, requiring patients to travel a long distance to take this quick and straightforward test.

When it comes to care, one size does not fit all, so care must be tailored to the needs of the local community. We are implementing neighbourhood-based healthcare and planning services to guarantee that care is targeted to the local people.

Asthma leads to inflammation in the airways, which increases the production of nitric oxide (NO). A FeNO test measures the level of NO in a person's exhaled breath—higher levels indicate airway inflammation. This makes FeNO a valuable tool not only for diagnosing asthma but also for guiding treatment decisions.

Recognising its clinical value, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the British Thoracic Society (BTS), and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) have all updated their asthma management guidelines to include FeNO testing as a key part of both diagnosis and ongoing care.

The test itself is quick, non-invasive, and easily fits into a standard 10–15-minute consultation.

Education is essential for both healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients. Yet currently, there is no baseline standard for asthma training among HCPs. Without this foundation, it can be difficult to recognise poor asthma control or adjust treatment appropriately.

When HCPs are well-informed, they're better equipped to educate patients. And when patients understand their condition, their treatment, and how it works, they're more empowered to manage their asthma and, crucially, to know when to seek help if their symptoms worsen.

In the UK, access to care and information isn't equal. Patients from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often face barriers to healthcare, making it harder to access reliable education or testing. Some may narrowly miss qualifying for free prescriptions, only to struggle with the cost of medication.

Additionally, cultural perceptions around long-term conditions can be a barrier—within some ethnic communities, chronic illness is seen as a sign of weakness. This makes it all the more important to deliver the right messaging and targeted education in ways that reach and resonate with underserved groups.

The biggest barrier to wider access to FeNO testing in asthma care is funding, specifically, who is responsible for covering the cost.

In some areas, the Integrated Care Board (ICB) provides funding, but this isn't consistent across the country. In others, the responsibility may fall to the Primary Care Network (PCN). If the PCN doesn't prioritise it, the cost can land with individual GP surgeries, making access patchy and unreliable.

What's needed is a consistent, system-wide strategy—one where ICBs take ownership and ensure funding for FeNO testing is available across their regions.

Without access to FeNO testing, it's impossible to fully implement the recommendations set out by the updated NICE, BTS, and SIGN guidelines. That's why it's crucial to collaborate with advocacy organisations to build a strong case for the cost-effectiveness of FeNO testing.

A good example is Gloucestershire, where a local enhanced fee is paid for each diagnostic test. That payment is then reinvested to cover the cost of FeNO testing consumables.

Asthma care shouldn't rely on guesswork—but without the right tools in place, that's exactly what it risks becoming.

This article is based on materials originally authored by Carol Stonham.

The NObreath® is a FeNO device by Bedfont® Scientific Ltd. which can be used to measure airway inflammation for the management and diagnosis of asthma. 

Our mission is to help improve asthma diagnosis & management of adults and children worldwide through FeNO measuring. Our purpose is to make FeNO measuring more accessible globally, with the creation of an effective yet cost-efficient FeNO device and equally low cost consumables.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Gluten may not be the culprit for many people with irritable bowel syndrome","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250722/Gluten-may-not-be-the-culprit-for-many-people-with-irritable-bowel-syndrome.aspx","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 04:30:00 GMT","

A new study from McMaster University researchers has found that many people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who believe they are sensitive to gluten or wheat may not actually react to these ingredients.

IBS is an intestinal disorder that affects an estimated 10 per cent of Canadians – one of the highest prevalence rates globally, according to the Canadian Digestive Health Foundation. It can be disruptive and debilitating, and its underlying cause is unclear.

The study, published in The Lancet Gastroenetrology and Hepatology on July 21, 2025, included participants with clinically diagnosed IBS who reported feeling better on a gluten-free diet. These individuals were given cereal bars to eat containing either gluten, whole wheat, or neither -- without knowing, which was which, in a random order.

Researchers found the number of people who experienced worse symptoms was similar across all three groups, including the gluten-free placebo, suggesting that expectations and beliefs, rather than the ingredients themselves, may be driving symptoms in many cases.

Not every patient who believes they are reacting to gluten actually does. Some truly have a sensitivity to this food protein, but for many others, it's the belief itself that's driving their symptoms and subsequent choices to avoid gluten-containing foods.""

Premysl Bercik, senior author, professor with McMaster's Department of Medicine

When participants were later told which bars caused gastrointestinal symptoms, most did not change their beliefs or their diets. Bercik says the findings suggest that some patients with IBS may benefit, apart from dietary guidance also from psychological support and personalized care.

""What we need to improve in our clinical management of these patients is to work with them further, not just tell them that gluten is not the trigger and move on. Many of them may benefit from psychological support and guidance to help destigmatize gluten and wheat and reintroduce them safely in their diet.""

The study thus sheds light on why many people with IBS continue to avoid gluten, even when it may not be the true cause of their symptoms. According to researchers, the psychological phenomenon known as the nocebo effect, where negative expectations alone can trigger real symptoms, could partly be the reason. Bercik says the powerful role of social media and online communities can also fuel ideas that gluten is harmful.

""There is strong influence from the internet. Many patients post how bad they feel about gluten. Of course, it influences others,"" says Bercik, adding that for some people living with IBS, avoiding gluten is a way of taking control of their situation.

""Continuing the gluten-free diet might provided patients with an actionable method to try to control their symptoms, although it meant to follow unnecessary diet restrictions.""

To conduct the study, researchers designed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial. This means neither the 29 participants nor the researchers knew which bar was being consumed at any time. After each challenge, participants reported their symptoms, and stool samples were analyzed to objectively measure gluten intake.

Even though most participants said they ate the gluten or wheat bars, lab tests showed many didn't. According to the study, only about a third actually followed the diet as instructed, suggesting some may have skipped the bars to avoid symptoms.

Funding for the study was provided by Canadian Digestive Health Foundation and the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease.

An international team of researchers has made a key discovery: many children and young adults in Sub-Saharan Africa diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) may have a different form of the disease - one not caused by the immune system, unlike classic T1D. This discovery could change how diabetes is diagnosed, treated and managed across the region, paving the way for more accurate care and better outcomes.

The research was published today in Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology.

This is the first study across several Sub-Saharan African countries to use the same lab tests and genetic tools to learn more about type 1 diabetes. We've done similar research in the U.S. with different groups, but what's exciting here is being able to compare results between Africa and the U.S.""

Dana Dabelea, MD, PhD, paper's co-author, Distinguished Professor and Associate Dean of Research, Colorado School of Public Health, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus

The researchers enrolled 894 participants with youth-onset diabetes from three African countries: Cameroon, Uganda and South Africa. They compared findings from this population with similar studies done in the U.S. in the same age range.

""It's a really unique and important opportunity to explore the heterogeneity of T1D across countries and racial groups living in vastly different environments,"" adds Dabelea, who is also the director of the Lifecourse Epidemiology of Adiposity and Diabetes (LEAD) Center at CU Anschutz.

The researchers found that many young people in Sub-Saharan Africa diagnosed with T1D often don't have the usual markers in their blood (called islet autoantibodies) typically seen in people with T1D in other parts of the world. Specifically, 65% of participants with T1D in this region did not have islet autoantibodies.

Islet autoantibodies help distinguish T1D from other forms of diabetes, like type 2 or monogenic diabetes, which have different causes and treatments.

""This suggests that many young people in this region have a different form of T1D altogether and is not autoimmune in origin,"" said Dabelea.

When the researchers compared this data to studies in the U.S., they found a smaller but significant proportion (15%) of Black participants diagnosed with T1D had a similar form of diabetes found in Sub-Saharan Africa - characterized by negative autoantibodies and a low T1D genetic risk score.

However, white Americans with T1D showed the typical autoimmune pattern, even if they didn't have detectable autoantibodies, their genetics still pointed to autoimmune diabetes.

""The identification of this T1D diabetes subtype in Sub-Saharan African populations and among individuals of African ancestry in the U.S. suggests a potential ancestral or genetic link,"" Dabelea notes. ""These findings highlight the need to consider alternative etiologies in this group and a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms may provide important insights for future prevention and treatment strategies.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New antibody therapy offers hope for fragile patients with Fanconi anemia","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250722/New-antibody-therapy-offers-hope-for-fragile-patients-with-Fanconi-anemia.aspx","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:16:00 GMT","

An antibody treatment developed at Stanford Medicine successfully prepared patients for stem cell transplants without toxic busulfan chemotherapy or radiation, a phase 1 clinical trial has shown.

While the researchers tested the protocol on patients with Fanconi anemia, a genetic disease that makes standard stem cell transplant extremely risky, they expect it may also work for patients with other genetic diseases that require stem cell transplants.

We were able to treat these really fragile patients with a new, innovative regimen that allowed us to reduce the toxicity of the stem cell transplant protocol. Specifically, we could eliminate the use of radiation and genotoxic chemotherapy called busulfan, with exceptional outcomes.""

Agnieszka Czechowicz, MD, PhD, study's co-senior author, assistant professor of pediatrics

In the clinical trial, publishing online July 22 in Nature Medicine, the antibody used in combination with other drugs enabled transplants for three children with Fanconi anemia. All three have completed two years of follow-up and are doing well.

""If they don't get a transplant in time, Fanconi anemia patients' bodies eventually will not make blood, so they die of bleeding or infections,"" said co-first author Rajni Agarwal, MD, professor of pediatric stem cell transplantation. ""The reason I am so excited about this trial is that it is a novel approach to help these patients, who are very vulnerable.""

Before undergoing a stem cell transplant - in which diseased bone marrow is replaced by that of a healthy donor - a patients' own stem cells must be eliminated, typically with radiation or chemotherapy. In the trial, patients were instead injected with antibodies against CD117, a protein on the surface of blood-forming stem cells. The antibody, briquilimab, eliminates blood-forming stem cells without toxic side effects.

Other authors of the study included co-first author Alice Bertaina, MD, PhD, the Lorry I. Lokey Professor, and co-senior author Matthew Porteus, MD, PhD, the Sutardja Chuk Professor in Definitive and Curative Medicine.

The team drew upon decades of Stanford Medicine scientific advances to develop a safer technique that also makes stem cell transplants more accessible.

Czechowicz has studied blood-forming stem cells since 2004, when she was an undergraduate student in the lab of Irving Weissman, MD, the Virginia and D.K. Ludwig Professor in Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research who was then the director of Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Their work focused on CD117, which regulates the cells' growth and development. They found that an antibody against CD117 blocked the stem cells' growth and eliminated the cells from mice without the hazards of radiation and chemo. Together with other Stanford scientists, they subsequently identified the clinical antibody equivalent that was used in this new clinical trial.

This clinical trial also addressed a second challenge in stem cell transplant: In the past, about 35% to 40% of patients who need the transplants for any reason did not receive them because they lacked fully matched donors. But researchers found a way to increase the chance that the transplants would work by modifying the donated bone marrow before giving it to the participants. They enriched for CD34+ cells - the donor's blood-forming stem cells - by specifically removing a subset of problematic immune cells known as alpha/beta T-cells. The innovation, which was developed by Bertaina and her colleagues before she came to Stanford Medicine, reduces the risk of a transplant complication called graft-versus-host disease, in which immune cells in donated bone marrow attack the recipient. It allows patients to receive cells from someone who shares only half of their immune markers, such as a parent.

""We are expanding the donors for stem cell transplantation in a major way, so every patient who needs a transplant can get one,"" Agarwal said.

The first person with Fanconi anemia to benefit from the new approaches was Ryder Baker, of Seguin, Texas, who is now 11. Ryder received a stem cell transplant at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in early 2022 as part of the clinical trial. Today, Ryder's Fanconi anemia ""doesn't slow him down like it used to,"" said his mom, Andrea Reiley. Before the transplant, she said, ""He was so tired, he didn't have stamina. It's completely different now.""

Ryder, who recently finished fifth grade, is using some of his newfound energy to play sports. He loves pickleball and received an award - Up and Coming Player - from his school's soccer team.

The researchers hope Ryder will be the first of many kids to benefit from their work.

""Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are most commonly used in blood cancers, in which the bone marrow is full of malignant cells and patients have no other options,"" Czechowicz said. ""But as we're making these transplants better and safer, we can expand them to more patients including those with many different diseases.""

Fanconi anemia interferes with DNA repair. One consequence is impaired development of blood cells, including oxygen-carrying red blood cells; white blood cells needed for immune function; and platelets, which help the blood clot. Patients experience fatigue, reduced growth, frequent infections, and more bruising and bleeding than normal. Eventually, their blood cell production is so diminished they have a life-threatening condition known as progressive bone marrow failure, signs of which develop in about 80% of Fanconi anemia patients by age 12.

Children with Fanconi anemia can become stuck in a catch-22: A stem cell transplant can prevent and treat bone marrow failure, but because their DNA-repair machinery works so poorly, patients are extremely vulnerable to side effects - including cancer - from the chemotherapy or radiation used to prepare for these transplants.

""Right now, nearly all of these patients get secondary cancers by the time they're 40,"" Czechowicz said, adding that her team hopes their new approach will reduce those rates. Fanconi anemia patients are also more vulnerable than other people to complications of graft-versus-host disease.

The three trial participants were all younger than 10 when they received their transplants. They were of different racial/ethnic backgrounds and had different gene mutations underlying their Fanconi anemia.

Each patient received a single intravenous infusion of the antibody 12 days before they were scheduled to receive donated stem cells. Closer to the transplant date, they received immune-suppressing medications typically given before stem cell transplant, but no radiation or busulfan chemotherapy that is typically part of the treatment regimen.

Each patient was then given a stem cell transplant consisting of cells that had been donated by a parent, depleted of alpha/beta T-cells and enriched for blood-forming stem cells. Within two weeks, the donated stem cells quickly took up residence in the patients' bone marrow. No one experienced graft rejection - a transplant complication in which the patient's immune system rejects the donated cells - and by 30 days after transplant, the healthy cells from the donors had almost completely taken over the patients' marrow.

The researchers' initial goal was to help patients reach 1% donor chimerism, meaning 1% of the bone marrow cells would come from the donor. But two years later, all three patients have close to 100% of their cells from their donors - far better than the researchers expected.

""We've been surprised by how well it's worked,"" Czechowicz said. ""We were optimistic that we would get here, but you never know when you're trying a new regimen.""

Even with the improved protocol, a stem cell transplant is a big challenge for kids like Ryder, requiring them to spend more than a month in the hospital and endure short-term side effects such as severe exhaustion, nausea and hair loss.

""It was heartbreaking to see him go through things like that - I'd rather go through it than my child,"" Reiley said, adding that, fortunately, Ryder remembers little of the experience. ""I felt the heartbreak for him, and now he doesn't have to.""

Since his transplant, Ryder has grown taller, gained weight and become much less susceptible to run-of-the-mill germs, his mom said. ""It used to be huge hits when he would get sick at all, and I really don't have to worry about that anymore.""

Reiley has conversations with her son about how his experience as a medical pioneer is helping experts take better care of other kids. ""I think he takes a lot of pride in that, too,"" she said.

After more than three decades of administering stem cell transplants with the traditional approach, Agarwal said she loves explaining to patients' families how much better the new options are.

""When I counsel families, their eyes start to shine as they think, 'OK, we can avoid the radiation and chemo toxicity',"" she said.

The researchers are now conducting a phase 2 trial of the same protocol in additional children with Fanconi anemia. They also plan studies to test whether the new approach will work for other conditions, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia, another genetic disease that causes bone marrow failure.

Most cancer patients may still require some chemotherapy or radiation to rid them of malignant cells, said the researchers, who noted that another team at Stanford Medicine is testing whether the antibody can help elderly cancer patients who can't tolerate full doses of radiation or chemotherapy because they are fragile or have diseases in addition to cancer.

""That population is often at a disadvantage,"" Agarwal said. ""It may provide us with a way to treat them with less intensity so it's possible for them to get a transplant.""

The group is also working on next-generation approaches that may continue to improve the treatment regimen for patients with Fanconi anemia as well as other grievous diseases.

Other researchers who contributed to the study were from the University of California, San Francisco; Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine; St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; and Jasper Therapeutics Inc.

Study funding came from anonymous philanthropic support and the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine. The antibody, briquilimab, was supplied by Jasper Therapeutics Inc. The Fanconi Cancer Foundation and the Stanford Clinical Trial program also provided clinical trial support and assisted with the execution of the study.

Mental illnesses are thought to be caused by both biological and environmental factors in complex interaction. Among the environmental contributors are a wide range of social, economic, and demographic factors known as ""social determinants.""

Adam Skinner and colleagues used dynamic Bayesian network analysis to infer the complex causal networks that link social determinants to mental health in a nationally representative sample, consisting of around 25,000 participants in the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey. The authors identified variables that directly predicted mental health problems: physical health, loneliness, satisfaction with local community, and satisfaction with personal finances.

In addition, the authors found that mental health problems influenced many of these same variables, suggesting feedback loops. According to the authors, these results can be used to identify the social and economic interventions that could most efficiently and effectively reduce mental illness at a population scale. For example, if every participant was satisfied with their financial situation, rates of mental illness would drop by around 3 percentage points, eliminating almost a third of mental illness in Australia.

Significant public health gains could also be achieved by promoting local community engagement, physical wellbeing, and participation in volunteer or charity work and paid employment, perhaps through a nationally funded job guarantee program.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Astrocytes play key role in coordinating neurons for visual information","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250722/Astrocytes-play-key-role-in-coordinating-neurons-for-visual-information.aspx","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:52:00 GMT","

Cells called astrocytes are about as abundant in the brain as neurons, but scientists have spent much less time figuring out how they contribute to brain functions. A novel study by MIT researchers at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory shows that one function appears to be maintaining the chemical conditions necessary for groups of neurons to team up to encode information.

Specifically, the neuroscientists showed that when they knocked out the ability of astrocytes in the visual cortex of mice to produce a protein called ""GABA transporter 3 (Gat3),"" neurons there became less able as a group to represent information about the movies lab mice were seeing. GABA is a common inhibitory neurotransmitter that sharpens neural activity and astrocytes uniquely use Gat3 to regulate the ambient level of GABA in their area. In the study in eLife, knocking out Gat3 in the visual cortex left neurons stewing in a soup of excess GABA that only produced subtle effects on individual neurons, but nevertheless added up to a significant impairment on their efforts as an ensemble responsible for visual function.

Even if the changes at the level of a single neuron representing a visual stimulus do not change significantly, if a hundred neurons have some small changes, that could add up at the population level to a measurable, significant change.""

Mriganka Sur, Senior Author, Paul and Lilah Newton Professor in The Picower Institute and MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS)

Notably, the authors wrote in eLife, this is the first study in live mice of Gat3 at scales spanning individual cells and functional ensembles of hundreds of them.

To make the discovery, BCS graduate student Jiho Park used a novel implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock out Gat3 combined with statistical and computational analyses of neural activity at the population level, Sur said.

As neuroscientists have studied the brain's visual system over many decades, neurons have claimed most of their attention because they are electrically active and more easily targeted genetically, Sur said. Technology for tracking astrocyte activity and for manipulating their function hasn't developed as quickly. But in 2019, the National Institutes of Health gave Sur a grant to develop better tools for studying astrocytes. That funding helped the lab create the variant of CRISPR/Cas9 they call MRCUTS that enabled the new study. The tool allowed them to use just one viral vector to target the gene that encodes Gat3 for multiple cuts. That multiplexed attack decisively and precisely knocked it out in visual cortex astrocytes.

Once Park knocked out Gat3, she could see the effects of its absence by visually tracking the calcium activity of neurons, a proxy for their electrical activity. The consequences were more subtle than the team expected. Awash in GABA, neurons fired less robustly and less reliably. When the mice were watching only a gray screen, instead of movies, the neurons would spontaneously activate less often, too.

But to the researchers' surprise, when Gat3 was gone the neurons individually still did their jobs. Cells that in the presence of Gat3 were responsive to different features of the images the mice were seeing, such as the orientation of lines, remained responsive even after Gat3 was knocked out. Though ambient levels of GABA were higher, pairs of neurons still shared GABA through their direct connections, or ""synapses,"" as before, meaning their direct dialogue with each other didn't change.

""We were expecting to see changes in orientation tuning among other things, but we didn't see that,"" Park said. ""That's why we looked into deeper levels of analysis to see if there's any difference.""

That deeper analysis occurred at the level of broader neural ensembles, where Park used several statistical and computational methods to analyze how the collective information encoding by hundreds of neurons changed when Gat3 was knocked out.

Using a statistical method called a ""Generalized Linear Model"" to analyze patterns of activity across the ensemble, Park discovered that when Gat3 was knocked out, the activity of neurons became less predictive of the activity of others in the group compared to when Gat3 was present. This indicated that while individual neurons might still be doing what they were supposed to, their coordination was impaired. Meanwhile using a ""Support Vector Machine""-based decoder to discern the information that ensembles were representing, she found that when Gat3 was present the decoder could improve its assessment as more neurons were added to its sample. But when Gat3 was knocked out, the decoder could no longer ascertain the represented information even as its sample size increased.

""The decoding deficits following Gat3 ablation provide evidence that astrocytic regulation of ambient GABA is essential for organizing the coordinated neuronal activity patterns necessary for efficient information encoding in visual cortical networks,"" the authors wrote in eLife.

The finding that a lack of Gat3 disrupts neural coordination at the population level might help explain clinical observations that Gat3 reduction in the thalamus increases seizure risk, Gat3 increase in the striatum contribute to repetitive behaviors, and Gat3 reduction in the globus pallidus impairs motor coordination, Park said.

""Because our study is the first to look at Gat3 effects on a population level, it might help tie that back to some of the behavioral phenotypes people have been seeing,"" Park said. But more research is needed, Sur noted, because there are other Gat proteins, such as Gat1, that the brain might use to compensate.

In addition to Park and Sur, the paper's other authors are Grayson Sipe, Xin Tang, Prachi Ojha, Giselle Fernandes, Yi Ning Leow, Caroline Zhang, Yuma Osako, Arundhati Natesan, Gabrielle Drummond and Rudolf Jaenisch.

The National Institutes of Health, a MURI Grant, The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, the Freedom Together Foundation and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory provided funding for the study.

Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a severe haemorrhagic fever virus transmitted by tick to animal and humans. Discovered in 2009, the virus is found in South-East Asian countries and has a fatality rate of up to 40%. By studying the virus in tick cells, scientist from the University of Surrey have identified two novel antivirals effectors. This discovery could help scientists prevent diseases from spreading from tick to humans in the future.

The study, published in Nature Communications, analyzed Rhipicephalus microplus tick cells, common carriers of SFTSV, using advanced multi-data analysis to unravel the ticks' cellular responses to the virus.

The researchers pinpointed how two RNA helicases, essential proteins found in all forms of life, were critical in reducing SFTSV's replication within the ticks. The two RNA helicases, UPF1 and DHX9, were in fact found to interfere with the virus' ability to copy itself, essentially putting a wrench in its reproductive cycle.

Understanding how ticks tolerate these viruses is key for developing vector control strategies and to block tick-to-human transmission. By identifying UPF1 and DHX9 as key antiviral players, we start to unravel the complexity and uniqueness of the ticks' antiviral response. This is extremely valuable for future prevention and control strategies.""

A breakthrough AI model can spot silent structural heart disease from a simple ECG, promising to catch dangerous conditions earlier, streamline patient care, and close the diagnostic gap missed by traditional screening.

Study: Detecting structural heart disease from electrocardiograms using AI. Image Credit: DC Studio / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature, a group of researchers investigated whether an artificial intelligence (AI) electrocardiogram (ECG) model can reliably detect diverse structural heart diseases (SHDs) across various hospitals and care settings, outperforming standard physician review. The model, called EchoNext, was developed as a multitask classifier to address collinearity among different SHD component labels.

Every minute, another United States (US) patient enters the hospital with symptoms that may mask underlying SHD. Treating SHD already drains the nation of more than 100 billion dollars each year. Yet, an estimated 6.4% of older adults carry clinically significant valvular heart disease (VHD) that has never been diagnosed, in addition to 4.9% already diagnosed, making the total prevalence over 11%.

Early echocardiography saves lives, but ultrasound labs, trained readers, and patient travel costs remain barriers, leaving busy clinicians guessing whom to scan.

Large-scale digital ECG archives and modern AI offer a low-cost alternative: if one ten-second ECG could reliably uncover silent disease, scarce imaging resources could be directed to those who need them most.

Further research is needed to determine whether algorithm-guided screening improves survival and equity. Additionally, the paper discusses potential deployment strategies for such models, including both “gatekeeper” and “safety net” applications, each with unique benefits and trade-offs for clinical practice.

Investigators assembled 1,245,273 paired ECG-echocardiogram records from 230,318 adults treated between 2008 and 2022 at eight NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) hospitals, reserving patient-level splits for training, validation, and testing.

SHD was labeled when any guideline defined abnormality was present with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45%, left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 1.3 cm, moderate or worse right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) ≥ 45 mm Hg, or tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity ≥ 3.2 m/s as an alternative pulmonary hypertension definition, moderate or worse regurgitation/stenosis of any valve, or a moderate/large pericardial effusion.

The authors note these thresholds are somewhat arbitrary, as different studies and guidelines may use varying cutoffs.

A convolutional neural network named EchoNext ingested the raw 12-lead waveform, along with seven routine ECG parameters and age/sex data. Performance was first measured on a held-out NYP test set, and then on external cohorts from Cedars-Sinai, the Montreal Heart Institute, and the University of California, San Francisco.

Generalization across age, sex, race, ethnicity, and clinical context was assessed. Silent “shadow” deployment ran EchoNext on 84,875 consecutive ECGs from patients without previous echocardiography, storing scores but not influencing care.

Finally, a single-site pilot, Detecting Structural Heart Disease Using Deep Learning on an Electrocardiographic Waveform Array (DISCOVERY), prospectively invited adults with no recent imaging to undergo echocardiography stratified by a predecessor model's risk score; EchoNext was analyzed post hoc.

EchoNext, an AI-powered ECG model, excelled in retrospective analysis. Within the eight-hospital NYP test set, it detected composite SHD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 85.2% and an area under the precision–recall curve (AUPRC) of 78.5%. Accuracy remained consistent across academic and community campuses and did not falter when training and test sites were exchanged, demonstrating generalization.

External validation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI), and the University of California, San Francisco, yielded AUROC values of 78 to 80%, despite higher disease prevalence.

Disease-specific performance: LVEF ≤ 45% achieved AUROC 90.4%, while PASP ≥ 45 millimeters of mercury reached 82.7%. The authors emphasize that AUPRC values for component diseases are highly dependent on the underlying disease prevalence and should not be directly compared across conditions or use cases.

A 150-trace reader study compared EchoNext with thirteen cardiologists. Reviewing wide age, sex, waveform, and ECG intervals, physicians identified SHD correctly in 64% of cases. The AI alone achieved 77% accuracy, and when clinicians were shown the algorithmic risk score, their accuracy increased modestly to 69%, underscoring that the model captured prognostic patterns that were hidden from expert eyes. It is important to note that cardiologists in this assessment had access only to de-identified ECGs and routine parameters, without any clinical context, which is not typical of standard clinical care.

To estimate clinical opportunity at scale, the team silently ran EchoNext on 124,027 ECGs recorded in 2023 from 84,875 adults who had never undergone echocardiography. The model flagged nine percent of traces as high risk. Usual care, nevertheless, left 45% of these individuals without follow-up imaging, suggesting that an estimated 1,998 cases of silent SHD might have been intercepted had the alert been live, based on modelled prevalence and sensitivity scenarios provided in the paper.

Among the 15,094 patients who eventually received echocardiography, EchoNext preserved accuracy (AUROC 83%; AUPRC 81%) and delivered a positive predictive value of 74%, reinforcing its reliability in a contemporary workflow. The paper also provides modelled performance estimates at different prevalence scenarios and sensitivity thresholds, underscoring the practical implications for population-wide screening.

Prospective evidence came from the DISCOVERY pilot, which recruited 100 imaging-naive adults. Post hoc EchoNext scoring revealed clear tiers, with previously unrecognized SHD present in 73% of high-risk participants, 28% of moderate-risk participants, and 6% of low-risk participants; moderate to severe left-sided VHD followed a similar gradient.

These results illustrate the model's capacity to triage scarce echocardiography resources toward those most likely to benefit, while sparing low-risk individuals unnecessary testing. The original trial used a predecessor model (ValveNet) to stratify risk and recruit participants, and the EchoNext model was applied retrospectively to these participants for further analysis.

To summarize, EchoNext demonstrates that an AI-enhanced ECG can detect SHD associated with LVEF reduction, elevated PASP, and significant VHD, with AUROC and AUPRC metrics superior to those of cardiologists. By flagging high-risk patients for timely echocardiography, the algorithm promises to shrink diagnostic delay and the billion-dollar burden of SHD while maintaining equity across sites and demographics. However, the authors caution that AI-based screening may also carry potential risks, including patient anxiety from false positives or bias in clinical adoption, and highlight the need for further study of these aspects.

The public release of code and data encourages independent validation; however, large pragmatic trials must verify that AI-guided ECG screening truly improves survival, quality of life, and healthcare value. Notably, the authors have released a large de-identified dataset and a benchmark AI model (the Columbia mini-model) to support further research and enable transparent comparison of future algorithms.

PhoreMost Ltd., a next-generation targeted protein degradation (TPD) company progressing a pipeline of degrader therapeutics within oncology and inflammation, today announced the publication of a study demonstrating the capabilities of its high-throughput GlueSEEKER platform to accelerate the design and development of novel molecular glue degraders.

The paper, titled ""Systematic molecular glue drug discovery with a high-throughput effector protein remodeling platform"", was published in BioRxiv and describes PhoreMost's unique approach to molecular glue discovery, wherein effector proteins, such as E3 ligases, can be engineered at scale to expand protein surface landscapes and trigger induced degradation of target proteins. GlueSEEKER is used to develop a high-resolution understanding of the physical and chemical requirements for molecular glue development, and provides the blueprints to enable small molecule drug discovery. The approach synthesises quantitative high-throughput biological data with the most recent advances in computational small molecule drug discovery.

The study describes PhoreMost's GlueSEEKER in detail and documents an end-to-end case study for small molecule molecular glue discovery with the technology. The potential of the platform to accelerate programs is validated by the published data and methodology, which can also be applied to novel E3 ligases and other effector proteins across broad therapeutic areas.

Molecular glues have now been established as an effective therapeutic modality, but these small molecule drugs have still largely only been found through serendipity. Our GlueSEEKER platform overcomes the challenges associated with monovalent glue discovery, enabling their rational and systematic design from almost any E3 ligase or target. This paper marks a significant milestone by showcasing one of our case-studies and validating our deep mutational scanning approach for prospective drug discovery.""

Dr Benedict Cross, CTO, PhoreMost

Dr Neil Torbett, CEO, PhoreMost, commented: ""FDA-approved molecular glues have treated millions of patients and generated billions of dollars in revenue. The advances disclosed within this manuscript demonstrate how GlueSEEKER can radically enable the discovery of new molecular glue therapies, directing this modality towards specific targets across a broad array of E3 ligases.""

Neil added: ""GlueSEEKER builds on PhoreMost's long-standing expertise in mini-protein engineering and high-throughput phenotypic screening to provide rich biological data which is deeply enabling for the advancement of first-in-class drugs using AI-based molecule design tools. We are excited to build upon our leading position to progress the next generation of molecular glue degrader assets for both our internal pipeline and though alliances and partnerships.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","The impact of CO monitoring on smoking reduction strategies","https://www.news-medical.net/whitepaper/20250722/The-impact-of-CO-monitoring-on-smoking-reduction-strategies.aspx","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 12:27:00 GMT","

Smoking tobacco produces carbon monoxide (CO), a harmful gas formed through incomplete combustion. Each year, smoking causes more than 8 million deaths and remains one of the most serious public health threats the world has ever faced.1 This figure includes approximately 1.3 million non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke.1 Smoking severely impacts human health, affecting almost every organ in the body and leading to various diseases.

In light of these alarming statistics, this article investigates the role of CO monitoring in supporting smoking cessation.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colorless, odorless gas in cigarette smoke. When inhaled, it is absorbed into the bloodstream through the lungs. CO attaches to haemoglobin in red blood cells, blocking their ability to carry oxygen and depriving the body of this vital nutrient. This can lead to a variety of health complications and smoking-related diseases, including:2

The impact of smoking is profound, with smoking-related deaths remaining the UK's leading cause of preventable mortality, causing 1 in 4 cancer-related deaths and 64,000 deaths annually in England.3

CO monitoring is a simple, non-invasive technique used to measure CO levels in exhaled breath. While small amounts of CO are naturally present in the breath, smokers exhale higher levels due to CO inhalation during smoking.

Devices such as the Smokerlyzer® allow instantaneous CO level monitoring by having the user blow into the device.

CO monitors such as the Smokerlyzer® benefit patients on their journey to quit smoking by delivering immediate feedback on smoking-related CO levels. Observing a reduction in CO levels after quitting can be a strong motivator, reinforcing commitment to cessation efforts.



Image Credit: Bedfont® Scientific Ltd

A study by Beard and West (2012) investigating the efficacy of personal carbon monoxide monitoring discovered that out of 10 smokers, “7 of the smokers reported that they felt as though the devices had reduced their cigarette consumption… 6 smokers reported a lower nicotine dependency relative to baseline. Over the 6 weeks, there appeared to be a significant decline in the number of cigarettes smoked per day”.4

Given that smoking is responsible for over 8 million deaths annually, more must be done to aid smoking cessation and reduce the global burden of smoking-related illnesses on healthcare providers. CO monitoring is a proven tool that helps individuals quit smoking and regain control of their health.

Bedfont® Scientific has specialised in the design and manufacture of exhaled breath and gas monitoring instruments since 1976.

For medical gas monitoring, their Medi-Gas Check medical pipeline testing range verifies not only the quantity but also quality of gas administered to patients.

Bedfont's breath analysers include carbon monoxide (CO) monitors such as the Smokerlyzer®, used for smoking cessation, and the ToxCO®, used by emergency services, to diagnose CO poisoning.

The NObreath® FeNO monitor provides accurate analysis of airway inflammation for the control of asthma, and the Gastrolyzer® range aids in the detection of gastrointestinal disorders and food intolerances. Quick and non-invasive, breath analysis is the new blood test.

A new study by NYU Langone Health researchers found that the shutdown of a significant fossil fuel pollution source near Pittsburgh, PA, resulted in immediate improvements in respiratory health. The study is available online starting July 22 in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, a journal of the American Thoracic Society.

Assessing data from nearby local and federal air quality monitors, the researchers tracked the air pollution health effects on residents near the Shenango plant before and after its closure in 2016.

Results showed that within the first few weeks after the plant's closure in January 2016, respiratory related emergency visits decreased by about 20 percent. In the first month of the closure, pediatric asthma visits declined by 41 percent, and continued to fall by 4 percent each month through the end of the study period.

These findings indicate that reductions in fossil-fuel related air pollution are linked to both short and long-term lung health benefits, the researchers say.

The adverse reductions in respiratory health effects were much greater than expected, based on past studies of general air pollution in the U.S., indicating that emissions from such fossil fuel related sources are especially toxic.""

George Thurston, ScD., study senior author 

Dr. Thurston is a professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a member of the American Thoracic Society.

""This study provides rare, in-the-field evidence that the closure of a major industrial pollution source can lead to immediate and lasting improvements in the lung health of the those who live nearby,"" added the article's first author, Wuyue Yu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. ""By tracking health outcomes before and after the coke plant closure, we were able to isolate the effects of reduced air pollution and observe that cleaner air translates into fewer respiratory emergency visits and hospitalizations.""

Why wait for “Wicked” part two when you can tune into the 2025 European Championship in Switzerland to watch Germany's goalkeeper defy gravity and the odds? I'm Emily Olsen here with the whole crew — *Cynthia Erivo's Elphaba riff* welcome to Full Time! (And especially if you're new here!)

Coming up:

Exactly two years ago today, around the time that we launched this newsletter, the U.S. women's national team beat Vietnam 3-0 to open the 2023 World Cup. Sophia Wilson (then Smith) scored twice, followed by Lindsey Heaps (then Horan). It was the last time they'd capture a victory in the competition, before crashing out in the next round.

It's not just the players' last names that have changed since. Here's where we stand two years from the next one in Brazil:

What's happened since?

If you haven't paid attention to the USWNT since the last World Cup, brace yourself for some vertigo; very few aspects of this program will look like you last remembered.

Since Sweden forward Lina Hurtig scored the penalty kick that goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher (who is now retired) will always swear never crossed the line, Vlatko Andonovski resigned from his position as head coach, and then-assistant coach Twila Kilgore stepped into the interim role while U.S. Soccer scouted for a permanent replacement.

Then, in November 2023, the Emma Hayes era began. The former Chelsea manager started her job as USWNT head coach in May 2024, two months before the Summer Olympics in France. That's where “Triple Espresso” — the attacking trio of Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson and Trinity Rodman — entered the women's soccer lexicon and powered the USWNT to a gold medal.

How much has changed since then?

What's ahead?

Despite being the competition's most successful competitor, with four World Cup titles, the U.S. isn't guaranteed a spot in the field.

Over 30 Concacaf teams will contend for four guaranteed places at the 2027 Women's World Cup, with the U.S. and Canada as heavy favorites.

These places will be earned at the 2026 Concacaf W Championship, an eight-team bracket which will be held in November 2026. (While there is a qualifying period for the W Championship, the U.S. is expected to bypass that gantlet as one of the region's two highest-ranked nations.)

Last year, after the U.S. and Mexico withdrew their late joint bid to host the 2027 tournament, FIFA members threw their support behind Brazil, selecting it over a European proposal. The decision marked a historic milestone: For the first time, the biggest event in women's soccer will be staged in South America.

The 1950 and 2014 men's World Cups drew millions to Brazil's white sand beaches and samba-charged streets, turning the country into a global soccer festival. The question now: Will the world return with the same passion for the women's game, 13 years later?

Two years ago, I wrote that the U.S. looked toothless and lost during the group stage of the World Cup, but that everything going wrong in New Zealand was actually a symptom of the USWNT's larger problem, not the illness itself.

Helpfully, Hayes came in from day one calling herself a “heart surgeon in the middle of emergency surgery” as she tried to prepare the team for the 2024 Olympics. Speaking as someone on the ground for the last World Cup and the Olympics, the difference in mood around the team couldn't have been more stark. The pressure was still on, but the next generation was ready for it.

Now, the days of emergency surgery are behind the team, but the federation, the program and Hayes are still working on fixing all of those underlying issues. They've found investment via Michele Kang, owner of the Washington Spirit, among other clubs, who has invested millions to address pipelines for players, coaches and referees in the women's game.

Hayes told me shortly after taking the USWNT job that if the team had won the 2023 tournament, she wouldn't have been interested. It was the project of taking over a team at one of its lowest points, and building again — building something new — that interested her. Gold medals in Paris can never be overlooked, but this project has always been about 2027.

Call her Elphaba, because she defied gravity. Call her Ice because that's what's in her veins. Call her “OMG DID YOU SEE THAT?!”

Or you could just call her German goalie Ann-Katrin Berger, because that's now synonymous with putting up stone-cold performances in big moments.

Down a player and a goal in the first 15 minutes versus France on Saturday, hurting their already depleted backline, Germany could have easily been counted out. And yet they went into halftime tied, held on through extra time and sealed the deal in a penalty-kick shootout. And it was due in large part to Berger, the Gotham FC goalkeeper whose resume speaks for itself.

Berger has also twice overcome thyroid cancer, including a recurrence during the 2022 Euro run where she was the backup keeper.

🎧 Listen to the latest “Full Time Euros” podcast to relive the wild shootout.

📺 Euros: Semifinals

Cristiana Girelli's brace in stoppage time pushed Italy through to the semifinals for the first time since 1997, where they will face defending champions England. The Lionesses will be entering the fixture in protest in support of defender Jess Carter, who said she has been subject to racial abuse all tournament long. The second semi is a must-watch as Gotham FC teammates Esther Gonzalez (Spain) and Berger (Germany) go head-to-head.

The Nigeria and South Africa fixture is a repeat of the 2018 championship match, with this semifinal clash further cementing the two sides' budding rivalry. The Super Falcons have a record nine championships, with Banyana Banyana eager to defend their 2022 crown. Then there's host nation Morocco, which will look to top Ghana in hopes of securing their return to the finals stage for a second year in a row.

Thankfully, we still have two more weeks of South American football. As a growing number of players have called on their federations and Conmebol for better working conditions, they've managed to juggle protesting off the pitch with beautiful football on it. Watch Mayra Ramirez's banger for Colombia or Linda Caicedo's brace against Paraguay, as Las Cafeteras begin to settle in the competition after a rocky start.

With the match schedule quite heavy, we thought it'd be nice to revisit some of our deeper reads.

Twinning: Ever want to switch places with your sibling? These identical twins in England's top division have bamboozled rivals and their coaches alike with their similar skills and matching features.

Teen sensations: Before, playing in college was one of the few paths to the pros for women. Now, more players are getting started before they even graduate high school, including 14-year-old star Mak Whitham.

Just a feeling: NWSL partnered with podcaster Alex Cooper's Unwell brand earlier this year, but is the relationship an “incredible platform” to grow the game or an existential risk?

Broken-foot goals and building worlds: We still aren't over having to say goodbye to former USWNT star Tobin Heath's playing career, so you can find us reading Meg's recent interview with her again … and again.

The United States Men's National Team is set for their 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup semi-final clash in the nation's capital as Mauricio Pochettino looks to avoid becoming another upset headline as they take on Guatemala.



With Luis Fernando Tena's Los Chapines side boosted by their penalty shootout win over Canada in the quarter-final, the Stars and Stripes will have to be wary of falling to a similar fate against a side that cannot be underestimated.

Here is how the Argentine tactician will deploy his XI on the night at Energizer Park.

Patrick Agyemang continues to control the central striker's birth this run, with the Charlotte FC striker capable of correcting the recent narrative surrounding him with a big performance tonight.

Arfsten hails Pochettino's impact

Discussed challenges of U.S. soccer development

Admits his aim is land in Europe

AUSTIN, Texas - The U.S. men's national team's run to the Gold Cup final was a meaningful moment for a relatively young squad that featured 15 players from MLS. Although the team would ultimately lose 2-1 to Mexico, it was a strong bounce back after lackluster showings against Turkey and Switzerland in June friendlies.

According to Max Arfsten, who played in five matches during the tournament and had three assists and one goal, the turnaround wasn't coincidental - and full credit to coach Mauricio Pochettino.

""First two friendlies we played, obviously, the results [weren't good], we lost both of those games,"" Arfsten said at MLS All-Star Media Day. ""And, you know, he could have kind of blamed us for that, because we're the ones playing. But he took, you know, the ownership and, like, kind of took it on himself with the media and stuff. So that kind of showed me he cares about us.

""It's not easy for someone to do that, especially when you're not playing - to take the blame to protect us, in a way. So I think that was a huge gesture that we all noticed. Like, OK, this guy, he wants us to, you know, be positive. Just have good vibes in the camp. And that's what he did.""

Pochettino was under heavy criticism following those two friendlies, but following his team's run to the Gold Cup final, there was optimism, considering how the team performed without several stars such as Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson and Weston McKennie. Arfsten has been in both the U.S.'s January camp and the Gold Cup and believes the Argentine's approach throughout was a significant catalyst.

""He's a really good guy, super friendly with the players, like, super emotional and, like, you can tell he cares about the players a lot,"" Arfsten said of Pochettino. ""It kind of goes without saying. Really good coach, as well. He's coached at very high levels... Really good experience for me to just be able to be coached by someone who has coached at such a high level before.""

Arfsten also reflected on his own experience at the Gold Cup, making strides in development.

""I just got mentally stronger. To be honest with you, I was put in like uncomfortable situations, like playing with players you're not really used to,"" he said. ""So going through all that, I think just made me mentally stronger. And then, you know, obviously I just gained a lot of good experience, like playing in big games and starting a lot and just kind of getting that experience.""

Another benefit of playing in the Gold Cup for Arfsten was seeing his stock rise. The wingback was linked with a move to Ligue 1, as the Columbus Crew reportedly rejected a bid for Toulouse, according to GiveMeSport. Arfsten acknowledged his goal is ultimately to land in Europe.

""Yeah, right now, obviously, it is a dream for myself, and I think any player to play in Europe at the highest level,"" Arfsten said. ""But you know, for now, I'm just focused on what's in front of me, and just staying here as a moment, doing what I can to just be the best player I can be.""

The Columbus wingback is set to play in the MLS All-Star game Wednesday at the Q2 Stadium.","{'href': 'https://au.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Home'}","soccer"

Chelsea have officially updated their honours board to reflect their status as the 'first ever' Club World Cup champions.

The Blues beat Champions League winners, and favourites for the Club World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final of the tournament just over a week ago.

It was a shock result, but an emphatic win on the night, with Chelsea taking home the all-new trophy, as well as a hefty cash prize in the first iteration of the tournament in its 32-team format. It had previously been fought between just six or eight teams.

After the Blues' victory, it was announced that previous winners of the Club World Cup would now be known as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions', with FIFA themselves dubbing Enzo Maresca's side as 'the first ever FIFA CWC Champions' on social media.

This means that the the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are effectively no longer world champions, while Chelsea also previously won the trophy in 2021.

And the Blues have been quick to reflect the change in direction when updating their club honours board.

The Blues' website has updated their triumph in the previous iteration of the competition

Alongside Chelsea, Liverpool (above), Man United and Man City also won the tournament

On Chelsea's website under the 'Men's trophy cabinet' section, a new addition was noticed by eagle-eyed fans.

Listing their triumphs below a section of text that read: 'Chelsea have won it all! Here we detail each and every one of our major trophy triumphs...,' the club added the FIFA Club World Cup from 2025.

This was followed by a change to their triumph in the tournament's previous iteration, with this listed as the 'FIFA Intercontinental Cup (formerly FIFA Club World Cup)' from 2021.

Back then, Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 after extra time in the final thanks to a late Kai Havertz penalty.  

City won the original competition in 2023, Liverpool lifted it in 2019 and United in 2008.

However, as of Tuesday morning, the three other English sides were yet to follow Chelsea's example in changing their honours roll.

All of City, Liverpool and United were still listed as previous FIFA Club World Cup champions on their websites.

Meanwhile, the competition had first been played in 2000 as the Club World Championship.

It returned in 2005, and was played annually until 2023, before adopting its current form as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in light of the Club World Cup this summer.

Real Madrid won it the most times with five - most recently in 2022 - while Barcelona won it four times, and Corinthians and Bayern Munich twice. 

Real won the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in 2024, and it will return in 2025 where PSG will be representing Europe by virtue of winning Champions League.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=club+world+cup","Why Chelsea delayed double RC Strasbourg deal amid Club World Cup decision revealed","https://www.si.com/onsi/soccer/chelsea/transfers/why-chelsea-delayed-double-rc-strasbourg-deal-amid-club-world-cup-decision-revealed-01k0seqxdwdw","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 16:39:23 GMT","

In this story:

Chelsea have already decided on which three players will join RC Strasbourg on loan for the 2025/26 season.

Every football club is only able to loan a maximum of three players from one club at any given time, and with Chelsea's ties to Ligue 1 outfit Strasbourg, who are also owned by BlueCo, the two sides are maximising the relationship.

Last season, Djordje Petrovic and Andrey Santos excelled for the French club and helped them qualify for the Conference League. However, Petrovic has since returned and departed on a permanent transfer to AFC Bournemouth, while Santos has been earmarked for a big role under head coach Enzo Maresca.

Chelsea have already confirmed one permanent sale to Strasbourg this summer, with Mathis Amougou making the switch to France, despite only joining the Blues back in January from Saint-Etienne.

Meanwhile, Chelsea completed the permanent signing of defender Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg in a deal worth around £12m last month.

Along with Sarr, the decision has been taken for highly-rated goalkeeper Mike Penders to join Strasbourg next season, with moves in the final stages of being finalised. Kendry Paez will be the third Chelsea player to move to France on loan next season to play under Liam Rosenior.

With Strasbourg back for pre-season training, the view may have been for Penders and Sarr, in particular, to have joined up with their new teammates as soon as possible to settle into their new surroundings. 

However, The Athletic have now revealed the reason for the delay and why they stayed with the Chelsea squad for longer before completing their respective loan moves to Strasbourg.

Chelsea wanted Penders, who is expected to be Strasbourg's number one, and Sarr to be with the Blues for the duration of their Club World Cup campaign in the United States to get some experience and be part of Maresca's set-up, before allowing them to depart on loan.

As quoted by ESPN, Sarr has big hopes for his career, which Chelsea will hope he can fulfil, after revealing which defender he hopes to follow in the footsteps of.

""I want to be like Virgil van Dijk,"" said Sarr last month. ""I love Van Dijk. But some people tell me I play like (Liverpool's) Ibrahima Konaté. It's very similar. He's a leader. For a defender, it's very important to be a leader. Off and on the pitch, I talk a lot. It's an important job.

""I think I anticipate well. With the ball, I can pick a good pass. When I was a kid, I had a dream. It was to be the best centre back in the world.""

Chelsea have cherry-picked which talent will move to Strasbourg and all parties will hope it will boost the French side to an even higher league finish next season. All that's left is for the clubs to confirm the loan deals.

Chelsea star Marc Cucurella has admitted he was 'scared s***less' by Donald Trump when the US president gatecrashed their Club World Cup lift. 

Trump became an unexpected participant in Chelsea's celebrations after they beat PSG 3-0 as he lingered on the stage while Reece James held the trophy aloft. 

As the players danced around at the MetLife Stadium, Trump continued to stand among them clapping and smiling, much to the confusion of just about everybody - especially Cole Palmer. 

Cucurella told Spanish journalist Gerard Romero: 'We had been told that, as a rule, Donald Trump would come to present us with the trophy and that we couldn't lift it until he left.

'And of course, we were all there waiting for him to leave, but the guy didn't want to leave, and on top of that, we looked at him and he said, ""Get him up, I'll stay here, and so on.""

'And I wondered who would say anything to him, you know... I was scared s***less!'

Marc Cucurella say she was 'scared s***less' when Donald Trump gatecrashed Chelsea

The US president bizarrely stood by as Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup earlier this month

The team knew he would be part of the ceremony but not the celebrations, says Cucurella

The US President had arrived to a chorus of cheers at MetLife Stadium and watched on as Chelsea secured a surprise 3-0 win against PSG, with Palmer scoring a brace while Joao Pedro was also on target.

Roughly 35 minutes before kickoff, Trump and wife Melania arrived at the nearby Teterboro Airport on the presidential Marine One helicopter from his local golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. 

The 79-year-old was given VIP treatment as he soaked up the action alongside First Lady Melania, who cut a chic figure in a white dress and black blazer, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

But Trump's crowning moment came after the final whistle when he took centre stage as the trophy was given to Chelsea.

It was anticipated that the Commander-in-Chief would step aside after giving the trophy to Chelsea captain James - as is customary. 

However, to the bewilderment of many Chelsea players, Trump remained on stage for the entire trophy lift.

Palmer, who really was the star of the show on the day, was astonished. An expression of disgust washed over his face. 'What's he doing?' he asked his team-mates. 

Speaking afterwards, the England star was honest but slightly more measured than his facial contortions had suggested. 

Cole Palmer looked baffled as Commander-in-Chief Trump joined their trophy celebrations

Trump had played a key role in presenting tournament awards following the final

'I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused, yeah,' he said.

Trump had earlier presented Palmer with the golden ball award with the 23-year-old midfielder looking as equally baffled during that presentation.

After presenting medals to both the victors and losers, the Trmup was front and center as the Blues hoisted the trophy.

Following his presentation of the trophy to Chelsea, he was asked to leave the stage by Infantino but bizarrely chose to stay put.

Marc Cucurella, fresh off winning the FIFA Club World Cup with Chelsea, has weighed in on Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona, sharing his thoughts on how the England international might adapt to Spanish football. 

Rashford joined Barça on loan from Manchester United until the end of the season, a transfer that has sparked plenty of debate and excitement across Europe.

Speaking in an interview with Jijantes, Cucurella expressed his belief that Rashford has what it takes to succeed at Barcelona, but he also pointed out that the winger will soon realise the differences between the Premier League and La Liga.

“He's very fast and I think he'll notice the difference in pace between the leagues,” Cucurella explained.  

“The Premier League is quicker, more physical, but in La Liga you have to adapt to a different style of play. 

“I believe Marcus can do quite a lot of work in Spain because of his speed and quality, but he will have to adjust.”

In addition to his views on Rashford, Cucurella also spoke about Barcelona's recent progress under Hansi Flick. The Chelsea defender admitted he was impressed by Barça's performances last season.  

“I was very surprised; I didn't expect it,” he said, acknowledging the improvements the Catalan giants have made since Flick took over.

Rashford's move to Barça is seen as one of the safest transfers of the summer. After a mixed season at Manchester United and Aston Villa, the England international now faces the challenge of proving himself in a new league and under a new system. 

As such, a lot of former players, including Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker, have voiced their opinion about the transfer and considering their takes, it is safe to say that he is likely to leave a strong impression.

Even though Chelsea's form was up and down in the 2024/25 season, it turned out to be a memorable one.

The Blues wrapped up a long campaign by finishing fourth in the Premier League to seal Champions League qualification. On top of that, they also won both the Conference League and the Club World Cup to collect two pieces of silverware.

It turned out to be a very successful debut year for Enzo Maresca, 45, as the head coach at Stamford Bridge.

Maresca's main target at Chelsea next season is to secure Champions League qualification again. We would expect it to be hard to silence the expectation and excitement around the talented young squad of players, though.

Chelsea have become a footballing powerhouse in the 21st century, signing some of the world's best stars over and over again. However, they may have just had a renewed boost from what they achieved last season.

According to The Telegraph, the fact that Chelsea won the Club World Cup and qualified for next year's Champions League has elevated them in the eyes of players based outside England.

Chelsea were always taking the Club World Cup seriously because of the financial benefits of the summer tournament. It's turned out that it could be huge for new signings, too, because players overseas are more attracted to the project in West London.

RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons really wants to join Chelsea, where the 22-year-old attacker would get to play for the club side who call themselves world champions.

If Chelsea are popular globally right now, perhaps now is the time to strike while the iron is hot in the transfer market.

In fairness, the Blues squad is finally coming together as it gels into something with major potential. It may need some tweaks to get competing against the very best teams on a consistent basis next term.

Chelsea have discussed two more signings, one offensive and one defensive, to improve Maresca's squad.

Our urgent message to the club's sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, is to ensure they don't miss out on signing a new left-back to provide some much-needed support for Marc Cucurella.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Next year's FIFA World Cup will bring the world's biggest sporting event to 11 cities across the U.S. In 2028, Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics.

Under normal circumstances, these events would draw millions of visitors, generate billions of dollars in tourism and showcase America on the world stage. But unless the U.S. changes course, we are likely to squander the opportunity, damaging both our economy and our global reputation.

Over 1 million fans traveled to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. The 2024 Paris Olympics attracted about 1.7 million international visitors. The U.S. should be preparing for similar crowds, but it is instead throwing up barriers.

On his first day back in office, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to apply “maximum” vetting to all visa applicants. In practice, that has meant more arrests, more detentions, more deportations and more horror stories of travelers turned away at the border.

The damage isn't limited to the border. The State Department has imposed invasive social media vetting on certain visa applicants. Consular officers are vetting applicants for “any indications of hostility towards the citizens, culture, government, institutions or founding principles of the United States.” Applicants who refuse to make their online activity visible may be viewed as trying to hide something, which could result in a denial.

Then came Trump's sweeping travel ban on 12 countries and restrictions on seven more on June 4. Leaked plans suggest the administration may soon target an additional 36 countries. That would affect hundreds of thousands of travelers. And earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order requiring noncitizens to pay more to visit our national parks than U.S. citizens.

The travel industry is already feeling the effect. In May, the World Travel and Tourism Council projected that international travel spending in the U.S. will plunge by 22 percent this year — a $12.5 billion loss. Among 184 countries studied, the U.S. is the only one expected to see a decline in spending by foreign visitors.

And don't assume you're safe if you're not from a banned country. Visa applicants from all over the world now face expanded surveillance and ballooning backlogs. For example, the average wait time for a tourist visa at the American embassy in Bogota, Colombia is now 15 months.

Even under former President Joe Biden, more than 66,000 visa applicants were stuck in “administrative processing.” That number has almost certainly grown during Trump's second term. Even travelers from closely allied countries now face uncertainty, long wait times and unexplained delays.

The message is being received overseas: Visit America at your own risk.

Meanwhile, the 11 U.S. cities hosting World Cup games are preparing for a wave of foreign visitors and media. But they also house large immigrant communities facing increased enforcement and surveillance. The administration has not clarified whether there will be any safeguards for undocumented or mixed-status fans, workers or residents near these events. 

On the contrary, Trump has ordered immigration agents to intensify arrests and deportations in Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles and New York — both key sites for World Cup matches. Immigrants are staying home, afraid that they could be picked up on their way to or from work.

This is a self-inflicted wound. Without a reliable workforce and a welcoming environment for international travelers, the U.S. could turn two marquee events into cautionary tales. Even if the administration relaxes certain policies temporarily to facilitate the World Cup and Olympics, the damage to America's image and economy may already be done.

Hosting global events is more than a point of pride — it's a test of openness, security and competence. A successful World Cup and Olympics would show the world that the U.S. remains dynamic, open and capable. But if fear and red tape define the visitor experience, we would send another message entirely: America isn't worth the trouble.

That wouldn't just be a lost opportunity but an unforced economic and diplomatic error.

Qatar signaled its interest as an Olympic Games host with established infrastructure from 2022 FIFA World Cup a key selling point.

The Qatar Olympic Committee (QOC) said it was taking part in “ongoing discussions” with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) over the election process for the host city of the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the organisation said in a media release on its website.

The country, which hosted football's World Cup in 2022 and the Asian Cup in 2024, is the latest to join the race to stage the 2036 Games after confirmed bids from Indonesia, Turkiye, India and Chile.

Other Asian countries considering a bid include Saudi Arabia and South Korea. Egypt, Hungary, Italy, Germany, Denmark and Canada have also shown interest.

“We currently have 95% of the required sports infrastructure in place to host the Games, and we have a comprehensive national plan to ensure 100% readiness of all facilities,” Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad Al Thani, the president of QOC, told the state-run Qatar News Agency on Tuesday.

“This plan is rooted in a long-term vision aimed at building a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable legacy.”

Qatar's capital Doha is set to host the Asian Games in 2030, having staged the event in 2006.

A successful bid would make Qatar the first country in the Middle East to host the Olympics amid the region's growing influence over major sporting events. Saudi Arabia is set to hold the football World Cup in 2034.

The England international hasn't looked like a world-class player for two years, but he could see plenty of game time in Catalunya

Rio Ferdinand was right when he claimed a lot of people were taken aback by Barcelona's interest in Marcus Rashford, ""given what he's produced over the last two years"". Basically, the forward's form and conduct have made a mockery of Manchester United's decision to give Rashford a new contract in July 2023 worth a staggering £325,000 ($438,000) per week.

Consequently, Ruben Amorim decided just over a month after taking over as manager last November that he wanted rid of Rashford as soon as possible. Frustratingly for United, a buyer could not be found - even after a mildly encouraging loan spell at Aston Villa during the second half of last season.

However, Barca have just agreed to sign Rashford with an option to buy for a fee in the region of £30 million ($40m) next summer - which is pretty much the best United could have hoped for in the circumstances. A transfer fee obviously would have been preferable, as it would have raised some badly-needed funds for the Amorim's enormous rebuilding job at Old Trafford, but United have at least managed to remove Rashford's enormous salary from their wage bill.

Furthermore, there's every chance that the loan deal could materialise into a permanent transfer - because while the general perception is that he'll be nothing more than a bench-warmer at Barcelona, Rashford could actually become a bargain buy this time next year...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Ruben Amorim will be facing an impossible task in 2025-26 if the Red Devils don't speed up their summer recruitment drive 

Manchester United needed to completely overhaul Ruben Amorim's squad after the worst season in the club's modern history. That much was obvious after the Red Devils followed up their 15th-placed finish in the Premier League with a dreadful 1-0 defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final, which saw them miss out on European qualification for the first time in a decade.

But here we are, less than four weeks away from United's blockbuster 2025-26 season opener against Arsenal, and only three new faces have arrived at Old Trafford: former Wolves star Matheus Cunha, teenage full-back Diego Leon and, after finally completing his long-awaited £71 million ($96m) switch from Brentford on Monday, Bryan Mbeumo.

That trio, however, won't cover more than just the foundations of Amorim's rebuild. The Portuguese coach couldn't hide his frustration after seeing his disjointed team held to a 0-0 draw by Leeds in their first pre-season friendly on Saturday, as he admitted to MUTV: ""We have a lot to improve, the speed of the game, all of the details. We need to improve."" That simply cannot happen if Sir Jim Ratcliffe and INEOS do not grant him the tools.

Cunha and Mbeumo will both add much-needed quality in the final third, but there is so much more work to be done if the Red Devils are to start climbing back towards the top.

Bryan Mbuemo is set to start his new adventure with Manchester United this season following hisfrom Brentford. Arriving with the 71 million pounds transfer fee, United are hoping that Mbuemo can make an immediate impact next season.

There will be plenty of expectation from the Cameroon international, especially following his excellent performance last season. Mbuemo managed to net 20 goals in the Premier League for Brentford, his highest scoring numbers in a season.

However, before manifesting his production with the Red Devils, United fans might also be interested to witness on how it all started. EFL channel recently posted a clip of Mbuemo's first goal ever after arriving in England.

The clip showed the attacker scoring for Brentford during their game against Derby County in the Championship division. Mbuemo arrived during the 2019/20 season, and he netted his first goal during that home game against Derby after 17 minutes of play, helping his side to win 3-0 in that match.

The ATP Tour in recent days has been rocked with some big news involving Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. 

After the Mubadala Citi DC Open in Washington, the attention will turn towards a Canadian swing and, in particular, the Toronto Open, which is a big tournament before the US Open. 

However, the two best players in world tennis have now pulled the plug on their participation, along with others such as Jack Draper and Novak Djokovic, as they bid to prepare properly for the US Open instead. 

This situation merely serves to highlight just how tough the ATP Tour is right now and once again, the players have been having discussions about the demands of the schedule in its current form. 

The withdrawals of a number of top players means that Fritz will start the tournament as the number one seed as the highest-ranked player. 

The Wimbledon semi-finalist could see this as a good opportunity to get another title under his belt, but it would appear that he also has some concerns over the schedule in its current format. 

He said in a press conference: “Yeah, I think, I mean, probably pretty much all the players for a long time have been asking for the season to be shorter, but all we are doing is just lengthening it, adding more stuff, we're adding more, like, longer tournaments. 

“The Hopman Cup was after Wimbledon. I didn't even know this was going on. They had an event with Felix and Cobolli playing a tournament right after Wimbledon and one of them is coming and playing here. It's insane, we are just adding stuff to the calendar over and over again.

“I think they shortened parts to obviously give themselves an extra week to do this, to make it the three weeks between the two tournaments, but we should just be – you know, I think it's funny how we can shorten, we find ways to shorten the schedule to make room for other tournaments, but we can't find room to shorten the schedule just for there to be nothing. I'd love to see it go back to just two weeks and maybe we can have an extra, can shorten the season a week, I don't know. But it's a lot of tennis. It's a lot of tennis upcoming.”

The American number one is making a lot of sense with these comments, but he certainly doesn't appear to be showing the signs of a player in need of a rest. 

Fritz is playing extremely well at the moment and was brilliant as he enjoyed a solid run to the last four at Wimbledon earlier this month. 

At 27, Fritz will be desperate to end his wait to win a Grand Slam title and at last year's US Open, he reached the final before going down to Sinner in the final. 

The Toronto Open will now be a tournament that Fritz is eagerly anticipating and given the current field, it would be hard to imagine the player not enjoying a deep run. 

The ATP Tour find themselves in a tricky situation when it comes to the schedule because on one hand, they want to promote the game in lots of countries. 

However, there is no point in having so many tournaments if the players are simply going to withdraw and produce tournaments without their very best players. 

Fritz has made some valid points and now it will be intriguing to see if the schedule is shortened somewhat when next year's dates are finalised. ","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The ATP Washington Open is back in action today for the second round. The second round features numerous high-quality matchups, including the headliner of this article: Lorenzo Musetti vs. Cameron Norrie. Here are my best bets for the second round of action at ATP Washington. Let me know whether you agree in the comment section.    

H2H: 0-1

The first time that Fabian Marozsan played Gabriel Diallo was earlier this year at the Davis Cup. Diallo took that match in straight sets, barely breaking a sweat, as he lost only four total games that day. The match was only, and I bring that up because Marozsan lost. Not only is Marozsan a career clay player, but Diallo is only 17-15 lifetime on clay. Perhaps Marozsan can return the favor now that he gets Diallo on Diallo's preferred surface. Marozsan is 56-32 on hardcourt, which isn't too bad when you compare it to Diallo's 80-44 overall record on hardcourt.

Best Bet to Make

Diallo is right on the line of usability at 1.5 straight on Bet365. While you can find outlets like Betfair that have Marozsan at 1.19, he remains the underdog, as Diallo is priced at 1.11 on the same site. That's the only time that Marozsan comes close to Diallo with the line. Most other sites have him at least a full point behind, if not more. This makes sense because Diallo already has one tournament victory this year, and a very quick victory over Marozsan on his opponent's preferred surface. Diallo's tournament victory was June 15th, and he's been in a quarterfinal and round of 16 since. He's also coming off taking Taylor Fritz to the limit at Wimbledon, so momentum is really riding with Diallo.

That being said, Diallo winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Diallo winning @1.5 @Bet365

H2H: 0-0

This will be the first match between Matteo Arnaldi and Lorenzo Sonego. There are several superficial comparisons between the two men, as well. Both men have had similar overall years. Arnaldi is 16-15 overall and Sonego is 14-17 overall. Both men are 7-6 overall on hardcourt in 2025. Hell, you can even get both men for 1.90 on 1xBet, but that's beside the point. Neither Arnaldi nor Sonego has ever played at Washington before. Of the two of them, Sonego is having the more consistently positive year. Sonego has thrived at two of three majors thus far in 2025, making one quarterfinal and one round of 16.



Best Bet to Make

Sonego is the slight favorite for a fairly solid reason, and that is his recent play. Coming off a quality showing at Wimbledon, Sonego has built himself confidence after a poor showing at Roland-Garros, which had to hurt his pride as a primarily clay player. Many sites see this as a push, and I get why they think that. Even in his wins, Arnaldi has struggled. Furthermore, he hasn't been outstanding on hardcourt since 2020 when he was 16-5. Arnaldi might be having the better year, but Sonego wins the match in three.

That being said, Sonego winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Sonego winning @1.90 @1xBet

H2H: 0-2

Cameron Norrie hasn't had much luck against Lorenzo Musetti. While the two have only met on clay, Musetti took both matches in three sets, and both of them were in 2023. The last time Norrie played in Washington was 2021, and he finished in the round of 16. Both men are playing fantastic tennis right now, but Musetti is having a slightly better go of it right now. Setting Wimbledon aside, Musetti had been in the semifinals of the four previous tournaments, including one finals loss at Monte Carlo. Had it not been for Carlos Alcaraz, Musetti may have won three of those tournaments.

Best Bet to Make

Norrie last made a semifinal in May, and that was at Geneva. Outside of that, Norrie hasn't advanced beyond the quarterfinals this year. Sure, most of Musetti's success has come on clay, but it's not like he's dogwater on a hardcourt. I will say that Norrie is by far the more accomplished player on the hardcourt, as he's 235-118 overall. But before you get any bright ideas about betting on him because of that, he's 7-8 this year, 14-12 in the last two years, and 28-24 in the last three years. He just isn't the same hardcourt player he was in 2022. 

That being said, Musetti winning is a value bet for sure.

Musetti.   Has no form right now, Norrie has a decent chance of winning especially with a win today over the Brit Billy Harris and it looks like Italian is just trying to find some matches and form coming of the loss at Wimbledon and the lack of match wins since the French open where he retired vs Alcaraz,    There is no way I could bet Musetti.   He is exactly the kind of guy I don't bet on right now(based on health and is he dealing with an injury Musetti? Maybe not
Norrie with a win under his belt could definitely win this match.  , I bet tons of tennis it's very difficult and when trying to interpret form and health can be very difficult      I'm also ignoring they 2-0 record on clay that Musetti has vs Norrie       Unfortunately I bet Norrie recently and he got his ass kicked by Billy Harris (Eastborne). Probably should have bet him back vs Harris today.      But I'm trying to bet on people that I have won with opposed to betting on people I've lost with , I do appreciate your write ups and I do bet on some of picks you make . Best James

Holger Rune has appointed renowned fitness trainer Marco Panichi, who has previously worked with both Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner.

Panichi worked with Djokovic from 2017 until April 2024, before he joined Sinner's team in September 2024 alongside Djokovic's former physiotherapist Ulises Badio.

Sinner fired both Panichi and Badio on the eve of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships, where he went on to claim his fourth Grand Slam title.

Rune‘s mother and manager Aneke Rune has revealed to Danish outlet BT that Panichi will join the world No 9's team.

“We will welcome Marco Panichi to the team,” Aneke Rune said. “He brings enormous experience – not just in the physical aspect, but everything related to building a Grand Slam winner. That takes the idea up another notch.

“We know Marco very well and have always had a really good relationship with him. And he has always liked Holger. He is in a special class, so it is a huge capacity to have in the team.

“The way he works, and the way he worked with Novak Djokovic, is very much the way we see a fitness coach in a team where he will also be active in training.”

According to BT, Panichi will start working with Rune at the Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, which will begin on August 7.

Holger Rune reveals details behind Andre Agassi collaboration, believes he can become world No 1

Carlos Alcaraz apologises to fans as he reveals reason for key schedule decision

Addressing his decision to part ways with Panichi and Badio before Wimbledon, Sinner said: “No, nothing major happened. Nothing big happened. I parted ways not long ago, but it's not affecting me.

“We've reached incredible results in the past with them, so obviously huge thanks to them. We made some great job, but I decided to do something different.”

Rune, who will compete at the ATP 500 tournament in Washington this week, recently revealed he has sought advice from tennis legend Andre Agassi.

“I reached out to him (Agassi) some months ago,” the 22-year-old said in Washington.

“He's an amazing man, first of all, and he's very wise, as well. He sees the game in a unique way that I've never experienced before.

“I thought now was a good moment to reach out to Agassi because my base is back and I'm playing well again. When you're changing coaches a lot, you don't play as well because you're not following one opinion or a single structure.

“I thought this was the right time to get some extra input. It's not anything magic, but he obviously had some very wise words I can use.”

Rafael Nadal won the 2020 French Open without dropping a set, the fourth time in his legendary career that he has accomplished this feat of sporting dominance. His toughest test that year — in addition to the vacant stands due to COVID-19 — was a quarterfinal matchup against future Wimbledon champion Jannick Sinner.

Their quarterfinal matchup got off to a late start. Even though the Spaniard made light work of a then-teenage Sinner in straight sets (7-6, 6-4, 6-1), the match ran until 1:30 AM. Nadal labeled playing at that time of night as ""dangerous.""

“No, the problem is the weather. Having two days in the middle is not a big deal. Of course, it is not ideal to finish a match at 1:30 in the morning. But the problem is the weather,"" the French Open legend said post-match. ""It is too cold to play. Honestly, it is very, very cold to play tennis, no?

“I know football players play under these conditions, but is a little bit different. They are all the time moving. We stop, we come back, we stop on the changeovers.

It is a sport that you are stopped in a lot of moments, no? I think is a little bit dangerous for the body to play with these very heavy conditions. But that's what happened today.""



Nadal boasts a perfect 3-0 head-to-head record against Sinner, although the pair would face off at distinctively different arcs in their careers. The veteran Spaniard would also beat the young Italian at the 2021 French Open.

Nadal was effusive in his praise of his opponent after the match. “Sinner is a very, very young talent with a lot of power, great shots,” he said.

“The conditions here were a little bit difficult because he was hitting every ball very hard, for me it was difficult. The ball, with this court, the spin is not there. For me, it was difficult to pull him out of the position.""

Sinner beat No. 11 David Goffin in the first round before upsetting No. 6 Alexander Zverev in the Round of 16 to reach his first major quarterfinal in just his second-ever main draw at a grand slam.

After topping Sinner, Nadal ousted Diego Schwarzmann in the semifinals and longtime rival Novak Djokovic in the finals to capture a fourth-straight French Open title.

Holger Rune has reportedly hired Marco Panichi, the fitness trainer who left Jannik Sinner's team days before Wimbledon started. Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio, who previously worked with Novak Djokovic, joined the world No. 1's team last year. But Sinner confirmed that he'd parted ways with both men before turning up to SW19.

Sinner still went on to lift his fourth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, overcoming an elbow injury without the help of his own personal fitness coach. And Panichi has also moved on, as he is set to start working with world No. 9 Rune next month.

According to Danish outlet BT, Rune's mum and manager, Aneke, confirmed that Panichi will join the camp at next month's Cincinnati Open.

“We will welcome Marco Panichi to the team. He brings enormous experience - not just in the physical aspect, but everything related to building a Grand Slam winner. That takes the idea up another notch,” Aneke said.

“We know Marco very well and have always had a really good relationship with him. And he has always liked Holger. He is in a special class, so it is a huge capacity to have in the team.

“The way he works, and the way he worked with Novak Djokovic, is very much the way we see a fitness coach in a team where he will also be active in training.”



Rune has worked with plenty of high-profile coaches in his time, including Boris Becker and Patrick Mouratoglou. But the 22-year-old went back to basics and has spent this season with Lars Christensen.

The five-time title winner also enjoyed a three-day training block with Andre Agassi ahead of this week's ATP 500 event in Washington. Rune reached out to the retired tennis icon months ago and sees Agassi as more of a mentor.

After their brief stint on the practice courts, Rune told the ATP: “It was a really short period but definitely he gave me an insight of where he sees me in the future, where he sees me now and obviously there's a lot of things to improve.

“He helped me to get my focus and my eyes on the right things, together with my coach Lars. It was really cool to spend some days with him.”

Sinner has yet to announce who his replacement fitness trainer and physiotherapist will be after parting ways with Panichi and Badio. Ahead of Wimbledon, the Italian confirmed they had split after the ATP 500 in Halle, where he suffered a shock loss in the round of 16.

“No, nothing major happened. Nothing big happened. I parted ways not long ago, but it's not affecting me. I feel ready to compete. I feel free. I feel me and my team, we are ready to do the best we can,” he said.

“As I said, there's not one specific thing. Nothing crazy happened. That's for sure not. As I said, we made some great work. For me, the final in Roland Garros was an amazing achievement. That's it. Look, in this sport, things can happen. There is nothing incredible, no, because sometimes a player feels something different, and that's my case.”

Harvest mice are Britain's tiniest rodent. They're not considered pests themselves, and in fact are actually seen as pest control; they prey on agricultural pests, saving farmers on pesticides. They also take their place in the food chain, supporting predators like hawks and owls, which supports overall biodiversity.

The mice's habitats are increasingly being infringed upon by human development. In order to provide them a safe place to live, British conservation consortium The Wildlife Trusts provides readymade nests for them—by cutting holes in tennis balls donated by Wimbledon:

 

The balls are attached to poles that are placed in field. The mice, talented climbers, readily populate them.





Wimbledon goes through some 55,000 tennis balls with each competition, so unlike Britain's human denizens, the harvest mice will suffer no housing crisis.

...

If you ever wondered what happens to the thousands of tennis balls used during Wimbledon after the championships are over, you can rest assured that they're going to a good cause.

In a heartwarming twist to the iconic tennis championships, organizers have donated many of the tennis balls to serve as shelters for field mice in the UK.

While many of the balls make their way to England's field mice, Wimbledon also sells some of its used tennis balls on-site at the tournament. The proceeds typically benefit the Wimbledon Foundation.

The eco-friendly mice initiative, which many fans don't know about, has supported British wildlife for years.

Tiny Harvest mice across the pond, which are about the size of a thumb, typically lived in tall grass in the countryside for protection against predators. However, they've faced habitat loss over the years due to industrial farming methods and changes in weather patterns making a it a concern for conservationists.

In the early 2000s, Wimbledon organizers entered into a partnership with the All England Lawn Tennis Club and Wildlife Trust to help get the balls repurposed into homes for the tiny critters.

The tennis balls are attached to poles with a small hole cut into them, making it a perfectly ready-made shelter for the mammals, especially for nesting females.

It's not just a win for wildlife, but also a small gesture that can have a big impact.

The sight of a harvest mouse peeking its head out of a bright ball has become a charming symbol of how major sporting events can make a big serve, not just on the scoreboard.

Wimbledon may be known for fierce competition on the court, however, the fuzzy yellow tennis balls turned into mouse mansions have social media abuzz.

After several photos of the repurposed mouse homes went viral on X, fans started raving about the eco-conscious initiative calling it the ""cutest sustainability story of the summer.""

One user wrote on X, ""This is the sweetest idea! Look how happy they are!""

""This is so cool,"" another person wrote.

""From Centre Court to mouse resort Wimbledon's real champions might be the harvest mice,"" a third person said.

""Turning tennis balls into mouse shelters—ingenious! Who would've thought tennis balls could serve as 'real estate' for mice? That's creativity in action,"" another person commented.

""My day is happier now that I learned this,"" someone else wrote.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=wimbledon+tennis","Jessica Pegula gave Iga Swiatek grass-court 'pep talk' days before Wimbledon","https://www.tennis365.com/news/jessica-pegula-reveals-key-change-iga-swiatek-made-helped-win-wimbledon","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:07:08 GMT","

Jessica Pegula says that she has ‘processed' her Wimbledon upset ‘pretty fast', revealing that she recognised a crucial improvement in Iga Swiatek's game during their recent grass-court clash.

The American's most recent match was a first-round Wimbledon clash against former world No 29 Elisabetta Cocciaretto, being shocked 6-2, 6-3 in just 58 minutes.

Pegula is now due to face off with former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the second round of the WTA 500 event in Washington.

“Yeah, I mean, it's (the Wimbledon loss) disappointing, but it was almost like I got killed, like, so bad that you're kind of just like, okay, just flush that one and move on,” said Pegula.

“There's not much to really say or do. It was a bad match for me, but at the same time, she played great and it was a great moment for her.

“So I feel like I always try to look at things with a good perspective that sometimes it's not always your moment. Sometimes it's the other person's moment.

“I mean, I have had it be my moment quite a bit, so I think I tried to look at that with that perspective that it wasn't the week for me, and I just want to take as much as I can and what I have learned from that match and kind of incorporate that into the couple of weeks. But again, it's not like rewriting the wheel and having to change a bunch of things just because of one match.

“You know, so I think I processed it pretty fast. The good thing is I was able to be home and get two really solid weeks at home before coming on the hard-court swing. It was really nice being home and spending time with my family and getting in a good training block.”

The loss at the grass-court Grand Slam was even more surprising given that Pegula had lifted the trophy at the WTA 500 tournament in Bad Homburg just a few days prior, defeating Iga Swiatek 6-4, 7-5 to cap off an excellent week of tennis.

Ultimately, it was the Pole who lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish at Wimbledon to claim her sixth Grand Slam – her first title since the French Open in 2024.

The world No 4 was particularly impressed by Swiatek's serving during their Bad Homburg meeting, something which translated well at SW19.

“I thought she was serving a lot bigger [at Bad Homburg],” analysed Pegula.

“I didn't really watch her much during Wimbledon. I'm not sure if that was better. But she was serving really big in Bad Homburg and playing good tennis and beat good grass-court players. I thought our final was a really high level. It was super close.

“You know, she is always kind of down on herself about grass, and I was, like, Hey, you're playing really good on grass. I'm not really sure why you think you're bad on grass or what it is.

“So it was kind of funny that she ended up winning Wimbledon. I was, like, of course I said that, and we had that moment and we played in the final, and then she wins Wimbledon, but that's just tennis for you. You kind of never know. She's a great player anyway, so she's going to be good on any surface.

“But yeah, it is interesting for — tennis is weird. You have a lot of weird things that happen over the course of two weeks.”

The Citi DC Open undoubtedly holds a special place in Pegula's heart, being the site of her first singles title.

In 2019, whilst ranked as the world No 79, dominated Camila Giorgi 6-2, 6-2 in the showpiece match – launching her closer to the WTA's top 50.

“It was a huge breakthrough for me as a player,” Pegula reminisced.

“It was the first professional title I had ever won. I never even won a challenger singles title.

“So for me, getting that monkey off my back, being able to do it at a tour level for the first time was great, and to think that was such a big mountain for me to climb at the time and now I'm sitting here and I have won, I don't know, eight or nine or whatever it is, and doubles titles, as well, it's kind of funny how things can seem far away, but once you do them it becomes easier, it's less of a mountain to get over.

“But it definitely was a really fun week for me here, and I still feel like I have those memories every time I come back. I know so many of the volunteers and the people that work this tournament, from the security to the transport that have seen me and helped me over all the last four or five, whatever I'm on, six years ago? Over the last six years.

“So it's been really cool, and I still have that same kind of feeling every time I come back here, and that's why I always feel like I can play good tennis here and have some good results. So, yeah, I love coming back here.”

The American will be hoping to build her hard-court form ahead of the US Open, with her highlights at the Grand Slam being a quarter-final appearance in 2022 and a final showing in 2024.

                Iga Swiatek has been branded ""the best player this century.""            


                Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner may want the story around their failed drug tests to be forgotten, but it has been revived after their Wimbledon wins.            


                The Brit will have a prime opportunity to avenge her loss from two months ago.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa have withdrawn from the star-studded doubles event at the US Open next month.

An updated entry list has been unveiled, with Tsitsipas and Badosa one of two pairs to have quietly pulled out.

British No.1 Jack Draper and Qinwen Zheng are also no longer on the list, with both players suffering from recent injuries. 

But the popular duo, often nicknamed 'Tsitsidosa', are the main ones to stand out after deciding to no longer feature.

Their withdrawal will only increase rumours of the couple splitting up, following reports during Wimbledon. 

Fans spotted that they had unfollowed each other on Instagram and posts of them together had been deleted.

Tsitipas and Badosa had been considered a tennis 'power couple' and first started dating in 2023. 

However, only a day after both of them were beaten in the opening round at Wimbledon, reports of a break-up swirled. 

HOLA.com said that sources have confirmed their split, with one saying: ""The break-up just happened. They both lost in the first round in London and everything has come together for them.""

The women's World No.10 and men's World No.29 will now not be taking part in the revamped US Open doubles event. 

Badosa is also said to be carrying an ongoing injury issue, which could potentially be a reason for their withdrawal.

There has been no official confirmation of why they pulled out, but both players remain on the singles entry list.

Tsitsipas has a poor record at major tournaments this year heading into the US Open, only winning once in 2025.

The Greek star was openly criticised by his coach at SW19 and he will want a major improvement at Flushing Meadows.

Meanwhile, alongside a quick exit at Wimbledon, Badosa failed to make it past the round of 32 at Roland Garros after reaching the semi-finals at the Australian Open.

It will be all eyes on the singles for both stars now, following their withdrawal from the doubles competition.

The US Open Mixed Doubles Championship will be staged across two days in New York City, beginning on August 19. 

A total of 16 teams will compete for a $1million prize.

Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu are the standout pairing, with Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner playing with Emma Navarro.

Novak Djokovic is teaming up with Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek joins Casper Ruud and Taylor Fritz plays with Elena Rybakina.

Women's World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka will feature with Grigor Dimitrov and Jessica Pegula combines with Tommy Paul.

Nick Kyrgios is planning to return to action too, pairing up with Naomi Osaka for the event in New York.

After two teams pulled out, there have also been some new names added to the entry list. 

Amanda Anisimova and Holger Rune will pair up, while couple Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur will play together too.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+open+tennis","Two superstar mixed doubles teams have now withdrawn from the US Open event after the full entry list is announced","https://www.thetennisgazette.com/news/two-superstar-mixed-doubles-teams-have-now-withdrawn-from-the-us-open-event-after-the-full-entry-list-is-announced/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:00:00 GMT","

The controversial US Open mixed doubles event continues to be changed after the full entry list has been announced.

This year has seen the US Open completely overhaul the mixed doubles event, giving priority to singles players instead of doubles specialists.

Singles players getting priority is not the only change that they have made, with the US Open being heavily criticised for what they have done.

Despite the backlash, the US Open initially announced a blockbuster lineup of mixed doubles teams, but two of those have now withdrawn after the full entry list has been announced.

Some of the standout pairings in the initial announcement of mixed doubles teams were Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, as well as Jack Draper and Qinwen Zheng.

However, one of those teams has now been removed from the entry list after withdrawing.

After undergoing surgery, Olympic champion Zheng has officially withdrawn from the US Open, consequently calling an end to any hopes of her playing alongside Draper in New York.

Both members of that team are currently struggling due to injury, with Draper also withdrawing from two upcoming tournaments due to an arm problem.

They are not the only team to have withdrawn from the event, with Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa also pulling out.

Although Badosa has recently struggled with injury issues, it appears that there may be another reason for this withdrawal.

Tsitsipas and Badosa were in a romantic relationship for nearly two years, but it has recently been reported that they have now parted ways and this seems to be the more likely reason for them pulling out of the US Open.

While these two teams have exited the US Open mixed doubles draw, there have also been 11 additions to the entry list.

These new teams include Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova and Holger Rune, Venus Williams and Reilly Opelka, as well as a remaining tennis couple in Alex de Minaur and Katie Boulter.

There are now 25 teams in the lineup for the US Open mixed doubles event next month, but only 16 of them will actually be able to play.

The 16 teams for the US Open mixed doubles event this year are decided in two ways, eight through their combined singles ranking and the other eight will be through wildcards given by the tournament.

Currently the top ranked doubles team is Sinner and Navarro, with a combined ranking of just 12.

Although the ATP world number one should safely be into the US Open mixed doubles draw, Aryna Sabalenka currently sits in ninth place alongside her currently injured partner Grigor Dimitrov.

There is still a month to go until the US Open mixed doubles event takes place, with rankings still expected to change in that time.

The US Open mixed doubles event will take place on August 19-20.","{'href': 'https://www.thetennisgazette.com', 'title': 'The Tennis Gazette'}","tennis"

The U.S. Open returns to Queens in less than a month with a few notable changes this year.

One of the biggest updates is the schedule. The mixed doubles tournament will take place earlier than usual, and the singles tournaments will start a day earlier.

Meanwhile, the United States Tennis Association has plans to transform the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, including major renovations to Arthur Ashe Stadium and the Players Center.

Nicole Kankam, the USTA's managing director of pro tennis marketing and entertainment, joined “Mornings On 1” Tuesday to preview what's ahead for the Open.

Argentine Francisco Comesana overcame rainy conditions and American Tristan Boyer to advance at the Generali Open in Kitzbühel on Monday. Seeded at an ATP Tour event for the second time, the seventh seed Comesana fought off Boyer 6-3, 7-6(1) to reach the second round. 

Comesana's opening-round clash with Boyer was suspended for approximately four hours after inclement weather closed in, with the Argentine leading 5-2. The 24-year-old returned to court and secured his 12th match win of the season, already three times as many tour-level wins he earned in 2024. Comesana, No. 73 in the PIF ATP Rankings, next faces Arthur Cazaux or Ignacio Buse.

Formula 1 on track to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with 26% reduction in carbon footprint

Road car vs. F1 car: The driver | Aramco

Who will come out on top between Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris? Former McLaren driver David Coulthard has his say…

David Coulthard is relishing the fight between McLaren team mates Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris so far this season, making comparisons to the 2021 title race and the years he spent alongside Mika Hakkinen at McLaren.

After 12 of 24 scheduled Grands Prix, Piastri leads Norris by the slender margin of eight points – equivalent to a sixth-place finish – in the Drivers' Championship standings, having won five races to his team mate's four.

Ahead of the campaign resuming at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, Coulthard praised Piastri for holding the edge but likened the situation to Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton's pulsating scrap four years ago.

“If it was half a World Championship, Oscar's won,” stated Coulthard, who made 246 starts in the top echelon, scoring 13 wins, 62 podiums and more than 500 points.

“I don't think anyone could say he hasn't deserved to be leading – he was leading before [the McLarens] came together in Canada. But if Lando turns it around in the second half of the season, he's doing it against someone that's a talented third year F1 driver.

“It's a bit like 2021, where some people are still so vocal about what happened… only one driver could win. Both Max and Lewis drove like World Champions that year, but only one of them could have the title.”

Referencing how the intra-team fight has been managed so far, Coulthard continued: “I think McLaren have handled it really well. I think both their drivers are on the tamer side of animal than the wilder side of animal, so that probably makes it a little bit easier.

“But this could also be their only chance to win a world title; we don't know what 2026 brings, we don't know what the future is, so you've got to seize the moment.

“That's why I'm really impressed with how Oscar has stepped up this year. But Lando's response over the last two races is showing his quality as well. I think it's going to be one of those things where both of them deserve it, but only one can get it.”

Coulthard added that he had long been braced for the aforementioned clash between Norris and Piastri in Canada, drawing on his own experience alongside Hakkinen at McLaren from 1996 to 2001, which included several flashpoints.

“I predicted the coming together, because I've been there and done that – I crashed into Mika, he crashed into me,” said the Scot, who memorably collected his team mate on the first lap of the 1999 Austrian Grand Prix.

“It's always going to be the case that no matter how tight a team is, once you have the intensity of both drivers having a chance to win, then that's going to get more and more complicated.”

While McLaren are in a strong position in both championships, Coulthard has not yet ruled out Verstappen and Red Bull getting back in the mix – the Dutchman sitting 69 points adrift of Piastri as things stand.

“You can't rule Max out,” Coulthard argued, while lauding Verstappen's stellar Qualifying effort at Silverstone last time out. “I think for the championship, we all know it's going to take an upgrade to unlock some performance.

“Where Red Bull are right now, and if they were frozen, it's difficult to imagine that the second half of the season circuits are suddenly going to suit the Red Bull better than the first half.

“It will take an upgrade from Red Bull to give him the consistency. Are they capable of doing it? Absolutely. Have they done it before? Yes. Is Max exceptional? Absolutely.”

Formula 1 on track to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with 26% reduction in carbon footprint

Road car vs. F1 car: The driver | Aramco

After two weekends off, F1 heads to Spa with plenty to look forward to in the 2025 Belgian Grand Prix.

After a mini-break between races, the final part of the season before the summer shutdown features a double-header, starting with one of the sport's most iconic venues. While the drivers will be looking forward to getting out on track at Spa-Francorchamps, there have been a few developments since the paddock was last together…

The 2025 Belgian Grand Prix will be the first F1 race weekend that Red Bull have taken part in without Christian Horner as their Team Principal.

Horner was relieved of his operational responsibilities as both Team Principal and CEO just three days after the British Grand Prix, with the 52-year-old telling the team it came as a surprise. Under Horner, Red Bull won eight drivers' championships and six constructors' titles, but it looks increasingly unlikely that they will add to either of those tallies this year.

Moving forward, it is former Racing Bulls Team Principal Laurent Mekies who has been tasked with arresting a slide that saw Red Bull go from one of the most dominant campaigns ever in 2023 to now sitting fourth in the standings.

While the news came as a surprise to Horner, it also caught out many within the paddock who were not expecting such a significant change at the top of Red Bull at this point of the year, and Spa-Francorchamps will be the first opportunity to hear from both Mekies and Max Verstappen – as well as many of Horner's former peers in charge of other teams – on the impact of the move.

The last race at Silverstone did little to dampen speculation surrounding Max Verstappen's future at Red Bull, and the change in Team Principal will only add to the intrigue.

When Red Bull were enjoying their most dominant year in 2023, Verstappen spoke of the importance of keeping the team together and key personnel in place to continue that run. Since then, a number of big names have departed, with Horner becoming the latest just two weeks ago.

There were questions to both Horner and Verstappen about links between the four-time world champion and Mercedes, with Horner stating that Red Bull would one day have to plan for life without their star driver. Based on current contracts, that's not meant to be until 2028, but it hasn't stopped discussions from taking place to understand future options.

If anyone had been expecting the gap between races to just quieten the talk around Verstappen and Mercedes, then they were betting against the internet, where fans were tracking jets and yachts associated with both Verstappen and Toto Wolff. According to their movements, there's a high chance the pair were in the same town in Sardinia at the same time…

Whether that's just coincidental – Sardinia being a beautiful place to go for a short break – or led to any meeting remains to be seen, but both sides are sure to be asked about it in Belgium.

It might be nearly three weeks since we last went racing, but what a story it was at the end of the British Grand Prix when Nico Hulkenberg finally secured the first podium of his Formula 1 career.

The German was able to enjoy some pretty spectacular celebrations in the Sauber garage after the race, and then similarly was welcomed home to a party by friends and family, before a further marking of the moment at the Sauber headquarters in Switzerland.

On the latter point, it's worth remembering that was Sauber's first podium for 13 years, and also continued some clear progress for the team after impressive car developments. They brought an upgrade to the Spanish Grand Prix and since that point have scored 35 points, making them the fourth-highest scoring team in the past four races.

Can they keep that run going at Spa-Francorchamps, or will the gap in events allow rivals to bring more performance to their own cars and fight back?

Ferrari have yet to win in 2025 but they have certainly been trending in the right direction in recent races, with the team finishing with at least one car in the top five in every race since Imola, where they brought an upgrade to their car.

That upgrade, however, was not the main item that Ferrari have been working on. There have been incremental gains, but there has also been a focus on the rear suspension that they have been hoping will address some of the handling and set-up issues that both Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton have been having to fight with this year.

A filming day at Mugello last week was the second of Ferrari's two permitted promotional events this year, and offered a valuable opportunity to try and make further progress. If they have developed new parts that unlock more potential from the SF-25, then Ferrari could well be a threat for victories in the second half of the season.

And even if there isn't a clear step forward, or more work needs to be done, the signs have still been positive of late, with three podiums in the last five races and Ferrari starting to take hold of second place in the Constructors' Championship, despite having to play catch-up following the double-DNF in China.

There's something special about watching Formula 1 cars attacking Spa-Francorchamps, a circuit that retains such a sense of history.

Beautifully winding its way through the Ardennes, the track is a major challenge due to the need to balance both top speed with the high downforce needs of the middle sector. Not to mention the iconic corners such as Eau Rouge and Raidillon, Pouhon and Blanchimont.

It's a track that can provide plenty of drama due to the ability to overtake and the propensity for rain to impact the weekend, with the circuit perhaps the best example of a venue where it can be raining in one sector and completely dry in another.

To add to the action this weekend, Spa-Francorchamps will also be host to a Sprint for only the second time, and the first occasion delivered a Sprint that took place in wet conditions, before a Grand Prix that was dry. A lap of Spa is special enough on its own, but even more racing action has got to be a good thing.

Formula 1 on track to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with 26% reduction in carbon footprint

Road car vs. F1 car: The driver | Aramco

With just eight points separating Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris at the halfway mark of the 2025 season, F1.com takes a look back at how other close titles battle at the midway point played out during the rest of the campaign.

The 2025 World Championship is very much all to play for as we arrive at the halfway point of the campaign, with Lando Norris' victory at the British Grand Prix bringing the gap to leader Oscar Piastri down to just eight points. This is not the first time that we have witnessed such a duel at the midway stage – but how did those close title battles of the past play out? F1.com has been taking a look back…

Jody Scheckter had four wins under his belt from a three-year spell with Tyrrell when he joined the newly-formed Wolf team in 1977. Things quickly got off to a strong start, with Scheckter winning the squad's first-ever race at the season-opening Argentine Grand Prix.

Three more podiums and another victory followed during the first half of the campaign, meaning that Scheckter led Ferrari's Niki Lauda – competing in his first full season since his fiery accident at the 1976 German Grand Prix – by just one point in the championship standings after Round 8 of 17.

However, the South African only won one more race in the second portion of the season and, though there were still several points finishes, Lauda fared better, so much so that the Austrian wrapped up the title with two races to spare.

Lauda opted to skip those two Grands Prix and walk away from Ferrari. Scheckter, meanwhile, ended the campaign 17 points adrift of Lauda but would go on to become a World Champion with the Scuderia himself in 1979.

After Mercedes aced the introduction of turbo-hybrid regulations in 2014, the championship became a primarily intra-team battle between the squad's drivers in the years that followed. Lewis Hamilton had beaten Nico Rosberg in both 2014 and 2015 – but Rosberg appeared determined to change that when 2016 kicked off.

The German driver embarked on a winning streak as the campaign got underway, racking up four consecutive victories across the opening races. However, following his infamous collision with Hamilton at Round 5 in Spain, the latter then also took a number of wins, meaning that Hamilton was just one point behind his team mate after Round 10 of 21.

Hamilton's prospects of claiming his fourth World Championship took a hit at Race 16 in Malaysia, where an engine failure forced him to retire and lose a significant amount of points.

And while he went on to win four races back-to-back at the end of the campaign, it was not enough to overturn his deficit to Rosberg, who clinched the title by five points. Rosberg subsequently announced his retirement, while Hamilton would go on to pick up four consecutive championships between 2017 and 2020.

In his fourth F1 campaign – and third for Renault – Alain Prost looked well and truly in the mix for the title in 1983. By Race 7 of 15, the Frenchman was the only multiple winner of the season after taking victories in France and Belgium.

This put him in the lead of the championship – but just one point ahead of 1981 World Champion Nelson Piquet, who had been victorious in front of his home fans at the season-opening Brazilian Grand Prix.

Prost remained on course for his debut title entering into the final round of the season in South Africa, having remained two points clear of Piquet. After starting from P5 on the grid, the French driver worked his way up to P3 during the race.

However, Prost's Renault suffered a turbo failure on Lap 35 of 77, putting him out of the running. A P3 result for Piquet, meanwhile, was enough to secure the Brazilian the second of his three World Championships, ending the season two points clear of Prost.

By the halfway mark of the 1956 season, Ferrari's Peter Collins and Maserati driver Stirling Moss were tied on 11 points apiece at the top of the standings, with Moss' team mate Jean Behra and the other Scuderia car of Juan Manuel Fangio just behind in third and fourth respectively.

The picture would look very different ahead of the eighth and final round of the championship, however, with Moss no longer in contention while Fangio led by eight points from Collins and Behra.

During the title-deciding Italian Grand Prix, Fangio's chances of winning a third consecutive World Championship appeared to be over when he was forced to retire with steering issues – meaning that Collins had the opportunity to seal a debut title.

But an extraordinary gesture from Collins would change that. With this being an era in which drivers were permitted to hand their cars over to their team mates, the Briton gave his challenger to Fangio to complete the race, allowing the Argentinian to finish second and claim the title in the process.

In 2007, Lewis Hamilton missed out on becoming a World Champion in his rookie season by just one point to Kimi Raikkonen. The pair again found themselves battling for the title in the campaign that followed and were tied on 48 points – along with Felipe Massa – after Round 9 of 18.

During the second half of the year, Raikkonen's challenge fell away after a series of DNFs for the Ferrari driver. But his team mate Massa remained in the fight against the McLaren of Hamilton, meaning that the finale in Brazil would decide the victor.

Hamilton was seven points ahead of Massa prior to the race, with Massa able to take the title if Hamilton finished in sixth place or lower. A dramatic Grand Prix then unfolded in which Massa claimed victory and, for a few seconds at least, looked to have won the championship.

But Hamilton – who had been running in P6 – famously overtook Toyota's Timo Glock on the last lap, moving him up into P5 and earning him his debut World Championship by a sole point from Massa.

Formula 1 on track to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with 26% reduction in carbon footprint

Road car vs. F1 car: The driver | Aramco

Jenson Button has given his take on which F1 driver he believes is currently the best on the grid – as well as being the ""most rounded"" ever in the sport.

Jenson Button believes that Max Verstappen is the “most rounded F1 driver that there has ever been”, with the 2009 World Champion suggesting that the Dutchman can “do more with a car than anyone else”.

Since making his debut back in 2015, Verstappen has added his name to the history books by going on to achieve four World Championships, 65 wins, 44 pole positions and 117 podiums to date.

While the Red Bull man has faced a tougher start to 2025 – putting him in third of the Drivers' Standings on 165 points, 69 points adrift of leader Oscar Piastri and 61 behind second-placed Lando Norris – Button feels that Verstappen remains as the best driver currently on the grid.

As such, the Briton was asked during an appearance on The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X about who he saw as the second-best, leading him to give his take on how the McLaren pair compare to Verstappen.

“I think Lando and Oscar are both up there,” Button explained. “They're very different personalities. I think Lando can be his own worst enemy. He's unbelievably quick, but if he makes a tiny mistake… I think he thinks about it too much.

“Oscar is very level-headed. He just wants to go racing, and he wants to drive fast, and he does it very well. And my comments about Max [being the best], yeah, I feel he's the most rounded F1 driver that there has ever been, you know?

“And I know he hasn't won the championships of Lewis [Hamilton]. And I obviously think Lewis is extremely, extremely good and one of the best in the world. But there's just something about Max that he can do something with a car that I don't think anyone else can.”

In terms of knowing Hamilton's abilities, Button raced alongside the seven-time World Champion at McLaren between 2010 and 2012 and was left impressed by how his then team mate could quickly bounce back during a race weekend.

“I was team mates with him for three years, and the talent, the natural ability he has is unbelievable,” said Button. “He would struggle in practice, come to qualify, I'm like, ‘Right, I've got him. I'm going to have him.' And he'd just, bang, put in a lap.

“It just came from nowhere, and I don't know where it came from. So, extreme talent, and obviously the career he's had, I'm not sure anyone's going to beat that, his records. But just thinking about this moment in time, I feel that Max is the one that can do more with a car than anyone else.”

Formula 1 on track to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with 26% reduction in carbon footprint

Road car vs. F1 car: The driver | Aramco

Brad Pitt experienced several tracks on the Formula 1 calendar whilst filming F1 The Movie – but there was one in particular that he felt was ""unbelievable"".

Brad Pitt has revealed the track that he felt was the “highest of highs” after experiencing various circuits on the calendar – both as a driver and spectator – during filming of F1 The Movie.

With much of the motion picture captured during actual Grand Prix weekends, Pitt was able to get a taste of several venues, including Silverstone – where some of the first scenes were filmed – and Abu Dhabi, both tracks that he enjoyed.

However, reflecting on his favourite circuits during an appearance on F1's Beyond The Grid podcast, Pitt cited Belgium's Spa-Francorchamps as a particularly special one.

“I have a real love for Silverstone because we got our footing there and we got to live there for a couple of months – how spoiled are we?” said Pitt. “And then I have a real soft spot for Abu Dhabi because we spent another couple of months there and we finished up the film there.

“But the high of highs? Spa. Oh my god! 4.3 miles, 100-metre elevation change through the woods and the back. The Pouhon corner, it's double [apex]. It's off-camber and you're coming downhill into it. It's such a smooth, graceful feeling.

“And then of course Eau Rouge. We went to the bottom of Eau Rouge. Tim Bampton from F1 took us down to the base of Eau Rouge, and he said, “Turn your backs, just look up the hill and wait”. And the cars come right by the wall.

“Fernando [Alonso] went by, and it literally sucks the air out of your lungs. It is unbelievable. It is unbelievable.”

With Pitt and co-star Damson Idris both getting behind the wheel for the film's driving sequences – in their respective roles as returning driver Sonny Hayes and rookie Joshua Pearce – the actors were able to experience some of the circuits for themselves.

However, Pitt felt that what he was doing did not compare to what he witnessed from watching the F1 drivers on track.

“That was that same weekend we were driving,” he explained of the Spa experience. “I'd been out but I'm not doing what Fernando was doing! When I first saw him flat-out around Copse at Silverstone – it is staggering, it's breathtaking.”

Reflecting back on the experience of filming at Silverstone for the first time at the 2023 British Grand Prix – during which Pitt and Idris stood alongside the drivers for the national anthem before the race – Pitt said: “It's nutty, but it brings an energy to the film itself.

“It's like a race to make sure we get these scenes. We're going to shoot it on the grid. We've embedded ourself in the race weekend. We have to prove ourselves. We will not cock up the programme and slow down the race, and we won't be in anyone's way!

“Damson and I do the national anthem. We turn around, we find ourselves walking with Carlos [Sainz], which was cool – these little accidents that happen. And then we get to the back of the grid and we get two takes for this scene with Tobias [Menzies] and Javier [Bardem].

“The day before, the very first thing we put on film was going out, taking the cars out on our own in front of 100,000 fans on Quali day, and that got my attention.”

Formula 1 on track to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030 with 26% reduction in carbon footprint

Road car vs. F1 car: The driver | Aramco

Have the team from Maranello come up with a suspension solution that will let Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc's SF25s shine?

Ferrari are set to introduce their revised rear suspension at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix, following test sessions at Mugello.

The only obvious visual change is to the forward leg of the upper wishbone, which is now mounted a few centimetres lower than previously. This follows similar changes earlier in the season made by first Mercedes and subsequently McLaren.

The idea of this change – in combination with the anti-dive geometry of the front suspension – is to increase the resistance of the car to changes in its pitch as it is braked or accelerated. In this way, the aero platform of the car becomes more stable and the aerodynamic forces acting upon it become more consistent as a result.

'Smashing Machine' star Dwayne Johnson will make his Lido debut, as will Julia Roberts, appearing on the Venice red carpet for Luca Guadagnino's out-of-competition title 'After the Hunt.' 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Oscar season starts here. 


	With its 2025 line-up, announced Tuesday, the Venice Film Festival has (again) taken the award season pole position, with a program packed with a frankly absurd number of must-see movies. 




	Among the hot awards titles heading to the Lido are Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, from A24, featuring Dwayne Johnson as two‑time UFC heavyweight champion Mark Kerr and Emily Blunt as his wife Dawn; Luca Guadagnino's #MeToo–inspired thriller After the Hunt, for Amazon MGM Studios, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, will premiere out of competition; and Guillermo del Toro's dark reimagining of Frankenstein, featuring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth, a Netflix production.

					Busan Film Festival to Honor Jafar Panahi as Asian Filmmaker of the Year		
			









	This will mark the Venice festival debut for both Roberts and Johnson. 


	Netflix, which sat out Vence last year, is back in force for 2025. Alongside Frankenstein, the streamer has  Noah Baumbach's comedy‑drama Jay Kelly, co-written with Emily Mortimer, and headlined by George Clooney, premiering in competition, and Kathryn Bigelow's ticking bomb geopolitical thriller A House of Dynamite, starring Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Greta Lee, Gabriel Basso, and Jared Harris.


	The Venice line-up is an embarrassment of riches, for award-watchers and regular film fans alike, with the competition selection including the latest from A-list auteurs Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), François Ozon (L'Etranger), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan). A year after Brady Corbet's The Brutalist launched in Venice, en route to three Oscar wins, the film's co-writer (and producer) Mona Fastvold arrives in competition with The Testament of Ann Lee, a historical drama musical film starring Lewis Pullman, Amanda Seyfried, and Tim Blake Nelson, that she co-wrote with Corbet. 

	











The Voice of Hind Rajab, the new film from Four Daughters director Kaouther Ben Hania, is certain to be one of the most talked-about films in Venice this year. The film tells the true story of Hind Rajab, a 6-year-old girl who, on January 29, 2024, was trapped in a car on fire in Gaza. She called Red Crescent emergency workers, who kept her on the line while they tried to get an ambulance to her. The Party Film Sales is handling worldwide sales on the film and co-representing North American rights with CAA Media Finance. 


	Another politically-charged title in competition is Olivier Assayas' The Wizard of the Kremlin, starring Jude Law as Vladimir Putin and Paul Dano as the fictional Kremlin insider Vadim Baranov. 


	Yorgos Lanthimos, a Venice Golden Lion winner for Poor Things, returns in competition with Bugonia, an adaptation of Jang Joon-Hwan's 2003 South Korean sci-fi film Save the Green Planet!, featuring his frequent collaborator Emma Stone. Focus Features will release the film stateside, with Universal Pictures handling internationally outside of Korea, where CJ ENM will release.


	And iconic indie director Jim Jarmusch, a Cannes regular, will bring his latest to the Lido this year, premiering Mubi's Father Mother Sister Brother, a triptych with an all-star ensemble cast including Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Indya Moore, Vicky Krieps, Tom Waits, Luka Sabbat, and Charlotte Rampling.


	The 82nd Venice competition line-up also includes the latest from A-list auteurs Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), François Ozon (L'Etranger), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan)

	











	Italian Oscar-winning Paolo Sorrentino (The Great Beauty) will open this year's festival with La Grazia (Grace), a love story starring his long-time collaborator Toni Servillo. La Grazia, co-starring Diamonds actor Anna Ferzetti, will premiere in competition on Aug. 27. Mubi picked up the film ahead of its Venice bow.


Dog 51, a new action-packed French sci-fi thriller from Bac Nord director Cedric Jimenez will close the festival, out of competition. 


	Gus Van Sant's return to feature films, Dead Man's Wire, starring Bill Skarsgard, will also screen out of competition. Other out-of-competition highlights include Anders Thomas Jensen's Danish dark comedy The Last Viking starring Mads Mikkelsen, Julian Schnabel's long-awaited The Hand of Dante, and Scarlet, the first anime feature in four years from Japanese master Mamoru Hosoda. 


	Venice has selected four TV series for its small-screen sidebar: Etty, a limited series from Israeli showrunner Hagai Levi (In Treatment, The Affair), loosely based on the diary of Dutch Jewish writer Etty Hillesum, starring Julia Windischbauer and Sebastian Koch, which Studio TF1 is selling worldwide; Portobello, the first Italian original production for HBO Max in which Italian director Marco Bellocchio (The Traitor), follows the true story of the downfall of one of Italy's most beloved TV hosts; Studiocanal's A Prophet – The Series, a TV reboot of Jacques Audiard's classic French prison drama from 2009, directed by Enrico Maria Artale; and Il Mostro (The Monster), a true-life serial-killer drama from Gomorrah series director, Stefano Sollima, made for Netflix.

	











	This year's Golden Lion career achievement honorees are legendary German director Werner Herzog (Fitzcarraldo, Grizzly Man) and Vertigo star Kim Novak. 


	Venice's Classic sidebar, which includes a selection on documentaries about cinema, this year includes Mike Figgis' Megadoc, a behind-the-scenes look at Francis Ford Coppola's decades-in-the-making Megalopolis.


	Two-time Oscar-winner Alexander Payne heads up this year's competition jury as president, and together with international film talents including Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, French director Stéphane Brizé, Italian director Maura Delpero, Chinese actress Zhao Tao, and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, will pick the 2025 Golden Lion winner.


	The 2025 Venice film festival runs Aug. 27 to Sept. 9.

Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch in 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps,' joined Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby and Ebon Moss-Bachrach at their film's L.A. premiere. 


							By 

	Kirsten Chuba


Events Editor


The Fantastic Four: First Steps stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach continued their world tour in promotion of the film on Monday, bringing Marvel's First Family to Los Angeles.


The film — set against a backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world — follows Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and The Thing as they defend Earth from Galactus and Silver Surfer.




	On the blue carpet, Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch but previously auditioned for the role of Spider-Man, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the possibility of working with Tom Holland within the MCU, as Spider-Man and Johnny Storm are close friends in the comics.

	“That pairing makes sense to me and I think he's brilliant and I'm up for it,” the actor said. “I think we'd have a laugh. I've never met Tom and I think he's brilliant; his Peter Parker is the best one ever, I think he's our best-ever Spider-Man, so why not? Let's do it, get it moving.”

	Kirby, starring as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, also commented about her journey with the film, as she's currently pregnant with her first child while her character also becomes a mother on screen. 


	“It's a very surreal timing for me. I think the most moving thing for me was that in a big movie like this, Sue spends half the time pregnant, she gives birth and then she has a newborn while facing some huge intergalactic, existential threat to humanity,” Kirby explained. “She's never sidelined and she's absolutely part of it; the fact that she's a mother makes her stronger I think and it taught me so much about how powerful that experience is. As she does in the comics, I really hope that translates.”

	Julia Garner, who plays the much buzzed-about Silver Surfer, joked that the team “made me look a lot cooler than I actually am” with special effects. She continued, “I've never done this kind of acting before and I think it's really important as an actor to try different things and see what works and what doesn't work. I had so much fun making this so it was really exciting and I would definitely do it again.”

Adam Sandler, Anderson Cooper, Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, John Oliver and Andy Cohen were among those who made surprise appearances on Monday's episode after CBS announced that the late-night show would be ending in May 2026.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Stephen Colbert was feeling all the love and support from some of his late-night allies and famous friends on Monday night after it was announced that The Late Show had been canceled.


	“Some people see this show going away as a sign of something truly dire, and while I am a big fan of me, I don't necessarily agree with that statement because we here at The Late Show never saw our job as changing anything other than how you felt at the end of the day, which I think is a worthy goal,” Colbert told his live studio audience during Monday's show, before quipping, “Or rather, changing how you felt the next morning when you watched on your phone, which is why broadcast TV is dying. You're part of the problem. Look in the mirror, OK?”

					Jon Stewart Rages Over Colbert Cancellation In F-Bomb Filled Speech		
			









	The host continued, “Point is I don't want this show to be associated with making you sad or anxious, but since I'm the guy who's going away next year, I'm thinking maybe I'm not the guy to cheer you up. So I thought music, OK, that makes people happy, right?”


	That's when Lin-Manuel Miranda and “Weird Al” Yankovic came out to cheer up the crowd in the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York by singing Coldplay's “Viva la Vida” (the song seemed timely, huh?). The camera then panned to the audience for a Coldplay kiss cam parody, except it featured several more famous faces showing their solidarity to Colbert, including Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Adam Sandler, Christopher McDonald, Last Week Tonight‘s John Oliver, The Tonight Show‘s Jimmy Fallon, Late Night‘s Seth Meyers and The Daily Show‘s Jon Stewart. [Stewart also railed against the cancellation on The Daily Show; while Fallon decried the decision.]

	











	Last week, Colbert and CBS announced that The Late Show would conclude at the end of the 2025-26 season in May next year. The network cited a “financial decision” amid a declining linear TV landscape for the cancellation.


	At the taping of Thursday's show last week, the host told the live audience that he was informed of the decision to end The Late Show the night before, drawing boos from the audience.


	Earlier on Monday night, during his monologue, Colbert also addressed people who “have been speculating about the timing of this decision from Paramount.”


	“They're pointing out that last Monday, just two days before my cancellation, I delivered a blistering monologue in which I showed the courage to have a mustache,” he joked (as he actually slammed Paramount in the monologue in question over their 16 million settlement with President Donald Trump). “I mean, obviously, CBS saw my upper lip and boom, canceled. Coincidence? Oh, I think not. This is worse than fascism. This is stache-ism.”


	The show's cancellation announcement comes as David Ellison's Skydance Media is currently in the process of acquiring Paramount Global, which is the parent company of CBS. However, the deal is still pending FCC approval, more than a year after the proposed merger was announced. Earlier this month, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from Trump, who sued over former Vice President Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interview. Sources previously told The Hollywood Reporter that Paramount believes the lawsuit posed a threat to Skydance's deal to acquire the company, as it seeks approval by the FCC under the Trump administration.

	











	While Colbert has previously criticized the settlement on The Late Show, CBS said in a statement that it wasn't a factor in the decision to end the show. 


	“Over the weekend, somebody at CBS followed up their gracious press release with a gracious anonymous leak saying they pulled the plug on our show because of losses pegged between $40 million and $50 million a year,” Colbert later said during his monologue. “Forty million is a big number. I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million? Oh yeah.”


	Following the news last week, Trump also took to his Truth Social platform to positively gloat about the series being canceled, writing, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! [Fox News late night host] Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”


	On Monday's show, Colbert clapped back at Trump, saying, “How dare you, sir? Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism? Go fuck yourself,” drawing cheers from his live audience. They also broke out in a chant, yelling, “Stephen! Stephen! Stephen!”


	As for Trump's claim that Colbert's ABC counterpart “is next,” Colbert said, “Nope, absolutely not, Kimmel. I am the martyr. There's only room for one on this cross, and I've gotta tell you, the view is fantastic from up here. I can see your house!”

	











	Trump went after Colbert and the late-night brethren again on Tuesday morning, posting to Truth Social, “The word is, and it's a strong word at that, Jimmy Kimmel is NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes and, shortly thereafter, Fallon will be gone. These are people with absolutely NO TALENT, who were paid Millions of Dollars for, in all cases, destroying what used to be GREAT Television.”


	Colbert has hosted The Late Show since 2015, after taking it over from David Letterman, who launched The Late Show in 1993.

The 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's ""Press 3"" option was shut down on July 17.


							By

Associate Editor


Jim Parsons is blasting President Donald Trump‘s administration for shutting down one of the nation's crisis hotlines, which offered tailored support for LGBTQ youth and young adults.


The Big Bang Theory star made a recent appearance on MSNBC's The Weekend, where he criticized the decision to end the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's LGBTQ service on July 17.




	“I think it's quite literally criminal,” Parsons said. “It's one of the kinds of decisions that you're like, ‘There's no good reason for it.' It doesn't matter what reason you ever put towards it or say it's the reason it's happening, it's never going to be justified.”

	The openly gay actor, who is married to Todd Spiewak, continued, “It is only hurtful and it feels like it's only being done in order to make a point, we're getting rid of this because we want to make sure certain people understand they're not welcome here.”


	According to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the LGBTQ youth program served more than 1.4 million callers since it launched in September 2022. Callers now don't have the option to “Press 3” for specialized LGBTQ support.


	SAMHSA wrote in a statement after it was announced that the Trump administration would be shutting down the specialized service, “Everyone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress. Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.”

Scale, collaborations and specialism are key ingredients that she and her team are betting on, Kate Ward, managing director, Unscripted Productions at BBC Studios Productions, tells THR.

The Americas, narrated by Tom Hanks, on NBC. [Stanley] Tucci in Italy on National Geographic. Walking With Dinosaurs, narrated by Bertie Carvel (The Crown, HBO's upcoming Harry Potter series), on PBS. These series are just the latest star-studded factual offerings from BBC Studios Productions, one of the British and global media industry's most respected production outfits that is part of BBC Studios, the main commercial arm of U.K. public broadcaster BBC, that have taken the U.S. by storm.


	Of course, there has also been Prehistoric Planet, executive produced by Jon Favreau, and OceanXplorers with James Cameron. And there is more to come involving big names, as Disney has unveiled that National Geographic has greenlit a new documentary series under the working title Meet the Planets, that is being developed by Ryan Reynolds' Maximum Effort and BBC Studios.

	Bottom line: Shows from BBC Studios Productions, which includes the world-renowned Natural History Unit, the Documentary Unit, the Science Unit, wholly owned label Voltage, and third-party distribution relationships, regularly feature Hollywood creatives and do well on U.S. screens, as well as worldwide.


	And they have just received six Primetime Emmy nominations and 11 Daytime Emmy nominations. Secrets of the Neanderthals and The Secret Lives of Animals are nominated for the latter. In terms of Primetime Emmy nominees, The Americas are in the running for the Outstanding Narrator Award for Hanks and the Outstanding Music Composition for a Documentary Series or Special Emmy for Hans Zimmer. Tucci in Italy is up for the honors for outstanding hosted non-fiction series or special and outstanding cinematography. And Planet Earth – Asia was nominated in the Outstanding Music Composition for a Documentary Series or Special category and Outstanding Narrator for Attenborough.

	











	But what is the recipe for factual success at BBC Studios Productions? Key ingredients are scale and breadth, collaborations and partnerships, and specialism, or craft, Kate Ward, managing director, Unscripted Productions at BBC Studios Productions, tells THR.


	“I think that factual programming is really having a moment, and we're really seeing that moment,” she argues. “Big dramas have incredible power and zeitgeist and are, obviously, a huge part of the ecosystem. But what factual does as a genre is that we really passionately believe it's there to change perspectives and start conversations. And because it hasn't always been at the front of the schedule in the U.S., when it does, it feels really special.”


	Take The Americas, for example. “We hope it's giving Americans a shared view of the natural world of life on their doorstep, sometimes at the end of their street, which in a world that can feel fragmented and challenging is something that brings people together,” Ward argues. “Bringing people together is something that is core to our values and our mission at the BBC.”


	So, how is her unscripted team at BBC Studios trying to succeed in a crowded marketplace? First, “we're excited about the scale and the variety of work we're doing for the U.S. market,” Ward shares. “Our shows represent a range of different styles of factual programming for a range of different broadcasters with a range of different models.”

	











	In terms of the scale of productions, she lauds BBC Studios' “unmatched ambition” and ability to pull off “epic” shows. “If you look at The Americas, for example, it took five years to make 180 filming expeditions,” she explains. “So, we are working at epic proportions in terms of production. How many protein bars did the team have to eat over five years to make this show? As a result, you get that infectious curiosity that just draws you in as a viewer.”


	The second ingredient of success is expertise. “We can bring the specialism, the craft we are known for,” to ensure high-quality programming, Ward explains. “Walking With Dinosaurs can bring real value and an education for children and adults. It's rooted in real science. So it is entertainment and education together, and I think that means it can reach a really, really large audience.”


	Finally, Ward says it's about collaborations with creatives, producers and distribution partners rather than going it alone. “Creators bring their own way of storytelling, ambition, passion, and together, we can do extraordinary things. We also have deep partnerships producers, with platforms and broadcasters, from our long-standing, unbelievably special relationship with PBS that we value so deeply to NBC and Universal Television Alternative Studio (UTAS), which was a great experience for us. We also have a whole range of programming for National Geographic and Disney, and we have done great work with the likes of Apple and Netflix.” 

	











	Strong relationships not only give existing shows a good audience platform but can, of course, also lead to the development of further shows, and shows that stand out, she argues. “These deep collaborative relationships help us shape and do new things for the U.S. market that's really distinctive,” concludes Ward.


	Now, how about those Hollywood stars collaborating with the BBC. “We're working with a range of amazing Hollywood talent – actors, directors, auteurs,” she tells THR. “Why have these people, often known for their fictional work, been drawn to the factual genre? I believe it's because it allows them to explore the subjects about which they're genuinely passionate and to innovate in a different way of storytelling than they do in their other work, which may predominantly be in scripted. We're super excited about that melding of worlds and that sharing of experience.”


	How does BBC Studios attract such big names in the always-fierce battle for talent? “It's about storytellers, trust and mutual respect,” Ward tells THR. “I believe that they are coming to the BBC, because we have the trust, the legacy, the consistent quality, and the specialism that we have built over the years. “That is really, really important and critical when we're working with other storytellers.”


	For BBC Studios Productions, working with famous personalities with a shared passion, along with fan appeal and bases, is key too, not least to give series the desired broad reach. But importantly, the creative collaborators must make real sense – or viewers will smell a rat. “We're looking for those meaningful connections and that creativity,” Ward explains. “But it is important to approach this through the lens of two storytellers coming together in true partnership, and it always has to be authentic.”

	











	Take Tucci, for example. “Stanley is an incredible storyteller, and to be part of that storyteller's journey through Italy, which he is passionate about, is so exciting, and we're so proud of what we were able to create together,” Ward says. “Or when you think about Tom Hanks' role on The Americas: Tom's passion for the subject really shines through. If that wasn't the case, the audience would know the difference.” 


	In other words: you couldn't just take a random famous face and attach it to a BBC Studios Productions documentary or other factual series without a real interest or connection. “This is factual programming. So, there have got to be real, authentic, passionate connections to the subjects, storytellers who immerse you and take you on that journey,” Ward explains. “These storytellers can start those conversations, change perceptions, take you to worlds and times that you didn't know about. So, we will always be looking for that authenticity and that connection between us and storytellers in a creative partnership.” 


	Thanks to BBC Studios, U.S. audiences, along with British and global viewers, have also fallen in love with such British voices as the legendary naturalist David Attenborough and historian Lucy Worsley (Lucy Worsley's Holmes vs. Doyle). “She also brings that authentic connection,” highlights Ward. “Lucy is so popular in America, and she does it so brilliantly.”


	Ward vows to continue on the path of bringing factual hits to the U.S. and the world. “Scale, specialism, and collaboration are part of the secret sauce of how we're approaching the business,” she tells THR. “And we feel super privileged to be able to bring those together and provide a melding of creativity and what that does for people who love factual storytelling or find it. That is a really, really powerful and exciting proposition.”

Whoops!


													By
												

	Hannah Dailey



	Abracadabra! For her latest trick, Lady Gaga demonstrated for fans how to recover like a pro after a stumble, jumping right back up after slipping and falling in the middle of a Mayhem Ball concert in Las Vegas over the weekend.


	As captured in videos from the performance, Gaga temporarily lost her balance while walking in the alleyway between her stage and the fans gathered on the floor of T-Mobile Arena. Just seconds prior, a cameraman filming her appeared to trip as well, and the Grammy winner helped him adjust the aim of his lens before continuing to walk.

	











	Moments later, however, Gaga — wearing a hooded cloak while performing “Vanish Into You” — also dropped to the floor of the venue. But before you could blink, she jumped right back up to her feet and continued moving toward the Little Monsters waiting for her at the pit barricade.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Aside from the singer's small slip, the Mayhem Ball tour has kicked off without a hitch. Gaga opened the trek July 16 in Vegas, playing a total of three shows at T-Mobile Arena. She'll next make stops in San Fransisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City.


	The tour comes in support of Gaga's critically acclaimed 2024 album, Mayhem, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The project was her seventh to reach the chart's summit over the course of her career.

	











	And though mid-show snafus are hardly ideal, Gaga is in good company when it comes to people who have taken a tumble in concert. Last year, Olivia Rodrigo kept plugging away after falling through a hole in her stage, while Madonna laughed it off after one of her dancers dropped her during a show. More recently, Beyoncé played it cool when her flying car prop stopped working during a Cowboy Carter stop in Houston, and Katy Perry persevered when her own levitating set piece malfunctioned in the middle of a number.

Shakira and The Weeknd will headline the 2025 Global Citizen Festival on the Great Lawn in New York's Central Park on Sept. 27. The show hosted by Global Citizen ambassador Hugh Jackman will also feature performances from Tyla, Ayra Starr and Mariah the Scientist, with more participants to be announced soon.

	











	This year's Global Citizen festival campaign is focused on providing energy access to one million people across Africa, according to a release, an effort that aims to provide access to quality education and football — in partnership with FIFA — for 30,000 children around the world. In addition, the campaign will look to “mobilize $200 million to protect 30 million hectares of the Amazon rainforest, and registering 40,000 New Yorkers to volunteer across the city.”


	Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival are free and can be earned by taking action on these issues on the Global Citizen app or here.

	“I'm honored to headline the incredible Global Citizen Festival in Central Park this September,” said Shakira in a statement. “Music has always been my way of connecting with people and leaving a mark on the world. I can't wait to perform, unite, and inspire action.” 


	Jackman added, “The 2025 Global Citizen Festival marks my eleventh year as host, and I'm thrilled by the progress we've made over the years. The growing impact of the Global Citizen movement touches every corner of the world, and I'm eager to advocate alongside my fellow ambassadors, performers, world leaders, and private sector executives to leave the world better than we found it.”

	











	Global Citizen was one of the co-producers behind the first-ever FIFA Club World Cup halftime show on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey featuring Doja Cat, J Balvin, Tems and Coldplay with Emmanuel Kelly.

This isn't the first time the former Fox News host has taken issue with J.Lo.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Apparently Megyn Kelly isn't planning to go to a Jennifer Lopez concert anytime soon.


	On Monday (July 21), the SiriusXM host shared a clip from a recent J.Lo concert — as the pop star makes her way across Europe for the Up All Night: Live in 2025 tour — that shows Lopez dancing suggestively with three male backup dancers to her 2011 Lil Wayne-assisted hit “I'm Into You.”


	“So she's a soft porn star now,” Kelly wrote on X alongside the video, whose original poster had captioned it “55 year old Jennifer Lopez ‘performing.'” Kelly added: “Great choices!”


	Anyone who's seen Lopez perform recently — like when she returned to host the American Music Awards in May and kicked off the show with a choreography-heavy opening number soundtracked by the biggest hits of 2024-25 — knows this performance is nothing new for the singer/actress, long known for her dancing chops and her uninhibited onstage persona. (This is the woman behind the 2014 Billboard Hot 100 top 20 hit “Booty,” after all.)

	











	But it doesn't seem like Kelly has ever counted herself among Lopez's J.Lovers fan base. During her speech at a President Trump victory rally in January, The Megyn Kelly Show host invoked J.Lo's name, saying: “The good news just keeps on coming. I woke up this morning, I was 2 inches taller, a pound thinner and I had skin like Jennifer Lopez. Speaking of J. Lo, how happy are you her candidate lost? It's so delightful.” In June, Kelly dedicated a segment of her show (and a full online essay) to calling out the “desperate” bodysuit Lopez wore to her 2025 World Pride Festival set in Washington, D.C.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	And last year, Lopez caught a stray when the former Fox News host took issue with a different musician, Usher, and his 2024 Super Bowl halftime show. “Not into Usher or this halftime show,” Kelly wrote on X in February 2024, following the R&B superstar's headlining stint at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium. “However I do appreciate that my kids haven't had anyone's vag exposed to them on screen as they innocently wait for the football to start. (Hi J-Lo, Shakira.)” (While there was no nudity during Lopez's co-headlining halftime show with Shakira at the 2020 Super Bowl, Kelly seems to remember a much more explicit production.)


	Once Lopez wraps her string of European dates next month, she'll return to Las Vegas for a new residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace starting Dec. 30, with dates through March 2026. Her Up All Night Live in Las Vegas residency follows her Jennifer Lopez: All I Have stint from 2016 to 2018 at Zappos Theater in Planet Hollywood.


	See Kelly's new X post and Lopez's performance clip below.

So she's a soft porn star now. Great choices! https://t.co/kNO1FgC6GM

Nicks and Buckingham shared matching Instagram posts last week featuring lyrics from Buckingham Nicks cut ""Frozen Love.""

	Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are sparking reunion buzz after a cryptic billboard appeared on Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard this week, seemingly teasing a long-awaited reissue of their 1973 album Buckingham Nicks.

	The billboard was shared on , showing the album's original cover art—featuring a topless Nicks and Buckingham—alongside their names and the date Sept. 19. The location, near Sound City Studios where the record was initially tracked, feels like a deliberate nod to the album's origins.

	The billboard, spotted near Los Angeles' Sound City Studios where the album was originally recorded, features the iconic cover art of a topless Nicks and Buckingham alongside their names and the date Sept. 19 — a likely nod to the record's roots.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Adding to the speculation, Nicks and Buckingham shared matching Instagram posts last week featuring lyrics from Buckingham Nicks cut “Frozen Love.” Nicks posted, “And if you go forward…” while Buckingham followed with, “I'll meet you there,” completing a line from the song's chorus.

	










A post shared by Stevie Nicks (@stevienicks)


	Though neither artist has officially confirmed the reissue, a now-removed page for Buckingham Nicks briefly appeared on Rhino Records' website over the weekend, further suggesting an announcement is imminent. Parade reported the URL still exists, even though the cover art was taken down.


	The original Buckingham Nicks album was the duo's only release as a pair before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975. It's been out of print for decades and has never received a digital or vinyl reissue. Bootleg versions have circulated among fans for years, and there's now hope the new release could include bonus material like alternate takes or live recordings—including a famed early version of “Rhiannon.”


	While some fans are holding out hope for a joint tour, others speculate about a full Fleetwood Mac reunion—though Nicks previously revealed that the band wouldn't continue without Christine McVie, who died in 2022. 


	Nicks previously said that the last time she spoke to her former bandmate and boyfriend was at McVie's memorial. “The only time I've spoken to Lindsey was there, for about three minutes,” she previously told Rolling Stone. “I dealt with Lindsey for as long as I could. You could not say that I did not give him more than 300 million chances.”


	The tease also comes on the heels of Fleetwood Mac's 50th anniversary celebrations earlier this month, where Mick Fleetwood wrote on Instagram: “It's magic then, it's magic now. What a thrill, what a thrill.”


	As of now, representatives for Rhino Records have declined to comment. Fans will have to wait until Sept. 19 to see whether Buckingham Nicks finally gets its long-overdue re-release.

Kreidich, who has led the independent distribution division since April 2021, is departing the company. New leadership is expected to be announced this week.


													By
												

	Dan Rys



Cat Kreidich is leaving her post as president of Warner Music Group's distribution division ADA Worldwide, she announced in a memo to staff today (July 22) obtained by Billboard. Kreidich, who has led the division since April 2021, said she will share her plans for the future “when appropriate.”


	“While organizational change is a constant in our industry, I believe the foundation we've established will continue to serve independent artists effectively,” Kreidich wrote. “We built an exceptional global team and expanded our global release volume, revitalized our brand identity, and developed a digital platform specifically designed for independent artists and labels within the Warner supply chain.”


	Kreidich joined ADA at the end of 2020 as executive vp overseeing global expansion, before succeeding Eliah Seton as president just five months later. She had previously spent eight years at The Orchard, and had focused during much of her tenure at ADA on reinventing WMG's distro business, including focusing on upgrading its technology and services and bringing in a new executive team. A new leader for ADA is expected to be announced this week.




			Trending on Billboard		







	“Cat is a class act,” WMG CEO Robert Kyncl said in his own memo, obtained by Billboard. “A bold thinker and decisive leader, she's always focused on what's best for the indie community — its artists, its labels, and its spirit. Under her leadership, ADA has grown its relationships across the creative ecosystem, expanded its global reach, and strengthened its team and tech. She's helped guide us through some major shifts, staying agile, and delivering results.”


	During her tenure, Kreidich signed a distribution deal with Three Six Zero Recordings, brought aboard Kesha and her Kesha Recordings and delivered the singer her first No. 1 on multiple charts as an independent artist, and expanded into several new territories, among other accomplishments. She's also been a fixture on Billboard's Indie Power Players feature each year.


	Her tenure also coincided with a period when WMG was focused on bolstering its distribution options, at several points exploring acquisition targets before ultimately backing away from that plan; in March, Kyncl said at a Morgan Stanley conference that the company was now looking into building out its indie distribution offering rather than growing through buying. “I've looked at all distribution companies over the last 18 months … and what I can tell you is that we're not willing to grow this at all costs,” Kyncl said at the time. “We have an incredible technology team … and they have been building features already for a year and a half. This way you get to the same outcome much more efficiently.”


	Kyncl also announced earlier this month that Warner would be reducing staff through layoffs, the third time he had announced staffing cuts during his tenure. The same day, the company announced that it was launching a $1.2 billion catalog acquisition venture alongside Bain Capital.


	“To the ADA labels and artists who keep the heart of this industry beating: thank you for your dedication, creativity, and passion,” Kreidich wrote. “I've been inspired by your relentless drive and your vision. You champion creativity, and prove that independence doesn't mean going it alone — it means doing it your way. You are shaping the future of music, and I remain passionate about the independent music community and will continue to champion its growing importance.”


	Read her full memo below.


To the ADA Team,


I wanted you to hear this news directly from me: After four transformative years proving that Warner Music Group and ADA can truly be the best home for independent artists and labels, I have made the decision to leave the company. While organizational change is a constant in our industry, I believe the foundation we've established will continue to serve independent artists effectively.


We built an exceptional global team and expanded our global release volume, revitalized our brand identity, and developed a digital platform specifically designed for independent artists and labels within the Warner supply chain. We made strategic acquisitions like RSDL, which Warner will go on to use to help fuel their entire recorded music business.


This journey represents my second chapter with ADA. My first began during the early years of digital transformation, when I transitioned from a music tech startup. Having completed one of the first of its kind “New Media” degrees at Emerson College, I was drawn to the possibilities of digital disruption and the independent music scene. When I came across ADA in the '00s, it was supporting breaking independent acts at an unprecedented scale, pioneering new approaches while music was being democratized globally through emerging digital platforms like iTunes, eMusic, and mobile entertainment.


When I returned four years ago as an executive from The Orchard and Sony, I brought a vision to recapture that pioneering spirit and transform ADA to better compete in an increasingly crowded landscape of innovative music technology companies. We didn't aspire to be the biggest distribution company, but rather the most valuable—valuable to our artist and label partners by offering expert guidance and measurable results, and valuable to Warner Music Group by helping build its ecosystem and reputation for supporting independent artists. We believed that Warner Music Group and ADA were better together, each strengthening the other's capabilities and reach, and I think we've proven that out. As the company begins its next chapter, WMG is committed to continuing to expand the depth and range of ADA's services. 


To the ADA labels and artists who keep the heart of this industry beating: thank you for your dedication, creativity, and passion. I've been inspired by your relentless drive and your vision. You champion creativity, and prove that independence doesn't mean going it alone—it means doing it your way. You are shaping the future of music, and I remain passionate about the independent music community and will continue to champion its growing importance.


While I'm not ready to announce my next chapter, I look forward to sharing those plans when appropriate — it will be consistent with the work I have been grateful to do for the last 20 years as an indie advocate.


With gratitude and appreciation,


CAT

					By Peter White 

Executive Editor, Television


EXCLUSIVE: The Jussie Smollett hoax hate crime attack saga is set to be explored in a new documentary.


Netflix has ordered The Truth About Jussie Smollett?, a 90-minute feature doc about the case that, despite occurring in 2019, was just wrapped up, legally speaking, a couple of months ago.


	It will feature an interview with former Empire star Smollett himself.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The project comes from All3Media-owned production company Raw, which is behind two of Netflix's weirder true-crime tales in The Tinder Swindler and Don't F**k with Cats.


	The Netflix logline says the Smollett doc is a “shocking true story of an allegedly fake story that some now say might just be a true story. Featuring interviews with police, lawyers, journalists, investigators who claim to have uncovered new evidence about the case, and with Jussie himself, this compelling documentary invites the audience to decide for themselves who is telling The Truth About Jussie Smollett?”

	











	Gagan Rehill, who helmed Netflix's Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal, is directing. Raw's Tom Sheahan and Tim Wardle are exec producers on the doc, which will launch August 22.


	In January 2019, the Empire star claimed to have been a victim of a hate crime that stunned Hollywood but later was accused of staging the attack. He was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, but the charges were dropped. In 2020, he was re-indicted and eventually convicted on five felony counts, including lying to police, and sentenced to jail in March 2022, though he only served six days.

	











	Last November, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the legal consequences Smollett suffered due to the high-profile incident, with the court finding that special prosecutor Dan Webb's decision to retry Smollett had violated the performer's rights.


	In May, officials announced they had reached a settlement with Smollett and the actor said he was giving $60,000 to charity.


	“I'm very excited to be sharing this film with Netflix viewers,” Rehill said. “This story is a thrilling ride, and we were lucky enough to have access to the key players. I wanted this documentary to balance their competing narratives and to also use their compelling, colorful testimonies to thread the light and shade of the story through the film. But much more than that, I wanted this film to speak to the particular moment of rapid cultural change when this takes place in 2019; when, as a society, we were becoming more combative, more polarized, more divergent over our shared reality – when we began to lack a common singular Truth.”

EXCLUSIVE: A Taylor Swift documentary series is officially coming to Channel 4. 


	The network will explore the “global phenomenon” of the world's highest-grossing music performer via the two-parter, it said, confirming reports from several months back.


Taylor [working title] will dig deep across the musician's 20-year career, a period that has seen her transcend the realm of pop star to become a cultural icon. Through interviews with high-profile commentators, industry insiders and fans, the documentary examines the forces that have shaped her trajectory and the devoted community she inspires. Channel 4 said “rare archive” will reveal fresh insights into Swift and her story, as the series charts her journey from ambitious teen with towering dreams to one of the most influential and scrutinized figures of our time.

	Swift needs no introduction but the singer has generated mind-bending press coverage over the past few years and has an enormous global fanbase. She is the first billionaire with music as their main income. The Channel 4 doc follows her near-two-year-long Eras tour and before that a Netflix special titled Miss Americana.

	Director Guy King said: “Taylor Swift is an unprecedentedly powerful 21st century voice for women and young people. Under the microscope of social media since the earliest days of MySpace and Tumblr, she came of age during a new feminist wave. With her fame came controversy, which she so skilfully wrestled to the floor. We're excited to tell her story.”


A Deadly American Marriage producer Sandpaper Films is behind the doc and King (The Fall, Bombing Brighton) is directing. Producer is Jessica Brady and archive producer is Lina Caicedo. Susannah Price and Henry Singer from Sandpaper are EPs. The series is edited by BAFTA-winner Martin Thompson. Blue Ant is overseeing international sales.

					By Ted Johnson 

Political Editor


NPR‘s editor in chief plans to step down this fall, an announcement that comes just after public media lost federal funding for the next two years.


Edith Chapin, who also holds the title of acting chief content officer, told NPR that her resignation was not due to Congress' vote last week to rescind federal funding. “I have had two big executive jobs for two years, and I want to take a break,” she said. “I want to make sure my performance is always top-notch for the company.” 


	In a statement, Chapin said, “It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve NPR's listeners and readers, and work alongside some of the most dedicated journalists in the world. I will leave deeply proud of what we've accomplished and confident in the strength and integrity of NPR's newsroom going forward.”

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	She told NPR that she informed CEO Katherine Maher of her decision two weeks ago.


	Chapin has led the NPR newsroom since 2022, first as acting SVP News and editor in chief and then, the next year, taking on that role on a permanent basis. She previously has served as VP and executive editor at large and VP and executive editor of NPR News. Before joining NPR in 2012, she worked at CNN for 25 years, including as VP and deputy bureau chief in Washington, D.C.


	Maher said in a statement, “Edith laid the foundation for a stronger public radio, and set us on a solid path with her expert navigation. She has led with conviction, clarity, and compassion — always putting the public's interest first. Her impact on NPR's journalism and on the many people she mentored and supported over the years is immeasurable.”

	Last week, Congress voted to strip $1.1 billion of federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or its entire appropriation for the next two years. That funding was part of a $9 billion package of rescissions requested by Donald Trump. He and other Republicans have claimed that NPR and other public media entities are biased against conservatives. But PBS, NPR and the CPB have pointed to surveys showing continued high levels of public trust in public media compared to other sources.

					By Damon Wise 

Film Editor, Awards


	Superheroes are a thing of the past in the latest iteration of Marvel's Fantastic Four, the best by far of the company's attempts to translate the long-running comic book's appeal to the big screen. This it does not by trying to reinvent the wheel but, rather smartly, by addressing the elephant in the room, locating the action in a kitsch yet somehow timeless retro-future more befitting The Jetsons than The Avengers. It also benefits from a smart script and — I can't believe I'm writing this — really quite moving performances from its four charismatic leads, being arguably the best of Pedro Pascal's releases this year.

	











	Director Matt Shakman sets out his stall with a bold opening gambit that sees Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby) discovering that she is pregnant by her partner Reed Richards (Pascal). Together with Sue's brother Johnny (Joseph Quinn) and Reed's best friend Ben (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), the couple are also celebrating five years of Fantasticness, which they do quite literally on TV's The Ted Gilbert Show. This enables a quick and effective recap of the foursome's origin story: during a routine space mission, an electric storm left each one of them with “cosmically compromised DNA” and their own special skillset.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Interestingly, the word “superpower” is never used — the conscientious Reed prefers the word “anomalies” to describe these changes — and the film quickly gets to work establishing a world — half real-life Manhattan, half EPCOT — where the Four have become the guardians of America (and, by extension, the world). The rejection of the s-word is important, since the Four's abilities haven't aged terribly well: Reed has become a real-life Stretch Armstrong; Sue can make herself invisible and project force fields; Johnny becomes a human torch at will; and Ben — aka The Thing, and the only who must live with his “anomaly” full time — is now a clay-like creature gifted with super-strength.

	











	The perma-'50s vibe is incredibly well realized, and the sets are endlessly inventive: Cinema marquees in Times Square boast films with titles like Subzero Intel, Sunrise in Minsk, and The Emperor's Twin (a Walt Disney production, apparently), plus adverts for Juicy Fruit chewing gum and Pop-Tarts. The background casting is equally inspired; this is a film in which serious men in black-framed glasses and homburg hats point at things that literally everybody else is already looking at and say, “Would ya look at that!!!” Similarly, the Four's charitable trust — the Future Foundation — is quite a modest enterprise, more concerned with tackling crime at a grassroots rather than global level.


	The peace is suddenly shattered by the arrival of a mysterious silver surfer — not that one, but a female lookalike. Known as The Herald and played by Julia Garner, she announces to the world's media that the earth has been “marked for death” and will soon be consumed an entity she refers to as “The Devourer.” This turns out to be another name for Galactus, a surprisingly scary Marvel villain played with sinister sincerity by Ralph Ineson. Galactus is driven by an unassuageable appetite for destruction and, during an impressive showdown in space, offers to make a deal: Galactus will spare Earth if Reed and Sue hand over their as-yet unborn child.


	Needless to say, they don't, and when they return — in scenes that are wryly reminiscent of today — the citizens of New York berate them for their selfishness (“You said no???”). Nevertheless, much to his wife's annoyance, Reed realizes that desperate measures must be taken to keep Galactus at bay, and so he devises a series of plans to save the world, using his own child as bait. This in itself makes a refreshing change from the usual baffling Marvel McGuffin, and even though the outcome is wholly predictable, there's a definite frisson in the sight of The Herald's liquid-metal hand trying to snatch Sue's baby from the womb.


	As expected (from recent Marvel movies, not Fantastic Four movies passim), the VFX are pretty extraordinary, and, for once, there's even a clarity to the action, which is certainly spectacular on an Imax screen. The big draw, though, is the core cast. Kirby is a powerful Mama Lion, Quinn makes for an audaciously uncool Johnny, and Moss-Bachrach brings unexpected pathos to The Thing. MVP, though, is Pascal, who, in a poetic inversion of Galactus' destructive curse, plays Reed as a great scientist burdened by his analytical genius, forever condemned to play out the worst possible scenario in his mind in his quest to protect the world.


RELATED: How to Watch the Marvel Movies in Chronological Order


	That might sound heavy, but First Steps is admirably light on po-face superhero gravitas and rich in satisfying action-movie spectacle, notably when Galactus shows up in New York. The ending might seem pleasingly final, but watch for a predictable and quite unnecessary post-credits sting that sets up the Fantastic Four's return with a cliffhanger and teases the return of a very familiar character. Well, it is a Marvel movie, after all.

					By Greg Evans 

NY & Broadway Editor


Whoopi Goldberg paid tribute to her old friend Malcolm-Jamal Warner during a solemn moment on The View today. 


	Initially reading a prepared statement, Goldberg paused and sighed before moving into a more personal tribute.


	“We were devastated to hear that Malcolm-Jamal Warner drowned while vacationing in Costa Rica,” Goldberg began. “He was just 54 years old. He first became a pop culture icon as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show. And generations of Americans are feeling this loss because he was like everybody's brother.”

	Here, an emotional Goldberg took a deep breath. “He was really a great kid. I knew him well, I mean, it just…You know, the person who [broke the news to her] sent me a note that said, this is why what you did on Friday matters, and that is something that I will impart to you all. Because our lives move so quickly and we can disappear at any second, do not let much time pass before you say to your loved ones, hey, I'm thinking of you or hey, how you doing? Make sure you contact somebody today and reach out.”

	Goldberg's co-host Sunny Hostin also paid tribute. “I knew him also – I dated his friend – and he was always so nice to me. He didn't behave the way I thought movie stars or television stars would behave. He was very welcoming to this kind of outsider.”


	Hostin, a lawyer, also praised The Cosby Show. “I think [Warner's death] was so shocking because of the place that he had in pop culture for African Americans. I remember growing up and watching this family as a kid from the South Bronx projects, watching a Black doctor and Black lawyer married to each other living in a beautiful Brooklyn townhouse. And for me, it became something that was a possibility. That depiction, I think, was an overdue corrective against these harmful stereotypes of the Black community that existed for so very long, and he was just such a crucial part of it, especially I think for young Black men.”

	Following the tragic death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, tributes have poured in from all over Hollywood and beyond, as his loved ones and those he touched with one of his performances remember the man. 


	Warner's breakout role was playing Theo Huxtable on NBC's The Cosby Show, which ran for 8 seasons from 1984 to 1992. The series followed the upper-middle-class Huxtable family, with Warner starring as the only son of a doctor, Heathcliffe (Bill Cosby), and lawyer Claire (Phylicia Rashad), who also had four daughters: Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), Denise (Lisa Bonet), Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), and the youngest, Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam).

	











	In the show's second season, Geoffrey Owens joined the cast as Elvin Tibideaux, love interest of the eldest Huxtable daughter, Sondra, whom he would later marry.

	Following Warner's death in a drowning accident on July 20, Owens remembers his friend and longtime co-star.


	“This tragedy has almost left me speechless,” Owens shared in a statement to Deadline. “Malcolm was a lovely man; a sweet and sensitive soul. I respected him for many reasons, including the fact that he genuinely loved the act of creation. He had the mind of an actor and the heart of a musician. He was generous, too. I did a theater project long ago and asked him to participate; and he was there for me. My heart goes out to his family,” he added.

A summer without superhero movies may still be years or decades away, but at least Hollywood seems willing to achieve Origin Story Zero. Despite a title that tips a cap to the characters' Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, The Fantastic Four: First Steps joins this season's Superman and Thunderbolts as superhero stories that plop audiences in medias res, at least compared to the Fantastic Four retellings of decades' past. A title card lets the nerds know that this is all taking place on Earth-828, explaining the 1960s-ish retro-futuristic style and lack of any other visible MCU superheroes. Then off we go into an Easter eggy (but not off-puttingly so) newsreel-style montage chronicling the many adventures of stretchy scientist Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), his sometimes-invisible wife Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), her fiery brother Johnny (Joseph Quinn), and their rock-monster family friend Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), less charitably known as The Thing.

Generally, their superhero monikers don't get much play in this story, which is so family-focused that it becomes almost weirdly insular, with few other characters to speak of—and even fewer that aren't computer-generated. Besides The Thing, a wondrously seamless visual-effects creation, and the similarly well-rendered robot assistant H.E.R.B.I.E. (Matthew Wood), the heroes encounter a shiny alien being known as the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), who arrives on Earth to herald the arrival of Galactus (Ralph Ineson), a vast, godlike, world-devouring creature. Though the Surfer  evinces some oblique cosmic decency beneath her shiny metallic exterior, Galactus appears to be an unstoppable, unknowable force, and brainiac Reed must figure out how to protect his family and the rest of the Earth from this unimaginably massive threat. It must be said that some of the plans he comes up with do not sound like the work of a bona fide genius.

They seem, in fact, like remnants of smaller, dumber movies that preceded this one, heralding oblivion. Specifically, despite a trip to space and through some time-dilating portals, on paper First Steps more or less remakes 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer. That low-rent sequel expends no small amount of its 87 minutes sans credits on a ghastly Mister Fantastic dance sequence and a scene where the world's most famous superheroes irritate passengers on a commercial airline. No such antics animate First Steps, and while the new movie is better than the two-and-done Tim Story-directed sorta-series by a factor that may reach the triple digits, perhaps a smidge more whimsy might have done some good. An odd moroseness takes over the movie in its back half, mostly due to a stakes-raising moral dilemma. Given, surprisingly, how much the advertising materials draw footage from the first half-hour, this turn probably qualifies as a spoiler. Suffice to say that there's a thoughtful, almost Star Trek-like moral question that the movie ultimately feels unequipped to take seriously—though that doesn't stop director Matt Shakman and four credited screenwriters from trying, exacerbating Marvel's ongoing tension between their grown-up aspirations and their four-quadrant instincts (or possibly vice versa).

Any break from the lightweight Marvel punch-up style is a welcome one, yet The Fantastic Four: First Steps still finds room for plenty of bad dialogue. The freedom once afforded actors as eclectic as the entire cast of Iron Man 2 is long gone, leaving this central quartet to play things respectably, honorably, and more than a little muted, with occasional outbreaks of Downey Lite yammering where certain words get repeated (“plan” is one here) like the characters are vamping on a third-tier single-camera sitcom. The endless possibilities of a retro-futuristic alternate universe are utilized, in part, to imagine that the laziness of writing in fist-bumps or dully contemporary phrasings and affectations can escape anachronism status on a technicality. The early scene where Sue announces her pregnancy is a deadly object lesson in forced multiple-draft chumminess, inspiring wistful thoughts of how Pascal was apparently warned off of doing a Mid-Atlantic accent. Stylish costumes are one thing; stylized acting is apparently quite another. For much of the film, the whole cast politely avoids stepping on each other's toes.

Granted, past Fantastic Four movies, Incredibles movies, and any number of Avengers and X-Men variations have taken up a lot of bickering-super-family real estate, which may explain why First Steps doesn't bother depicting much familial discord. The last thing the superhero subgenre needs is a bunch of people learning to, get this, use their powers and work together. But this movie's family dynamics feel especially frictionless; in depicting actual (not de facto or metaphorical) parenthood, siblinghood, and especially marriage, Marvel is as wobbly and tentative as first-time parents, only without ever admitting how tired they are.

It's particularly demoralizing to see an actor as striking and memorable as Vanessa Kirby reduced to nobly girlbossing her way through by-the-book protective-mom routines. Those piercing eyes, so consistently drained of personality, desire, or sexuality! Johnny Storm has a glimmer of those latter stirrings when he beholds the Silver Surfer—a naked woman astride a surfboard, he points out when protesting too much, though Reed performs a quick “actually” about any implied nudity as if quoting Pope Kevin Feige himself. But it amounts to little. These movies have become so piously devoid of romance, nevermind sex, that one half-expects to see the happily pregnant married couple inhabiting separate beds, as in an early sitcom-spoofing episode of WandaVision, which Shakman also worked on. Like that show, The Fantastic Four: First Steps offers some delightful visual pastiche, including impressively imagined art direction, costumes, and visual effects, alongside a pervasive sense that there's less to the characters than meets (and fills) the eye. The Thing's adorable sweater-vests have more distinction than Moss-Bachrach's mo-capped performance, or even how his computer-generated character actually moves through the frame.

It's probably not easy to make a good Fantastic Four movie. The characters have power sets so difficult to depict in live-action that the grumpy rock monster consistently looks the best of the bunch, while various forcefields, flamed-on human torches, and stretchy limbs have been consistently shown up by an animated movie from two decades ago. The newest version has enough actor-based charm to distract from its jankiest effects, plus a damn cool Silver Surfer, a lot of bright blue in the color scheme, one hilarious Mole Man, and a zippy pace. Occasionally it even conjures images of sci-fi majesty, like Sue in zero-gravity labor or the Surfer riding molten waves. For a lot of Marvel fans, it will be more than enough. For the more superhero skeptical, it offers a helpful example of how simply skipping the origin stuff on the fourth try doesn't automatically confer a sense of dramatic urgency or comic-book wonder. Sometimes it's just a franchise in a hurry to get to the next step.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Michelle Yeoh embarrasses her immortal kid in Ne Zha 2 English dub trailer","https://www.avclub.com/ne-zha-2-trailer-michelle-yeoh","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Even an otherworldly demonic hero can get embarrassed by his mom. Ne Zha is super powerful, both within his animated universe and at the box office. Ne Zha 2 is already the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Now, the Chinese film is getting a bit of extra star power with an English dub featuring Michelle Yeoh as the titular character's doting mother. A24 is handling the English-language release, which hits theaters on August 22.

“A rebellious young boy, Ne Zha, is feared by the gods and born to mortal parents with wild, uncontrolled powers,” a synopsis for the film reads. “Now he's faced with an ancient force intent on destroying humanity, he must grow up to become the hero the world needs.”

﻿

Given that an Oscar winner like Yeoh is involved, the English dub trailer features a bit more of Ne Zha's mom, Lady Yin, than the version released by production company CMC Pictures earlier this year. “Immortal or demon, you are my son,” she tells him. “You must be brave and walk your own path.” The trailer ends with a laugh line when Lady Yin says, “Wait! Before you leave, will you give your mama one last big hug?” As a nearby crowd awws, Ne Zha walks away grumbling, “Come on, they're all watching!”

The voice cast of Ne Zha 2 is slightly different from the English-language cast for the first Ne Zha film. While Vincent Rodriguez III (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) and Aleks Le (Dandadan, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man) will both reprise their roles (as Li Jing and Ao Bing, respectively), Yeoh replaces Stephanie Sheh as Lady Yin. In a previous statement, Yeoh said she was honored to be a part of the film and “can't wait for everyone to experience the wonder, heart, spectacular artistry, and magic of this film on the big screen.” The cast also includes Crystal Lee (Genshin Impact, DC Heroes United).

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Venice Film Festival announces lineup, including premieres from Safdie, Lanthimos, and more","https://www.avclub.com/venice-film-festival-lineup-safdie-del-toro","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 14:43:00 GMT","

Awards watch is in full swing. The Hollywood Reporter was right in characterizing this year's Venice lineup as featuring “a frankly absurd number of must-see movies.” While it's been an up and down year for cinema thus far, the auteurs are bringing their A-game for festival season. Venice will see the premieres of multiple highly anticipated films, including Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, which stars Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi, Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, which follows the story of two-time UFC heavyweight champion Mark Kerr (played by Dwayne Johnson), and Luca Guadagnino's dark academic thriller After The Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which will premiere out of competition.

Del Toro, Safdie, and Guadagnino are far from the only filmmakers who will be walking the carpet. Frequent collaborators Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone are back with Bugonia, an adaptation of Jang Joon-Hwan's Save The Green Planet!. The two had a pretty good fest back in 2023, when they took home the Golden Lion for four-time Oscar winner Poor Things. Speaking of Oscars, Mona Fastvold, who co-wrote The Brutalist with Brady Corbet, has her own “historical drama musical” in competition titled The Testament Of Ann Lee. Other major directors like Noah Baumbach (Jay Kelly) Kathryn Bigelow (A House Of Dynamite), Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan) are also in competition. 

Alexander Payne will be in attendance although he isn't screening a film. The Holdovers director and two-time Oscar winner is heading the jury, which also includes actor Fernanda Torres, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, French director Stéphane Brizé, Italian director Maura Delpero, actor Zhao Tao, and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu.

As celebrity friends and stunned fans mourn the tragic passing of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, a new development emerged late on July 21, 2025. According to an update first reported by Us Weekly, “The Cosby Show” alum was not alone when he died in an accidental drowning at a beach in Costa Rica. 

A spokesperson for the Red Cross there told Us Weekly that on July 20, emergency personnel “attended to two adult male patients,” one of whom survived the incident.  

CPR was performed on a 54-year-old man who matched Warner's identity, the spokesperson said, but he was declared deceased at the scene. A second victim, an unidentified 35-year-old man, was “transported in critical condition to the local clinic,” Us Weekly was told. The Red Cross spokesperson confirmed to the outlet that Warner and the second person were “involved in the same incident.”

On July 21, Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) issued an incident report, translated from Spanish to English, that stated its agents “carried out the removal of the body of a male who died as a result of asphyxia by submersion,” per Today.com. 

The report said that Warner, who was vacationing with family at Playa Cocles in Costa Rica's Limon province, went for a swim in the ocean between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. local time, per Today.com. According to the report, he was “dragged by a current offshore.”

Today.com reported that other people on the beach were able to pull Warner back to shore, but by the time the Costa Rican Red Cross arrived, he was “without vital signs.” His body was then sent to the Judicial Morgue in San Joaquin de Flores for an autopsy, the outlet reported. 

Roger Sanz, President of the Chamber of Tourism and Commerce of the Southern Caribbean, said in a statement, “Despite the rescue efforts made by Caribbean Guard volunteers at Playa Grande, the actor — who was vacationing in the area with his family — tragically lost his life. We want to make it clear that we are organized, that most of us do inform our clients and visitors. But like in every part of the world, accidents can happen — and this time, it happened to us.”

A post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)

At the time of his death, Warner had been in Costa Rica for a week, according to TMZ, which published video of the actor arriving at the airport there on July 13. The outlet reported that he had flown there from Atlanta.

A source confirmed to People that Warner was on a family vacation when he drowned. It is not clear if his wife and daughter were with him at the airport or if additional family members were on the trip. 

Although Warner is best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on eight seasons of “The Cosby Show” in the 80s, the actor's most recent roles included five seasons on FOX's medical drama “The Residents” and, his final role, as Chief Inspector Bill Houston on “Alert: Missing Persons Unit.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Malcolm-Jamal Warner's Heartwarming Final Interview","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/malcolm-jamal-warner-last-interview-words/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 10:37:16 GMT","

“There's part of me that I will be able to leave this earth knowing — and people knowing — that I was a good person.” So said Malcolm-Jamal Warner in the last interview he gave before his death.

Warner sat down with Melyssa Ford for the May 21 episode of the “Hot & Bothered” podcast.

 Incredibly, the 54-year-old spoke a great deal about his legacy, saying he thinks about it “a lot.”

Warner drowned on a beach vacation with his 8-year-old daughter July 20 in Costa Rica.

In the podcast, the “Cosby Show” actor spoke about his own father, saying that his dad once told him while others love him for his career success, his dad was most proud that Malcolm was a good person.

“I'm a good person because my dad's a good person,” Warner told Ford. “It is possible to walk through this world and, with all of the darkness in the world, it is possible to maintain your soul and be a good person.”

 In the telling interview, which dropped just two months before Malcolm-Jamal Warner's unexpected death, the actor spoke about his young daughter.

“My daughter will be 8 next month, so I sob a lot. She'll say something and I'll go ‘oh my God, that's me, that's me,'” he said.

Warner told a story of being in Los Angeles with his daughter, hearing coyotes. When he explained how dogs and coyotes evolved from wolves, the little girl said, “So basically, dogs are colonized wolves not called by their name.”

In telling the story, Warner said, “I sat there, my chest poked out. I brushed my shoulder off and said ‘that right there, that's my kid.'” he related.

“My dad named me after Malcolm X and Ahmad Jamal, so that's where it starts. So she gets it honestly,”  Warner said with pride.

Malcolm-Jamal Warner also acknowledged that part of his legacy would always be tied to “The Cosby Show,” where he rose to fame playing Theo Huxtable for eight seasons from 1984 to 1992.

“I feel like, okay, there's that legacy there, but then, because I've had this full life after that show, there's another lane of legacy that I get to leave,” he said in the interview. “And I'm still working through that.”

Incredibly, Malcolm-Jamal Warner also talked about grief during the podcast, relating how at age 15, he had been in the room when his beloved grandfather passed away.

“I literally watched him take his last breath,” he recalled. “And if you've ever seen someone take their final breath, there's this peace that comes over them, just washes over them.”

And while Warner said that moment was sad, it also taught him something.

 “I realized that when we grieve for people who have passed on, we're grieving for ourselves, right? Because we miss them. And when I think about people in my life who have gone on and transitioned, I think about the lives that they've led. They were really good people,” he said.

“And when we talk about, why are the good people taken away from us, I go, ‘Maybe they're being rewarded or something,'” said Warner.

When beloved actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner died on July 20, 2025, in an accidental drowning, he was vacationing with his family in Costa Rica, a source confirmed to People. 

Authorities said Warner, who was 54, drowned while swimming at a beach in Playa Cocles, located on the Caribbean coast, when a strong current, or rip tide, swept him offshore, according to the Associated Press.

The beach town of Playa Cocles, located in Limon Province, is a popular destination for surfers because of its abundant waves and laid-back vibes, per multiple tourist sites. But the strong, unpredictable rip tides there have also been cited by travel experts and researchers who have deemed it one of the most dangerous beaches in Costa Rica. 

A post shared by Costa Rica Top Tours (@costaricatoptours)

In 2009, researchers at the National University of Costa Rica developed a comprehensive risk assessment study to measure and build awareness around potential dangers at more than 100 beaches along the country's Pacific and Caribbean coasts, according to The Costa Rica Star. 

Playa Cocles, where Warner died, was named “the most dangerous beach in the Atlantic Coast,” according to the outlet, because of its rip currents and “irregular conditions of the beach.”

In November 2016, researchers at the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, worked with officials in Costa Rica on a study aimed at preventing drowning deaths due to dangerous rip currents, which a summary of the study defined as “powerful, narrow channels of fast-moving water that can swiftly transport swimmers a significant distance off-shore.” 

Professor Chris Houser, an expert in earth and environmental sciences, worked with the National University of Costa Rica, the United States embassy in Costa Rica, and the Red Cross to measure rip tides there and establish new laws, including training for lifeguards to spot rip tides and alerts for beachgoers, the summary said. 

A lifeguard program was specifically set up at Playa Cocles beach because, Houser reported, it was where they measured “the worst rips in Costa Rica.” The rip tides there were so strong, he said, that “even an Olympic swimmer could get swept up and drown trying to fight the current.”

A 2022 video about Playa Cocles from travel vlog “The World at Your Feet” said the white sand beach is best for surfers from January to March, when waves are highest.

Located near Puerto Viejo, the beach stretches nearly a mile, according to travel blogger James Kaiser, who recommended two luxury hotels — Le Cameleon and Geckoes Lodge. He also wrote that there are multiple “laid-back restaurants” located just across from the beach. 

It's not clear where Warner and his family, including his wife and daughter, were staying on their vacation. However, a statement from the Costa Rica Red Cross said it responded to the “water-related” incident at the Playa Grande resort in Cahuita, Limón at around 2:10 p.m. on July 20, per People.

TMZ published a photo and video of the actor arriving at the Costa Rica airport on July 13, one week before his tragic death.

Warner was best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on 80s sitcom “The Cosby Show,” but his most recent work has included five seasons on FOX's “The Residents” and, in April, appearing in his final TV role as Chief Inspector Bill Houston on “Alert: Missing Persons Unit.”

Comedian and “30 Rock” star John Lutz is mourning an unimaginable loss following the sudden death of his beloved younger brother, Joel. This tragedy has left his family heartbroken and his community rallying in support. On July 20, Lutz shared the heartbreaking news in an emotional Instagram post.

“My younger brother Joel passed away suddenly this past Thursday. My family and I are heartbroken,” he wrote. “He was a funny, compassionate, and loving person. There are so many other things that I want to say about him, but right now I am too devastated to continue typing. I love you Joel.”

A post shared by John Lutz (@shutup_lutz)

The following day, Lutz followed up with another post, this time sharing personal photos and announcing a GoFundMe campaign to help Joel's surviving family: his wife Jenni and their four children—twins Ellery and Rhea, 15, Zoe, 13, and Josiah, 10.

“My brother Joel unexpectedly passed away this past Thursday. I loved him so much and cannot express the loss I am feeling right now. Even if he was a better fisher than I was,” Lutz wrote.

“A GoFundMe has been set up for his family… If you can find it in your heart, please give a little or share this to help them through this tough time.”

Lutz, best known for playing JD Lutz on “30 Rock” and as a longtime writer on Saturday Night Live and Late Night with Seth Meyers, received an outpouring of support from his comedy peers.

A post shared by John Lutz (@shutup_lutz)

Kenan Thompson commented: “Oh noooo!!! I'm so sorry John!!!! Sending y'all love and prayers!!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾”

Actress D'Arcy Carden added: “Sending so much love to you and your family John.”

SNL alum Vanessa Bayer shared: “I'm so sorry John. Thinking of you and your family and sending love.”

People reported that Joel Lutz was an experienced engineer and UX design manager who worked internationally in Germany and South Korea before settling in North Carolina.

The GoFundMe set up in his honor continues to gather support to help his wife and children navigate this unimaginable loss. As of this writing, more than $64,932 has been raised through GoFundMe to support Joel's wife and their four children.

Our thoughts remain with the Lutz family during this challenging time.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Malcolm-Jamal Warner Gushed Over His Wife & Daughter in Touching Podcast [VIDEO]","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/everything-malcolm-jamal-warner-said-about-wife-daughter/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 14:35:14 GMT","

Before his tragic passing at age 54, Malcolm-Jamal Warner quietly built the life he never thought he wanted. “The Cosby Show” star, who drowned off the coast of Costa Rica on July 20, kept his family out of the spotlight. However, in recent podcast appearances, he has given rare insight into how becoming a husband and father has changed him.

“I talk about my wife and daughter, but obviously I don't post them,” Warner said on his ‘Not All Hood podcast'. “I talk about them because they are the hugest parts of my life, the best parts of my life, the best decisions I've ever made.”

On the ‘Hot & Bothered podcast‘ earlier this year, Warner reflected on meeting his wife later in life and how his mindset had evolved. “I met my wife through a mutual friend,” he shared. “Because I was on this hiatus, I was like, I'm not really dating.” 

Their connection surprised him—especially after telling her on their first date that he didn't plan to have kids. “She said, ‘I'm definitely going to have kids,'” he recalled.

But something shifted: “At some point, I was like, if I'm going to have a kid, this is the person I would want to have it with,” he said. “I also realized that if something happened and we weren't together romantically, she would still be the person I would want to raise a child with, co-parent with.”

Their daughter, now 7, became the heart of Warner's world. “It's so funny because my daughter will say she already knew. She was just waiting for us to decide,” Warner said on ‘Not All Hood'.

He credited meeting his wife at 45 and fatherhood soon after as timing that felt spiritually aligned. “There was a moment I realized, when people say, ‘when you know, you know,' that's what that feeling is,” he told host Melyssa Ford. “I had that experiential knowledge of when you know, you know. This is it.”

Warner admitted he was often misunderstood by the public when it came to settling down. “For so long, people were like, he's a womanizer. He's never going to settle down,” he said. “No, I did it when it was right. I did it the right way.”

He also shared why he chose to keep his family off social media and away from red carpets. “I like to keep them and their identity private,” he said, “but I love talking about them because I want people to know that it's possible to be happy and to have love, and love really be enriching.”

May Malcolm-Jamal Warner's legacy live on through the love he shared with his wife and daughter, and the impact he left behind.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Malcolm-Jamal Warner's ‘Community' Wife Yvette Nicole Brown Shares Emotional Tribute","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/malcolm-jamal-warner-yvette-nicole-brown/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 14:12:03 GMT","

The tributes continue to pour in for Malcolm-Jamal Warner following his tragic death on July 20 at age 54. Yvette Nicole Brown, who played Shirley Bennett on “Community,” reflects on the loss of her beloved friend and co-star. Warner played Shirley's husband Andre on the sitcom.

A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown)

On July 21, Brown took to Instagram to share a touching tribute to Warner, including a video of the actor talking about finding “a reason to smile.” 

“This loss has devastated me. 💔 I don't have the words right now so I am repurposing these beautiful ones from my dear friend, who I adored,” the actress wrote.

She continued, “This video is a glimpse of the love he would share just randomly. To have him as a friend was a blessing from God. He was one of one. I love you @malcolmjamalwar. I always have. I always will. Thank you for being a real one. Until we meet again, friend. 💔🕊️”

Brown added, “Heartfelt condolences to his wife and daughter whom he CHERISHED and his dear mom and his dad.❤️”

A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown)

Later in the day, Brown took to Instagram Live to remember Warner. “Holding space for @malcolmjamalwar ❤️🕊️,” she noted in the caption.

During the recording, the actress shared, “I was a huge fan from the time I was 13 years old. I was blessed to work with him and most importantly, I was blessed to call him friend. Dear friend.”

Brown continued, “I am not someone who takes friendship lightly. I cherish being allowed to walk through life with someone. I just talked to Malcolm maybe a week ago.”

“This is devastating,” she shared through tears. “He was such a real one, you guys … he was so real.”

“He deserves a personal moment from me,” Brown said. “Such a good friend. He was such a good man. He was such a good husband. He was such a good dad … Please know that he was an amazing husband and an amazing father and he loved his family and his family loved him.”

The actress touched on how Warner was “intentional” about contacting friends when he thought of them. “He never missed my birthday and I never missed his,” she said, reflecting on the ways he would make the day special for her every year.

“When I did ‘Community' and knew Shirley had been married … I was so happy that [creator] Dan Harmon let me have Malcolm,” she recalled.

Brown shared how she asked, during the first season, “If we go the distance, if we ever see Shirley's husband, can it please let it be Malcolm-Jamal Warner?”

She continued, “And then I jokingly said, ‘But only if they reconcile,' because I was like, if they reconcile, I'll get to kiss my childhood crush. If they don't reconcile, I don't want it to be Malcolm-Jamal Warner.”

“And Dan Harmon, to his credit, thought it was a brilliant idea and that's how I got to really meet Malcolm and work with Malcolm, Brown explained. “Shirley got her Andre, and then we got to be, we became really great friends.”

“I just wanted to work with him forever because he's such a good guy,” she added.

As might be inferred from its still-awkward subtitle, Matt Shakman's “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” is a story about the mortal terror — and the profound thrill — of walking into the unknown. Here, in a movie that promises to push the Marvel Cinematic Universe out of its comfort zone before quickly retreating into a tired version of the same old schtick, only the terror shines through.  

It's the terror of a Hollywood film executive who's desperate to rejuvenate his sprawling mega-franchise, but deeply afraid of messing with the formula. It's also — for the best part of Shakman's film — the terror of a brilliant scientist who's dying to have a child with his wife, but petrified at the premise of an experiment that he doesn't have the power to control.

While Fantastic Four leader Reed Richards can extend his limbs into any shape imaginable (a radiation-induced talent that “First Steps” appears to forget about for appropriately long stretches of time), his sideburns turn grayer at the thought of living with his heart outside of his body. How do you rattle an invincible genius who can wiggle out of any problem with just a blackboard and some chalk? Give him a problem that no formula can solve. 

 










And that's exactly what “First Steps” does with its opening act. The Fantastic Four have already established themselves as the most beloved family on Earth (well, their Earth) by the time we meet them — a shortcut that Josh Friedman, Jeff Kaplan, Eric Pearson, and Ian Springer's script will pay for down the road. Winsomely portrayed by Pedro Pascal as a worried egghead who's shelled inside his own thoughts, Reed may not be the most outspoken member of the superteam (that distinction belongs to Joseph Quinn's Johnny Storm, even if his flame is dulled to death in this film), but the fact that he's basically Tony Stark, Albert Einstein, and Bill Nye all rolled into one is still enough to make him the de facto frontman. 

Things are a bit shakier behind closed doors. When his wife reveals that she's pregnant after several years of trying and giving up, it's Reed who struggles to wrap his head around the known unknowns of what becoming a parent might entail. (Sue Storm is played by Vanessa Kirby, who finds any number of invisible nuances in a one-note part that largely reduces her to “baby” in the same way that Ken's entire identity was “beach.”) Reed fights to make the retro-futuristic dimension of Earth-828 a place where it's safe for people to raise a child, but he understands his world too well to account for all of its variables; he can invent a teleportation device without breaking a sweat, but delegates the task of building a crib to his helper robot H.E.R.B.I.E. (whose “Star Wars”-worthy design is somewhat wasted on beep-boop comic relief). 

 










In other words, Mister Fantastic is scared. As scared to have his first kid as Joel Miller was to lose his second one. And Pascal's performance is so raw and refreshing because the actor isn't afraid to lead with that fear. And for a while, the film around him isn't either. Indeed, the initial chapters of “First Steps” are attuned to Reed's all too relatable neurosis in a way that makes it seem like the MCU is about to grow by leaps and bounds. Creating life in the face of an existential crisis requires a greater degree of magical thinking than Reed's brain was built to process, and when a naked metal Julia Garner surfs into Times Square and heralds the imminent arrival of the world-devouring space giant Galactus (Ralph Ineson), the news is like comeuppance for having the gall to bring something beautiful into a multiverse of gods and monsters.

“First Steps” might take place in a bizarro 1960s that's suspended between RKO and “The Jetsons,” but its parental anxieties are ripped straight from our 21st century; Galactus' threat to “Eat Reed's planet slowly while his son watches” is no different or more personal than what I hear every time a fascist opens their mouth on TV. Finally, it would seem, we're in for a Marvel movie with relatable human stakes. A Marvel movie in which a sequel doesn't feel like the only thing that's at risk. A Marvel movie in which saving the universe will require its characters to confront — and overcome — their mega-franchise's stultifying fear of change. 

 










Spoiler alert: We're not. 

“First Steps” may have the good sense to sidestep — or at least speed through — the characters' hyper-familiar origin story, but it still feels like a movie we've seen 1,000 times before. In fairness, that movie has seldom looked this good. Superhero films thrive on a vivid sense of time and place, and Shakman's crew has an absolute field day with the mid-century modernism of Earth-828, every design choice of which radiates the modular optimism of a world that believes in itself. 

Imagine Don Draper trying to sell you a five-cent comic book: This New York City is the kind of place where anything's possible and life moves forward at the speed of a buoyant montage. Flying cars and nifty monorails zip between Bertrand Goldberg-inspired towers above ground, while Paul Walter Hauser's scene-stealing Mole Man rules over a subterranean paradise below. The skies are Pan-Am blue instead of CGI gray, and each living room comes with its own Lloyd fireplace. From its delightful props (e.g. a baby monitor shaped like an old tube TV) to its turtleneck costumes, “First Steps” is the only MCU entry this side of “Wakanda Forever” that feels like it actually wants to be looked at — not just watched. 

 










Alas, “First Steps” loses its footing when it launches into space, loses the benefit of its scenery, and forces our attention on the plug-and-play jizz whizz at its core. The sky's the limit until the Fantastic Four leave Earth's atmosphere, at which point they immediately bump into the same low ceiling that makes all of the biggest Marvel movies feel like they have nowhere to grow. 

Galactus is quite a large boy, but the spectacle of his size — which Shakman can hardly contain in a single frame — isn't the only thing that makes the characters feel small. On the contrary, they shrink a bit more with every weightless action sequence and recycled joke, as the friction between Reed and Sue is subsumed into the stuff of garden variety special effects and “that's all we get?” lore (Galactus wants to eat the Earth because he's very hungry, and the Silver Surfer is somehow even less nuanced). 

Absent the visual dynamism of Earth-828, we can't help but notice that Johnny was barely a character to begin with. Pivoting away from his legacy as a red-hot womanizer, the film tries to paint the Human Torch as a dilettante with something to prove, but it never really settles on what that something should be. (Making it appear as if Johnny is burning himself alive is just another one of the many things this movie is afraid of, and so it settles for a cartoonish fire effect that feels just a few degrees shy of the characters from “Elemental.”) 

 










His cool uncle schtick is shared with flaky rock creature Ben Grimm (Eben Moss-Bachrach), who looks great, and brings a faint trace of upper-crust sophistication to a hero known for clobberin' anything that gets in his way, but leans way too hard on the vague loneliness that he sees in his own reflection. Ben is the strongest of the Fantastic Four, and yet even he struggles to carry the sort of smirking banter that hasn't been fresh since the first “Avengers” (nothing suffocates the MCU like its sense of humor, which makes it all the more refreshing to see Hauser tunnel a new path towards the Mole Man's punchlines). Instead of an emotional arc, Ben has a crush on a Hebrew school teacher played by Natasha Lyonne; if only the sight of The Thing wearing a tallit were the strangest thing I've had to process as a Jew over the last few years. 

The Fantastic Four do eventually return to Earth-828 for the second half of the story, but at that point this film is so consumed by the usual song-and-dance — big stuff coming from above, the heroes have to zip around to stop it — that the fear of the unknown starts to feel less like a theme for “First Steps” to to explore than an explanation for why it completely fails to do that. It doesn't help that Galactus is every bit as laughable as he is large (he was so much scarier and more compelling as a giant cloud in 2007's “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer”), or that Shakman is too afraid of how silly his characters' superpowers look in live-action to have any fun with them, which is a problem “The Incredibles” solved too well, and with too much comic ingenuity, for this movie to simply try and ignore. 

 










“Family is about fighting for something bigger than yourself,” Sue insists. But as “First Steps” limps to its total nothing of a conclusion, it feels less like a victory than it does a total surrender. You have to walk before you can run, but at this point the MCU is back to crawling on its knees, and at this point it seems like it might be too afraid to ever stand back up again. 

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures will release “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in theaters on Friday, July 25.

Amanda Seyfried is back on the musical theater kick, and this time, she's putting the Shake(r) in her dance routine for the big screen. The actress leads Mona Fastvold‘s “The Testament of Ann Lee,” portraying the titular religious leader who founded the Shaker Movement in the late 1770s.

“The Testament of Ann Lee” is co-written by Fastvold and her “The Brutalist” collaborator and real-life partner Brady Corbet. “Ann Lee” was announced in December 2024. It will premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival, and later will screen at TIFF 50.

 










Christopher Abbott, Thomasin McKenzie, Lewis Pullman, Tim Blake Nelson, Stacy Martin, Matthew Beard, Scott Handy, Viola Prettejohn, David Cale, and Jamie Bogyo co-star alongside Seyfried. Ann Lee's followers deemed her the female Jesus Christ, and her worshippers prayed through song and dance, hence the music-centric genre for the historical feature. “The Testament of Ann Lee” is shot in 70mm, as was “The Brutalist.”

The logline reads: “An epic fable about religious leader Ann Lee (Seyfried), who was proclaimed by her followers as the female Christ and went on to build one of the largest utopian societies.” 

“Ann Lee” features original songs by Oscar winner “The Brutalist” composer Daniel Blumberg. Choreography comes from Celia Rowlson Hall, the dancer who played the adult Sophie in “Aftersun.”

“The Testament of Ann Lee” is Seyfried's first music-centric film since 2018's “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.” She also sang in the first “Mamma Mia!” film in 2008 and “Les Miserables” in 2012. Seyfried has publicly lamented on missing out on playing Glinda in Jon M. Chu's “Wicked” before Ariana Grande was cast.

Seyfried told Vanity Fair that shooting Fastvold and Corbet's secret indie film after wrapping the upcoming Peacock limited series “Long Bright River,” was tough. “I went to hell and back,” Seyfried said of the demanding back-to-back projects, with “The Testament of Ann Lee” being shot on location in Budapest, Hungary. 

“Ann Lee” helmer Fastvold previously directed 2021 period queer romance “The World to Come,” starring Katherine Waterson and Vanessa Kirby. Fastvold and Corbet both produce “Ann Lee.”

 










“The Testament of Ann Lee” is one of the many buzzy titles in competition at Venice. “The Wizard of the Kremlin,” directed by Olivier Assayas, Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” Kathryn Bigelow's “A House of Dynamite,” Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia,” Benny Safdie's “The Smashing Machine,” Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice,” and Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother” are also among the features in competition.

Jim Jarmusch is keeping it all in the family. The auteur reunites with a slew of his frequent collaborators for “Father Mother Sister Brother,” set to be released by MUBI. The film will first premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival in competition, Jarmusch's first time in that section. The Cannes perennial premiered “Coffee and Cigarettes” out of competition in Venice in 2003. 

“Father Mother Sister Brother” is designed as a triptych, with the trio of stories all concerning the relationships between adult children, “their somewhat distant parent (or parents),” per the film's synopsis, and each other. Each of the three chapters takes place in the present, and each in a different country: “Father” is set in the Northeast U.S., “Mother” is in Dublin, Ireland, and “Sister Brother” is in Paris, France. Per any Jarmusch film, it's a character study that blends melancholy and comedy.

Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps, Sarah Greene, Indya Moore, Luka Sabbat, and Françoise Lebrun star in the film, written and directed by Jarmusch.

 










“‘Father Mother Sister Brother' is a kind of anti-action film, its subtle and quiet style carefully constructed to allow small details to accumulate – almost like flowers being carefully placed in three delicate arrangements,” Jarmusch said in a press statement. “Collaborations with the masterful cinematographers Frederick Elmes and Yorick Le Saux, the brilliant editor Affonso Gonçalves, and other frequent collaborators elevate what started as words on a page into a form of pure cinema.” 

The project was announced in 2024; this is Jarmusch's first feature film since 2019's “The Dead Don't Die,” which also starred his “Paterson” alum Driver. Blanchett previously led Jarmusch's “Coffee and Cigarettes,” too.

Jarmusch previously told The Guardian that he wrote “Father Mother Sister Brother” with a specific cast in mind, saying he had to “wrangle” the collaborators together for the production itself. “Actors are like wild animals that I have to somehow corral because they have so much going on. So, I'm trying to corral some incredible wild animals – I hope I can capture them,” Jarmusch said in 2023. “I'm a control freak in that I have to do it my own way. I have to choose all my own collaborators. I have to have final cut. I have to produce it through my own company. And as for the people financing the films, I allow them to give me notes on a rough cut but I always, contractually, have absolutely no obligation to use them.”

 










Elmes (“The Dead Don't Die,” “Paterson”) and Le Saux (“Only Lovers Left Alive,” “Personal Shopper”) are the directors of photography. Production designers are Mark Friedberg (“Joker,” “Paterson”) and Marco Bittner-Rosser (“Only Lovers Left Alive,” “Tár”). Editing was led by Gonçalves (“I'm Still Here,” “Paterson”), with music by Jarmusch and Anika. 

Jarmusch explained during the 2023 Overlook Film Festival (via The Playlist) that “Father Mother Sister Brother” almost had no music at all. “It's a very subtle film; it's very quiet,” Jarmusch said. “And I think music could move it too much one way — it's a funny and sad film, right? It sort of has both woven in. I don't know if I want to have music to add some other thing over it. It doesn't really want it so far.”

“Father Mother Sister Brother” is produced by Charles Gillibert, Joshua Astrachan, Carter Logan, and Atilla Salih Yücer. The film is produced and presented by Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello, MUBI, and Fremantle company The Apartment, with Jarmusch's Badjetlag and Gillibert's CG Cinema. In Ireland, Richard Bolger and Conor Barry at Hail Mary Pictures co-produced with financing provided by Fís Éireann and Screen Ireland. Cinema Inutile brought equity finance.

 










Cinéart will release the film in Benelux in collaboration with MUBI. The Match Factory is handling international sales. Gersh represented the North American rights. Jarmusch is represented by Bart Walker of The Gersh Agency and Victoria Cook and Hayden Goldblatt at Frankfurt, Kurnit, Klein & Selz.

The Venice Film Festival is back on the Lido for its 82nd edition, kicking off August 27-September 6. The packed lineup of auteur premieres heading to Italy include new films from Olivier Assayas, Guillermo del Toro, Mona Fastvold, Kathryn Bigelow, Noah Baumbach, Yorgos Lanthimos, Benny Safdie, Jim Jarmusch, Park Chan-wook, László Nemes, François Ozon, Pietro Marcello, and many more in competition.

Out of competition, we'll see new films from Luca Guadagnino (“After the Hunt”), Werner Herzog (“Ghost Elephants”), Sofia Coppola (Marc Jacobs documentary “Marc by Sofia”), Charlie Kaufman (the short “How to Shoot a Ghost”), Julian Schnabel (“In the Hand of Dante”), Gus Van Sant (“Dead Man's Wire”), Laura Poitras (“Cover-Up”), Lucrecia Martel (“Nuestra Tierra”), and Tsai Ming-liang (“Back Home”)

Artistic director Alberto Barbera's programmers had already unveiled a wave of announcements before Tuesday's lineup: Alexander Payne heads up the jury, Paolo Sorrentino's “La Grazia” opens the festival Italian-style, and Werner Herzog and Kim Novak will receive honorary Golden Lions at the opening ceremony to celebrate lifetime achievement. Novak is the subject of Alexandre Philippe's latest Hitchcock close-read, “Kim Novak's Vertigo,” made with the star's participation.

 










A no-show on Venice's list that was expected to premiere here? Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” with Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley. That will play Telluride before heading to Toronto, as TIFF on Monday announced the drama as a Canadian premiere. As expected, Netflix will have a strong showing with multiple titles including Kathryn Bigelow's “A House of Dynamite,” Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” and the out-of-competition Italian true-crime series “Il Mostro,” about a notorious cold-case serial killer known as the Monster of Florence. Netflix's latest collaboration with “All Quiet on the Western Front” Oscar winner Edward Berger, “Ballad of a Small Player,” skips Venice for Telluride and TIFF only.

As previously known, indie film distributor MUBI brings at least two titles so far to Venice: Paolo Sorrentino's Venice opener “La Grazia” as well as Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother,” the beat poet filmmaker's first time in Venice competition. (“Coffee and Cigarettes” played out of competition in 2003.)

A few highlights from Alberto Barbera's nearly two-hour press conference, which included the announcement of a Venice-record-making 15 documentaries out of competition, below.

The decision to premiere Venice perennial Luca Guadagnino's cancel-culture thriller “After the Hunt” (October 10, Amazon/MGM Studios) out of competition was a mutual one between Guadagnino and the studio. Guadagnino premiered “Queer” last year in competition, with “Challengers” originally set to open Venice 2023 before Guadagnino and Amazon/MGM Studios agreed to shuffle it out of the festival due to the strikes.

 










Mona Fastvold's latest collaboration with her husband Brady Corbet, “The Testament of Ann Lee,” which she directs and he co-writes with her, was also shot in 70mm in Hungary like “The Brutalist.” It's a “sort of musical,” per Barbera, starring Amanda Seyfried as the founder of the religious Shaker sect.

Julian Schnabel's out-of-competition, 150-minute epic “In the Hand of Dante,” starring Oscar Isaac (also at the festival with “Frankenstein”), arrives uncut after a battle, Barbera described, between Schnabel and his financiers to pare down the running time. “Most movies [at the festival] last from 2 hours and 15 minutes up to 2 hrs and 30 minutes,” Barbera said. “This is the new international standard, which is quite concerning for those who have to program the movies because packing all of them in our agenda is quite a problem.”

On the documentary side, Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel's “Nuestra Tierra” is in fact the previously titled “Chocobar.” The non-fiction feature, long tipped for festivals like Cannes over the years, examines colonialism in her home country and the assassination of indigenous leader Javier Chocobar.

Laura Poitras, who won the Golden Lion in 2022 for “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,” delivers another made-in-secret documentary, co-directed with longtime “Frontline” producer Mark Obenhaus. It's about the legacy of investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who exposed the cover-up of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam, and covered the Watergate scandal and other U.S. misdeeds throughout his career, including the torture of Abu Ghraib prisoners for The New Yorker.

 










Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth's Marianne Faithfull documentary “Broken English” (named for her 1979 studio album) features interpretive reenactments from “The End” co-stars George MacKay and Tilda Swinton.

Gus Van Sant's first feature since 2018's “Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot” is the out-of-competition thriller “Dead Man's Wire,” starring Bill Skarsgård in the true story of 1977 mortgage company hostage situation. Barbera also singled out co-star Al Pacino's performance as a special one.

Oliver Assayas' competition premiere “The Wizard of Kremlin” (based on Giuliano da Empoli's 2022 Moscow-set novel) imagines the rise of Putin through the fictional character of his spin doctor, played by Paul Dano in a performance Barbera also highlighted. 

The 21-film competition includes five features directed by women: Kaouther Ben Hania's “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” Taiwanese actress Shu Qi's directorial debut “Girl,” Valérie Donzelli's “À Pied d'Oeuvre,” Bigelow's “A House of Dynamite,” and Fastvold's film.

As a refresher, last year, Pedro Almodóvar's “The Room Next Door” won the Golden Lion under the jury led by Isabelle Huppert. Venice is the next major stop on the fall awards season after Cannes' initial launch, though Venice doesn't program any Croisette repeats, opting for world premieres that then head to Telluride, TIFF, NYFF, and beyond. Brady Corbet won best director at Venice last year for “The Brutalist,” setting up the film's Oscar run.

 










Under jury leader Payne, the rest of the panel of filmmakers and talent (yet to be announced) will decide the Golden Lion winner for the best film, among other awards such as the Silver Lions for Grand Jury Prize and best director, Volpi Cup for best actress and best actor, the screenplay award, the Special Jury Prize, and the Marcello Mastroianni Award for best new young actor or actress.

The long-awaited “Happy Gilmore 2” celebrated its premiere in New York City on Monday, July 21 at Jazz at Lincoln Center, along with a massive array of talent including stars Adam Sandler, Julie Bowen, Benny Safdie, Bad Bunny, and Kid Cudi, to name a few. Sandler reprises his role as the titular unsuccessful ice hockey player turned unlikely golf pro.

Sandler's “Grown Ups” co-star Kevin James revealed that a third installment may be on the horizon. “I think you can keep hope alive,” James told The Direct. “I can say that. I would keep a lot of hope alive. And I think it's happening—something's happening. I can say that.”

“It would be fun, that would be fun,” Sandler told IndieWire on the “Happy Gilmore 2” carpet. “We're always thinking of some shit and trying to get us all together. I've heard chatter.” As for if he is down for “Grown Ups 3,” Sandler says, “When it happens, I've got to let you know. I just don't know what the fuck we're doing right now, but we're trying to figure out stuff.”

We also had a chance to catch up with Safdie, who's next project, “The Smashing Machine,” releases in theaters on October 3 from A24. The biopic follows UFC legend Mark Kerr, led by Dwayne Johnson. “It was one of the most incredible things to witness,” Safdie told IndieWire of Johnson's unrecognizable transformation.

“He was just so committed and amazing,” he continued. “To see him walking amongst, like, 400 people, and everybody being like, ‘When's Dwayne going to get here?' He's just walking amongst everybody. Everything about him changed. It was really, really cool.”

“You really understand the fears, the love, the sadness, the happiness,” Safdie previously said of just how great Johnson is. “If somebody's open to doing that and talking about that stuff, then they're going to be able to give a great performance. Because of how physically strong he is, I don't know if a lot of people give him that opportunity.”

“Happy Gilmore 2” is directed by Kyle Newacheck (“Workaholics,” “What We Do in the Shadows”), who also previously helmed Sandler's 2019 film “Murder Mystery.” Sandler cowrote “Happy Gilmore 2” with Tim Herlihy, who also cowrote the original.

It premieres July 25 on Netflix. Check out the trailer here.

FKA twigs has agreed to drop her long-running lawsuit against her former boyfriend Shia LaBeouf. According to documents obtained by Pitchfork, the musician and her lawyers filed a request to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, meaning that FKA twigs cannot refile the case.

In a joint statement shared with Pitchfork, attorneys Bryan J. Freedman and Shawn Holley said, on behalf of their respective clients, FKA twigs and Shia LaBeouf: “Committed to forging a constructive path forward, we have agreed to settle our case out of court. While the details of the settlement will remain private, we wish each other personal happiness, professional success, and peace in the future.”

FKA twigs originally sued Shia LaBeouf in December 2020, claiming that the actor subjected her to “relentless abuse,” sexual battery, assault, and emotional distress. She had been seeking $10 million in damages.

Speaking with The New York Times, FKA twigs further described the alleged abuse she endured during her relationship with LaBeouf. “What I went through with Shia was the worst thing I've ever been through in the whole of my life,” she said. “I don't think people would ever think that it would happen to me. But I think that's the thing. It can happen to anybody.”

LaBeouf has long denied many of FKA twigs' claims of abuse.

Jonathan Richman has spent the better part of his five-plus-decade career as a sunny, reassuring presence on the fringes of American rock, rhapsodizing about the mundane rhythms of everyday life. He never came close to the Billboard charts but his cult was big enough to edge into the mainstream. When the Farrelly brothers needed a friendly face to defuse the raunchiness of 1998's There's Something About Mary, they asked Richman to serve as the comedy's Greek chorus; alone among alternative-minded singer-songwriters of the era, he radiated unabashed humor and unguarded emotion.

Given Richman's customary gentleness, it's genuinely disconcerting hearing him sing about mortality. “When I make my transition, I want everyone to know I only changed positions,” he sings at the outset of Only Frozen Sky Anyway, his 18th studio album—an acknowledgement that the 74-year-old singer-songwriter has accepted the inevitability (if not the finality) of his eventual passage from this particular astral plane.

Though he doesn't dwell on the subject, death is the thread that ties together Only Frozen Sky Anyway. He admits as much in the record's brief liner notes, writing of the deceptively lively “Se Va Pa'volver” that it represents a theme that took shape during the album's recording sessions this past January: “The song is about how our friends are leaving, in their dying, on an errand, only to return. In another role. With another mission.”

Old friends were on Richman's mind when he headed into the studio alongside his longtime drummer Tommy Larkins and keyboardist Jerry Harrison, who played in Richman's original Modern Lovers lineup before departing to join Talking Heads. In his notes, the Richman salutes Andy Paley, a power-pop legend who ran in the same Boston circles as the Modern Lovers and died last November; early in the 1970s, he and Harrison played together in the Sidewinders, and he later produced Richman's 1996 album Surrender to Jonathan!

Paley's passing adds resonance to Harrison's reunion with Richman, lending the impression that the two old colleagues are seizing the opportunity to make music while they still can. The keyboardist returned to the fold nearly a decade ago but he's a major presence on Only Frozen Sky Anyway, seamlessly joining a collective that's augmented by a handful of auxiliary musicians including Nicole Montalbano, Richman's wife, who serves as a co-producer and occasional tamboura player.

It's an intimate group, one responsive to Richman's proclivities and quirks. He may be pondering the great transitions, but that doesn't mean he's abandoned the music he's held dear for years. As he puts it on “The Wavelet,” a meditative drone that closes the album: “I don't want to go to sleep now, I want to dance.”

And dance he does throughout, going so far as to rejigger the Bee Gees' “Night Fever,” stripping away its insistent disco beat to reveal something gentle and reassuring, a makeover that rhymes with the sepia romanticism of “That Older Girl.” Richman doesn't stray from the sensibility he cultivated in the 1980s, preferring to keep his backbeat so subdued, it almost feels like texture. The buoyant bop of “David & Goliath” helps pull the record into perspective; Larkins gives the song a palpable groove, where the rest of his rhythms are as painterly as Harrison's nuanced keyboard.

The loose, intuitive instrumental interplay is crucial to the album's charm. Often, songs feel as if they're conjured from the air: Lyrics are rudimentary yet keenly felt; melodies drift into view only to evaporate shortly afterward. Larkins and Harrison take their cues from Richman, enhancing his eccentricities and also deepening his sweetness, a blend that gives such flights of fancy as “Little Black Bat” a jolt of giddiness. Their subtle, shifting support also adds depth to the bookending “I Was Just a Piece of Frozen Sky Anyway” and “The Wavelet,” the songs where Richman feels the passing of time acutely. Larkins adds a heartbeat, Harrison suggests the vast unknown, as Richman sings with a warm, open heart. The combination is effective and affecting, in part because the sensibility is so familiar: Richman hasn't changed his style, but rather uncovered unexpected emotional dimensions within himself, a discovery that makes Only Frozen Sky Anyway surprisingly moving.

How far would you go to escape a screen? Some people turn to apps to fend off digital distraction. Others stash their phones in timer-equipped lockboxes. The truly desperate—or truly liberated—opt for dumbphones, happy cavemen pawing prehistoric Nokias. Sofie Birch and Antonina Nowacka, on the other hand, decamped to Sokołowsko, a tiny village on Poland's southern border, where a century before, consumptive patients made pilgrimages in search of clear waters and restorative air.

It wasn't just their phones they were fleeing. The two musicians—whose previous collaboration, 2022's Languoria, fused synthesizers and keening voices in heady ambient mysticism—were in search of more immediate ways of making music, unburdened by MIDI cables or Ableton dropdowns. They brought with them zithers, harps, classical guitars, and a Nagra reel-to-reel tape machine, and set up beneath the trees to improvise and record the songs that would become Hiraeth, which drifts even deeper into the bewitching universe they conjured on their last album.

For Nowacka, at least, this sort of spontaneous music-making was second nature. The Polish singer and experimental musician—a student of European opera, Hindustani classical, and Javanese vocal styles—once traipsed across the state of Oaxaca by bus, seeking out dusty churches where she recorded spine-tingling vocal improvisations. On another trip, she set up her recorder in lightless Indonesian caves, dissolving into the penumbral air and stony reverb. Even Languoria was hardly a high-tech extravaganza, sketched out in hushed voices and atmospheric tones that rippled like morning light on a still pond. But Hiraeth's almost entirely acoustic palette is starker still. Even more importantly, while Languoria might have been made in any home studio anywhere in the world, Hiraeth is deeply infused with a sense of place.

The title track begins with the low murmur of a stream and the buzzing of bees before classical guitar and harp begin braiding curlicues in the air. “Stars on the ground” folds the dappled brilliance of birdsong into atonal plucks and gamelan-like bells. In “Love object,” a cricket keeps time with a carefully plucked acoustic guitar beneath Nowacka's sylph-like singing, its chirping uncannily synchronized. Even in the absence of explicit field-recorded details, the whole album unfolds like a landscape painting, stringed instruments filling in gently curved lines with microtonal color. The players are not so much unplugged from electronic sources as fused directly into their surroundings.

That's not to say that Hiraeth is naive or steeped in new-age woo-woo. The first song, “Rabbit's Hole,” runs backward, reversing a portion of the following track; given the Alice in Wonderland-referencing title, its backmasked harp, zither, and voice seem designed to suggest slipping down a conduit to an alternate reality.

Beyond the novelty of the artists' approach or the simple warmth of the acoustic textures, the real magic happens when they lock into a trance-inducing musical pattern. Over the nearly nine minutes of “Collecting eyes,” the album's most hypnotic song, a steadily plucked steel-string pattern offers an invisible framework for Nowacka and Birch's graceful vocal counterpoints, chiming perfect fifths locked into a hypnotic cyclical pattern. Most songs are structured around a single pair of chords, at most, but unusual tunings and shivery microtones turn what might seem merely idyllic into an expression of some weirder, wilder energy. Nowacka's voice, with its breathy edge and rapid-fire vibrato, is a beam of light tracing the contours of hidden dimensions.

After their initial outdoor sessions, the two returned to the studio, where they layered in instruments like pipe organ and Yamaha DX7. But those additional elements are never overpowering. Instead, they add helpful shading and contrast, like the slow-moving bass tone that anchors the flyaway strings of “Comes with sunrise.” The album's title is a Welsh word that describes deep, nameless longing, like the Sehnsucht of German or the saudade of Portuguese; perhaps it signals a desire to return to the rolling hills of Sokołowsko and that prelapsarian state of being where they found themselves at play in the fields, communing with the birds and coaxing vibrations from the air. Hiraeth is a testament that there are realms beyond our ordinary perception; sometimes you just have to leave something behind to find them.

“Anonymity sometimes feels like a mistake,” said two of dance music's most doggedly anonymous artists in an unusually heartfelt Instagram post earlier this month. British dance music duo Two Shell were reflecting on their set at Glastonbury's huge IICON stage, lamenting that people still wonder if it's actually them up on stage, and then sounding almost defensive: “It was us, and we put our hearts and minds into it.”

This level of sincerity is the antithesis of the group's trickster approach. Self-destructing interviews; decoys pantomiming DJ sets beamed in from halfway across the world; password-protected tracks on a confusing website—there's not a smokescreen they haven't tried. Now, at “the end of a chapter,” they're ready to be taken seriously. Two Shell have touched on this before: “We're tired of hiding,” in Mixmag. “Our pranks don't mean we're not sincere,” in The Guardian. But even those interviews were silly, just further music-PR 4D chess moves to keep everyone else off their game. This disarming post is different. The jig is up. These are just two ordinary lads who make catchy electronic music, and they want to enjoy their success instead of pretending to be above it. Maybe?

Joke or not, there's a world-weary tone to their post-Glastonbury missive that also weighs down IIcons like a wet blanket. The album-allergic duo calls the 12-track release a “playlist” of tracks from their sets over the past year. It's still plenty kooky—the easiest way to describe opener “Can You Hear Me?” is cybernetic bagpipe dubstep, where shrill woodwinds duel with wobbling basslines—but it's also surprisingly been-there-done-that. Skippy beats, shiny synths, mangled vocals that play tricks on your memory. In the heady days of “home,” a treasure trove of​ new Two Shell tunes would have set the dance music internet alight. IIcons just feels expected, as if their mass appeal and crossover success have driven them closer to the middle of the road. I guess if you play enough big festival stages, you start making music for big festival stages.

The best tracks on IIcons carry the duo's idiosyncratic genius like a still-burning Olympic torch. “Clutch” is a monster: evil techno-trance-pop that sounds like it's stomping out of a sewer, all gurgling basslines and huge kick drums. The vocal moves in mysterious ways, bending and resolving at right angles, more ambivalent than anthemic. This has always been their greatest trick: stripping the human voice of its humanity. It's like they scooped out the breath and left only the disembodied vibrations hanging in the air, the sensation of words and feelings without any meaning.

Ambiguity is Two Shell's secret weapon, because it makes you go back, over and over, to figure out what the hell they're actually doing. The rush of “Doom Culture” is brain-scrambling. Shrill synths and curdled basslines hint at aggression, but the rigid kick and strangled vocal sound more like a deeply abstracted ballroom bitch track. “⋆₊˚vision✧‧⁺˖⋆.” is slip-n-slide garage, threatening to careen out of control as every sound is beveled and polished to a skeuomorphic sheen. The staggering “Dark Shadow” sounds both brooding and cartoonish, invoking dubstep's dentist-drill basslines with equal parts menace and humor, while the vocal captures the icky sensation of accidentally chewing foil. These tracks are uncomfortable and uncanny—never just one thing at any given time—and you can hear in them the excitement that the duo seemed to radiate in every direction when it hit its stride around 2022.

The rest of IIcons is more predictable. The potential hit, “finding my spirit,” tackles a house track head on where Two Shell would usually zig-zag, with a vocal that feels strangely serious. It sounds so much like a Four Tet song that it's already associated with Four Tet, and it lacks the alien contours we look for in a Two Shell tune. Other tracks, like “eXist” and “Moving Shadow,” are perfectly fine, though they also sound like fairly standard riffs on UK dance music, without the weirdness or ugliness that makes the duo's best music stick jaggedly in your brain.

Lucky for us, Two Shell remain absolutely sick producers. It often feels like they dreamed up new rare-earth elements and tried to map them in sound—soft, hard, metallic, plasticine, jiggy, all at once—and they're still pushing the needle leftward. They make underground dance music more pop-friendly, and the pop-friendly side of things more confrontational and silly. But IIcons also shows us that for all their… iconoclasm… Two Shell are heading down a well-trodden path. Their original tactic of taking the piss out of DJ culture doesn't make as much sense now that they're as popular and revered as the big-time selectors they once poked fun at. “The intention was never to troll,” they say in that Instagram post. “It was to question what we are and whether it matters.""

It might be a cliché, but what really matters is the music. Even if IIcons is not their best, it's still far more interesting than most of what gets played on the big stages Two Shell occupy these days. Hopefully the duo can rest up, find some new inspiration, and take off their disguises. Or just get some newer, crazier ones. They could open a restaurant, start a fake nation-state, make dance music for pets. They could also just be Jack and Patrick (or “Pete”), pumping out insidiously hooky dance tracks without hiding behind anything at all, learning from their mistakes and having fun making new ones.

	President Donald Trump appears to be growing increasingly desperate to turn the national conversation away from his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He spent the weekend suggesting prominent Democrats should be prosecuted over bogus right-wing conspiracy theories, and on Tuesday he said it outright.


	“Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.


	Trump was asked which Democratic figures the Justice Department should target specifically in light of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's recent call for Obama administration officials to be “prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law” over claims that they “manufactured” intelligence to allege Russia worked to get Trump elected in 2016.


	“It would be President Obama, he started it,” Trump replied. “The leader of the gang was President Obama. Barack Hussein Obama, have you heard of him?” he continued. “He's guilty, it's not a question. This was treason. This was every word you could think of. They tried to steal the election.”

	











	“This is like proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious, that Obama was trying to lead a coup,” Trump said later. “It was with Hillary Clinton, with all of these other people, but Obama headed it up. … This is the biggest scandal in the history of our country.”


	Several investigations and review  — including a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review in 2020 — have concluded that Russia worked to elect Trump over Clinton in 2016. Trump has repeatedly called the idea a “hoax,” and has similarly been calling the Epstein scandal a “hoax” in the face of backlash to the Justice Department announcing it would not be releasing any more material on the sex offender and longtime friend of the president — despite Trump and top Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, promising supporters they would release the government's files on Epstein and the elites potentially in league with the disgraced financier.

	Trump's history with Epstein has been under the microscope as his administration has tried to bury the story. The Wall Street Journal reported last week on a salacious birthday note Trump wrote for Epstein in the early 2000s, and in which he allegedly wrote about how the two “have certain things in common.” Rolling Stone reported on the lengths the administration went to kill the story, which Trump has denied. The president sued the Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, for publishing the piece last week.


	Trump is now going on the offensive against his political enemies over long-disproven conspiracy theories, ostensibly to distract from his ties to a sex offender. “We caught Hillary Clinton, we caught Barack Hussein Obama,” Trump said, adding: “It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. You ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense.”

	The U.K.'s Channel 4 will pack two decades of success into a new, two-part documentary series, tentatively titled Taylor. Directed by Guy King, the docuseries will explore Taylor Swift‘s evolution during her explosive rise to the top of pop stardom, utilizing additions from a “rare archive” and commentary from experts and fans.


	“Taylor Swift is an unprecedentedly powerful 21st-century voice for women and young people,” King shared in a statement, per Deadline. “Under the microscope of social media since the earliest days of MySpace and Tumblr, she came of age during a new feminist wave. With her fame came controversy, which she so skillfully wrestled to the floor. We're excited to tell her story.”


Taylor will be produced by Sandpaper Films, which previously helmed the feature documentaries Doom Scroll: Andrew Tate and the Dark Side of the Internet, A Deadly American Marriage, Investigating Diana, and more. Jessica Brady will lead production with Lina Caicedo as archive producer. Sandpaper Films' Susannah Price and Henry Singer will serve as executive producers. Martin Thompson will edit the two-part release.

	











	Rumors about the documentary series first surfaced in April 2025, weeks before Swift gained ownership of her music catalog after successfully purchasing the master recordings of her first six studio albums from Shamrock Holdings. The musician's rapidly evolving narrative makes it difficult to capture the full expanse of her career. Five years have passed since Swift released her own documentary, Miss Americana, and everything has changed in that brief period of time.

	Since 2020, Swift has released four original studio albums and four re-recordings of previously released albums. She also embarked on The Eras Tour, which ultimately became the highest-grossing tour in history. 


	Last year, Channel 4 aired the documentary The Rise and Rise of Taylor Swift: Untold, about how Swift's “incredibly loyal fanbase helped carry her to the top.” A release date has not yet been set for Taylor.

	The 22-year-old accused of killing an American Idol music supervisor and her husband last week allegedly used the couple's own gun, which they kept in their home. 


	Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman shared this detail at a town hall in Encino Monday, July 21, according to ABC 7. Hochman also said that, after allegedly killing Robin Kaye and Thomas Deluca, suspect Raymond Boodarian used his own cellphone to call the police and gave the cops his name.


	Kaye and Deluca were killed at their Encino home on July 14, with LAPD officers discovering their bodies while conducting a wellness check. Boodarian was arrested the next day “without incident,” the police said.


	The suspect was eventually charged with two counts of murder with enhancements for killing the couple while committing a robbery, intentionally using a firearm, and committing multiple murders. He also faces a burglary charge. At a court hearing last week, Boodarian was ordered to stay in jail until his arraignment on Aug. 20. He has yet to enter a plea.

	In a previous statement, LAPD investigators said, “While there were no signs of forced entry or trouble at the location during that investigation, it is now believed that the suspect had gained entry into the residence through an unlocked door. The victims returned home while the suspect was inside their residence, and a confrontation ensued, which resulted in the suspect taking their lives.”

	Kaye was a longtime music supervisor on American Idol, joining the show in 2009 and working on nearly 300 episodes. She also worked as a music supervisor for Miss Universe, Lip Sync Battle, The Dance Scene, Crashed, and several other shows. Deluca, meanwhile, was a songwriter and musician.

	











	“We are devastated to hear of Robin and her dear husband, Tom's, passing,” a spokesperson for American Idol previously told Rolling Stone. “Robin has been a cornerstone of the Idol family since 2009 and was truly loved and respected by all who came in contact with her. Robin will remain in our hearts forever, and we share our deepest sympathy with her family and friends during this difficult time.”

	In some ways, Reneé Rapp was burnt out before she even really got started. The singer-songwriter-actor's 2023 debut album, Snow Angel, preceded a major tour, a starring role in the blockbuster movie musical adaptation of Mean Girls and the end of her run on the hit HBO series The Sex Lives of College Girls. After all of that, Rapp, 25, took some time for herself while making her fun, bratty, propulsive new record, Bite Me, in the process. Now that she's on the hamster wheel of pop stardom again, she's still not sure how she feels about it. “I make music for myself, but I don't put out music for myself,” she says. “I don't promote things for myself. If I was just going to do [it all] for myself, I wouldn't put shit out in the first place. I'd have a different career.” 


	The career Rapp chose is heating up again, with Bite Me, due Aug. 1, already looking like one of the year's most exciting pop albums — led by the effectively punky lead single “Leave Me Alone” as well as the incredibly catchy “Mad.” There's also a fall arena tour to look forward to. As she gears up for both, Rapp reflects on the making of the album, settling into life with her rising guitar-hero pop star girlfriend Towa Bird, and how she's managing the public's perception of her no-fucks-given style. 

	











You recorded your debut album after 14-hour days on set for Mean Girls. What was it like having a little more space to write and record Bite Me?I tried to be more careful and cognizant of my time spent making this project, not only taking time to make it, but also really controlling what was going on around me. I started seeking my own approval, which was the biggest difference. And not only did I try to cultivate my own approval, but I was trying to cultivate my own environment. When I was making these songs, I was going out and seeing my fucking friends.

	











	I was in the streets, and that felt so good. I just started doing what I wanted, and I started liking my life more. I was able to write songs from experiences that absolutely wrecked and destroyed me and turn them into something listenable, as opposed to just saying, “I'm so depressed I can kill myself.” I [wanted to] write a song about a situation that almost did kill me, but say it in a mocking way of “That's so funny that you would do that to me.” I wanted to make these songs irreverent and resilient and crying, but smiling at the same time.

Why was the irreverence important in the delivery?It's just how I talk. I pretty much communicate everything in that way. Not to sound like SheEO, but I like to do everything with a sense of power. I like to make sure that the ball will always be in my court, even if I got royally fucked over and terrorized by people I worked with. I've never wanted to give anyone any power over me even if they've hurt me, like those are my emotions. Those are my feelings. I just approach everything with a dark-humored resilience. I love making light out of the terrible things that have happened to me, or things that I think are terrible experiences that I've had. What [else] am I going to do? Wallow in self-pity?


A great example of that is the song “That's So Funny,” this emotional-seeming ballad that doesn't wallow for too long. What situation inspired that one?I think that was the last song that was written for the album. I had written a song on my first album, “Poison Poison,” about [the same] situation, and I was just so pissed and angry. [On “Poison Poison,” the song makes clear it's about another woman who has been in Rapp's life.] There's no other way I want to approach this than a fucking diss [song]. I want this to be so vengeful and bitey, and we rewrote the verses of “Poison Poison” because they were too personal. 


	Then more shit happened with this situation last year, and it got to the point where I don't even feel anger. I mean, I always feel anger towards it, but one of the overwhelming things I wanted to write about was what has happened to me is so diabolical. And I'm still standing. I'm still just walking away from this, trying as hard as I can to keep my mouth shut. And yes, this is me keeping my mouth shut, which I know doesn't say much, but I wanted it to reflect how deeply hurt I was by that situation.

What were some of the influences on these songs?Interestingly enough, the biggest writing influences are more so personalities, like my dad. He's not a songwriter, but he's the most funny fucking person on planet Earth. He's hilarious, and so warm and loved and loving, but is flawed and so honest about it in a way that I admire so much. Musically, Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill was so influential. The powerhouse that is Joan Jett. We also took a lot of writing inspiration just from people, like a bad bitch all around like Kate Moss. A lot of the inspiration came from attitude and personality and people that I love and people that I admire.


On “At Least I'm Hot,” you worked with your girlfriend, the singer-songwriter and guitarist Towa Bird. What was it like to be in the studio with her?We do so much of life together. She's my best friend. I love being around her. I hate having to see other people. I fucking hate going to work now. Again, I used to hate my personal life, so I used to drown myself and work constantly so that I could avoid the people that I was around and myself and the situations that I had gotten myself into. Now, it's the complete opposite. I had to go to the studio super late the other night, and I was so pissed because I was like, “Fuck you guys. These are my wife hours.”


	I get scared working with her sometimes because she's just really intimidating. As a person, she's really cool. And I think the world of her. When she came in to cut her part on “At Least I'm Hot,” I felt so anxious because I don't like asking people for anything. It makes me deeply insecure. I even get scared when I ask my girlfriend to work with me. But we work together all the time, and I force my way into working on her shit too.


The last time we spoke you were feeling burnt out before you even released Snow Angel. What was it like to take a break before easing into Bite Me?It was really scary. It takes a long time to figure out how to actually let yourself take a break. I just reached a point where I was like, “Damn, I just don't like this anymore. I don't exactly need to feel like I have guns to my head all the time. I can actually enjoy this.” I was miserable. I hated everything. Taking a break was a train wreck because it was so hard to stop. I couldn't just pull out of every fucking show I had booked or festival. So it was a little bit difficult, but I think that ultimately it was really great for me.


	The biggest [incentive] was that I really liked my personal life. I've always relied on my work life because I hate my personal life. But now that I actually like the former, I feel more comfortable taking time. I'm also really fucking stubborn and very defiant. Everybody was like, “All right, time to put more music out.” And I was like, “I'm not gonna do that. I'm actually quite sad.” I don't want to fall into the puppet narrative of artists.

	











Your defiance is something that has made a lot of people really love and respect you. Have you always found it easy to stand your ground and stick up for yourself in these situations, or has it become easier as you've gotten older?I think it was something I was born with and it's always been my attitude, for better or for worse. I come across very self-assured, and I think in a lot of ways, I am. But I also, at the same time, just have the constant, nagging voice asking me if I'm fucking up, or if I'm not doing enough, or if I'm not good enough. I feel so different from how I'm perceived. Yes, I was self-assured enough to be like, “I'm gonna take time off and stop listening to people.” And also, whilst I was doing that, I was freaking the absolute fuck out every single day.


But also also having those boundaries means you give a lot of fucks.I care so much about my career holistically. I care so much about making music and making good shit and, like, making sure that when I'm putting myself out there that I feel really connected to what I'm doing. I had just lost that [after the Snow Angel tour], and I was trying so desperately to find it, but it's really difficult to do when you're so underwater. I feel like not enough people give artists enough credit, maybe myself included, for running your own business. Like, yeah we make music and fuck-ass TikToks and do all this bullshit. And it is super fun. But ultimately we run really big operations.


What was it like to build that operation and experience the parts of being a pop star outside the studio?I always thought when I was younger that I'm such a performer. I do love to be out there, but I actually like the making of an album much more than I do the promotion and seeing it come to life. It's not like I don't like promoting it and sharing it and like talking about it, but there's something that is scary, again. No matter how calm, cool, collected, bitchy, or defiant I come off, I'm deeply terrified. 


	I always thought that was something that was so clear about me, until I started being publicly perceived in a more massive way, and then you become aware of how you come across, more so than you probably should be. It's nice watching things come to life, but to be completely honest, it's so fucking scary. It's difficult managing so many people who all really want to work together and be great. It's hard to trust the process and to trust the universe, and also constantly be slutting myself out. Sometimes I'm happy and other times I feel like I'm underwater and gonna cry.

	











Is there any element of how people perceive you that shocks you?I learned that people really get things wrong and are really loud about it. At first, I struggled with that because I would see so many things about my life and experiences online that were so untrue, and it made me so frustrated and so angry. I felt this deep need to defend myself, and then I started to realize that I actually don't owe [anyone] my life story. I used to think [there was] no way things can be misconstrued that much. It is kind of interesting and funny watching everyone's theories all the time. I'm like, “How on God's green earth did you get here?”


What's the funniest theory you've seen recently?I did a Ziwe interview. It's such a satirical show, and she's such a fucking talented comedian. And after that interview came out, I saw a video that was like, “I can't believe Reneé would say that we should euthanize old people.” And I'm like, hang on. Did you guys miss the part that this is satire? I also said that we should stab people more. Do you genuinely believe I think we should stab people more and euthanize the old? Are we fucking stupid? I actually find it entertaining, but it does shock me sometimes. 


What terrifies you most about getting Bite Me out in the world?I love it so much. I worked so hard on it, and I had so much fun making it that I think the hard part is not shooting myself in the foot by getting really anxious about it. I feel like I made music from places that were really scary for me, not to sound like such a pick-me. So to put it out into the world, and not know if it's going to be received in the way that it feels for me is scary.

People seem to be receiving the singles well so far. I really struggle to be able to feel it. No matter how many times anybody tells me that it's going so well, the deeply rooted fear of not being enough or not being good enough takes over in my brain. 


What are the exciting, happy moments that have broken through that feeling?When we put the tour on sale, and sold out some of those venues so quickly, that was nice. I remember I actually was really happy for a couple minutes, and then it went to shit. But I had a couple of fleeting moments of joy.Part of what makes your personal life so much better now seems to be the really powerful group of friends surrounding you, like Megan Thee Stallion, Cara Delevingne, and your former Sex Lives co-star Alyah Chanelle Scott. What has it been like finding people in the industry you can lean on as much as your childhood friends?I pride myself on having good friends. I pride myself on having protective friends. I have a massive case of impostor syndrome that I thought would go away by now, but it's not fucking going away. But I have so many friends in the industry who are so lovely and fucking amazing. I don't really reach out to them, because I feel like I'm bothering people. What I appreciate about Cara and Meg and friends like that is they've been such champions in my [life] and have made a real effort to be in my life and reassure me that they love me.

	The Caribbean Guard, a volunteer lifeguard association, issued a statement in the wake of Malcolm-Jamal Warner‘s drowning in Costa Rica. The actor, who was 54 years old, died of asphyxia after being caught by a high current while swimming on Sunday. No lifeguards were on duty, as their limited services had been allocated to other locations in the area, the association said. 


	“It was all very fast and even though there were people on the beach who came in to rescue him, they didn't arrive in time,” the Caribbean Guard said in a statement on Facebook. The association noted that Playa Grande, where the drowning occurred, is one of its “most challenging beaches.” It has patrolled the beach for “the last few years,” and notes that “it's a beach known by local surfers and there are signs (in English and Spanish) that warn of the danger of death by drowning.”


	While there would have normally been guards on duty at Playa Grande, they were redirected to patrol Playa Black and Chiquita, two other local beaches with prominent dangerous currents that recently experienced “water incidents.” The Caribbean Guard shared that it “deeply regrets” the actor's death, lamenting that “despite having been provided with CPR maneuvers on the beach” by locals, “his resuscitation was unsuccessful.”

	While unfortunate, the Caribbean Guard sees the incident as being indicative of a larger problem across Costa Rica and other countries in the Caribbean that will persist without direct intervention. “We appeal to the President of the Nation, the national government, the Municipality of Talamanca and the entire Caribbean community,” the association wrote, “to continue joining efforts to minimize this problem, which is sadly rising all over the country.”

	











	The volunteer group noted that “we do everything in our power,” and they have saved “numerous lives in recent years.” Without them, the statement continues, “drownings would could by the dozens.” Still, without the proper resources, their reach is limited, they wrote. “We do our part to minimize risks but if we don't have government help, clear public policies and strong support from local entrepreneurs,” they concluded, “this will keep happening.”

	Tributes are pouring in for the late Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who died Sunday at 54. After news broke that the actor died following an accidental drowning in Costa Rica, stars from Beyoncé and Jamie Foxx to his TV wife Tracee Ellis Ross and Jennifer Love Hewitt shared their condolences with his family and reflected on his legacy.


	“I cannot believe this. This hurts my heart,” Hewitt, who starred in 9-1-1 with Warner, wrote on Instagram. “A gentleman, an incredible talent and we were so lucky to have him in the ‘9-1-1' family. Heartbroken and sending love to his family.”


	Ellis Ross, who played his wife and lead role in Reed Between the Lines, shared her condolences on Instagram: “I love you, Malcolm. First I met you as Theo with the rest of the world then you were my first TV husband. My heart is so so sad. What an actor and friend you were: warm, gentle, present, kind, thoughtful, deep, funny, elegant.”


	She added: “You made the world a brighter place. Sending so much love to your family. I'm so sorry for this unimaginable loss.”

	










A post shared by Tracee Ellis Ross (@traceeellisross)


	For her part, Beyoncé updated her website with a tribute to the late actor, writing, “Rest in power Malcolm-Jamal Warner. Thanks for being a big part of our shared television history. You will be missed.”


	Sherri Shepherd, who starred in Sherri with him in 2009, wrote that she was “completely devastated” by his death. “He brought much laughter and gravitas playing my husband on my self-titled sitcom,” Shepherd said. “As someone who grew up on TV, Malcolm remained one of the most grounded people I've ever met in our business. To know Malcolm was to know a renaissance man that possessed humor, grace, humility and deep cultural appreciation.”

	











Viola Davis wrote that she was “speechless” and described how Theo — his character on The Cosby Show — was “OUR son, OUR brother, OUR friend.” She wrote: “Malcolm got it right… and now… we reveled in your life and are gutted by this loss. … We will speak your name — always.”

	Costa Rica National Police told ABC News that the actor died of asphyxia after swimming near Limon, Costa Rica. Police told the outlet he was caught by a high current. Warner was most known for The Cosby Show. Warner's role as the lovable Theodore Huxtable, the only son of Bill Cosby's Cliff Huxtable on the show, earned him a nod for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series at the 1986 Emmy Awards.

The ‘best ever UFO footage' has just had its authenticity verified by a ‘ufologist'.

This footage was captured by pilot Jorge A. Arteaga as he was flying over Colombia.

In it, a dark object can be seen emerging from the clouds and flying past the cockpit of Arteaga's plane.

A UFO expert has since come out to endorse the video, branding it ‘one of the greatest' pieces of evidence.

Arteaga and his co-pilot, Daniel, were in the skies above Colombia when they noticed the strange object moving in their direction.

At that point, Arteaga started filming and began to follow the UFO with the aircraft.

The pilot expressed fear when the object started moving towards him.

The aircraft was flying at a speed of 300KMH (186mph), with temperatures falling to five degrees Celsius.

We've seen a lot of UFO footage over the years, but this still stood out from the rest.

And a Ufologist agreed.

Jaime Maussan is a Mexican journalist with a very keen interest in alien activity.

Maussan spoke with Arteaga for an interview, and shared a clip to X.

 “We are facing one of the greatest UAP (UFO) evidences of all time; captured by the Captain Pilot Aviator @JorgeArteagaG,” he wrote in the caption.

Whether or not the word of a ufologist will be enough to sway skeptics remains to be seen.

It's no secret that there's a lot of UFO enthusiasts out there.

But can you blame them for being so fascinated?

A documentary came out earlier this year which claimed the US government had been involved in an '80-year cover-up' on the matter.

Then there were the whistleblowers testifying in Congress about ‘excessive secrecy' surrounding non-human intelligence.

And that's not forgetting all the video footage out there – like this object seen flying over New York City or this UFO spotted during an eclipse in Texas.

Who knows what the truth of the matter really is?

SOUTHWICK — Ronny LeBlanc, author of “Monsterland” and former star of “Expedition Bigfoot” on the Discovery channel, will dive into the Native American history as well as recent and personal sightings of high strangeness that some believe to be paranormal during a program hosted by the Public Library Wednesday.

“When we've had Bigfoot programs in the past, they've been very successful and we thought he'd be good to bring to Southwick,” Library Director Lynn Blair said about the program.

Clive Palmer's political parties Trumpets of Patriots and the United Australia Party (UAP) have not reported their privacy breach to her office, despite claiming to have done so, Australia's privacy commissioner says.

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) also left the door open to the possibility that the UAP will face penalties because an exemption for political parties from the Privacy Act may not apply as the UAP has been de-registered.  

Last week, Palmer's parties announced that they were the victims of a ransomware attack that had exposed “all emails to and from the Political Parties (including their attachments) and documents and records created and or held electronically by the Political Parties at any time”.

As part of a notice put on the parties' websites and sent to their email lists, the parties claimed to “reported the breach to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and to the Australian Signals Directorate.”

However, a spokesperson for the OAIC says it has no record of a breach being reported to the agency.

Neither a spokesperson for Palmer nor the privacy officer for the parties immediately responded to a request for comment. 

Under Australian privacy law, entities have 30 days to report a breach. Based on Palmer's parties' claim that an intruder was detected on 23 June, a formal report of the breach is due by tomorrow, 23 July. 

Political parties are exempt from the Privacy Act, which includes the obligation to report any breaches. 

Except the UAP may not be exempt. The party was “voluntarily deregistered” after the 2022 election, and was unsuccessful in its High Court bid to register before the last election. The UAP is still not registered according to the AEC.

An OAIC spokesperson said it had not confirmed whether “any or all of them are entitled to claim the political party exemption” given the recency of the event. 

“Any entity not covered by the exemption will need to adhere to the requirements of the Notifiable Data Breach scheme, as well as to the Privacy Act more generally,” they told Crikey.

Failing to report a breach can result in penalties under the Privacy Act. 

Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind questioned why political parties are exempted from Australia's privacy laws.

“The exemption is not only out of step with community expectations, it is not reflective of the nature and scope of risks to Australians' privacy in the digital era,” she said to Crikey.

The OAIC has always opposed the political party exemption, and Kind said that each new data breach was a reminder why Australian organisations should be improving their cybersecurity practices.

“The Australian community wants more, not fewer, protections on their privacy,” Kind said.

Contemporary Ireland is best thought of as a paranormal state. The paranormal is that which is “analogous or parallel to, but separate from or going beyond” known reality. The principle site of paranormal activity in Ireland is not some haunted castle or spooky seance. It is the Government coffers. We have a fiscal policy and a parafiscal one – a ghostly exchequer parallel to the known reality of the Irish economy.

By the end of this year, the State will have taken in roughly €186 billion in corporation taxes over the last decade. In many ways, the story of contemporary Ireland is encapsulated in the astonishing growth in the share of overall tax revenue contributed by corporation tax. In 1984, it was just 4 per cent. By 2014,  it had almost tripled to 11 per cent. It has by now almost tripled again to 29 per cent.

Most of this dizzying increase is what official bodies call “excess”. “In other words,” as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council puts it, “it cannot be explained by underlying domestic activity.” Or, in the Central Bank's formulation, it is “disconnected from actual economic activity in Ireland”. It is paranormal and, I think, unprecedented. Has any government in the history of the world ever been so dependent on the excessive and the inexplicable? Has any state ever driven such a great distance on the fumes of airy superfluity? 

To get a sense of the scale of this ectoplasmic largesse, we can ask: how much money would the State have taken in last year if the share of its revenues accounted for by corporation tax were the same as 2014?  The answer would be €11.9 billion. And what did the State actually take in corporation tax in 2024? That answer is €28 billion.

So we're looking at €16 billion of last year's revenue that was accounted for simply by the magical growth in the proportional contribution of corporation tax paid by a tiny number of American multinationals. To put that in context, €16 billion is the combined budget of the departments of Education and Transport this year. 

Little Ireland received more tax revenue from American corporations than any other country outside the US

At one level, of course, this windfall is not mysterious. The “excess” of magic money is a byproduct of the machinations of around 10 gigantic US-based corporations. They have transferred their intangible assets – patents, trademarks, brands and software licences – from overly obvious offshore tax havens to the more respectable but still very generous environs of Ireland.

The Irishness of this intellectual property (IP) is a legal fiction. We might call it IPP: Intellectual Plastic Paddy. But IPP allows the corporations to massively inflate the profits they declare here and the State to claim 12.5 per cent (now rising to 15 per cent) of those profits.

It might be reassuring to imagine that all this is the result of a cunning plan of Irish governments. But it isn't. The State was red in tooth and claw in its fight to stop the modest reforms to global tax regimes that resulted in the decisions of the multinationals to onshore their IP out of the tax havens and into Ireland. It went along with those reforms grudgingly and with bad grace when it had no real choice. This is the irony: the State has been enriched against its will, dragged kicking and screaming into Aladdin's cave.

Nonetheless, in 2022-2023, the latest year for which we have figures from the US, little Ireland received more tax revenue from American corporations than any other country outside the US. We got twice as much as China, three times as much as Germany, as much as India and Canada put together.

It is this  magic fountain that waters our parafiscal exchequer. The State essentially runs two budgets. One, based on actual economic activity in Ireland, is consistently in deficit. But the other, inflated by the IPP bonanza, is in flamboyantly extravagant surplus. The first is masked by the second. The paranormal occludes the normal.

So what? If we leave aside the morality – and by God do we ever leave aside the morality – it's free money. The luck of the Irish has turned from a sick joke into a daily reality. Why not just enjoy it?

The problem, though, is that paranormal activity is bewildering. It makes it hard to decide what is and is not real. And this is the paralysing condition that besets the State. It cannot make up its collective mind whether the “excess” is a conjuring trick or hard fact. Is it just the way Ireland is and will be for the foreseeable future? Or is it a little Eden from which, any day now, we will be expelled and thenceforth have to earn our bread by the sweat of our brows?

Unearned wealth – and let's be clear that this is what most of this “excess” corporation tax is – leads to laziness

These dual possibilities are the headlights in which the State is caught and frozen. It can neither believe its luck nor discount it. This is the underlying reason for the almost inexplicable inability of a very rich country to reach European standards of infrastructure and social services.

Because we don't think the bonanza is real and sustainable, we can't plan to spend it sustainably. Yet because we have this embarrassment of riches, we don't have to think about how we raise and spend money in the normal, tangible Irish economy. Hence, successive governments adamantly refuse to broaden the tax base – why bother taking the risk of upsetting any powerful lobby when you can just watch the billions roll into the parafiscal treasury?

Why, indeed, make any real choices at all? Unearned wealth – and let's be clear that this is what most of this “excess” corporation tax is – leads to laziness. The hard work of reform, of innovation, of articulating priorities and then delivering them, can be shirked. 

The State needs to pick a side: either decide that the crock of gold will keep renewing itself and invest accordingly, or conclude that leprechaun economics has had its day. Either trust in the paranormal or make the normal fit for purpose.

HBO's True Blood, which originally ended its run in 2014, is experiencing a major resurgence across Central and Eastern Europe. According to this week's HBO Top 10 rankings, the vampire fantasy drama is currently charting in 13 countries, including Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary, among others.

The show hit the Top 10 in all 13 territories on July 18, peaking in viewership momentum mid-week. This sudden spike underscores a renewed interest in long-finished genre series. At the same time, it's interesting to note that neither The Originals (TVD's spinoff) or The Vampire Diaries itself has seen a recent uptrend. Therefore, the recent rising viewership for True Blood appears to be a synergy of algorithmic suggestions and fan love for Charlaine Harris's The Southern Vampire Mysteries, especially considering that True Blood concluded its story in 2014.

What makes True Blood's revival remarkable is its cross-country consistency. The series ranked in the Top 5 across 12 of 13 countries on July 18 and has held steady in the Top 10 every day since. Its average weekly ranking sits at 5.4, with strong showings in smaller markets like Moldova (#8), Slovakia (#6), and Slovenia (#10). Critics and audiences are interestingly also nearly in sync on True Blood, with Rotten Tomatoes scores of 68% and 73%, respectively.

While The Vampire Diaries and its spinoff The Originals remain iconic CW staples with massive fanbases, True Blood has carved a darker, more mature lane that now probably feels fresher in today's streaming landscape for a niche fanbase. Unlike TVD's teen-focused romance and high school intrigue, True Blood leans heavily into Southern Gothic themes, political allegory, and adult content and that offers viewers a grittier, more provocative take on vampire mythology.

In terms of longevity, TVD ran for eight seasons compared to True Blood's seven, but it's HBO's bolder creative freedom and risk-taking that is probably giving True Blood the required traction at this point. TVD holds a 86% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes but lacks strong critic scores across seasons. The CW franchise thrived on cliffhangers, spinoffs, and growing teen-interest in riding the supernatural bandwagon back then but that's not as relevant now, likely because people are more inclined toward procedural dramas that are simultaneously branched out and more realistic. True Blood, on the other hand, is a self-contained series with no spinoffs.

True Blood is available to stream on HBO. Stay tuned to Collider for more updates.

Controversial paper questions whether interstellar visitor 3I/ATLAS is 'possibly hostile' alien tech in disguise","https://www.livescience.com/space/extraterrestrial-life/here-we-go-again-controversial-paper-questions-whether-interstellar-visitor-3i-atlas-is-possibly-hostile-alien-tech-in-disguise","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 17:37:31 GMT","

A controversial new paper questions whether the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a potentially dangerous alien probe, similar to claims made about 'Oumuamua. But experts have called it ""nonsense"".

The newly discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could be a piece of ""possibly hostile"" extraterrestrial technology in disguise, according to controversial research from a small group of scientists, including a renowned alien-hunting astronomer.

Their paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, echoes similar claims previously made about 'Oumuamua, the first-ever cosmic interloper that was discovered in 2017.

But experts have told Live Science that the new claims are ""nonsense"" and ""insulting,"" and insist that the available evidence points toward the object being completely natural.

3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 barreling toward the sun at more than 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h), and was confirmed to be an interstellar object less than 24 hours later. Initial observations strongly suggest it is a large comet surrounded by a cloud of ice, gas and dust called a coma, stretching up to 15 miles (24 kilometers) across. A computer model simulating where it originated from hinted that it could be up to 3 billion years older than our solar system, potentially making it the oldest comet ever seen.

But in a new paper, uploaded July 16 to the preprint server arXiv, a trio of researchers have questioned whether the comet is actually some form of covert alien tech sent here by an advanced, potentially aggressive extraterrestrial civilization.

The researchers described the new paper as a ""pedagogical exercise,"" or thought experiment, and offer no clear evidence of alien involvement. Instead, they point at the comet's ""anomalous characteristics"" and provide alternative theories to explain them.

The study's most notable author is Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard University who is renowned for linking extraterrestrial objects to intelligent aliens. He is the head of the Galileo Project, which is attempting to detect evidence of technosignatures and UFOs. In 2023, he led a controversial expedition that claimed to have collected pieces of possible alien tech left behind by an unconfirmed interstellar meteorite in the Pacific Ocean. (These claims have since been largely debunked by outside researchers).

Loeb was also the primary researcher who claimed that the unusual shape and non-gravitational acceleration of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua were signs that it was an alien probe.

Today, the general consensus is that 'Oumuamua was an asteroid that was leaking gas into space, similar to a comet. However, Loeb and his colleagues have continued to advocate its potential alien origin and have proposed missions to track down the wandering space rock.



Loeb's co-authors for the new study are both associated with the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is), a U.K. institute dedicated to planning future missions to alien star systems.

In a blog post explaining the new paper, Loeb wrote that if 3I/ATLAS is a ""technological artifact"" it could be evidence of the dark forest hypothesis, which argues that the reason we have not found evidence of extraterrestrial life is that they are staying silent to remain invisible to potential predators or prey.

""The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken,"" he wrote.

Most of the points laid out in the new paper relate to the unusual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS. The object is moving significantly faster than the only other known interstellar objects — 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov, which was spotted in 2019 — and has entered the solar system at a different angle from its predecessors, approaching the sun side-on relative to our star's orbit through the Milky Way.

Loeb wrote that the object's trajectory ""offers various benefits to an extraterrestrial intelligence"" that may be using it to subtly spy on Earth. One such benefit is that 3I/ATLAS will make relatively close approaches to three planets: Jupiter, Mars and Venus. And the minimum distances between the object and these worlds could enable aliens to discretely deploy ""gadgets"" there, Loeb wrote.

3I/ATLAS will also be hidden on the opposite side of the sun to Earth when it reaches its closest point to our home star in late October. ""This could be intentional to avoid detailed observations from Earth-based telescopes when the object is brightest or when gadgets are sent to Earth from that hidden vantage point,"" Loeb wrote.



The unusually high speed of 3I/ATLAS also makes it very hard to launch a spacecraft to intercept it before it exits the solar system, which could be another potential sign of clandestine alien activity, the researchers argued.

Based on its current speed, Loeb also noted that 3I/ATLAS would have entered the outer boundaries of the solar system around 8,000 years ago, which is ""roughly when human-made technologies became advanced enough to start documenting history on Earth."" Although, it is unclear what he is trying to imply by saying this.

The researchers also argued that there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, especially as researchers are yet to identify any ""volatiles,"" or specific chemicals associated with comets, within its coma.

Since 3I/ATLAS was discovered, researchers have been trying to identify it, and so far, the overwhelming consensus is that it is a comet.

""There have been numerous telescopic observations of 3I/ATLAS demonstrating that it's displaying classical signatures of cometary activity,"" Darryl Seligman, an astronomer at Michigan State University who led the first study quantifying 3I/ATLAS, told Live Science in an email.

""All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet that was ejected from another solar system, just as countless billions of comets have been ejected from our own solar system,"" added Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina in Canada who specializes in solar system dynamics.



Any assumptions about the object's lack of volatiles is also premature at this time. ""The object is still pretty far away from the sun, so no, we wouldn't typically expect to find direct evidence of volatiles necessarily,"" Seligman said. Instead, these compounds will likely become apparent in the coming weeks and months, he added.

Loeb admits that the alien technology scenario is a long shot: ""By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet,"" he wrote in the blog post.

Given the available evidence, many of the researchers who spoke to Live Science are disappointed with the new paper and pointed out that it distracts from the work of other scientists.



""Astronomers all around the world have been thrilled at the arrival of 3I/ATLAS, collaborating to use advanced telescopes to learn about this visitor,"" Chris Lintott, an astronomer at the University of Oxford who was part of the team that simulated 3I/ATLAS's galactic origins, told Live Science in an email. ""Any suggestion that it's artificial is nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object.""

—1 million 'interstellar objects' — each larger than the Statue of Liberty — may lurk in the outer solar system

—An interstellar visitor may have changed the course of 4 solar system planets, study suggests

Loeb is no stranger to this type of criticism and has defended his position, writing that ""the hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to explore, irrespective of its likely validity.""

However, while it is important to remain open-minded about any ""testable prediction,"" the new paper pushes this sentiment to the limit, Lawler told Live Science in an email. ""In my experience, the vast majority of scientists subscribe to the idea that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the evidence presented is absolutely not extraordinary.""

Credits: Royal Museums Greenwich

China is working super hard to contend for the position of the frontier of research and development, as its CNSA (China's National Space Administration) recently announced a discovery of an extraterrestrial ocean that could shift the race in its favor. This silent race to become the next frontier of research and development has been happening quietly in the shadows. This race is happening between China, Japan, and the West. 

The twist behind all of this is that even though the CSNA has made this discovery, they expressly stipulated that this extraterrestrial phenomenon does not contain water. This discovery was brought into the limelight during a press briefing that was televised and broadcast all over the world.

This extraterrestrial body was said to be more of a liquid layer covering up an entire world, made up of a substance we don't even know about yet as humans.

It was described much more clearly as a fluid, resting, and floating mass of water drifting across the galaxy. Now, after making these substantial claims, the inevitable reality of questions slipping into the minds of many becomes an obvious reality. One such question is, “What is this extraterrestrial ocean made up of if it's not water?” Another interesting question most enthusiasts seem to be asking is, “Could this new water form support planetary life as we know it?

CSNA scientists have stipulated that the extraterrestrial ocean has more similarity with the properties of a superfluid than with the properties of any liquid we can find on Earth. A superfluid is a specific type of fluid that has zero viscosity and inherently flows without any loss in kinetic energy. In other words, the discovery stipulated that this extraterrestrial form does not behave like any liquid we know on planet Earth. Instead, it moves in waves and reacts to gravitational forces. 

Just like many other nations that have developed hyper-sophisticated spacecraft to study our cosmos from the lenses of astronomy, China has also developed its Tianwen-X probe. This equipment was able to pick up thermal signatures that were being emitted by this strange, dark, and icy planet. 

Shortly after this discovery was made, closer attention was paid to expand the details of it, and upon clearer observation, it was found that the thermal and erratic heat signatures that were being emitted from the planet were a liquid-like layer wrapping around the planet, disguising itself as some form of energy system.

One of the many reasons the discovery itself is groundbreaking is that, it should be noted, even though this phenomenon is not outrightly a liquid, it still flows. After a series of highly advanced tests that specialized in complex systems like spectrography and magnetic field analysis were carried out, it was eventually universally agreed that this ocean is composed of high-energy particles that are bound in a fluidic quantum state. 

In recent times, making such substantial discoveries is necessary to deeply understand our planet and the universe alike. This new concept challenges everything we know about physics. 

The Newtonian laws we have on Earth do not apply to extraterrestrial phenomena, which in this case is the extraterrestrial ocean covering the dark, icy planet. This is just a glimpse of the possibilities in our universe. It is now time for us to rethink and imagine water and its characteristics. Consequently, what we consider normal and straight on Earth doesn't seem to follow through once in the deepest parts of space and beyond.

Pictured in portrait: Paige Miller (left) and Meagan Ankney (right) co-host the ""Spooky Science Sisters"" podcast and co-authored ""Spooky Science,"" which was released June 24.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Meagan Ankney found herself listening to a lot of podcasts about the paranormal.

“Being that I'm a scientist — and a naturally skeptical person — I was always a bit disappointed that most paranormal content is presented without any skepticism or is backed by pseudoscience,” says Ankney. In April 2020, the ""Spooky Science Sisters"" podcast was born. Ankney enlisted her longtime friend and sister-in-law, Paige Miller, to co-host.

It turns out, there's a real thirst for content that blends the supernatural and science. The podcast's Instagram account has grown to have more than 17,000 followers in the five years since. The popularity led Ankney and Miller to co-author a book, “Spooky Science: Dissecting the Mysteries of Ghosts, Cryptids, Aliens and Other Oddities”, which was released on June 24.

Writing the book was a challenge, since both authors have full-time jobs: Ankney as a chemist for a state lab and Miller as a safety specialist at a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility.

“We were lucky to go into the writing process with over 80 podcast episodes worth of research,” says Ankney. Those notes and records became the foundation of the book, and each chapter followed the same format as the podcast: First, an overview of the history and folklore, then the science behind it.

The late nights working on the manuscript even produced a “paranormal” experience for a sleep-deprived Ankney: “I was working on my laptop in my living room pretty late at night, and swore I heard my then-5-year-old walk out of her room — as in, I heard distinct footfalls on our wood floor. But when I looked up, she wasn't there,” says Ankney. “Probably the weirdest trick my brain has ever played on me.”

Ankney and Miller will discuss “Spooky Science” at Mystery To Me on July 29 from 6-7 p.m.

Meagan Ankney: My interest in the paranormal goes back to when I was a kid. I fell in love with The X-Files when I was just 6 years old and can remember going to the library to seek out books about aliens and other supernatural topics because of it. … My passion for science stretches back just as far. My mom was a geology major in college, so family trips frequently involved visits to national parks or other natural areas. I ended up studying geology in college, and then went on to get my PhD in geochemistry from UW–Madison, where my dissertation work focused on using distinctive chemical signatures in volcanic rocks to learn more about magma chamber development before large-scale volcanic eruptions.

 

Paige Miller: I have a hard time pinpointing a specific event that sparked my interest in the weird and spooky. For as long as I can remember I've been collecting porcelain dolls, watching horror movies and enjoying scary stories. Funny enough, I credit my passion for science in part to my love of spooky things. At a young age, I became obsessed with the idea of being a forensic scientist. … That childhood fascination stuck with me, and it's what fueled my decision to study chemistry in college. I ultimately found my passion in environmental, health, and safety, and I graduated with my Masters just this year.

 

MA: I love a good ghost story. … After writing this book, I can say that I'm more skeptical than ever that [ghosts] exist, but ghosts are still a fascinating phenomenon from both a psychological and historical perspective. There are so many spooky ways that your brain can be tricked into believing you've encountered a ghost, and it's undeniably cool that humans from around the world have been telling ghost stories for thousands, if not tens of thousands, of years.  

PM: I love learning and talking about cryptids and other “creepy creatures,"" but there is nothing quite like a spooky ghost or haunted house story. No matter who you are, skeptic or believer, everybody has a story or knows somebody who has a story that's really made them consider the existence of ghosts. And while I, like Meagan, am skeptical that they exist, it is certainly one of the more comforting theories on what awaits us in the afterlife.

 

MA: In terms of the actual writing, I think we both found it challenging to learn to write for a general audience, rather than a scientific one. I know the first few chapters I turned in were definitely a bit too technical and dense. The UFO section was probably the most difficult because the history of sightings and government projects can get pretty convoluted.

 

MA: Vampires, as we know them today, got their start, in part, with a series of strange deaths about 300 years ago. In 1725, a man named Petar Blagojević died in the small town of Kisiljevo. In the 10 weeks after his burial, nine additional people mysteriously passed away, with each of them claiming on their deathbed that they received a visit from Petar. The terrified villagers dug Petar up to investigate. When they opened his coffin, Petar's body wasn't as decomposed as they expected, his nails and hair appeared to have grown, and fresh blood was present around his mouth. All of this the villagers believed was evidence that Petar was a vampire. A similar version of this story played out in at least two other Serbian villages over the next few years, and tales of so-called vampires spread around the world through the distribution of pamphlets, treatises, and news stories.

Of course, we know today that Petar was not a vampire. Decomposition of interred bodies happens much more slowly than most people expect: At a depth of just 4 feet, a body retains much of its soft tissue for about a year. The “fresh” blood that was present was probably fluids from the breakdown of internal organs being pushed out due to swelling. Nails and hair can appear elongated as the soft tissues around them retract.

In the early 18th century, though, medical science was not advanced enough for the villagers to understand natural processes like the spread of disease and decomposition, so they turned to a supernatural explanation. It's a classic example of what happens when folklore and science meet.

Supernatural heads back to comics.

Marvel teases Ultimate Endgame.

Ice Cream Man to release deck of cards.

This is Comic Book Club News for July 22, 2025.

Dean and Sam will carry on, my wayward sons, as Dynamite Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products have announced a brand-new Supernatural comic book series is debuting this October.

Written by Greg Pak with art by Eder Messias, the comic will depict previously unseen adventures of the Winchester brothers that take place between the episodes of the insanely long-running CW series. 

Back in 2008, Wildstorm (under DC Comics) published a series of in-continuity miniseries tying into Supernatural: Origins, Rising Son, Beginning's End, and Caledonia. After those early experiments, it seems that was it for Supernatural in comics — until Dynamite came into the picture. In fact, according to  the publisher, “Warner Brothers was not looking to license Supernatural out as there's no event around it… But we politely pushed as we really wanted it, and over the course of the last two years, and some pitches, Warner Brothers felt like we had the right team to move it forward.”

In the new series, “the monster hunters will hear of a series of mysterious fires haunting a decaying rust belt town. When a local factory burns down, followed by several employees going up in flames, and the CEO is suspiciously well-prepared, it's up to Dean and Sam to figure out what's going on and set it straight!”

Supernatural #1 will hit stores in October. 

Back in 2019, Marvel Studios released a little movie called Avengers: Endgame. And now Marvel Comics is hoping to get a bit of that hype for Ultimate Endgame, a new event series that will bring to a head the Ultimate Universe's ongoing plot thanks to the return of the evil Reed Richards, The Maker.

While Marvel is light on details for the December 31, 2025 debuting event — more will be revealed at San Diego Comic-Con — we do have two teaser images that directly call to mind the MCU blockbuster.

The first showed a breaking apart “U” a la the teaser poster for Avengers: Endgame. The second? A straight-up crib of the head pile main poster for Endgame.

That said, we can tell a few things based on this parody teases. The above-the-line characters in the event are Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, King T'Challa, Peter Parker, Logan, Mei Igarashi, Janet Van Dyne, Reed Richards (aka Doom), and Reed Richards (aka The Maker). No huge surprises, these are all characters featured in Marvel's Ultimate Universe line, including Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men, Ultimate Black Panther, Ultimate Wolverine, and The Ultimates.

What's more interesting in the teaser are the bottom credits. Other characters listed are Charli Ramsey, Thor Odinson, Sif, Lejori Joena Zakaria, Luke Cage, Nico Minoru, America Chavez, Illyana Rasputin, Emmanuel Da Costa, and Bruce Banner. But more important are the other credits: the Ultimate Writers are Jonathan Hickman, Bryan Hill, Peach Momoko, Deniz Camp, and Chris Condon. Assistant Editor is Michelle Marchese, Editor is Wil Moss, Editor-in-Chief is C.B. Cebulski, and Executive Producers are Kevin Feige and Dan Buckley.

While none of that is a huge surprise — those are the writers and editors, after all — the inclusion of Feige on there does drive home the increased collaboration between Marvel Comics and Studios. Whether there are any portals in Ultimate Endgame or anyone says “I love you 3000” remains to be seen.

Image Comics‘ Ice Cream Man regularly pushes the comic book form with every issue. But a new one-shot from creators W. Maxwell Prince, Martín Morazzo, and Chris O'Halloran won't be a comic at all: The Mortal Coil Shuffle is being published as a deck of 55 cards.

The custom-designed deck featuring custom backs and a custom box as well are designed by Morazzo, O'Halloran and Good Old Neon. Image teases that “Some cards will tell part of the story; while other cards cast inscrutable spells on unwitting characters; and some must be joined with other cards to form a complete piece of art.”

Added Prince, “When I was nine, I contracted chicken pox. And the only person available to watch me while sick was my German next door neighbor—a lovely woman named Inge, who, over time, would become a sort of surrogate grandmother to me. She taught me how to play Gin rummy that be-pocked week, and if I close my eyes now I can still hear her shuffling the deck, tapping her gigantic press-on nails onto the table between drags of her extra long Kool cigarettes.

“The cards were alive for me back then, and so this little Ice Cream Man experiment is dedicated to Inge: let's see if we can't bring some cards to life one more time!”

The Mortal Coil Shuffle will be a limited one-time-only printing, and Image promises there will never be a second printing, no new runs, and it will never exist in any of the Ice Cream Man trades or collections.

Ice Cream Man: Mortal Coil Shuffle will hit comic book shops on Wednesday, October 1.

DEAR READERS: I was recently interviewed by the Nashville Voyager Magazine. I thought I would share some of the questions they asked me, so you would also get to know a little bit more about me. I have been writing this column for many years, and I am so proud to offer the topic of spirituality in a non-scary, non-woo-woo way, and I never dreamed my column would be as popular or welcomed as it has been, and I am so grateful to each of you who takes the time to read my words each week. I recently moved to Tennessee, and I have had some big challenges and changes, so I hope you enjoy the article

Q: Bonnie, please kick things off for us with an introduction to yourself and your story.

A: I was born into a family of spiritualists. For many generations, my ancestors have had this gift from God running through their veins. I am a fourth-generation psychic medium. I grew up in a small rural town in New England. The house I grew up in was an old historical schoolhouse, and there always seemed to be spirits available for my viewing and engaging with. Since my mother had the gift of mediumship [and] could see what I was seeing and could alleviate any fears that I had with connecting to the spirit world, I grew up thinking everyone saw spirits.

As I grew older, the spirit world would become even stronger in my life. Hearing the voice of God asking me to do this work, I asked, “Why?” when he said, “Little One, the world is becoming darker and darker, and we need more light.” I closed down my Salon I owned and “Messages from Heaven” was born. For over a decade, I have been a full-time demonstrating medium, giving audiences, large and small, a glimpse into Heaven with the intention of providing proof that life goes on and the bond of love can never die. Deciding to follow our son and grandchildren to this area has had its challenges, but it's so worth the chance to be with our family. I am now at the point of opening a private office just fifteen minutes from Nashville in Franklin, Tenn.

My website has so much more info: www.bonniepagemedium.com. I have also written three books found on Amazon and I've been writing a weekly column for the last seven years called “Ask the Psychic” as a freelance columnist for [MediaNews Group], which is seen in many of their papers. My mission is to bring healing to all and to erase the fear of dying while proving that life goes on and Love Never Dies.

Q: I'm sure it wasn't obstacle-free, but would you say the journey has been fairly smooth so far?

A: The challenge has always been in the belief system. I am not going to force a belief on anyone, I am just here to show by giving evidence that life goes on and there is another way to look at death and living.

Q: As you know, we're big fans of Medium Bonnie Page/Messages from Heaven. For our readers who might not be as familiar, what can you tell them about the brand?

A: I specialize in private readings, gallery events, and teaching others to connect with the spirit world. Guidance and Protection are always there for you and reaching beyond what you can see in the physical world. As a Reiki Master and healer, my work is always about the healing aspect of mediumship.

Q: What matters most to you? Why?

A: What matters to me most is the reason why I do this work. My story is within all three of my books as to how I became a full-time professional medium. I am working for God, offering healing and light to others along the way. Sometimes, one person at a time, with the hope of reaching many and leaving a footpath of hope and inspiration.

Pricing:

• Pricing for private readings starts at $99.00

• Pricing for Galleries starts at $30.00

• Pricing for Classes varies.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=Conspiracy+Theories","How to talk to conspiracy theorists","https://thosenerdygirls.org/conspiracy-theorists-sart/","Tue, 22 Jul 2025 11:00:06 GMT","

[This post was updated by Those Nerdy Girls from the original written on 11/23/22.]

My uncle is knee-deep in science conspiracy theories. Any tips on respectfully engaging him?

A: Experts recommend the SART strategy: Show empathy; Affirm critical thinking; avoid Ridicule; and invoke conspiracy theory “exiters” as Trusted messengers. And it never hurts to remember that as humans we need to feel heard before we can truly listen.

Ah, conspiracy theories. We've all been exposed to them – wildly inaccurate hot-takes about COVID, typically invoking sinister plots by powerful forces. Defying evidence and/or basic logic, they nonetheless can stubbornly persist and seriously undermine public health.

Misinformation experts Stephan Lewandowsky and John Cook have written “The Conspiracy Theory Handbook” to help science lovers debunk conspiratorial junk. We share a lightly-edited excerpt outlining the SART strategy in preparation for keeping the peace at family gatherings.

/ Excerpt begins:

*S*HOW EMPATHY

Approaches should be empathic and seek to build understanding with the other party. Because the goal is to develop open-mindedness, communicators must lead by example.

*A*FFIRM CRITICAL THINKING

Conspiracy theorists perceive themselves as critical thinkers who are not fooled by an official account. Affirm the value of critical thinking and redirect this approach towards a more critical analysis of the conspiracy theory.

AVOID *R*IDICULE

Aggressively deconstructing or ridiculing a conspiracy theory, or focusing on “winning” an argument, runs the risk of being automatically rejected.

INVOKE *T*RUSTED MESSENGERS

Counter-messages created by former members of an extremist community (“exiters”) are evaluated more positively and remembered longer than messages from other sources.

End excerpt /

A final nerdy note:

This can be hard, slow work that isn't always effective. Be gentle with yourself and walk away from the conversation when needed.

We sign off with a big thanks to our community. We see and honor your work battling misleading information one social media post/share/IRL conversation at a time. We promise to keep providing tools that help us all Stand Up for Science.

With love,

Your Nerdy Girls

There is no shortage of speculation surrounding From, but one Julie Matthews theory could actually help explain a strange moment from season 2. Like any good mystery show, From's complex nature means that with each new episode, more questions are introduced, while their answers are slowly revealed over time.

By From season 3's ending, there are more questions than ever. This includes Tabitha Matthews and Jade Herrera's reincarnation reveal and Boyd Stevens' discovery of the reborn Smiley monster. Julie's story walking and how it connects to other events is still unclear, though one new theory suggests it's more important than we currently know.

From season 3 introduced Julie Matthews' ability to story walk, a variation of time travel that allows her to revisit various moments from the stories of other characters. This first occurs in season 3, episode 8, when Julie and Ethan return to the ruins where Julie, Marielle, and Randall were tortured, and she is transported away from her brother.

Between Julie Matthews' time travel and the introduction of the Man in Yellow, there are many theories about what will happen in From season 4. 

During this brief time, Julie interacts with several of From's other characters, though not in scenes that she was originally in. When she eventually returns to her own time and confides in Ethan what happened to her, he explains the ability, also sharing that she cannot change the past, she can only visit it.

It is this detail in Julie's story that the new From theory stems from. It argues that it was actually Julie, in one of her story walking adventures, who knocks on the RV during the scene in which Jim, Randall, Donna, and Boyd are trapped in the crashed vehicle overnight (via Reddit).

When Julie appears at the end of From season 3, she has a large scratch on her face, which could have happened while trying to escape from the monsters in the cave.

This moment came at a crucial point in season 2 when Randall was getting ever closer to breaking down, just before the trio lapses into their comas. The knocking was scary to those inside the RV, but the theory posits that it was actually an accident on Julie's part after attempting to escape from Fromville's tunnels.

From is following in Lost's footsteps as the MGM+ science-fiction horror series repeats a cleverly teased plot twist that Lost used 17 years ago.

This could make sense, given that the previous time that she saw the cave system, she was utterly horrified and got lost trying to follow her mother and Victor. What's more, when Julie appears at the end of From season 3, she has a large scratch on her face, which could have happened while trying to escape from the monsters in the cave.

 Beyond Julie potentially being the source of the knocking on the RV in season 2, it seems probable that she could have also been responsible for other unexplained events in From as well. In fact, season 3 confirmed it was Julie who threw the rope to Boyd in season 2, solving one big mystery.

Likewise, several other theories similarly highlight Julie's newfound ability as the answer to longstanding mysteries. These theories range from Julie being recognized by a monster despite just arriving in the town, to Julie being the real creator of the talismans, proving just how broad an application the skill could have.

All of From's seasons have been generally well-received and made the show popular, but which of the three seasons has been the strongest so far? 


Audiences also know from season 3's ending that Julie with short hair appears just before Jim's death, trying to change his story to help him survive. This moment both reaffirms Ethan's words of advice to his sister and implies, due to her changed appearance, that Julie remains in Fromville for a long time beyond season 3's ending.

Even without being able to change the past, Julie does not yet know how other versions of herself impacted it.

Importantly, Ethan's reveal that Julie will not be able to change the past with her story walking seems to come true sadly quickly, but there could be numerous events that she doesn't necessarily know she is involved in yet. Even without being able to change the past, Julie does not yet know how other versions of herself impacted it.

The Man in Yellow's identity is still a mystery after From season 3, but one fan theory claims he's the older version of an existing character.

In general, From would be better off using Julie's story walking ability sparingly in season 4, as it could become repetitive if the series solved too many mysteries that way. With that being said, though, if the series does use Julie's new talent in the right moments, it could create perfect big reveals.

Julie's ability to story walk was a huge addition to From season 3 and should return in From season 4 to help further explain the show's mysteries. While I do think the new From theory is correct about Julie's involvement in several unexplained events in the show, it seems possible that the banging noise in season 2 could have actually been the Man in Yellow instead.

There has been a new exciting update surrounding the upcoming season 4 of one of the best horror shows on TV, which further raises its anticipation.

The knocking and how afraid Randall is what forces him out into the woods at night, leading to him ending up in a coma. This event and its unfortunate outcome make it feel more likely that the Man in Yellow made the noise, or at least ordered one of From's monsters to do it for him.

Every helpful discovery is countered by a worse foe, leading to the theory that the Man in Yellow is behind it all.

Especially given how much the noise was meant to scare the RV's inhabitants, it seems like something he could have done. Though it is possible that Julie could have accidentally scared them by knocking, the Man in Yellow is known for creating chaos and fear, so it seems more likely that it was an insidious and intentional move by him.

After the Man in Yellow's chilling introduction in the From season 3 finale, a season 4 theory makes the villain even more terrifying. 

Interestingly, From introduced the Man in Yellow in the season 3 finale, when he appears to kill Jim, linking him to Julie and her story walking. Nothing in From's universe is by chance. Every helpful discovery is countered by a worse foe, leading to the theory that the Man in Yellow is behind it all.

Given how often the seemingly unrelated stories in From are connected, it is possible that Julie's story walking is somehow either connected or in opposition to the Man in Yellow's powers.

Given how often the seemingly unrelated stories in From are connected, it is possible that Julie's story walking is somehow either connected or in opposition to the Man in Yellow's powers. Whether this means that one or both of them played a role in the knocking, it's possible that the moment unknowingly led Fromville's residents to where they are now.

MOSCOW, July 22. /TASS/. Russian Supreme Court Chair Irina Podnosova has passed away in Moscow at the age of 71, a source in her inner circle told TASS.

The department said in a statement that Ice never arrested or deported Luis Leon to Guatemala, and that the reports were a ‘hoax'

Confusion swirled around the fate of a Chilean resident of the US after the Department of Homeland Security called reports of his deportation to Guatemala a “hoax”.

On 18 July, the Morning Call newspaper of Allentown, Pennsylvania, reported that the family of the man, Luis Leon, said he was handcuffed after showing up at to immigration office on 20 June to report a lost green card. They said he was first sent to a detention facility in Minnesota, then to Guatemala, where they said a Chilean relative informed them he was in a hospital.

The report said Leon was 82 years old and had come to the US after being granted political asylum in 1987 after being tortured under the regime of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. It said in his nearly 40 years living in the US he spent his career working in a leather manufacturing plant, raised a family and had since retired.

DHS, however, denied in a statement that Leon had been deported and that there was no record of Leon having a green card appointment in Philadelphia on that date. The department also said that its only record of Leon entering the US “was from 2015 from Chile under the visa waiver program”.

The Guatemalan government also denied that Leon had been deported. In a statement, the Guatemalan Migration Institute said it coordinates with Ice on all deportations from the US and that no one matched Leon's name, age or citizenship, according to the Associated Press.

The AP added that Guatemala agreed in February to receive people deported from the US who are from other Central American countries, but that its agreement does not extend to Chileans.

On Monday, Morning Call published a new story reflecting DHS and Guatemala's claims, and noting that it “repeatedly requested information from Ice during its reporting; an Ice spokesperson previously refused to confirm details, including whether or not Leon was even at the Philadelphia office, and said Monday that Ice investigators were not able to contact the family”.

It added that Leon's granddaughter, Nataly, who refused to provide her last name, said she had visited Leon in a hospital in Guatemala City, where she claimed he was being treated for pneumonia.

But the outlet also reported that a Chilean journalist, Jose Del Pino, said a doctor at the hospital in question had no record of him.

Del Pino also reportedly provided a copy of an alleged death certificate to the Morning Call for a man with the same name and date of birth who died in Santiago, Chile, in 2019. It added that Del Pino said Chilean citizens all have national identification numbers, and none matches another person with that name and birthday.

Late on Sunday her family issued a statement saying they would no longer speak to media and asked for privacy, and Leon's granddaughter did not respond to the Morning Call's further requests for comment on Monday.

The Guardian has approached Ice, the Chilean embassy in the US, the municipality of Allentown and various immigration organizations for comment. An attorney at Campos Firm said multiple immigration attorneys had tried to contact the family asking to represent them, but could not reach them.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A vast toxic algae bloom has sparked growing concern in Australia as it lingers off the south coast, killing hundreds of marine species and disrupting fisheries.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese unlocked federal funds this week to cope with the Karenia mikimotoi algae as it persists four months after first appearing.

South Australia's government said it was holding an emergency meeting yesterday to be briefed by scientists on the phenomenon.

The algae, which damages the gills of fish and suffocates them, stretched across 4,400km2 when it was first spotted in mid-March, the state government said.

While South Australian authorities hoped the bloom would disperse, it has instead spread across the region, the latest government update said.

A marine heat wave in the area had “largely abated,” it said, but remained in some deeper waters.

Beaches on wildlife-rich tourist draws such as Kangaroo Island, Yorke Peninsula and Fleurieu Peninsula have been littered with the marine carcasses of sharks, rays, crabs and octopuses.

“It's hard to overstate the extreme severity of the algal-bloom environmental crisis in South Australia,” University of New South Wales marine ecologist Adriana Verges said. “We are talking about extensive mortality of nearly 500 different marine species, including key habitat-forming sponges and other invertebrates, as well as fish. It's completely devastating.”

Karenia mikimotoi has been detected around the world, including in waters off Japan, Norway, the US and China, since the 1930s, and disrupted local tourism and fishery industries, causing millions of dollars of damage.

Ian Mitchell, who manages a fish market in Adelaide, said some people had not caught anything since April.

“It's the worst I've ever seen it,” he told national broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corp. “I'm speaking to fishermen on a daily basis, and I've got fishermen in tears on the phone.”

The federal government on Monday announced A$14 million (US$9.1 million) in financial assistance to impacted fisheries, cleanup efforts and research into preparedness.

Albanese said a “whole range of issues” had led to the event, including nutrient-rich floodwater runoff and above-average ocean temperatures.

Historically fishing and aquaculture industries can take years to recover from algae blooms, Australian Marine Conservation Society chief executive Paul Gamblin said.

“It's an enormous red flashing warning that climate change has arrived off Australia and it is having enormous impacts,” he said.

South Australia has not previously experienced a toxic algae bloom of this scale or duration.

Local authorities have urged beachgoers to avoid swimming in water that is discolored or foamy, warning that it can irritate the skin and affect breathing.

Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and duration of marine heat waves across Australia, which significantly affect marine ecosystems.

Thai police this week arrested a woman accused of bedding at least 11 monks in breach of their vows of celibacy, before blackmailing them with thousands of secretly taken photos of their trysts.
The monks are said to have paid nearly US$12 million, funneled out of their monasteries, funded by donations from laypeople hoping to increase their merit and prospects for reincarnation.
The scandal provoked outrage over hypocrisy in the monkhood, concern that their status

“We have seen submarine cable infrastructure threatened in recent years by foreign adversaries, like China,” FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement. “We are therefore taking action here to guard our submarine cables against foreign adversary ownership, and access as well as cyber and physical threats.”
The United States has for years expressed concerns about China's role in handling network traffic and the potential for espionage. The U.S. has

Birthed on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic, spreading conspiracy theories about vaccinations and a cabal of global elites, the Sanseito Party has widened its appeal ahead of today's upper house vote — railing against immigration and dragging rhetoric that was once confined to Japan's political fringes into the mainstream.

As part of the investigation, the department asked the university to share, within 30 days, tax records related to foreign funding, a list of foreign gifts, grants and contracts with any foreign source, and other documents, the department said in a statement and in a letter to                                    ","{'href': 'https://www.taipeitimes.com', 'title': 'Taipei Times'}","world"

Russia plans to spend around $1.1 trillion on rearmament over the next 11 years in preparation for a potential large-scale war, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on July 22.

Moscow has launched its most ambitious weapons program since the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said. Russia is mobilizing all sectors of society to support its military buildup, he added.

""There is a total mobilization of politics, economy, and society of the Russian Federation to be ready for the upcoming large-scale war,"" Budanov said during the annual meeting of Ukrainian ambassadors.

As part of this reform, Russia has already created two new military districts — Moscow and Leningrad — and is preparing to form additional divisions and military units. Budanov said the Kremlin's goal is not just regional domination but a reshaping of the global order.

""Russia seeks to disrupt the current security and economic order,"" he added. ""For this purpose, Moscow is building up its presence in Africa, primarily using its proxy forces.""

Budanov also warned that Russia is conducting hybrid operations abroad, including cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, aimed at undermining democracies.

""Moscow's goal is to impose on countries its own vision of the future world order, where 'big' states, primarily the Russian Federation, have full power, a monopoly on all critical resources and decide the fate of the world in a closed circle,"" Budanov said. 

His comments follow a growing number of warnings from Western intelligence services about Russia's long-term military buildup. Last year, German intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said that Moscow will have the military capabilities to attack NATO by 2030.

Russia's defense spending has already overtaken that of all European countries combined. In 2024, its military budget surged by 42% to $462 billion, surpassing Europe's collective defense expenditure of $457 billion, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 30 that Russia is prepared to scale up its war effort to levels last seen in World War II, claiming ""millions"" of civilians are supporting the military by donating supplies and equipment.

Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi estimated in April that Russia could call up to 5 million trained reservists, with a broader mobilization potential of 20 million.

Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Demonstrators gathered in Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odesa to oppose the legislation, which grants sweeping new powers to the prosecutor general over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO).





Moscow has launched its most ambitious weapons program since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said.

""I think they need to be called out for their subsidizing this killing that is happening on the battlefields in Ukraine,"" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said.

The legislation grants the prosecutor general new powers over investigations led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and cases led by the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.

The announcement comes as pro-Western President Maia Sandu, who narrowly secured reelection last year, seeks to preserve her parliamentary majority and advance Moldova's bid for EU accession.



The breach reportedly prompted an urgent response from Ukrainian units to prevent the situation ""from spiraling into disaster.""

Russian schoolchildren are recruited into drone development and other military programs through seemingly harmless video games, state-run competitions, and promises of academic and career advancement.

An SBU officer is suspected of demanding a $300,000 bribe from a person under investigation for allegedly organizing illegal border crossings for military-age men during wartime, NABU said.

Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council has imposed a moratorium on business inspections by state authorities, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 21, calling the move essential for the country's economic security.

The delegation will be led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov and include representatives from Ukraine's military intelligence, the Foreign Ministry, and the Presidential Office.

The target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russian forces launched 42 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones overnight, primarily from Russia and occupied Crimea, Ukraine's Air Force said. At least 26 drones were shot down, and seven more were lost or suppressed by electronic warfare systems, according to the statement.","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Trump's firing of 1,300 DOE workers is bad news for all student loan recipients and K-12 students alike.

On July 14, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for President Donald Trump's administration to fire more than 1,300 workers at the Department of Education (DOE). The order, while not a final ruling on the legal merits of the case, lifted a district court injunction that had prevented Trump from gutting the federal agency. Now, while litigation plays out in the courts, the administration is free to move forward with its campaign promise to shut down the DOE — a cause conservatives have championed for more than four decades.

Truthout spoke with two education policy experts at nonprofit think tanks to learn more about how the mass layoffs at the DOE will immediately impact schools, teachers, and students' daily lives: Jon Valant, the director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, where his research specializes in K-12 education policy, and Sara Partridge, the associate director of higher education at the Center for American Progress. The interview below has been lightly edited for clarity and concision.

The DOE now stands to be roughly half the size it was in 2024, thanks to a combination of layoffs and resignations. What do you foresee as the most immediate or urgent impacts of the Supreme Court order allowing the Trump administration's mass firings to continue?

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Sara Partridge: One area that the workforce reductions were largely concentrated in is the Office of Federal Student Aid, which administers grant, work study, and student loan programs for 9.9 million students each year. The Office of Federal Student Aid is responsible for processing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), disbursing student loan forms, managing repayment of student loans, and providing oversight and monitoring of all the parties that participate in the federal student aid program. They also provide information to students and families and help to resolve complaints and issues related to student loan servicing. These are important responsibilities that ensure students across the country can access postsecondary education and repay their loans, and that taxpayer dollars spent on financial aid go to programs that meet federal requirements. Student loan borrowers will in all likelihood face a reduced quality of service and more issues with student loan repayment in the coming months and years as a result of these changes.

Can you talk a little more about the issues that current and future student loan borrowers will face?

Sara Partridge: Many student loan borrowers in repayment are already in distress and facing the risk of default. One recent analysis found that as of April, 5.8 million or 31 percent of borrowers with a payment due are in late stage delinquency, or more than 90 days past due on payments. Once payments are 270 days late, the borrower enters default and collections may begin. As many as 1.8 million could reach default status in July, 1 million in August, and 2 million in September, the study estimated. Already, borrowers who are past due on their payments have seen an average credit score decrease of 60 points, which will stay on their credit report for 7 years and result in less access to credit and higher interest rates. When in default, a borrower's wages, tax returns, and Social Security checks may be garnished.

Currently, there is a backlog of at least 1.5 million applications for income-driven repayment plans, which will likely increase as more borrowers seek to switch out of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, due to the fact that the administration is restarting interest accrual for those who are currently in an administrative forbearance as a result of ongoing litigation against the SAVE plan.

When student loan borrowers have issues or errors with monthly payments, income-driven repayment plans, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, delays for relief under borrower defense or closed school discharge, or any other number of issues that their servicer fails to resolve, they can contact the Ombudsman Office at the Department of Education. As of March 2025, more than 6,500 complaints remained unresolved. I expect that these workforce reductions will make it even more challenging for borrowers to receive help or relief when they confront errors, challenges, or complex situations relating to their student loans.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) also just phased out a number of federal student loan repayment plans. How might the Supreme Court ruling and this budget bill together reshape the student loan landscape?

Sara Partridge: The Department has both ongoing and new duties to carry out that will require significant expertise, resources, and staff that may no longer be available. The Office of Federal Student Aid will have the task of implementing a range of new programs as a result of the OBBBA, including introducing new loan limits for graduate students and parent borrowers, moving borrowers into new repayment plans, and expanding Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs. Many of these changes will start to take place July 1, 2026, and some will require new regulations to determine how they will be implemented. These are tall tasks on a quick timeline, even for a fully staffed Department.

Student loan borrowers will see a range of changes starting in July 2026, including higher monthly payments under the new OBBBA plans. Graduate borrowers and parent borrowers will see new limits on federal student loans. The graduate and professional borrowing limits will likely disproportionately impact students pursuing medicine, dentistry, and other health care fields, forcing many to rely on more risky private student loans. The OBBBA also limits repayment options for parent borrowers, barring them from accessing income-driven repayment plans.

Is there anything students should do now to prepare for changes in student aid administration?

Sara Partridge: If borrowers are past due on their student loan payments, they should contact their servicer to work with them to prevent going into default. If they are a Parent PLUS borrower, they may want to consider consolidating their loans before July 2026 to access the amended income-based repayment plan (although this can, in some cases, reset progress toward cancellation, so borrowers should speak with their servicer about this choice).

If borrowers are facing ongoing challenges with their student loans that they cannot get resolution for with their servicer or the Department of Education, student loan borrowers can open cases with their congressional representatives, which will serve the dual purposes of getting them assistance while also making Congress aware of the myriad challenges borrowers are facing right now, and encourage them to hold the administration accountable for delivering on its statutory duties.

When might the effects of reduced capacity at the DOE begin to ripple into K-12 schools, impacting teachers and students?

Jon Valant: It looks like the staffing cuts are having negative impacts already. For example, the cuts were heavily concentrated in the Institute of Education Sciences, which has been slashed to the point where we're losing access to data that we rely on to evaluate needs and progress. That being said, I think the most significant, direct impacts might actually come from the funding cuts — or the Trump administration's attempts to withhold billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds — that are causing immediate headaches and sacrifices from schools. Those are previously approved funds that school districts have been promised that suddenly aren't available for a new school year that's quickly approaching. We'll see where that ends up, since they'll have to deal with legal and political challenges, but that could mean fewer services for English language learners and fewer before- and after-school programs. And now, just a month or two before the school year starts, school and district leaders are scrambling to figure out what cuts they might have to make to programs and staff. 

Another agency disproportionately targeted by layoffs is the Office for Civil Rights. How do you think the DOE's closing will impact equity and civil rights in schools?

Jon Valant: Protecting students' civil rights is one of the core functions of the U.S. Department of Education. I'm concerned about what the Office for Civil Rights staffing cuts mean for the Education Department's ability to fulfill its obligations in that regard — now and in the future. Maybe even more than that, though, I'm concerned with the way that this administration is redefining, twisting, and narrowing the Department's priorities with respect to civil rights. In the past, the focus has been on protecting vulnerable groups of students. Now, the focus seems to be on weaponizing civil rights enforcement to threaten school districts and universities that don't align with its positions on culture-war issues like LGBTQ+ rights. We've seen that with universities like Harvard and Columbia, as well as with state and local K-12 education agencies, including Maine and California.

Sara Partridge:  The March 2025 workforce reductions closed seven of the Department's 12 regional civil rights offices, laying off 208 investigators, or 55 percent of the agency's total investigative staff. A recent court filing showed that under the Trump administration, the Office for Civil Rights has dismissed civil rights complaints at a rapid-fire pace. Historically, close to half of the complaints about civil rights violations have related to discrimination due to disability. Students of all backgrounds, but in particular those with disabilities, may see their rights to equal educational opportunity diminished under this administration, and evidence already suggests that layoffs of civil rights investigators are taking their toll.

Jon, you wrote in this Brookings piece that there's a “dangerous gap between education's problems and proposed ‘solutions.'” You note chronic absenteeism and large gaps in student test scores. Can you explain how dismantling the DOE fails to respond to the key problems you're seeing in education — and how it could make these issues worse for students?

Jon Valant: Let's run down some of the many challenges facing K-12 schools in the United States right now. We've seen years-long declines in academic performance — that started before COVID — especially among the country's lowest-scoring students. We continue to battle high rates of chronic absenteeism and other indicators of student disengagement. We have alarming data on student mental health and have to grapple with challenges related to cell phone use, social media, and other issues that originate outside of classrooms. We have a workforce that's rapidly changing with school systems that aren't equipped to keep up with those changes. How does dismantling the U.S. Department of Education or slashing funds for schools help with any of that? I have no idea. This is an era of genuine challenges for U.S. students and schools, and yet many of our leaders seem more focused on winning culture-war battles than actually addressing those challenges.

What are some specific policies that you think would more adequately address these issues?

Jon Valant: I think what defines great schools, more than anything, is outstanding teachers and instruction. We can use policy more strategically to attract, retain, and develop excellent teachers, especially in schools that most need additional support. I also think we have a lot of work to do in evaluating the quality of curricular materials, encouraging schools and districts to adopt high-quality curricula, and training teachers in those curricula. And, really, I'd like to see policymakers think more seriously about schools' role in sustaining a healthy democracy and cohesive society. School isn't only about preparing students for college and the workforce. It's also about developing an ability to get along with another, respect other people's perspectives and experiences, know how to spot misinformation, and value the country's norms and institutions.

Is there any angle or consequence you think is being overlooked in media coverage of the DOE dismantlement?

Sara Partridge: The nearly $900 million in cuts to federal education research undertaken by the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) are a critical blow to researchers' and policymakers' understanding of education outcomes, trends, and issues. In postsecondary education, these contracts help us understand how student loan dollars are distributed and the outcomes of students who borrow for college. They help us understand who continues to face barriers to enrolling and graduating from college. Some of these studies are longitudinal and take place over a decade or more, so interrupting and re-starting them means wasted resources and years of lost time. Canceling these projects is short-sighted and could potentially be deeply damaging to the long-term future of the American education system.

Republicans frame closing the DOE as an effort to give power back to the states. What role do the states play in this? Is it actually feasible for states to take over the DOE's functions?

Jon Valant: President Trump likes to say that he's “sending education back to the states.” But the truth is that states and localities, not the federal government, have been the key actors in K-12 education all along. For example, the federal government only covers about one-tenth of the expenses for K-12 education, with state and local governments covering the rest. The federal government isn't involved in selecting curriculum or deciding what content students should learn. It doesn't hire teachers and school leaders or even decide what standards should be used for hiring teachers and school leaders. Those responsibilities fall to more local levels of government. That's not to say that the federal government isn't important in K-12 education — it is. It plays key roles in protecting students' civil rights, collecting data and supporting research, and providing funding and support to vulnerable groups, like students with disabilities and students in poverty.

Sara Partridge: The federal government conducts research and oversight, ensures students' civil rights are protected, distributes funding to states and schools, administers postsecondary student financial aid, and runs grant programs that help fill gaps or foster innovation. States, on the other hand, are primarily responsible for academic standards, curriculum, and graduation requirements; teacher certification; and a majority of public school funding. Any major changes to these responsibilities would require an act of Congress. Historically, the federal government has played an essential role in prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity for all students. Certain federal standards and guardrails also ensure that taxpayer dollars are well spent on quality education. Shifting responsibility to the states without providing any mechanisms for accountability or oversight at the federal level would undoubtedly make the educational playing field more unequal and leave students with the greatest need behind.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.
