      Stargate SG-1 is sci-fi series about a secret government program in possession of alien technology that enables humans to instantly travel to other inhabitable planets. It's only second to the X-Files in my book when it comes to reflecting the reality of government/alien coverups.
    


      This episode Covenant (available on Amazon Prime Video for free!) is soooo on-the-nose it's like the producers are well aware of what's going on...and more.
    


      Here's the parallels I noticed to reality:
    


      - Alec Colson, billionaire aerospace entrepreneur intent on disclosure -> Robert Bigelow
    


      - The Trust: Shady secret org of powerful people intent on keeping the secret of the Stargate -> the Gatekeepers
    


      - The Vice President being part of the the Trust -> Dick Cheney as gatekeeper
    


      - Govt gives alien tech / dna to contractors to reverse engineer -> black budget programs
    


      - The Asgard: classic greys some of whom conduct experiments on humans on Earth -> abductions
    


      - Colson announces evidence of ET life and then the Trust tries to kill him in mysterious ways -> whistleblower attacks
    


      - The media working directly with the government -> the coverup
    


      - the alpha site -> offworld bases a la gary mckinnon
    


      - images of ships in space held / shown by Colson -> similar to what gary mckinnon found
    


      - the stock market crashing due to attempts at disclosure -> fears of the powerful against disclosure
    


      I could totally go on. Anyone else watch this episode / the series in general and see the similarities to reality? Anything I missed that might point to a reality hitherto undiscovered re: disclosure? Would love to reverse engineer topics of investigation from sci-fi  ^_^

Their paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, echoes similar claims previously made about 'Oumuamua, the first-ever cosmic interloper that was discovered in 2017. 3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 barreling toward the sun at more than 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h), and was confirmed to be an interstellar object less than 24 hours later. But in a new paper, uploaded July 16 to the preprint server arXiv, a trio of researchers have questioned whether the comet is actually some form of covert alien tech sent here by an advanced, potentially aggressive extraterrestrial civilization. Instead, they point at the comet's "anomalous characteristics" and provide alternative theories to explain them. Related: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS transforms into a giant 'cosmic rainbow' in trippy new telescope image Get the world's most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox. The study's most notable author is Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard University who is renowned for linking extraterrestrial objects to intelligent aliens. In 2023, he led a controversial expedition that claimed to have collected pieces of possible alien tech left behind by an unconfirmed interstellar meteorite in the Pacific Ocean. (These claims have since been largely debunked by outside researchers). However, Loeb and his colleagues have continued to advocate its potential alien origin and have proposed missions to track down the wandering space rock. Loeb's co-authors for the new study are both associated with the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is), a U.K. institute dedicated to planning future missions to alien star systems. In a blog post explaining the new paper, Loeb wrote that if 3I/ATLAS is a "technological artifact" it could be evidence of the dark forest hypothesis, which argues that the reason we have not found evidence of extraterrestrial life is that they are staying silent to remain invisible to potential predators or prey. Loeb wrote that the object's trajectory "offers various benefits to an extraterrestrial intelligence" that may be using it to subtly spy on Earth. One such benefit is that 3I/ATLAS will make relatively close approaches to three planets: Jupiter, Mars and Venus. 3I/ATLAS will also be hidden on the opposite side of the sun to Earth when it reaches its closest point to our home star in late October. "This could be intentional to avoid detailed observations from Earth-based telescopes when the object is brightest or when gadgets are sent to Earth from that hidden vantage point," Loeb wrote. The unusually high speed of 3I/ATLAS also makes it very hard to launch a spacecraft to intercept it before it exits the solar system, which could be another potential sign of clandestine alien activity, the researchers argued. Based on its current speed, Loeb also noted that 3I/ATLAS would have entered the outer boundaries of the solar system around 8,000 years ago, which is "roughly when human-made technologies became advanced enough to start documenting history on Earth." The researchers also argued that there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, especially as researchers are yet to identify any "volatiles," or specific chemicals associated with comets, within its coma. Since 3I/ATLAS was discovered, researchers have been trying to identify it, and so far, the overwhelming consensus is that it is a comet. "There have been numerous telescopic observations of 3I/ATLAS demonstrating that it's displaying classical signatures of cometary activity," Darryl Seligman, an astronomer at Michigan State University who led the first study quantifying 3I/ATLAS, told Live Science in an email. "All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet that was ejected from another solar system, just as countless billions of comets have been ejected from our own solar system," added Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina in Canada who specializes in solar system dynamics. Any assumptions about the object's lack of volatiles is also premature at this time. "The object is still pretty far away from the sun, so no, we wouldn't typically expect to find direct evidence of volatiles necessarily," Seligman said. Instead, these compounds will likely become apparent in the coming weeks and months, he added. Loeb admits that the alien technology scenario is a long shot: "By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet," he wrote in the blog post. "Any suggestion that it's artificial is nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object." —An interstellar object exploded over Earth in 2014, declassified government data reveal —An interstellar visitor may have changed the course of 4 solar system planets, study suggests Loeb is no stranger to this type of criticism and has defended his position, writing that "the hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to explore, irrespective of its likely validity." However, while it is important to remain open-minded about any "testable prediction," the new paper pushes this sentiment to the limit, Lawler told Live Science in an email. He studied marine biology at the University of Exeter before training to become a journalist. He also writes Live Science's weekly Earth from space series.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>HBO's True Blood, which originally ended its run in 2014, is experiencing a major resurgence across Central and Eastern Europe. According to this week's HBO Top 10 rankings, the vampire fantasy drama is currently charting in 13 countries, including Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary, among others. This sudden spike underscores a renewed interest in long-finished genre series. Therefore, the recent rising viewership for True Blood appears to be a synergy of algorithmic suggestions and fan love for Charlaine Harris's The Southern Vampire Mysteries, especially considering that True Blood concluded its story in 2014. What makes True Blood's revival remarkable is its cross-country consistency. Its average weekly ranking sits at 5.4, with strong showings in smaller markets like Moldova (#8), Slovakia (#6), and Slovenia (#10). While The Vampire Diaries and its spinoff The Originals remain iconic CW staples with massive fanbases, True Blood has carved a darker, more mature lane that now probably feels fresher in today's streaming landscape for a niche fanbase. Unlike TVD's teen-focused romance and high school intrigue, True Blood leans heavily into Southern Gothic themes, political allegory, and adult content and that offers viewers a grittier, more provocative take on vampire mythology. In terms of longevity, TVD ran for eight seasons compared to True Blood's seven, but it's HBO's bolder creative freedom and risk-taking that is probably giving True Blood the required traction at this point. TVD holds a 86% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes but lacks strong critic scores across seasons. The CW franchise thrived on cliffhangers, spinoffs, and growing teen-interest in riding the supernatural bandwagon back then but that's not as relevant now, likely because people are more inclined toward procedural dramas that are simultaneously branched out and more realistic. True Blood, on the other hand, is a self-contained series with no spinoffs. True Blood is available to stream on HBO.

He specializes in history, strange science, and anything out of the ordinary. Laura is an editor and staff writer at IFLScience. She obtained her Master's in Experimental Neuroscience from Imperial College London. Ed and Melinda Pardy, weather enthusiasts from Alberta, Canada, were attempting to look for funnel clouds after a recent storm when they spotted the highly unusual orb in a field behind their property. According to Ed, the sphere appeared to hover above the ground at a height of around 7 meters (23 feet). “Then I was like, ‘Oh, that'll go away really soon,' and it didn't.” Ed, who had read about the phenomenon as a child, wondered whether it might be the elusive "ball lightning", potentially described back as far as the 12th century CE. Back then, an account from one abbot describes how "a sort-of fiery globe threw itself down into the river". "For a long time ball lightning was regarded with scepticism. Although it is now generally accepted as a genuine phenomenon with thousands of reported sightings, there is still no accepted scientific explanation of its origin," Giles Gasper and Brian Tanner, who highlighted the 12th century account, explain in a piece for The Conversation. "Highly complicated theories include the burning of silicon from vaporised soil. It is one of the oldest scientific puzzles that remains unsolved." While we know very little of the phenomenon – given its rarity – in recent years, scientists have been less dismissive of it. In 2012, researchers at the Northwest Normal University in Lanzhou, China set up cameras and a spectrometer in the Qinghai Plateau, known for its frequent lightning, and recorded until they saw an apparent ball of lightning. "It is known that silicon, iron, and calcium are the main components of soil. For a start, this object appears larger than previous reports of ball lightning. “The brightness of ball lightning is typically given by witnesses as comparable to that of a 100 W lamp," Mark Stenhoff, the author of Ball Lighting (1999), previously told IFLScience. It is often reported fairly close to the ground, so obstructions would also limit the distance over which it could be observed”. "There's actually maybe one thing that tends to produce this color, especially when it comes to lightning," astronomy YouTuber Anton Petrov explains in a video. Though ball lightning would be awesome, something far less rare called "electric power line arcs" could be the culprit here. “Sometimes an arc can be formed that travels across those lines, flashing with an orange and blue light, and then at the very end, it typically vanishes in a puff of sparks. And that's exactly what we're seeing here,” storm chaser George Kourounis told CTV News, though he added that he couldn't be completely sure without witnessing it first-hand. "If it is ball lightning," he added, "then this is one of the best ball lightning videos I've ever seen." Receive weekly science coverage direct to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>China is working super hard to contend for the position of the frontier of research and development, as its CNSA (China's National Space Administration) recently announced a discovery of an extraterrestrial ocean that could shift the race in its favor. This race is happening between China, Japan, and the West. This extraterrestrial body was said to be more of a liquid layer covering up an entire world, made up of a substance we don't even know about yet as humans. It was described much more clearly as a fluid, resting, and floating mass of water drifting across the galaxy. Now, after making these substantial claims, the inevitable reality of questions slipping into the minds of many becomes an obvious reality. One such question is, “What is this extraterrestrial ocean made up of if it's not water?” Another interesting question most enthusiasts seem to be asking is, “Could this new water form support planetary life as we know it? In other words, the discovery stipulated that this extraterrestrial form does not behave like any liquid we know on planet Earth. Instead, it moves in waves and reacts to gravitational forces. Just like many other nations that have developed hyper-sophisticated spacecraft to study our cosmos from the lenses of astronomy, China has also developed its Tianwen-X probe. Shortly after this discovery was made, closer attention was paid to expand the details of it, and upon clearer observation, it was found that the thermal and erratic heat signatures that were being emitted from the planet were a liquid-like layer wrapping around the planet, disguising itself as some form of energy system. After a series of highly advanced tests that specialized in complex systems like spectrography and magnetic field analysis were carried out, it was eventually universally agreed that this ocean is composed of high-energy particles that are bound in a fluidic quantum state. In recent times, making such substantial discoveries is necessary to deeply understand our planet and the universe alike. This new concept challenges everything we know about physics. This is just a glimpse of the possibilities in our universe. Consequently, what we consider normal and straight on Earth doesn't seem to follow through once in the deepest parts of space and beyond.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There is no shortage of speculation surrounding From, but one Julie Matthews theory could actually help explain a strange moment from season 2. Like any good mystery show, From's complex nature means that with each new episode, more questions are introduced, while their answers are slowly revealed over time. By From season 3's ending, there are more questions than ever. Julie's story walking and how it connects to other events is still unclear, though one new theory suggests it's more important than we currently know. From season 3 introduced Julie Matthews' ability to story walk, a variation of time travel that allows her to revisit various moments from the stories of other characters. Between Julie Matthews' time travel and the introduction of the Man in Yellow, there are many theories about what will happen in From season 4. It argues that it was actually Julie, in one of her story walking adventures, who knocks on the RV during the scene in which Jim, Randall, Donna, and Boyd are trapped in the crashed vehicle overnight (via Reddit). This moment came at a crucial point in season 2 when Randall was getting ever closer to breaking down, just before the trio lapses into their comas. From is following in Lost's footsteps as the MGM+ science-fiction horror series repeats a cleverly teased plot twist that Lost used 17 years ago. This could make sense, given that the previous time that she saw the cave system, she was utterly horrified and got lost trying to follow her mother and Victor. Likewise, several other theories similarly highlight Julie's newfound ability as the answer to longstanding mysteries. Audiences also know from season 3's ending that Julie with short hair appears just before Jim's death, trying to change his story to help him survive. This moment both reaffirms Ethan's words of advice to his sister and implies, due to her changed appearance, that Julie remains in Fromville for a long time beyond season 3's ending. Even without being able to change the past, Julie does not yet know how other versions of herself impacted it. Importantly, Ethan's reveal that Julie will not be able to change the past with her story walking seems to come true sadly quickly, but there could be numerous events that she doesn't necessarily know she is involved in yet. Even without being able to change the past, Julie does not yet know how other versions of herself impacted it. The Man in Yellow's identity is still a mystery after From season 3, but one fan theory claims he's the older version of an existing character. In general, From would be better off using Julie's story walking ability sparingly in season 4, as it could become repetitive if the series solved too many mysteries that way. With that being said, though, if the series does use Julie's new talent in the right moments, it could create perfect big reveals. There has been a new exciting update surrounding the upcoming season 4 of one of the best horror shows on TV, which further raises its anticipation. The knocking and how afraid Randall is what forces him out into the woods at night, leading to him ending up in a coma. This event and its unfortunate outcome make it feel more likely that the Man in Yellow made the noise, or at least ordered one of From's monsters to do it for him. Every helpful discovery is countered by a worse foe, leading to the theory that the Man in Yellow is behind it all. Though it is possible that Julie could have accidentally scared them by knocking, the Man in Yellow is known for creating chaos and fear, so it seems more likely that it was an insidious and intentional move by him. Interestingly, From introduced the Man in Yellow in the season 3 finale, when he appears to kill Jim, linking him to Julie and her story walking. Every helpful discovery is countered by a worse foe, leading to the theory that the Man in Yellow is behind it all. Whether this means that one or both of them played a role in the knocking, it's possible that the moment unknowingly led Fromville's residents to where they are now. From is a series revolving around a mysterious American town that ensnares newcomers, forcing its inhabitants to maintain order and find an escape amidst nighttime perils from the surrounding forest. The residents face threats from terrifying creatures emerging after sunset, complicating their struggle for survival. Share your opinions in the thread below and remember to keep it respectful. Three months after the series wrapped up, a Yellowstone spinoff has become a global hit on Netflix, proving the future is bright for Taylor Sheridan. It's hard to ignore Buffy the Vampire Slayer losing momentum in later seasons, but the moment things started going wrong is often overlooked by fans. These 10 HBO miniseries are absolute masterpieces, showing what makes great miniseries, and number 1 may even be one of the best shows of all time. Mastering such a wide and varied genre like sci-fi isn't easy, and keeping that quality up is even harder - which makes masterpieces stand even more. A fresh perspective on the genre, this crime drama series with a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score promises to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.</p>

In it, a dark object can be seen emerging from the clouds and flying past the cockpit of Arteaga's plane. A UFO expert has since come out to endorse the video, branding it ‘one of the greatest' pieces of evidence. Arteaga and his co-pilot, Daniel, were in the skies above Colombia when they noticed the strange object moving in their direction. The aircraft was flying at a speed of 300KMH (186mph), with temperatures falling to five degrees Celsius. Maussan spoke with Arteaga for an interview, and shared a clip to X. But can you blame them for being so fascinated? A documentary came out earlier this year which claimed the US government had been involved in an '80-year cover-up' on the matter. Then there were the whistleblowers testifying in Congress about ‘excessive secrecy' surrounding non-human intelligence. And that's not forgetting all the video footage out there – like this object seen flying over New York City or this UFO spotted during an eclipse in Texas.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dynamite will launch a new ongoing Supernatural comic book series. Image Comics to release Ice Cream Man as deck of cards. Ice Cream Man to release deck of cards. This is Comic Book Club News for July 22, 2025. Discovery Global Consumer Products have announced a brand-new Supernatural comic book series is debuting this October. Back in 2008, Wildstorm (under DC Comics) published a series of in-continuity miniseries tying into Supernatural: Origins, Rising Son, Beginning's End, and Caledonia. In fact, according to  the publisher, “Warner Brothers was not looking to license Supernatural out as there's no event around it… But we politely pushed as we really wanted it, and over the course of the last two years, and some pitches, Warner Brothers felt like we had the right team to move it forward.” In the new series, “the monster hunters will hear of a series of mysterious fires haunting a decaying rust belt town. When a local factory burns down, followed by several employees going up in flames, and the CEO is suspiciously well-prepared, it's up to Dean and Sam to figure out what's going on and set it straight!” Back in 2019, Marvel Studios released a little movie called Avengers: Endgame. While Marvel is light on details for the December 31, 2025 debuting event — more will be revealed at San Diego Comic-Con — we do have two teaser images that directly call to mind the MCU blockbuster. A straight-up crib of the head pile main poster for Endgame. That said, we can tell a few things based on this parody teases. The above-the-line characters in the event are Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, King T'Challa, Peter Parker, Logan, Mei Igarashi, Janet Van Dyne, Reed Richards (aka Doom), and Reed Richards (aka The Maker). Other characters listed are Charli Ramsey, Thor Odinson, Sif, Lejori Joena Zakaria, Luke Cage, Nico Minoru, America Chavez, Illyana Rasputin, Emmanuel Da Costa, and Bruce Banner. But more important are the other credits: the Ultimate Writers are Jonathan Hickman, Bryan Hill, Peach Momoko, Deniz Camp, and Chris Condon. While none of that is a huge surprise — those are the writers and editors, after all — the inclusion of Feige on there does drive home the increased collaboration between Marvel Comics and Studios. Whether there are any portals in Ultimate Endgame or anyone says “I love you 3000” remains to be seen. Image Comics‘ Ice Cream Man regularly pushes the comic book form with every issue. The custom-designed deck featuring custom backs and a custom box as well are designed by Morazzo, O'Halloran and Good Old Neon. Image teases that “Some cards will tell part of the story; while other cards cast inscrutable spells on unwitting characters; and some must be joined with other cards to form a complete piece of art.” And the only person available to watch me while sick was my German next door neighbor—a lovely woman named Inge, who, over time, would become a sort of surrogate grandmother to me. She taught me how to play Gin rummy that be-pocked week, and if I close my eyes now I can still hear her shuffling the deck, tapping her gigantic press-on nails onto the table between drags of her extra long Kool cigarettes. “The cards were alive for me back then, and so this little Ice Cream Man experiment is dedicated to Inge: let's see if we can't bring some cards to life one more time!” The Mortal Coil Shuffle will be a limited one-time-only printing, and Image promises there will never be a second printing, no new runs, and it will never exist in any of the Ice Cream Man trades or collections. Ice Cream Man: Mortal Coil Shuffle will hit comic book shops on Wednesday, October 1. For Comic Book Club News, I'm Alex Zalben. And great news, going forward, we're publishing this podcast as a tub of ice cream. Got tips or stories you'd like us to cover?

Clive Palmer's political parties Trumpets of Patriots and the United Australia Party (UAP) have not reported their privacy breach to her office, despite claiming to have done so, Australia's privacy commissioner says. Last week, Palmer's parties announced that they were the victims of a ransomware attack that had exposed “all emails to and from the Political Parties (including their attachments) and documents and records created and or held electronically by the Political Parties at any time”. However, a spokesperson for the OAIC says it has no record of a breach being reported to the agency. Under Australian privacy law, entities have 30 days to report a breach. Based on Palmer's parties' claim that an intruder was detected on 23 June, a formal report of the breach is due by tomorrow, 23 July. An OAIC spokesperson said it had not confirmed whether “any or all of them are entitled to claim the political party exemption” given the recency of the event. Failing to report a breach can result in penalties under the Privacy Act. “The exemption is not only out of step with community expectations, it is not reflective of the nature and scope of risks to Australians' privacy in the digital era,” she said to Crikey. The OAIC has always opposed the political party exemption, and Kind said that each new data breach was a reminder why Australian organisations should be improving their cybersecurity practices. “The Australian community wants more, not fewer, protections on their privacy,” Kind said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Contemporary Ireland is best thought of as a paranormal state. The paranormal is that which is “analogous or parallel to, but separate from or going beyond” known reality. The principle site of paranormal activity in Ireland is not some haunted castle or spooky seance. In many ways, the story of contemporary Ireland is encapsulated in the astonishing growth in the share of overall tax revenue contributed by corporation tax. In 1984, it was just 4 per cent. By 2014,  it had almost tripled to 11 per cent. It has by now almost tripled again to 29 per cent. Most of this dizzying increase is what official bodies call “excess”. “In other words,” as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council puts it, “it cannot be explained by underlying domestic activity.” Or, in the Central Bank's formulation, it is “disconnected from actual economic activity in Ireland”. It is paranormal and, I think, unprecedented. Has any state ever driven such a great distance on the fumes of airy superfluity? To get a sense of the scale of this ectoplasmic largesse, we can ask: how much money would the State have taken in last year if the share of its revenues accounted for by corporation tax were the same as 2014? So we're looking at €16 billion of last year's revenue that was accounted for simply by the magical growth in the proportional contribution of corporation tax paid by a tiny number of American multinationals. To put that in context, €16 billion is the combined budget of the departments of Education and Transport this year. Little Ireland received more tax revenue from American corporations than any other country outside the US At one level, of course, this windfall is not mysterious. They have transferred their intangible assets – patents, trademarks, brands and software licences – from overly obvious offshore tax havens to the more respectable but still very generous environs of Ireland. The Irishness of this intellectual property (IP) is a legal fiction. We might call it IPP: Intellectual Plastic Paddy. But IPP allows the corporations to massively inflate the profits they declare here and the State to claim 12.5 per cent (now rising to 15 per cent) of those profits. It might be reassuring to imagine that all this is the result of a cunning plan of Irish governments. It went along with those reforms grudgingly and with bad grace when it had no real choice. This is the irony: the State has been enriched against its will, dragged kicking and screaming into Aladdin's cave. Nonetheless, in 2022-2023, the latest year for which we have figures from the US, little Ireland received more tax revenue from American corporations than any other country outside the US. It is this  magic fountain that waters our parafiscal exchequer. The State essentially runs two budgets. If we leave aside the morality – and by God do we ever leave aside the morality – it's free money. The luck of the Irish has turned from a sick joke into a daily reality. It cannot make up its collective mind whether the “excess” is a conjuring trick or hard fact. Or is it a little Eden from which, any day now, we will be expelled and thenceforth have to earn our bread by the sweat of our brows? Unearned wealth – and let's be clear that this is what most of this “excess” corporation tax is – leads to laziness This is the underlying reason for the almost inexplicable inability of a very rich country to reach European standards of infrastructure and social services. Because we don't think the bonanza is real and sustainable, we can't plan to spend it sustainably. Yet because we have this embarrassment of riches, we don't have to think about how we raise and spend money in the normal, tangible Irish economy. Why, indeed, make any real choices at all? Unearned wealth – and let's be clear that this is what most of this “excess” corporation tax is – leads to laziness. The State needs to pick a side: either decide that the crock of gold will keep renewing itself and invest accordingly, or conclude that leprechaun economics has had its day.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>DEAR READERS: I was recently interviewed by the Nashville Voyager Magazine. I thought I would share some of the questions they asked me, so you would also get to know a little bit more about me. I have been writing this column for many years, and I am so proud to offer the topic of spirituality in a non-scary, non-woo-woo way, and I never dreamed my column would be as popular or welcomed as it has been, and I am so grateful to each of you who takes the time to read my words each week. Q: Bonnie, please kick things off for us with an introduction to yourself and your story. For many generations, my ancestors have had this gift from God running through their veins. The house I grew up in was an old historical schoolhouse, and there always seemed to be spirits available for my viewing and engaging with. Since my mother had the gift of mediumship [and] could see what I was seeing and could alleviate any fears that I had with connecting to the spirit world, I grew up thinking everyone saw spirits. As I grew older, the spirit world would become even stronger in my life. Hearing the voice of God asking me to do this work, I asked, “Why?” when he said, “Little One, the world is becoming darker and darker, and we need more light.” I closed down my Salon I owned and “Messages from Heaven” was born. For over a decade, I have been a full-time demonstrating medium, giving audiences, large and small, a glimpse into Heaven with the intention of providing proof that life goes on and the bond of love can never die. I am now at the point of opening a private office just fifteen minutes from Nashville in Franklin, Tenn. I have also written three books found on Amazon and I've been writing a weekly column for the last seven years called “Ask the Psychic” as a freelance columnist for [MediaNews Group], which is seen in many of their papers. Q: I'm sure it wasn't obstacle-free, but would you say the journey has been fairly smooth so far? I am not going to force a belief on anyone, I am just here to show by giving evidence that life goes on and there is another way to look at death and living. Q: As you know, we're big fans of Medium Bonnie Page/Messages from Heaven. For our readers who might not be as familiar, what can you tell them about the brand? A: I specialize in private readings, gallery events, and teaching others to connect with the spirit world. As a Reiki Master and healer, my work is always about the healing aspect of mediumship. A: What matters to me most is the reason why I do this work. I am working for God, offering healing and light to others along the way.</p>
