                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Now, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have identified a link between stress and inflammation and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most aggressive and lethal types of cancer. Previous studies have shown that inflammation and cellular stress activate a protein called STAT3 - short for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 - in pancreas cells, promoting tumor initiation, adaptation to stress and resistance to treatment. How STAT3 accomplishes this has not been understood until now. In the current study, the researchers discovered that in some cancer cells, STAT3 is able to activate specific genes critical for adaptation to stress and inflammation. The researchers believe the findings can be applied to precision medicine, developing early screening tools that recognize precancerous cells. It could also help clinicians and identify which patients are more likely to develop aggressive cancers and which ones will respond better to traditional pancreatic cancer treatment as the disease progresses to later stages, according to senior author of the study, David Cheresh, Ph.D., distinguished professor and vice chair for research and development in the Department of Pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center. They are also beginning to explore molecules that block inflammation from activating ITGB3 in pancreatic cancer as well as other cancers that affect the surface of tissues, including lung, breast and skin cancers in order to prevent tumors from progressing, spreading and becoming resistant to drug therapies. A STAT3/integrin axis accelerates pancreatic cancer initiation and progression. Discover how super-resolution technology can be used to sudy neurotransmission at inhibitory synapses.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cells called astrocytes are about as abundant in the brain as neurons, but scientists have spent much less time figuring out how they contribute to brain functions. A novel study by MIT researchers at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory shows that one function appears to be maintaining the chemical conditions necessary for groups of neurons to team up to encode information. Specifically, the neuroscientists showed that when they knocked out the ability of astrocytes in the visual cortex of mice to produce a protein called "GABA transporter 3 (Gat3)," neurons there became less able as a group to represent information about the movies lab mice were seeing. GABA is a common inhibitory neurotransmitter that sharpens neural activity and astrocytes uniquely use Gat3 to regulate the ambient level of GABA in their area. In the study in eLife, knocking out Gat3 in the visual cortex left neurons stewing in a soup of excess GABA that only produced subtle effects on individual neurons, but nevertheless added up to a significant impairment on their efforts as an ensemble responsible for visual function. Even if the changes at the level of a single neuron representing a visual stimulus do not change significantly, if a hundred neurons have some small changes, that could add up at the population level to a measurable, significant change." To make the discovery, BCS graduate student Jiho Park used a novel implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock out Gat3 combined with statistical and computational analyses of neural activity at the population level, Sur said. As neuroscientists have studied the brain's visual system over many decades, neurons have claimed most of their attention because they are electrically active and more easily targeted genetically, Sur said. But in 2019, the National Institutes of Health gave Sur a grant to develop better tools for studying astrocytes. The tool allowed them to use just one viral vector to target the gene that encodes Gat3 for multiple cuts. That multiplexed attack decisively and precisely knocked it out in visual cortex astrocytes. Once Park knocked out Gat3, she could see the effects of its absence by visually tracking the calcium activity of neurons, a proxy for their electrical activity. When the mice were watching only a gray screen, instead of movies, the neurons would spontaneously activate less often, too. Though ambient levels of GABA were higher, pairs of neurons still shared GABA through their direct connections, or "synapses," as before, meaning their direct dialogue with each other didn't change. "We were expecting to see changes in orientation tuning among other things, but we didn't see that," Park said. "That's why we looked into deeper levels of analysis to see if there's any difference." That deeper analysis occurred at the level of broader neural ensembles, where Park used several statistical and computational methods to analyze how the collective information encoding by hundreds of neurons changed when Gat3 was knocked out. Using a statistical method called a "Generalized Linear Model" to analyze patterns of activity across the ensemble, Park discovered that when Gat3 was knocked out, the activity of neurons became less predictive of the activity of others in the group compared to when Gat3 was present. This indicated that while individual neurons might still be doing what they were supposed to, their coordination was impaired. Meanwhile using a "Support Vector Machine"-based decoder to discern the information that ensembles were representing, she found that when Gat3 was present the decoder could improve its assessment as more neurons were added to its sample. But when Gat3 was knocked out, the decoder could no longer ascertain the represented information even as its sample size increased. "The decoding deficits following Gat3 ablation provide evidence that astrocytic regulation of ambient GABA is essential for organizing the coordinated neuronal activity patterns necessary for efficient information encoding in visual cortical networks," the authors wrote in eLife. "Because our study is the first to look at Gat3 effects on a population level, it might help tie that back to some of the behavioral phenotypes people have been seeing," Park said. But more research is needed, Sur noted, because there are other Gat proteins, such as Gat1, that the brain might use to compensate. In addition to Park and Sur, the paper's other authors are Grayson Sipe, Xin Tang, Prachi Ojha, Giselle Fernandes, Yi Ning Leow, Caroline Zhang, Yuma Osako, Arundhati Natesan, Gabrielle Drummond and Rudolf Jaenisch.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study by NYU Langone Health researchers found that the shutdown of a significant fossil fuel pollution source near Pittsburgh, PA, resulted in immediate improvements in respiratory health. Assessing data from nearby local and federal air quality monitors, the researchers tracked the air pollution health effects on residents near the Shenango plant before and after its closure in 2016. Results showed that within the first few weeks after the plant's closure in January 2016, respiratory related emergency visits decreased by about 20 percent. These findings indicate that reductions in fossil-fuel related air pollution are linked to both short and long-term lung health benefits, the researchers say. The adverse reductions in respiratory health effects were much greater than expected, based on past studies of general air pollution in the U.S., indicating that emissions from such fossil fuel related sources are especially toxic." Dr. Thurston is a professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a member of the American Thoracic Society. "This study provides rare, in-the-field evidence that the closure of a major industrial pollution source can lead to immediate and lasting improvements in the lung health of the those who live nearby," added the article's first author, Wuyue Yu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. "By tracking health outcomes before and after the coke plant closure, we were able to isolate the effects of reduced air pollution and observe that cleaner air translates into fewer respiratory emergency visits and hospitalizations."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a comprehensive Genomic Press interview published in Brain Medicine today, Dr. Hamilton Se-Hwee Oh reveals groundbreaking insights into the complex dialogue between our brains and bodies that fundamentally shapes aging, depression, and neurodegenerative disease. Working at Mount Sinai's prestigious Brain-Body Institute and Ronald M. Loeb Center for Alzheimer's Disease in New York City, Dr. Oh bridges multiple scientific disciplines to decode mechanisms that could transform treatment approaches for millions suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders. The concept of "sonder" first sparked Dr. Oh's fascination with biology during high school. This profound realization that every person experiences life as vividly and complexly as our own led him to marvel at how trillions of cells coordinate to create rich emotional and subjective experiences. His scientific path gained urgency through personal experience when diagnosed with a rare chronic kidney disease and witnessing his best friend develop persistent, unexplained abdominal pain. This personal motivation drives his current research examining how immune cells and metabolic organs amplify or dampen mood symptoms. During his Stanford PhD under Dr. Tony Wyss-Coray, Dr. Oh achieved remarkable breakthroughs that reshaped scientific understanding of human aging. His research demonstrated that human organs age at dramatically different rates, with profound implications for disease susceptibility. These findings, published in three first-authored papers in Nature and Nature Medicine, reveal why some individuals develop heart disease while others face neurodegeneration despite similar chronological ages. Perhaps most significantly, Dr. Oh identified cerebrospinal fluid synaptic biomarkers capable of predicting Alzheimer's dementia onset years before clinical symptoms manifest. This discovery opens possibilities for early intervention strategies that could alter disease trajectories. How might healthcare systems adapt if we could identify Alzheimer's risk decades before symptoms appear? His work reveals that depression involves far more than brain chemistry alone. By integrating large-scale human proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and mechanistic animal models, he demonstrates how psychological stress accelerates organ aging while peripheral molecular signals rewire neural circuits affecting mood and cognition. This multidisciplinary approach positions Dr. Oh at the forefront of precision medicine development. His research examines molecular fingerprints of interventions including exercise and ketamine therapy, seeking to understand why certain treatments work for specific individuals while failing for others. Could peripheral blood markers eventually guide personalized depression treatment selection? This observation led him to study hematopoietic stem cells in Dr. Hanna Mikkola's laboratory, investigating how transcription factors regulate immune system development. His transition to studying brain-immune interactions emerged from recognizing that external environmental cues profoundly influence cellular identity and function. What other unexpected organ systems might influence brain health in ways science has yet to discover? By revealing how specific proteins and metabolites track with depressive behavior, his work identifies novel therapeutic targets. Understanding differential organ aging patterns could enable interventions targeting root causes rather than symptoms alone. His research on exercise and ketamine's molecular mechanisms provides frameworks for developing next-generation treatments. Major depressive disorder affects multiple body systems, yet current treatments primarily target brain neurotransmitters. Dr. Oh's findings suggest that effective therapies might need to address peripheral inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and organ-specific aging processes. How might psychiatric care transform if clinicians routinely assessed organ aging profiles alongside traditional mental health evaluations? Beyond his research contributions, Dr. Oh advocates for transforming scientific funding priorities. He notes that while scientists celebrate unconventional thinking and groundbreaking discoveries, funding agencies often favor incremental research with substantial preliminary data. This disconnect may limit transformative discoveries that require high-risk exploration. Dr. Oh particularly values academic freedom to pursue unexpected leads and develop new skills, even when this temporarily reduces productivity. What revolutionary discoveries might emerge if funding structures better supported exploratory research?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a severe haemorrhagic fever virus transmitted by tick to animal and humans. By studying the virus in tick cells, scientist from the University of Surrey have identified two novel antivirals effectors. The researchers pinpointed how two RNA helicases, essential proteins found in all forms of life, were critical in reducing SFTSV's replication within the ticks. The two RNA helicases, UPF1 and DHX9, were in fact found to interfere with the virus' ability to copy itself, essentially putting a wrench in its reproductive cycle. Understanding how ticks tolerate these viruses is key for developing vector control strategies and to block tick-to-human transmission. By identifying UPF1 and DHX9 as key antiviral players, we start to unravel the complexity and uniqueness of the ticks' antiviral response. This is extremely valuable for future prevention and control strategies."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An antibody treatment developed at Stanford Medicine successfully prepared patients for stem cell transplants without toxic busulfan chemotherapy or radiation, a phase 1 clinical trial has shown. While the researchers tested the protocol on patients with Fanconi anemia, a genetic disease that makes standard stem cell transplant extremely risky, they expect it may also work for patients with other genetic diseases that require stem cell transplants. We were able to treat these really fragile patients with a new, innovative regimen that allowed us to reduce the toxicity of the stem cell transplant protocol. Specifically, we could eliminate the use of radiation and genotoxic chemotherapy called busulfan, with exceptional outcomes." Agnieszka Czechowicz, MD, PhD, study's co-senior author, assistant professor of pediatrics All three have completed two years of follow-up and are doing well. "If they don't get a transplant in time, Fanconi anemia patients' bodies eventually will not make blood, so they die of bleeding or infections," said co-first author Rajni Agarwal, MD, professor of pediatric stem cell transplantation. "The reason I am so excited about this trial is that it is a novel approach to help these patients, who are very vulnerable." The antibody, briquilimab, eliminates blood-forming stem cells without toxic side effects. The team drew upon decades of Stanford Medicine scientific advances to develop a safer technique that also makes stem cell transplants more accessible. Czechowicz has studied blood-forming stem cells since 2004, when she was an undergraduate student in the lab of Irving Weissman, MD, the Virginia and D.K. Ludwig Professor in Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research who was then the director of Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Their work focused on CD117, which regulates the cells' growth and development. This clinical trial also addressed a second challenge in stem cell transplant: In the past, about 35% to 40% of patients who need the transplants for any reason did not receive them because they lacked fully matched donors. The innovation, which was developed by Bertaina and her colleagues before she came to Stanford Medicine, reduces the risk of a transplant complication called graft-versus-host disease, in which immune cells in donated bone marrow attack the recipient. It allows patients to receive cells from someone who shares only half of their immune markers, such as a parent. "We are expanding the donors for stem cell transplantation in a major way, so every patient who needs a transplant can get one," Agarwal said. Ryder received a stem cell transplant at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in early 2022 as part of the clinical trial. Today, Ryder's Fanconi anemia "doesn't slow him down like it used to," said his mom, Andrea Reiley. Ryder, who recently finished fifth grade, is using some of his newfound energy to play sports. "Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are most commonly used in blood cancers, in which the bone marrow is full of malignant cells and patients have no other options," Czechowicz said. Eventually, their blood cell production is so diminished they have a life-threatening condition known as progressive bone marrow failure, signs of which develop in about 80% of Fanconi anemia patients by age 12. Children with Fanconi anemia can become stuck in a catch-22: A stem cell transplant can prevent and treat bone marrow failure, but because their DNA-repair machinery works so poorly, patients are extremely vulnerable to side effects - including cancer - from the chemotherapy or radiation used to prepare for these transplants. "Right now, nearly all of these patients get secondary cancers by the time they're 40," Czechowicz said, adding that her team hopes their new approach will reduce those rates. Fanconi anemia patients are also more vulnerable than other people to complications of graft-versus-host disease. The three trial participants were all younger than 10 when they received their transplants. Each patient received a single intravenous infusion of the antibody 12 days before they were scheduled to receive donated stem cells. Closer to the transplant date, they received immune-suppressing medications typically given before stem cell transplant, but no radiation or busulfan chemotherapy that is typically part of the treatment regimen. Each patient was then given a stem cell transplant consisting of cells that had been donated by a parent, depleted of alpha/beta T-cells and enriched for blood-forming stem cells. But two years later, all three patients have close to 100% of their cells from their donors - far better than the researchers expected. "We've been surprised by how well it's worked," Czechowicz said. Even with the improved protocol, a stem cell transplant is a big challenge for kids like Ryder, requiring them to spend more than a month in the hospital and endure short-term side effects such as severe exhaustion, nausea and hair loss. "It was heartbreaking to see him go through things like that - I'd rather go through it than my child," Reiley said, adding that, fortunately, Ryder remembers little of the experience. "I felt the heartbreak for him, and now he doesn't have to." "It used to be huge hits when he would get sick at all, and I really don't have to worry about that anymore." Reiley has conversations with her son about how his experience as a medical pioneer is helping experts take better care of other kids. "I think he takes a lot of pride in that, too," she said. After more than three decades of administering stem cell transplants with the traditional approach, Agarwal said she loves explaining to patients' families how much better the new options are. "When I counsel families, their eyes start to shine as they think, 'OK, we can avoid the radiation and chemo toxicity'," she said. They also plan studies to test whether the new approach will work for other conditions, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia, another genetic disease that causes bone marrow failure. Most cancer patients may still require some chemotherapy or radiation to rid them of malignant cells, said the researchers, who noted that another team at Stanford Medicine is testing whether the antibody can help elderly cancer patients who can't tolerate full doses of radiation or chemotherapy because they are fragile or have diseases in addition to cancer. "That population is often at a disadvantage," Agarwal said. "It may provide us with a way to treat them with less intensity so it's possible for them to get a transplant." The group is also working on next-generation approaches that may continue to improve the treatment regimen for patients with Fanconi anemia as well as other grievous diseases.

Tyson School of Medicine; St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; and Jasper Therapeutics Inc.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Lawrence and Penny Higgins of Fairfield, Maine, first learned in 2020 that high levels of toxic chemicals called PFAS taint their home's well water, they wondered how their health might suffer. Worse still, she added, they "really didn't want to hear about it." PFAS can affect nearly every organ system and linger in bodies for decades, raising risks of cancer, immune deficiencies, and pregnancy complications. These "forever chemicals" have been widely used since the 1950s in products including cosmetics, cookware, clothing, carpeting, food packaging, and firefighting foam. Researchers say they permeate water systems and soils nationwide, with a federal study estimating that at least 45% of U.S. tap water is contaminated. Maine was among the first states to begin extensive water and soil testing and to try to limit further public exposure to PFAS through policy action, after discovering that farms and residences — like the Higgins' property — had been contaminated by land-spreading of wastewater sludge containing PFAS. Exposure can also be high for people living near military bases, fire training areas, landfills, or manufacturing facilities. In regions where testing reveals PFAS hot spots, medical providers can be caught flat-footed and patients left adrift. Rachel Criswell, a family practice doctor and environmental health researcher, is working to change that. Her medical training at Columbia University included more than a year in Norway researching the effects of PFAS and other chemicals on maternal and infant health. When patients began asking about PFAS, Criswell and the state toxicologist offered primary care providers lunchtime presentations on how to respond. Since then, she has fielded frequent PFAS questions from doctors and patients throughout the state. Even knowledgeable providers can find it challenging to stay current given rapidly evolving scientific information and few established protocols. "The work I do is exhausting and time-consuming and sometimes frustrating," Criswell said, "but it's exactly what I should be doing." Courtney Carignan, an environmental epidemiologist at Michigan State University, said learning of PFAS exposure, whether from their drinking water or occupational sources, "is a sensitive and upsetting situation for people" and "it's helpful if their doctors can take it seriously." The national academies affirmed what Criswell had already been recommending: Doctors should order blood tests for patients with known PFAS exposures. "There isn't a day that goes by," Lawrence Higgins said, "that we don't think and wonder when our bodies are going to shut down on us." After finding out in 2021 that his family was exposed to PFAS through sludge spread on their Unity, Maine, farm decades earlier, Adam Nordell discovered that "it was exceedingly difficult" to get tested. "Our family doctor had not heard of PFAS and didn't know what the test was," he said. A lab technician needed coaching from an outside expert to source the test. "The results were devastating but incredibly helpful," Nordell said. Their blood serum levels for PFAS were at roughly the 99th percentile nationally, far higher than their well-water levels would have predicted — indicating that additional exposure was probably coming from other sources such as soil contact, dust, and food. Blood levels of PFAS between 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter may be problematic, the national academies reported. In highly contaminated settings, blood levels can run upward of 150 times the 20-ng/mL risk threshold. Nordell and his family had been planning to remain on the farm and grow crops less affected by PFAS, but the test results persuaded them to leave. "Knowledge is power," Nordell said, and having the blood data "gave us agency." Deductibles and copays can also limit patients' capacity to get tested. Less costly finger-prick tests, administered at home, appear to capture some of the more commonly found PFAS as accurately as blood serum tests, Carignan and colleagues found. Maine legislators recently passed, with overwhelming support, a bill — modeled after one in New Hampshire — that would require insurers to consider PFAS blood testing part of preventive care, but it was carried over to the next legislative session. "In my mind, it's a no-brainer that the PFAS blood serum test should be universally offered — at no cost to the patient," said Nordell, who now works as a campaign manager for the nonprofit Defend Our Health. Early screening for the diseases associated with PFAS, he said, is "a humane policy that's in the best interests of everyone involved" — patients, providers, and insurance companies. Criswell tells colleagues in family practice that they can view elevated PFAS blood levels as a risk factor, akin to smoking. In trainings, she shares a handout summarizing the national academies' guidance — including associated heath conditions, blood testing, clinical follow-up, and exposure reduction — to which she has added details about lab test order codes, insurance costs and coverage, and water filtration. Criswell served on an advisory committee tasked with allocating $60 million in state funds to address PFAS contamination from past sludge-spreading in Maine. As with many earlier PFAS policies, Maine is among the first states to adopt this measure. Screening for PFAS is falling short in many places nationwide, said Kyle Horton, an internist in Wilmington, North Carolina, and founder of the nonprofit On Your Side Health. She estimates that only about 1 in 100 people facing high PFAS exposure are getting adequate medical guidance. Even in her highly contaminated community, "I'm not aware of anyone who is routinely screening or discussing PFAS mitigation with their patients," Horton said. Testifying before a Maine legislative committee this year in support of a bill that would limit occupational PFAS exposure, Criswell said, "We, as physicians, who are sworn to protect the health of our patients, must pay attention to the underlying causes of the illnesses we treat and stand up for policy solutions that reduce these causes." Criswell and other Maine doctors have observed chronic stress among patients. Nordell, the former farmer, described his family's contamination as "deeply, deeply jarring," an ordeal that has at times left him "unmoored from a sense of security." To assess the mental health consequences of PFAS exposure in rural residents, Criswell and Abby Fleisch, a pediatric endocrinologist at the MaineHealth Institute for Research, teamed up on a study. In its first phase, winding up this summer, they collected blood samples and detailed lifestyle information from 147 people. Nordell, the Higginses, and other Central Maine residents sit on an advisory board for the study, a step Criswell said was critical to ensuring that their research helps those most affected by PFAS. Criswell has faced what she calls "cognitive dissonance," caught between the deliberate pace of peer-reviewed medical research and the immediate needs of patients eager to lower their PFAS body burden. Initially she considered inviting residents to participate in a clinical trial to test therapies that are considered safe and may help reduce PFAS levels in the body, such as high-fiber diets and a drug designed to reduce cholesterol called cholestyramine. Criswell and Fleisch are instead planning to produce a case series on PFAS blood-level changes in patients taking cholestyramine. "We can validate the research results and share those," Criswell said, potentially helping other patients. Alan Ducatman, an internist and occupational physician who helped design the largest PFAS cohort study to date, said providers should convey that "there is no risk-benefit analysis" for any of the current treatments, although they're generally well known and low-risk.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>PhoreMost Ltd., a next-generation targeted protein degradation (TPD) company progressing a pipeline of degrader therapeutics within oncology and inflammation, today announced the publication of a study demonstrating the capabilities of its high-throughput GlueSEEKER platform to accelerate the design and development of novel molecular glue degraders. The paper, titled "Systematic molecular glue drug discovery with a high-throughput effector protein remodeling platform", was published in BioRxiv and describes PhoreMost's unique approach to molecular glue discovery, wherein effector proteins, such as E3 ligases, can be engineered at scale to expand protein surface landscapes and trigger induced degradation of target proteins. GlueSEEKER is used to develop a high-resolution understanding of the physical and chemical requirements for molecular glue development, and provides the blueprints to enable small molecule drug discovery. The study describes PhoreMost's GlueSEEKER in detail and documents an end-to-end case study for small molecule molecular glue discovery with the technology. Molecular glues have now been established as an effective therapeutic modality, but these small molecule drugs have still largely only been found through serendipity. Our GlueSEEKER platform overcomes the challenges associated with monovalent glue discovery, enabling their rational and systematic design from almost any E3 ligase or target. This paper marks a significant milestone by showcasing one of our case-studies and validating our deep mutational scanning approach for prospective drug discovery." Dr Neil Torbett, CEO, PhoreMost, commented: "FDA-approved molecular glues have treated millions of patients and generated billions of dollars in revenue. The advances disclosed within this manuscript demonstrate how GlueSEEKER can radically enable the discovery of new molecular glue therapies, directing this modality towards specific targets across a broad array of E3 ligases." Neil added: "GlueSEEKER builds on PhoreMost's long-standing expertise in mini-protein engineering and high-throughput phenotypic screening to provide rich biological data which is deeply enabling for the advancement of first-in-class drugs using AI-based molecule design tools. We are excited to build upon our leading position to progress the next generation of molecular glue degrader assets for both our internal pipeline and though alliances and partnerships."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The rapid advancement of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) has opened unprecedented windows into cellular diversity, yet existing methods for multiplexing samples struggle with scalability and accuracy. Traditional techniques relying on antibodies or lipid-based barcodes often fail to uniformly label cells across different types or species, particularly in complex clinical samples. To overcome these challenges, a team led by Professor Yiwei Li at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) has pioneered Toti-N-Seq, a groundbreaking technology that harnesses the universal presence of N-glycans on cell and nuclear surfaces. Published as a cover story in Research (2025, DOI: 10.34133/research.0678), this innovation redefines how researchers approach high-throughput cellular profiling. This fusion protein binds non-selectively to all N-glycan types, enabling universal tagging of cells and nuclei. By attaching DNA barcodes to Stv-Fg, the team achieved precise sample multiplexing without cell-type or species restrictions. Experimental validations underscored its robustness: flow cytometry revealed labeling efficiencies as low as 37.5 pM for cell membranes and 75.0 pM for nuclei, with cross-contamination below 2% even after prolonged sample mixing. When applied to single-nucleus sequencing, it achieved an overall classification accuracy (OCA) of 0.987, outperforming conventional antibody- or lipid-based methods. Notably, the technology preserved rare cell populations, such as the 0.5% plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in human peripheral blood samples, while reducing doublet rates to 0.04% for single cells and 0.02% for nuclei. These capabilities were further validated in 12-plex experiments, where sample ratio deviations remained under 4%, proving its reliability for large-scale studies. Looking ahead, the Toti-N-Seq platform is set to transform both basic and applied research. The team plans to expand its multiplexing capacity to 24-plex or higher, facilitating ambitious projects like cross-organ cell atlases and high-throughput drug screening. Integration with epigenetic and proteomic tools will enable multi-dimensional single-cell analyses, shedding light on complex regulatory networks. Clinically, Toti-N-Seq's ability to retain rare cell subsets positions it as a powerful tool for dissecting tumor microenvironments and predicting immunotherapy responses. Upcoming multi-center studies will explore its diagnostic potential in cancer patient cohorts. Beyond academia, the technology's compatibility with platforms like MobiNova microfluidics promises to streamline industrial workflows, accelerating drug development and toxicity testing through standardized, reproducible protocols. By leveraging the ubiquity of N-glycans, Professor Li's team has created a versatile tool that bridges species and cell types while preserving biological nuance. As the technology moves toward clinical and industrial adoption, it holds the potential to democratize high-resolution cellular profiling, empowering discoveries from developmental biology to personalized medicine.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from McMaster University researchers has found that many people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who believe they are sensitive to gluten or wheat may not actually react to these ingredients. IBS is an intestinal disorder that affects an estimated 10 per cent of Canadians – one of the highest prevalence rates globally, according to the Canadian Digestive Health Foundation. The study, published in The Lancet Gastroenetrology and Hepatology on July 21, 2025, included participants with clinically diagnosed IBS who reported feeling better on a gluten-free diet. These individuals were given cereal bars to eat containing either gluten, whole wheat, or neither -- without knowing, which was which, in a random order. Researchers found the number of people who experienced worse symptoms was similar across all three groups, including the gluten-free placebo, suggesting that expectations and beliefs, rather than the ingredients themselves, may be driving symptoms in many cases. Not every patient who believes they are reacting to gluten actually does. Some truly have a sensitivity to this food protein, but for many others, it's the belief itself that's driving their symptoms and subsequent choices to avoid gluten-containing foods." Premysl Bercik, senior author, professor with McMaster's Department of Medicine When participants were later told which bars caused gastrointestinal symptoms, most did not change their beliefs or their diets. Bercik says the findings suggest that some patients with IBS may benefit, apart from dietary guidance also from psychological support and personalized care. "What we need to improve in our clinical management of these patients is to work with them further, not just tell them that gluten is not the trigger and move on. The study thus sheds light on why many people with IBS continue to avoid gluten, even when it may not be the true cause of their symptoms. Bercik says the powerful role of social media and online communities can also fuel ideas that gluten is harmful. "There is strong influence from the internet. Many patients post how bad they feel about gluten. To conduct the study, researchers designed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial. After each challenge, participants reported their symptoms, and stool samples were analyzed to objectively measure gluten intake. Even though most participants said they ate the gluten or wheat bars, lab tests showed many didn't.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study by researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health identified that uranium's isotopic composition can be used as a biomarker to noninvasively measure accumulation of uranium in the kidneys. Uranium from drinking water can accumulate in the kidneys-even at low levels of exposure-and this newly identified biomarker may serve as an early warning sign of kidney damage. The findings, published in Environmental Science & Technology, suggest a potential breakthrough in detecting and preventing chronic kidney disease caused by uranium toxicity. This discovery offers critical insights into a largely overlooked environmental health threat. Uranium that enters the body through drinking water is filtered by the kidneys, where some of it is retained and can cause harm over time. Our study suggests that uranium isotopes in urine may provide a sensitive, noninvasive biomarker for detecting kidney accumulation and the risk of damage." Anirban Basu, PhD, senior author, geochemist and research scientist at Columbia Mailman School According to federal data, nearly two-thirds of U.S. community water systems-serving approximately 320 million people-have detectable uranium levels. While uranium is best known as a radioactive element, its chemical toxicity-particularly to the kidneys-is the more pressing concern at environmental exposure levels. Studies show that even low concentrations of uranium (below the 30 μg/L MCL) may impair kidney function. "Our findings raise particular concern for communities in the Great Plains and the Colorado Plateau, including many Native American populations, where natural uranium deposits and legacy mining activity have led to high groundwater contamination," added Basu. Roughly 80% of ingested uranium is excreted in urine within days, but the remainder can accumulate in the kidneys-especially in the outer layer, where it binds to cells, causes injury, and interferes with vital functions. Over time, this damage can contribute to chronic kidney disease. "Current tools to measure uranium in the body don't tell us how much is accumulating in the kidneys specifically – this is a big roadblock to understanding and preventing long-term kidney damage from uranium exposure," said first author Catherine Lucey, a doctoral student in environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman School. In experiments with mice, researchers found uranium accumulation in both the kidneys and bones with distinct isotopic signatures after just 7 to 14 days of exposure to contaminated water. Because uranium's isotopic signature is detectable in urine, this biomarker could enable cost-effective and noninvasive monitoring of kidney uranium levels-especially useful in communities at higher risk of exposure. "Our results support the development of new models to predict how uranium travels through the body-from ingestion to accumulation and excretion," said Lucey. "This work lays the foundation for precision biomarkers that could lead to earlier intervention-before irreversible kidney damage occurs." The study is part of a broader effort to improve environmental health surveillance and develop tools for monitoring metal exposures in vulnerable populations. The researchers plan future studies with longer exposure periods and lower uranium doses to better understand long-term effects. Other co-authors include Brandon L.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A person without Friedreich's ataxia typically has fewer than 30 of the triplet letters GAA in a row. The test to discover this expansion is straightforward, but Bidichandani's team wondered if there was more to the story than a greater length of GAA letters. When they used a new technology called long-read sequencing, they discovered something that no one had found before: "spelling errors" in the long string of GAA letters in some people with the condition. Instead of GAA expanded 1,500 times, we found different combinations of G's and A's that the original test could not detect. It is a whole new level of genetic variability that was not being taken into account in the diagnosis and prognosis of Friedreich's ataxia." The discovery is significant for several reasons. Bidichandani's preliminary research using long-read sequencing shows that people with GAA letter irregularities seem to have a milder version of the disease in which they experience slower progression. His data thus far also shows that about 30% of people with the condition have this irregular spelling. "Our first goal with this new grant is to determine the real diversity of genotypes in people with Friedreich's ataxia, and then to determine whether their condition is actually less severe." The research has major implications for clinical trials, Bidichandani said. People in ongoing trials have been enrolled based on the assumption that there is one presentation of Friedreich's ataxia with a straightforward expansion of GAA letters. If trial participants appear to be responding to a drug, they actually could have a milder version of the condition instead, Bidichandani said. Understanding the different genotypes is also essential for people who want to undergo testing before deciding to have children. "Because the standard test performed by many clinical diagnostic labs does not detect the spelling errors, people may receive a false negative result for carrier testing," he said. "We have already discovered several families who've been told they're not carriers, but when we do our specialized test, it turns out that they are carriers." Bidichandani's grant was one of only 19 Impact Awards funded nationally through the fiscal year 2024 Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program within the Department of Defense. It is called an Impact Award because grant recipients are expected to make discoveries that have an immediate effect on patient care. Friedreich's ataxia is rare; about 5,000 people in the United States have the condition, and there is currently only one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment. "This is an exciting time for our research program," Bidichandani said. "We believe our findings will have a beneficial impact on people with Friedreich's ataxia and their families."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A breakthrough AI model can spot silent structural heart disease from a simple ECG, promising to catch dangerous conditions earlier, streamline patient care, and close the diagnostic gap missed by traditional screening. In a recent study published in the journal Nature, a group of researchers investigated whether an artificial intelligence (AI) electrocardiogram (ECG) model can reliably detect diverse structural heart diseases (SHDs) across various hospitals and care settings, outperforming standard physician review. The model, called EchoNext, was developed as a multitask classifier to address collinearity among different SHD component labels. Every minute, another United States (US) patient enters the hospital with symptoms that may mask underlying SHD. Treating SHD already drains the nation of more than 100 billion dollars each year. Yet, an estimated 6.4% of older adults carry clinically significant valvular heart disease (VHD) that has never been diagnosed, in addition to 4.9% already diagnosed, making the total prevalence over 11%. Early echocardiography saves lives, but ultrasound labs, trained readers, and patient travel costs remain barriers, leaving busy clinicians guessing whom to scan. Large-scale digital ECG archives and modern AI offer a low-cost alternative: if one ten-second ECG could reliably uncover silent disease, scarce imaging resources could be directed to those who need them most. Further research is needed to determine whether algorithm-guided screening improves survival and equity. Additionally, the paper discusses potential deployment strategies for such models, including both “gatekeeper” and “safety net” applications, each with unique benefits and trade-offs for clinical practice. Investigators assembled 1,245,273 paired ECG-echocardiogram records from 230,318 adults treated between 2008 and 2022 at eight NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) hospitals, reserving patient-level splits for training, validation, and testing. SHD was labeled when any guideline defined abnormality was present with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45%, left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 1.3 cm, moderate or worse right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) ≥ 45 mm Hg, or tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity ≥ 3.2 m/s as an alternative pulmonary hypertension definition, moderate or worse regurgitation/stenosis of any valve, or a moderate/large pericardial effusion. The authors note these thresholds are somewhat arbitrary, as different studies and guidelines may use varying cutoffs. A convolutional neural network named EchoNext ingested the raw 12-lead waveform, along with seven routine ECG parameters and age/sex data. Performance was first measured on a held-out NYP test set, and then on external cohorts from Cedars-Sinai, the Montreal Heart Institute, and the University of California, San Francisco. Generalization across age, sex, race, ethnicity, and clinical context was assessed. Silent “shadow” deployment ran EchoNext on 84,875 consecutive ECGs from patients without previous echocardiography, storing scores but not influencing care. Finally, a single-site pilot, Detecting Structural Heart Disease Using Deep Learning on an Electrocardiographic Waveform Array (DISCOVERY), prospectively invited adults with no recent imaging to undergo echocardiography stratified by a predecessor model's risk score; EchoNext was analyzed post hoc. EchoNext, an AI-powered ECG model, excelled in retrospective analysis. External validation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI), and the University of California, San Francisco, yielded AUROC values of 78 to 80%, despite higher disease prevalence. Disease-specific performance: LVEF ≤ 45% achieved AUROC 90.4%, while PASP ≥ 45 millimeters of mercury reached 82.7%. The authors emphasize that AUPRC values for component diseases are highly dependent on the underlying disease prevalence and should not be directly compared across conditions or use cases. Reviewing wide age, sex, waveform, and ECG intervals, physicians identified SHD correctly in 64% of cases. It is important to note that cardiologists in this assessment had access only to de-identified ECGs and routine parameters, without any clinical context, which is not typical of standard clinical care. To estimate clinical opportunity at scale, the team silently ran EchoNext on 124,027 ECGs recorded in 2023 from 84,875 adults who had never undergone echocardiography. The model flagged nine percent of traces as high risk. Usual care, nevertheless, left 45% of these individuals without follow-up imaging, suggesting that an estimated 1,998 cases of silent SHD might have been intercepted had the alert been live, based on modelled prevalence and sensitivity scenarios provided in the paper. Among the 15,094 patients who eventually received echocardiography, EchoNext preserved accuracy (AUROC 83%; AUPRC 81%) and delivered a positive predictive value of 74%, reinforcing its reliability in a contemporary workflow. Prospective evidence came from the DISCOVERY pilot, which recruited 100 imaging-naive adults. These results illustrate the model's capacity to triage scarce echocardiography resources toward those most likely to benefit, while sparing low-risk individuals unnecessary testing. The original trial used a predecessor model (ValveNet) to stratify risk and recruit participants, and the EchoNext model was applied retrospectively to these participants for further analysis. To summarize, EchoNext demonstrates that an AI-enhanced ECG can detect SHD associated with LVEF reduction, elevated PASP, and significant VHD, with AUROC and AUPRC metrics superior to those of cardiologists. By flagging high-risk patients for timely echocardiography, the algorithm promises to shrink diagnostic delay and the billion-dollar burden of SHD while maintaining equity across sites and demographics. However, the authors caution that AI-based screening may also carry potential risks, including patient anxiety from false positives or bias in clinical adoption, and highlight the need for further study of these aspects. The public release of code and data encourages independent validation; however, large pragmatic trials must verify that AI-guided ECG screening truly improves survival, quality of life, and healthcare value. Notably, the authors have released a large de-identified dataset and a benchmark AI model (the Columbia mini-model) to support further research and enable transparent comparison of future algorithms.
