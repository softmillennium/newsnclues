                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After a first round loss at Wimbledon last month the world No. 6 has announced that she will be sitting out the US Open next month. Zheng, who won Olympic gold in the singles competition at the Paris Olympic Games, has been struggling with an elbow injury in recent months and has undergone surgery. She underwent arthroscopic surgery earlier this month, after a disappointing first round exit at Wimbledon. “Over the past months, I've been dealing with persistent pain in my right elbow during training and matches,” she explained. “Despite trying various treatments to manage it, the discomfort never fully went away.” The recovery is expected to take months so it was no major surprise that she will not be fit to compete at the US Open from August 24. Nevertheless, the absence of one of the world's best young players will be a disappointment for fans in attendance in New York. She has won five career singles titles, including that triumph at the Paris Olympics. Zheng will not get the chance to improve on that record at Flushing Meadows next month. However her withdrawal does give an opportunity to Leolia Jeanjean, the 29-year-old from France currently ranked No. Whether you're into NFL touchdowns, NBA buzzer-beaters, world-class soccer goals, or MLB home runs, our app has it all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Open Era record of eight Czech players have reached the Livesport Prague Open last 16, including top seed Linda Noskova, Katerina Siniakova and Tereza Valentova. The Livesport Prague Open has often functioned as a showcase of the remarkable Czech talent conveyor belt, with five of its 10 editions since 2015 ending in a home champion being crowned. This year, that's even more the case than ever. Eleven Czech players -- five direct entrants, two qualifiers and four wild cards -- started in the 32-strong main draw. Indeed, of the three Czech first-round losses, two came in matchups between home players -- meaning that only one Czech fell to a foreign opponent (qualifier Jesika Maleckova to Slovakian No. They include Noskova, currently at a career high of No. 23 after making the Wimbledon fourth round; 2024 Roland Garros junior champion Tereza Valentova, 18, who has won her first two WTA 125 titles in the past seven weeks and is now ranked No. 1 Lucie Havlickova, 20, on the comeback trail after being sidelined for 15 months. Dominika Salkova, 21, reached the second round of Prague for the third time; Barbora Palicova, also 21, notched her first career WTA main-draw victory; and Sara Bejlek, 19, made a victorious return from a month-long injury layoff that forced her to miss Wimbledon. Meanwhile, 29-year-old Katerina Siniakova successfully held it down for the older Czech generation. Moreover, the youngest Czech player in the draw, 17-year-old Alena Kovackova, also put together a career-best tournament by qualifying for her first WTA main draw with wins over Arina Rodionova and Lucrezia Stefanini. 9, also received a qualifying wild card, where she stretched Nina Stojanovic to three sets in the first round. The current record number of Czechs in a tour-level quarterfinal lineup is six, and the record number in a tour-level semifinal lineup is three, both set -- surprise! This week, seven Czechs could potentially make the last eight, and there is at least one home player in each quarter -- meaning there could be an all-Czech semifinal slate on Friday. There have been eight all-Czech WTA finals since the country's independence in 1993, of which the latest was Siniakova's defeat of Bouzkova at Nanchang 2023. An Open Era record of eight Czech players have reached the Livesport Prague Open last 16, including top seed Linda Noskova, Katerina Siniakova and Tereza Valentova.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Swiss star Stan Wawrinka has continued to defy the odds following his latest ATP Tour victory Wawrinka, a three-time major winner, is most certainly in the twilight of his career. However, despite his status as a 40-year-old man, Wawrinka has shown no signs of slowing down, competing in various ATP Tour and Challenger events throughout 2025. On Monday, Wawrinka secured a first round win at the Umag Open in Croatia, defeating Alvaro Guillen Meza 6-4 6-1. Meza, 18 years Wawrinka's junior, struggled to cope on his second serve, winning only 17 per cent of those points. Wawrinka, who has achieved Grand Slam final wins over Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic during his illustrious career, recorded his second ATP Tour victory of the season against Alvaro Guillen Meza. As per OptaAce, since 1990 when Stan Wawrinka is the fourth player aged over 40 years old to win multiple matches at ATP-level events after Jimmy Connors, Feliciano Lopez and Ivo Karlovic. Wawrinka only had one ATP Tour win in 2025 before defeating Meza. This came at the Bucharest Open in  April, where he beat Timofey Skatov 6-4 6-7 7-6. Many may have expected Wawrinka to slow down once he reached 40. However, he has demonstrated his innate resilience, much like Venus Williams at the Washington Open. The Swiss player could rise even further if he beats his second round opponent in Umag on Wednesday. Like Stan Wawrinka, Damir Dzumhur is also entering the twilight of his career. Incredibly, Dzumhur beat Wawrinka again in 2019, this time at the Geneva Open.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you ever wondered what happens to the thousands of tennis balls used during Wimbledon after the championships are over, you can rest assured that they're going to a good cause. While many of the balls make their way to England's field mice, Wimbledon also sells some of its used tennis balls on-site at the tournament. The eco-friendly mice initiative, which many fans don't know about, has supported British wildlife for years. However, they've faced habitat loss over the years due to industrial farming methods and changes in weather patterns making a it a concern for conservationists. The tennis balls are attached to poles with a small hole cut into them, making it a perfectly ready-made shelter for the mammals, especially for nesting females. Wimbledon may be known for fierce competition on the court, however, the fuzzy yellow tennis balls turned into mouse mansions have social media abuzz. One user wrote on X, "This is the sweetest idea! "From Centre Court to mouse resort Wimbledon's real champions might be the harvest mice," a third person said. Who would've thought tennis balls could serve as 'real estate' for mice? "My day is happier now that I learned this," someone else wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They're not considered pests themselves, and in fact are actually seen as pest control; they prey on agricultural pests, saving farmers on pesticides. They also take their place in the food chain, supporting predators like hawks and owls, which supports overall biodiversity. The mice's habitats are increasingly being infringed upon by human development. In order to provide them a safe place to live, British conservation consortium The Wildlife Trusts provides readymade nests for them—by cutting holes in tennis balls donated by Wimbledon: Wimbledon goes through some 55,000 tennis balls with each competition, so unlike Britain's human denizens, the harvest mice will suffer no housing crisis.

Leylah Fernandez's DMs are open.The 2021 US Open finalist surprised social media over the weekend with a charmingly earnest appeal to the men of Montréal, hoping to go on her very first date during the National Bank Open next week.“There've been a lot of responses,” she exclaimed after winning her first round at the Mubadala Citi DC Open on Monday. “I think the first day, there were maybe over 100 messages. I've got a lot of options.”Fresh off an emphatic D.C. victory over Maya Joint, Fernandez told me the clarion call came out of a conversation with father and coach Jorge earlier this summer. “I think the first day, there were maybe over 100 messages.

At this age, we're all either studying or going to sports competitions, so reading those messages not only makes me feel better and like I'm not the odd one out, but it's also pretty cool that we're able to have those conversations together.” “He suggested I post a video on Instagram and have a date in Montréal where you feel at home and you feel comfortable.”There was only one caveat.“Of course, he was like, ‘But, he has to meet me first!' 36 has spent the last few evenings combing through Instagram DM requests—typically a no-go zone for athletes targeted by angry bettors—and has found a few contenders along with a sense of community.“I got responses from other athletes, including ones I went to the Olympics with, and they told me, ‘I know how you feel,' or, ‘When I was 22, I hadn't gone on a date yet, either.'

The move is reminiscent of one made by fellow Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who took fan John Goehrke to a Brooklyn Nets game after a back and forth on Twitter. The 2014 Wimbledon finalist is in the midst of winding down her tennis career, planning to play her final tournament in Montréal, and was supportive of Fernandez in her quest for love (or something like it).“I personally love interacting with fans and I think they appreciate that I do that,” she told me after her doubles match against Venus Williams on Monday. I hope she has a great time, and she'd better thank me for that idea.”Fernandez, who listed Ryan Gosling among her celebrity crushes and his 2024 film The Fall Guy as her favorite rom-com, sketched out her ideal first date—envisioning the standard trip to a coffee shop and a walk around the park—and hopes to take the classic “one match at a time” approach to her dating pool debut.

We're not going to think too much ahead.“It's also about getting to know each other, what his hobbies are and what he likes. I've had some relationships like that and they've been great, but it's been hard to build a foundation and have stability—unless you want to date someone on the tour, which I highly recommend you don't do.“My DMs are always open until there's a ring!” she joked.Fernandez promised to keep fans in the loop once the date is set, but don't expect a Bachelor-style production.“I want to keep that part private and I want to keep it fair for the person with me,” she said, adding with a hopeful smile, “We'll see!” “My DMs are always open until there's a ring!” she joked.Fernandez promised to keep fans in the loop once the date is set, but don't expect a Bachelor-style production.“I want to keep that part private and I want to keep it fair for the person with me,” she said, adding with a hopeful smile, “We'll see!” Fernandez promised to keep fans in the loop once the date is set, but don't expect a Bachelor-style production.“I want to keep that part private and I want to keep it fair for the person with me,” she said, adding with a hopeful smile, “We'll see!” “I want to keep that part private and I want to keep it fair for the person with me,” she said, adding with a hopeful smile, “We'll see!”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Jessica Pegula says that she has ‘processed' her Wimbledon upset ‘pretty fast', revealing that she recognised a crucial improvement in Iga Swiatek's game during their recent grass-court clash. The American's most recent match was a first-round Wimbledon clash against former world No 29 Elisabetta Cocciaretto, being shocked 6-2, 6-3 in just 58 minutes. Pegula is now due to face off with former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the second round of the WTA 500 event in Washington. “Yeah, I mean, it's (the Wimbledon loss) disappointing, but it was almost like I got killed, like, so bad that you're kind of just like, okay, just flush that one and move on,” said Pegula. “There's not much to really say or do. It was a bad match for me, but at the same time, she played great and it was a great moment for her. “So I feel like I always try to look at things with a good perspective that sometimes it's not always your moment. But again, it's not like rewriting the wheel and having to change a bunch of things just because of one match. The good thing is I was able to be home and get two really solid weeks at home before coming on the hard-court swing. It was really nice being home and spending time with my family and getting in a good training block.” The world No 4 was particularly impressed by Swiatek's serving during their Bad Homburg meeting, something which translated well at SW19. “I thought she was serving a lot bigger [at Bad Homburg],” analysed Pegula. “I didn't really watch her much during Wimbledon. I thought our final was a really high level. “You know, she is always kind of down on herself about grass, and I was, like, Hey, you're playing really good on grass. “So it was kind of funny that she ended up winning Wimbledon. I was, like, of course I said that, and we had that moment and we played in the final, and then she wins Wimbledon, but that's just tennis for you. WTA Rankings: Lois Boisson achieves milestone with maiden title win, Alex Eala -13 The Citi DC Open undoubtedly holds a special place in Pegula's heart, being the site of her first singles title. “It was the first professional title I had ever won. I never even won a challenger singles title. “So for me, getting that monkey off my back, being able to do it at a tour level for the first time was great, and to think that was such a big mountain for me to climb at the time and now I'm sitting here and I have won, I don't know, eight or nine or whatever it is, and doubles titles, as well, it's kind of funny how things can seem far away, but once you do them it becomes easier, it's less of a mountain to get over. The American will be hoping to build her hard-court form ahead of the US Open, with her highlights at the Grand Slam being a quarter-final appearance in 2022 and a final showing in 2024. Iga Swiatek has been branded "the best player this century." Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner may want the story around their failed drug tests to be forgotten, but it has been revived after their Wimbledon wins. The Brit will have a prime opportunity to avenge her loss from two months ago.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An updated entry list has been unveiled, with Tsitsipas and Badosa one of two pairs to have quietly pulled out. British No.1 Jack Draper and Qinwen Zheng are also no longer on the list, with both players suffering from recent injuries. But the popular duo, often nicknamed 'Tsitsidosa', are the main ones to stand out after deciding to no longer feature. Their withdrawal will only increase rumours of the couple splitting up, following reports during Wimbledon. However, only a day after both of them were beaten in the opening round at Wimbledon, reports of a break-up swirled. HOLA.com said that sources have confirmed their split, with one saying: "The break-up just happened. The women's World No.10 and men's World No.29 will now not be taking part in the revamped US Open doubles event. Badosa is also said to be carrying an ongoing injury issue, which could potentially be a reason for their withdrawal. There has been no official confirmation of why they pulled out, but both players remain on the singles entry list. Tsitsipas has a poor record at major tournaments this year heading into the US Open, only winning once in 2025. The Greek star was openly criticised by his coach at SW19 and he will want a major improvement at Flushing Meadows. The US Open Mixed Doubles Championship will be staged across two days in New York City, beginning on August 19. Novak Djokovic is teaming up with Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek joins Casper Ruud and Taylor Fritz plays with Elena Rybakina. Nick Kyrgios is planning to return to action too, pairing up with Naomi Osaka for the event in New York. After two teams pulled out, there have also been some new names added to the entry list. Amanda Anisimova and Holger Rune will pair up, while couple Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur will play together too.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This year has seen the US Open completely overhaul the mixed doubles event, giving priority to singles players instead of doubles specialists. Singles players getting priority is not the only change that they have made, with the US Open being heavily criticised for what they have done. However, one of those teams has now been removed from the entry list after withdrawing. After undergoing surgery, Olympic champion Zheng has officially withdrawn from the US Open, consequently calling an end to any hopes of her playing alongside Draper in New York. Both members of that team are currently struggling due to injury, with Draper also withdrawing from two upcoming tournaments due to an arm problem. Although Badosa has recently struggled with injury issues, it appears that there may be another reason for this withdrawal. Tsitsipas and Badosa were in a romantic relationship for nearly two years, but it has recently been reported that they have now parted ways and this seems to be the more likely reason for them pulling out of the US Open. The remaining 8 teams will be determined via wild card and announced at a later date. There are now 25 teams in the lineup for the US Open mixed doubles event next month, but only 16 of them will actually be able to play. Currently the top ranked doubles team is Sinner and Navarro, with a combined ranking of just 12. Although the ATP world number one should safely be into the US Open mixed doubles draw, Aryna Sabalenka currently sits in ninth place alongside her currently injured partner Grigor Dimitrov. There is still a month to go until the US Open mixed doubles event takes place, with rankings still expected to change in that time. The US Open mixed doubles event will take place on August 19-20.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Holger Rune has reportedly hired Marco Panichi, the fitness trainer who left Jannik Sinner's team days before Wimbledon started. Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio, who previously worked with Novak Djokovic, joined the world No. But Sinner confirmed that he'd parted ways with both men before turning up to SW19. Sinner still went on to lift his fourth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, overcoming an elbow injury without the help of his own personal fitness coach. And Panichi has also moved on, as he is set to start working with world No. According to Danish outlet BT, Rune's mum and manager, Aneke, confirmed that Panichi will join the camp at next month's Cincinnati Open. “We will welcome Marco Panichi to the team. He brings enormous experience - not just in the physical aspect, but everything related to building a Grand Slam winner. That takes the idea up another notch,” Aneke said. “We know Marco very well and have always had a really good relationship with him. “The way he works, and the way he worked with Novak Djokovic, is very much the way we see a fitness coach in a team where he will also be active in training.” Rune has worked with plenty of high-profile coaches in his time, including Boris Becker and Patrick Mouratoglou. But the 22-year-old went back to basics and has spent this season with Lars Christensen. The five-time title winner also enjoyed a three-day training block with Andre Agassi ahead of this week's ATP 500 event in Washington. Rune reached out to the retired tennis icon months ago and sees Agassi as more of a mentor. After their brief stint on the practice courts, Rune told the ATP: “It was a really short period but definitely he gave me an insight of where he sees me in the future, where he sees me now and obviously there's a lot of things to improve. It was really cool to spend some days with him.” Sinner has yet to announce who his replacement fitness trainer and physiotherapist will be after parting ways with Panichi and Badio. “As I said, there's not one specific thing. As I said, we made some great work. For me, the final in Roland Garros was an amazing achievement. There is nothing incredible, no, because sometimes a player feels something different, and that's my case.” This may include adverts from us and 3rd parties based on our understanding.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Here are my best bets for the second round of action at ATP Washington. Let me know whether you agree in the comment section. Diallo took that match in straight sets, barely breaking a sweat, as he lost only four total games that day. The match was only, and I bring that up because Marozsan lost. Marozsan is 56-32 on hardcourt, which isn't too bad when you compare it to Diallo's 80-44 overall record on hardcourt. While you can find outlets like Betfair that have Marozsan at 1.19, he remains the underdog, as Diallo is priced at 1.11 on the same site. Most other sites have him at least a full point behind, if not more. This makes sense because Diallo already has one tournament victory this year, and a very quick victory over Marozsan on his opponent's preferred surface. He's also coming off taking Taylor Fritz to the limit at Wimbledon, so momentum is really riding with Diallo. That being said, Diallo winning is a value bet for sure. This will be the first match between Matteo Arnaldi and Lorenzo Sonego. There are several superficial comparisons between the two men, as well. Hell, you can even get both men for 1.90 on 1xBet, but that's beside the point. Neither Arnaldi nor Sonego has ever played at Washington before. Sonego has thrived at two of three majors thus far in 2025, making one quarterfinal and one round of 16. Coming off a quality showing at Wimbledon, Sonego has built himself confidence after a poor showing at Roland-Garros, which had to hurt his pride as a primarily clay player. Many sites see this as a push, and I get why they think that. That being said, Sonego winning is a value bet for sure. Cameron Norrie hasn't had much luck against Lorenzo Musetti. While the two have only met on clay, Musetti took both matches in three sets, and both of them were in 2023. Both men are playing fantastic tennis right now, but Musetti is having a slightly better go of it right now. Setting Wimbledon aside, Musetti had been in the semifinals of the four previous tournaments, including one finals loss at Monte Carlo. Had it not been for Carlos Alcaraz, Musetti may have won three of those tournaments. Norrie last made a semifinal in May, and that was at Geneva. Outside of that, Norrie hasn't advanced beyond the quarterfinals this year. Sure, most of Musetti's success has come on clay, but it's not like he's dogwater on a hardcourt. I will say that Norrie is by far the more accomplished player on the hardcourt, as he's 235-118 overall. But before you get any bright ideas about betting on him because of that, he's 7-8 this year, 14-12 in the last two years, and 28-24 in the last three years. That being said, Musetti winning is a value bet for sure. Has no form right now, Norrie has a decent chance of winning especially with a win today over the Brit Billy Harris and it looks like Italian is just trying to find some matches and form coming of the loss at Wimbledon and the lack of match wins since the French open where he retired vs Alcaraz,    There is no way I could bet Musetti. He is exactly the kind of guy I don't bet on right now(based on health and is he dealing with an injury Musetti? , I bet tons of tennis it's very difficult and when trying to interpret form and health can be very difficult      I'm also ignoring they 2-0 record on clay that Musetti has vs Norrie       Unfortunately I bet Norrie recently and he got his ass kicked by Billy Harris (Eastborne). Probably should have bet him back vs Harris today. Share your thoughts and join the discussion Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rafael Nadal won the 2020 French Open without dropping a set, the fourth time in his legendary career that he has accomplished this feat of sporting dominance. His toughest test that year — in addition to the vacant stands due to COVID-19 — was a quarterfinal matchup against future Wimbledon champion Jannick Sinner. Their quarterfinal matchup got off to a late start. Even though the Spaniard made light work of a then-teenage Sinner in straight sets (7-6, 6-4, 6-1), the match ran until 1:30 AM. Nadal labeled playing at that time of night as "dangerous." Having two days in the middle is not a big deal. Of course, it is not ideal to finish a match at 1:30 in the morning. “I know football players play under these conditions, but is a little bit different. I think is a little bit dangerous for the body to play with these very heavy conditions. Nadal boasts a perfect 3-0 head-to-head record against Sinner, although the pair would face off at distinctively different arcs in their careers. “Sinner is a very, very young talent with a lot of power, great shots,” he said. “The conditions here were a little bit difficult because he was hitting every ball very hard, for me it was difficult. For me, it was difficult to pull him out of the position." 11 David Goffin in the first round before upsetting No. 6 Alexander Zverev in the Round of 16 to reach his first major quarterfinal in just his second-ever main draw at a grand slam. After topping Sinner, Nadal ousted Diego Schwarzmann in the semifinals and longtime rival Novak Djokovic in the finals to capture a fourth-straight French Open title.
