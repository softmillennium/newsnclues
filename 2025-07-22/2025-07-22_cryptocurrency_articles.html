                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins Both projects have emerged as symbols of the community-driven altcoin frenzy, leveraging humor and simplicity to attract investors. SPX6900, a parody token rooted in meme culture, has defied conventional logic by becoming a multi-millionaire generator, while TOKEN6900's strategy of minimalism—rejecting utility in favor of pure meme value—has resonated with a new wave of crypto enthusiasts. Its success lies in its refusal to adopt traditional financial frameworks, instead embracing a lighthearted approach that mirrors the irreverent spirit of meme culture. Similarly, TOKEN6900 has carved a niche by emphasizing transparency and simplicity. By fixing its supply at a marginally higher total than SPX6900 and forgoing additional utility, it has positioned itself as a “Non-Corrupt Token” (NCT) that rejects artificial inflation and gimmicks. The project's $5 million hard cap, despite its potential to raise more, further underscores its commitment to limiting speculation and preserving community trust. TOKEN6900's ICO success demonstrates how niche communities can drive liquidity and adoption without reliance on traditional financial metrics. Its 61% staking annual percentage yield (APY) and focus on “vibes over utility” have attracted a loyal following, mirroring the trajectories of earlier meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The projects' shared philosophy—prioritizing authenticity over innovation—has resonated in a market increasingly skeptical of overly complex tokenomics. While the surge in SPX6900 and TOKEN6900 reflects broader trends in the crypto market, it also highlights risks inherent to speculative assets. The lack of fundamental value or utility in these tokens makes their performance highly dependent on sentiment and community momentum. However, their ability to attract retail investors and generate rapid returns suggests that meme-based projects will continue to play a significant role in the ecosystem.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency is getting a lot of attention for different reasons. As an investment, it has the potential for higher returns than traditional vehicles. It also lets consumers conduct transactions without a middleman. But before you open an account with a crypto exchange and start investing, you should understand how the crypto market works. It consists of four phases: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. This article highlights the distinct characteristics of each cycle so you can recognize when to get in and out of the market. Large investors, such as institutional and experienced investors, start to buy up cryptocurrencies at relatively low prices in anticipation of price hikes in the future. There are a few things to note during this period: Savvy investors can recognize signals of the accumulation phase on charts through sideways price movements and horizontal trades, which can last from weeks to months. This period is best for long-term investors who can afford to lock in their money. It isn't suitable for short-term traders, though. This signals the beginning of a bull market, which is why it's also referred to as the bull market phase. During the markup phase, prices begin to break out and rise steadily. With more buyers and sellers participating, trading volume begins to increase. Traders often use these as buying opportunities, especially if there is a fear of missing out, also known as FOMO. If you're a momentum trader or a long-term trader who missed out during the accumulation phase, you still have a chance to jump in during the markup phase. Interested in trading or storing your crypto? Check out Investopedia's list of best cryptocurrency software wallets. At this point, there is mixed sentiment in the market. This phase is also characterized by optimism from other investors as they begin entering the market, as they are confident the bull run isn't over. Although trading volume may be higher, price increases tend to slow down during this period. Trading volumes decline as interest starts to wane even more. This can create a good opportunity for short sellers who can profit from the downturn in the market. It's important to understand how the market cycle works before you invest in and profit from cryptocurrencies.</p>

The whale's initial investment occurred 12 days prior, when they deployed 25 million USDT to acquire 9,188 ETH at an average entry price of $2,721.Ethereum Whale Dumps $30M ETH Position After 38% Gains Capitalizing on Ethereum's impressive rally since early July, , translating to $9.87 million in realized gains during this timeframe. Pullbacks are for buying on GM,First of all, I will start off with: This is NOT a bearish post on Ethereum. The recent surge in Ethereum's price can be attributed to sustained whale accumulation activities throughout June. A key moment occurred on June 15, when Ethereum whales collectively accumulated 818,410 ETH, approximately $2.5 billion worth, in a single trading session, representing the most concentrated buying spree since 2018. This accumulation frenzy aligned with growing institutional adoption, particularly following the successful launch of spot Ether ETFs that recorded an impressive 19-day consecutive inflow streak. In July, Sharplink Gaming, a Minneapolis-based performance marketing firm, dramatically expanded its Ethereum position by acquiring 353,000 ETH, worth over $1.2 billion through its treasury strategy, establishing itself as the world's largest corporate Ethereum holder and surpassing the Ethereum Foundation's holdings.

Since that breakout, Ethereum has delivered over 30% gains, reaching a peak of $3,859.36 on Monday, generating substantial returns for strategic whale positions. However, he emphasizes that maintaining support above the $2,800-$3,000 zone would preserve Ethereum's bullish structure and keep the pathway open for new all-time highs above $4,800.

This zone has demonstrated resilience in previous tests and could serve as a foundation for renewed upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently hovers near 80, indicating extremely overbought conditions and suggesting a brief correction or sideways consolidation phase before any potential continuation of the uptrend.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) said Monday it has accumulated roughly $2 billion in bitcoin and related assets, as Trump's highly lucrative pivot to cryptocurrency continues to grow his net worth while in office. In a press release, the company said that the bitcoin holdings now account for about two-thirds of Trump Media's total liquid assets. READ: SEC drops case against crypto firm with ties to Trump (March 20, 2025) Since then, Trump Media has effectively redefined itself as a cryptocurrency and financial services company. “We're rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in Monday's release. “These assets help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,” Nunes said. Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) crypto holdings overview Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Truth Social, has made significant moves into the cryptocurrency space, holding approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and related digital assets. Alongside these holdings, DJT has invested around $300 million in Bitcoin options with plans to convert these options into spot Bitcoin depending on market conditions. The company has also filed to launch three cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in partnership with Crypto.com, aiming to broaden its crypto footprint and offer new investment vehicles. READ: Crypto valuation hits new high of $4 trillion (July 18, 2025) Beyond Bitcoin, DJT has expanded its crypto portfolio by introducing a meme coin called $TRUMP on the Solana blockchain. This move into meme coins has sparked concern among ethics experts due to potential conflicts of interest, as it blurs lines between political influence and business ventures. DJT also launched Truth.Fi, a fintech platform that offers investment products. This aggressive focus on digital assets and investment products demonstrates DJT's ambition to diversify its financial portfolio while capitalizing on the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) plan to streamline securities tokenization may sound promising, but it is unlikely to benefit investors unless it delivers genuine innovation and efficiency, according to market maker Citadel Securities. “Tokenized securities must achieve success by delivering real innovation and efficiency to market participants, rather than through self-serving regulatory arbitrage,” Citadel wrote in a statement to the SEC's Crypto Task Force, as reported by Bloomberg. Tokenization — the process of representing real-world assets on a blockchain with digital tokens — is often touted for its potential to reduce costs and boost efficiency by minimizing the role of intermediaries, shortening settlement times and enabling fractional ownership of financial assets. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has advocated for tokenization, comparing its potential impact to the evolution of audio formats. He has suggested the introduction of an “innovation exemption” to encourage its development. Citadel cautioned that asset tokenization could “siphon liquidity” from traditional stock markets and create “new liquidity pools that are inaccessible” to key institutional investors such as pensions, banks and endowments. On Tuesday, JPMorgan made headlines amid reports that it is exploring Bitcoin-backed loans, which would allow clients to borrow against their crypto holdings. This move marks a significant shift from JPMorgan's historically cautious stance on crypto. However, Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds warned that traditional banks entering the market — even under more crypto-friendly regulations — will face steep challenges as non-native players. The biggest hurdles, he noted, include “secure custody, collateral volatility, and [orderly] liquidation frameworks.” “Bitcoin-backed lending isn't just about holding assets; it's about what happens when markets move fast and ensuring clients know exactly how their Bitcoin is being managed at all times,” said Reeds. Additional challenges, such as safe self-custody, are also top of mind for institutions. In June, Circuit CEO Harry Donnelly said he developed a crypto recovery engine to address this very issue.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CryptoPunks Lead as NFT Trading Volume Rebounds on Solana and Ethereum CryptoPunks and other established NFT projects are seeing renewed interest as the price of leading altcoins rise, with recent activity concentrated on Ethereum and Solana. The NFT market has cooled drastically in recent years, but Sunday marked its busiest day since February, with $26 million worth of tokenized JPEGs changing hands across Ethereum's ecosystem, according to a Dune dashboard created by Hildebert Moulié, a data scientist at venture firm Dragonfly. On Monday, that was followed up with $24.9 million in trading volume. Over half of Sunday's trading volume could be attributed to CryptoPunks.app, the official marketplace dedicated to the iconic collection of 10,000 pixelated profile pictures, which have been recognized by museums, auction houses, and luxury brands. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.) Other collections minted on Ethereum have seen floor prices swell over the past week, including a 38% jump to $56,000 for Pudgy Penguins NFTs, a 26% increase to $6,300 for Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs, and a 64% surge for Fidenza NFTs from generative artist Tyler Hobbs. Although some spectators on X hope that two days of elevated trading volume could turn into a resurgence for NFTs, which ran red-hot during the pandemic-era crypto boom, there was “some increased activity from December to February, but it wasn't sustained,” Moulié told Decrypt. On Monday, NFT marketplace Blur also saw a 120% jump in trading volume from the previous day to $12.8 million. In total, $9.3 million worth of Solana-based NFTs sales have taken place on secondary markets over the past seven days, a 59% increase, according to CryptoSlam. Ethereum-based NFTs have meanwhile seen $105 million in sales, a 50% increase over the same period of time. Although trading volume has decreased over the past week, Bitcoin-based collectibles have seen floor prices tick up as well. The NFT market may be glittering as Ethereum and Solana rise, but notably, no NFT collection referenced in this article is close to setting an all-time high floor price.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Trump ran and won on a bold promise: to make America the global capital of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. President Trump signed into law Senator Bill Hagerty's Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act—a landmark bill that cements a federal framework for dollar-backed digital assets. These payment stablecoins, pegged to secure assets, now have clear rules that promote transparency, protect consumers, and boost demand for U.S. Treasuries—all while reinforcing the dollar's position as the world's most foundational transactional currency. The GENIUS Act is a major win for American leadership in digital finance. But, on its own, it's not enough. To secure the full promise of stablecoins—and of American crypto innovation more broadly—the Senate must also pass Chairman French Hill's Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which just passed the House. Under the Biden administration, that ambiguity was weaponized—resulting in regulatory overreach, stifled innovation, and an exodus of talent and capital overseas. President Trump is reversing course, embracing a vision of American-led digital innovation—through executive action, a call for bitcoin reserves, and by working with the most pro-crypto Congress in U.S. history. But without legislative clarity, that progress is at risk. FTX—the most spectacular crypto fraud in history—happened outside the U.S. precisely because early regulatory uncertainty pushed innovators offshore. It will not only protect consumers and investors—it will also position the U.S. as a global leader, using financial innovation as a diplomatic asset. There's another critical frontier the Senate must address: protecting Americans from surveillance-driven central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). While other nations embrace centralized digital currencies as tools of control—none more chillingly than the Chinese Communist Party—we must draw a firm line in defense of American freedom. It's a necessary safeguard, and we're working to ensure its passage. We cannot unleash a new era of innovation while leaving the door open for future administrations to turn that same technology against our own citizens. Whether you're from Minnesota or Alaska, whether you're 18 or 80—when done right, this technology empowers individuals, strengthens financial sovereignty, and unlocks opportunity for all. And now, we must finish the job. Note: The views expressed in this column are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of CoinDesk, Inc. or its owners and affiliates.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin dominates the mainstream narrative, but smart money quickly shifts into altcoins. Early investors are rapidly securing their positions before the market surge. The surge reveals a clear trend, as altcoins now account for 71% of Binance Futures volume, while Bitcoin holds at just 25%. Traders are shifting their focus to altcoins for the next significant move. After Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091.61 on July 14, 2025, altcoin activity has surged significantly across the market. The CMC Altcoin Season Index is at 48, so there's still time for investors who haven't jumped on the trend yet. Here are three top picks, based on growing investor interest and strong fundamentals. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to enable fast and incredibly inexpensive transactions. When the full version launches, it is expected to support everything from dApps to meme coins and foster a utility ecosystem around Bitcoin. It can handle program deployment via Solana CLI, contract calls, transaction flows through the web console, and account state management. The performance remains stable, low latency, and contracts are already being ported over. $HYPER tokens, which fuel the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, are now available for purchase on the official website at fixed prices, with over $4 million raised so far. Early movers can secure annual percentage yields (APYs) over 200% through dynamic staking, right from the presale phase. It is designed to decline as more users join the pool, encouraging early participation. Snorter Token ($SNORT) is another popular altcoin sensation of this week. Sub-second swaps, real-time copy trades, and token sniping—all without leaving the messaging app. Snorter takes security seriously, boasting an 85% success rate in beta rugpull and honeypot detection. Blacklist scanners and mint trap alerts provide extra layers of protection. If the project delivers on its white paper vision, it could offer more depth and access than most existing DeFi platforms. But early investors looking for an upside don't have time till then. The $SNORT presale is fast selling out with close to $2M raised, and staking yields are juicy at 183%. Now trading for $199, Solana (SOL) has recorded a 25% jump in the last seven days alone and outperformed Bitcoin with flair. Technical indicators show $SOL bulls are in control, flashing strong buy signals across the board. Does that mean Solana is ready to reclaim its ATH of $294.33? But in the current climate, it's not a long shot. And it won't be just Solana that benefits from its growing momentum. Platforms that make use of Solana tech are also at an advantage. A good example is BONK, which has climbed over 20% on the weekly chart. While BONK has a heavy market cap of $3B, these under-the-radar tokens will be available for fixed, discounted rates before the presales sell out. Altcoin seasons can be exciting, but only for those who get in early. It's often a mix of regret and FOMO for investors who stay on the sidelines. All three altcoins discussed above – $HYPER, $SNORT, and $SOL –– are ripe for a rally. Make sure you have done your research before jumping in. As a crypto writer, Bogdan's responsibilities are split between researching and writing articles and entertaining the team with his humor bordering on the politically incorrect, an aspiring Bill Burr, if you will. Thanks to his 12+ years of writing experience in just as many fields, including tech, cybersecurity, modelling, fitness, crypto, and other topics-that-shall-not-be-named, he's become a genuine asset to the team. While his position as a senior writer at PrivacyAffairs thought him valuable lessons about the power of self-management, his entire writing career was and is an exercise in self-improvement. Now, he's ready to sink his teeth into crypto and teach people how to take control of their own money on the blockchain. With fiat as an eternally devaluing currency, Bitcoin and altcoins seem like the best-fitting alternative for Bogdan.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bank of England (BoE) is reassessing its plans for a digital pound, as officials question whether launching a new form of money is worth the effort, especially with the private sector rapidly advancing payment technologies. The BoE isn't abandoning its CBDC plans entirely. The bank aims to remain prepared to launch a digital pound if necessary, but may scale back the effort if private firms continue to advance electronic payment technologies that offer comparable benefits. At a Parliamentary hearing on Tuesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey expressed doubt over the necessity of a digital pound. He indicated that if ongoing collaboration with commercial banks proves successful, it would be difficult to justify introducing a new form of money. “I think that's a sensible place to do it,” Bailey told the Treasury Committee. This marks a shift from previous years, when Bank of England and Treasury officials considered a digital pound “likely” to be needed. The change comes amid waning global momentum for state-backed digital currencies. During “Crypto Week,” the House passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, a bill aimed at halting progress on an American CBDC. South Korea's central bank has also halted its digital currency pilot program. In contrast, the European Central Bank continues to pursue a digital euro. Recent BoE research indicates diminished benefits from launching a CBDC. Senior officials, including Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden and Treasury's director general for financial services Gwyneth Nurse, have reduced their involvement in the CBDC Engagement Forum, sending lower-ranking staff instead. The project has faced various challenges, including privacy concerns and fears about potential destabilizing effects if investors rush to state-backed digital currencies during crises.</p>

The move comes as other major U.S. banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, are developing stablecoins amid a broader push for more crypto-friendly regulation in Washington. CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime bitcoin skeptic, recently said that the bank will be involved in stablecoins. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment outside regular business hours. In May, Dimon told investors that he is "not a fan" of the bitcoin universe citing concerns, including leverage, misuse, and money laundering issues in the system, ruling out getting into custody, storing crypto assets for clients, or expanding significantly even if regulations ease.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) on blockchain empowers individuals to own their digital identities, streamlining KYC/AML processes and enhancing privacy. This approach promises a more secure and user-centric future for financial identity management. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) on blockchain empowers individuals to own their digital identities, streamlining KYC/AML processes and enhancing privacy. This approach promises a more secure and user-centric future for financial identity management. Yet, the current identity verification landscape is often fragmented, costly, and privacy-invasive, requiring individuals to repeatedly share sensitive personal data across multiple institutions. This paradigm shift holds the profound potential to transform how financial services approach identity, fostering enhanced privacy, robust security, and unparalleled efficiency in an industry grappling with data proliferation and escalating cyber threats. Traditional identity management in finance typically relies on centralized databases. If you open another account with a different institution, the process largely repeats. SSI offers compelling benefits that address critical pain points in the financial sector: Despite its immense promise, SSI faces hurdles before widespread mainstream adoption in finance: For instance, initiatives exploring digital identity wallets in the UK and EU are paving the way for SSI's integration into broader digital ecosystems, including finance. Financial institutions that embrace SSI will not only enhance their cybersecurity posture and streamline compliance but also fundamentally differentiate themselves by offering a truly user-centric identity experience. This shift moves beyond mere data protection to genuine data empowerment, fostering deeper trust and unlocking new avenues for secure, seamless digital interactions. The future of financial services identity will be one where individuals are the custodians of their own verified claims, presenting precisely what's needed, when it's needed, with cryptographic assurance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It's not just bitcoin (BTC-USD) that corporate treasuries are buying. A handful of firms are scooping up ethereum — or its native token, ether (ETH-USD) — as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets. So far, the companies taking this approach are mainly smaller names in the crypto world, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee. One larger player — Coinbase Global (COIN), the parent company of trading network Coinbase — has more than $440 million in holdings, according to crypto and investment tracker CoinGecko. When Coinbase announced in a 2021 blog post that it would become the first publicly traded company to hold ethereum and other assets, in addition to bitcoin, it stated, "We believe that in the future, more and more companies will hold crypto assets on their balance sheet." Ethereum has surged 60% over the past month to hover near $3,800, its highest level since January. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has yet to reclaim its 2021 high north of $4,600. It currently leads as the dominant infrastructure that allows businesses and consumers to transact with each other directly without banks, with a market share of more than 51%. "Ethereum lets anyone — whether it's a crypto project, a factory, an artist, an influencer — create their own token and thus their own community and incentivize communities with an economy basically," Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto marketplace NoOnes, told Yahoo Finance. "You could argue it has more utility than bitcoin," he said. That utility is why firms like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming have increasingly been raising capital to buy ETH, similar to how Strategy (MSTR) and a slew of other companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets in recent months.

Ethereum prices tumbled in April when President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement roiled markets. The rewards have not been as high as those that bitcoin has offered either: The return on ethereum year to date is 14%, versus bitcoin's 26%. Crypto miner BitMine Immersion Technologies recently announced it holds more than $1 billion in ethereum, or roughly 300,000 tokens. He noted that the company was "committed to Ethereum's continued growth." BitMine shares surged 25% in one session last week after an SEC filing revealed that billionaire Peter Thiel purchased 9.1% of the firm's common stock through his investment funds. Shares of each are up nearly 200% over the past month. Earlier this month, computing firm Bit Digital (BTBT) announced that it had shifted its entire treasury from bitcoin to ethereum. "We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system," Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, said in a press release. Ethereum's surge coincides with the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation signed by President Trump last Friday, moving through Congress. Optimism over stablecoin's adoption has sent shares of issuer Circle (CRCL) up more than 600% since its IPO on June 5. "Any company that uses stablecoin tech pays transaction fees to the Ethereum network." When asked directly whether Strategy would add ETH to its holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor said in an interview with The Street, "MicroStrategy wouldn't because MicroStrategy is 150% Bitcoin. Indeed, ethereum is by no means replacing bitcoin as the investment of choice for companies, Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. "These companies are just capitalizing on the real world asset [tokenization] trends." Ines Ferre is a Senior Business Reporter for Yahoo Finance.
