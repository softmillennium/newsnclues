                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that. They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat. They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes. In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer. All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday. “Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later. “We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added. In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers. At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us." (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players. It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright. But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen." And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different. Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup. We didn't show up in this window here.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>U.S. Men's National Team legend Alexi Lalas has given his two cents on a newly published clip showing head coach Mauricio Pochettino in tears speaking to his players after their 2-1 CONCACAF Gold Cup final loss to Mexico. After the USMNT's loss in Houston, a clearly emotional Pochettino told his players he felt they “deserved more,” adding, “In the way that you worked, the staff, everyone, I think today we deserved more, to lift the trophy, because I think the performance was there, I think you fought with too many adversities and too many factors against you. And I want you to never give up. I think we still have time to be better. For me, I feel so proud of you, but don't change. Pochettino's emotional response to the loss seemingly left Lalas divided, sympathising with and appreciating his clear passion, whilst also admitting part of him found his response “strange.” And I'll be honest with you, it was, for me at least, a little strange, a little jarring, not crying, or a coach or a player crying is necessarily that,” Lalas said on his State of the Union podcast. He also noted that he disagreed with Pochettino's belief that the team “deserved more” fron a final in which the former defender believes the USMNT was “thoroughly beaten.” “And then there's the part of me that is a romantic and says, ‘I love the fact that my national team coach is brought to tears because the pain that he feels of failure and not getting it across the line,' in a Gold Cup that everyone else seemed to think, well not everybody, but a lot of people seemed to think was inconsequential anyway. “And to some, who question how much he actually cares…how much Mauricio Pochettino actually cares about this team and more importantly about the job that he has to do relative to next summer.” While Pochettino's tears may have left Lalas divided, the 55-year-old said that at the end of the day, he would prefer to “have someone who is emotional, I would rather have somebody that is passionate, and in that moment isn't afraid to show it.” Now on a break from national team duty, Pochettino's side will reconvene in September when they host South Korea and Japan, before Ecuador and Australia travel Stateside a month later.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In the wake of a financially successful Club World Cup, Real Madrid and several other elite clubs across Europe and South America are pushing for a radical change. These soccer giants have made an unusual request: they want FIFA's new Club World Cup to be held every two years. With 32 teams participating, the competition saw fierce action and record-breaking earnings. FIFA distributed an astonishing $1 billion among participating clubs. These figures are unprecedented in the world of club competitions and have sparked interest from several stakeholders to make the tournament a more regular affair. According to sources cited by ESPN, the governing body is “pleased with the outcome of the new format, but currently considers it impossible to hold another Club World Cup in two years.” FIFA is instead planning for the next edition in 2029, with Qatar emerging as a frontrunner to host. “FIFA considers it logistically difficult and financially unsustainable to organize such a massive event every two years,” sources told ESPN. The primary obstacles are not just financial, but also structural. FIFA believes that organizing a biennial Club World Cup would clash with existing commitments, particularly with UEFA's competitions, such as the Champions League and the European Championship. “FIFA believes that holding the tournament every two years would create a conflict with UEFA, which is not in its interest,” the report adds. In addition, the global soccer calendar is already bursting at the seams, with national leagues, continental tournaments, and international fixtures jostling for space.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Under normal circumstances, these events would draw millions of visitors, generate billions of dollars in tourism and showcase America on the world stage. But unless the U.S. changes course, we are likely to squander the opportunity, damaging both our economy and our global reputation. Over 1 million fans traveled to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. The U.S. should be preparing for similar crowds, but it is instead throwing up barriers. On his first day back in office, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to apply “maximum” vetting to all visa applicants. The State Department has imposed invasive social media vetting on certain visa applicants. Consular officers are vetting applicants for “any indications of hostility towards the citizens, culture, government, institutions or founding principles of the United States.” Applicants who refuse to make their online activity visible may be viewed as trying to hide something, which could result in a denial. Leaked plans suggest the administration may soon target an additional 36 countries. And earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order requiring noncitizens to pay more to visit our national parks than U.S. citizens. In May, the World Travel and Tourism Council projected that international travel spending in the U.S. will plunge by 22 percent this year — a $12.5 billion loss. Visa applicants from all over the world now face expanded surveillance and ballooning backlogs. For example, the average wait time for a tourist visa at the American embassy in Bogota, Colombia is now 15 months. Even under former President Joe Biden, more than 66,000 visa applicants were stuck in “administrative processing.” That number has almost certainly grown during Trump's second term. Even travelers from closely allied countries now face uncertainty, long wait times and unexplained delays. The message is being received overseas: Visit America at your own risk. Meanwhile, the 11 U.S. cities hosting World Cup games are preparing for a wave of foreign visitors and media. But they also house large immigrant communities facing increased enforcement and surveillance. The administration has not clarified whether there will be any safeguards for undocumented or mixed-status fans, workers or residents near these events. On the contrary, Trump has ordered immigration agents to intensify arrests and deportations in Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles and New York — both key sites for World Cup matches. Immigrants are staying home, afraid that they could be picked up on their way to or from work. But if fear and red tape define the visitor experience, we would send another message entirely: America isn't worth the trouble. That wouldn't just be a lost opportunity but an unforced economic and diplomatic error. Stephen Yale-Loehr is a retired immigration law professor at Cornell University.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Even though Chelsea's form was up and down in the 2024/25 season, it turned out to be a memorable one. On top of that, they also won both the Conference League and the Club World Cup to collect two pieces of silverware. It turned out to be a very successful debut year for Enzo Maresca, 45, as the head coach at Stamford Bridge. Enzo Maresca in 1 season at Chelsea:– Conference League 🏆– Club World Cup 🏆Mikel Arteta in 6 seasons at Arsenal:– FA Cup 🏆– Community Shield 🏆🏆 pic.twitter.com/seSYJ3x67Y Maresca's main target at Chelsea next season is to secure Champions League qualification again. We would expect it to be hard to silence the expectation and excitement around the talented young squad of players, though. It's turned out that it could be huge for new signings, too, because players overseas are more attracted to the project in West London. RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons really wants to join Chelsea, where the 22-year-old attacker would get to play for the club side who call themselves world champions. In fairness, the Blues squad is finally coming together as it gels into something with major potential. It may need some tweaks to get competing against the very best teams on a consistent basis next term.</p>

The Blues have made some good progress on sales in the last week – Noni Madueke and Djordje Petrovic have both left permanently, while a trickle of loans out is also beginning, with Caleb Wiley the latest to go. Trevoh Chalobah has proved his quality time and again, and we really thought that a lack of rumours about a departure this summer meant that he had finally convinced those in charge he was good enough to keep around. Starting the Club World Cup final seemed like evidence he had sold Enzo Maresca on his quality. This piece claims that despite the fact that Chalobah has “established himself as a first team regular since returning from loan at Crystal Palace in January”, the club are “open to offers.” Somehow Wesley Fofana is “considered to be ahead of him in the pecking order”, despite his chronic injury issues. We wouldn't be surprised if these continued slaps in the face convince Chalobah he should move on anyway. As the article says “Chalobah may also decide his future is better served elsewhere.” With Mamadou Sarr having rejoined Strasbourg on loan, selling Chalobah while Fofana is still so unreliable surely couldn't happen without another defender coming in. Levi Colwill is liked but Benoit Badiashile has failed to work his way into the team ahead of Chalobah.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea star Marc Cucurella has admitted he was 'scared s***less' by Donald Trump when the US president gatecrashed their Club World Cup lift. Trump became an unexpected participant in Chelsea's celebrations after they beat PSG 3-0 as he lingered on the stage while Reece James held the trophy aloft. Cucurella told Spanish journalist Gerard Romero: 'We had been told that, as a rule, Donald Trump would come to present us with the trophy and that we couldn't lift it until he left. 'And of course, we were all there waiting for him to leave, but the guy didn't want to leave, and on top of that, we looked at him and he said, "Get him up, I'll stay here, and so on." 'And I wondered who would say anything to him, you know... Marc Cucurella say she was 'scared s***less' when Donald Trump gatecrashed Chelsea The US President had arrived to a chorus of cheers at MetLife Stadium and watched on as Chelsea secured a surprise 3-0 win against PSG, with Palmer scoring a brace while Joao Pedro was also on target. Roughly 35 minutes before kickoff, Trump and wife Melania arrived at the nearby Teterboro Airport on the presidential Marine One helicopter from his local golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The 79-year-old was given VIP treatment as he soaked up the action alongside First Lady Melania, who cut a chic figure in a white dress and black blazer, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino. But Trump's crowning moment came after the final whistle when he took centre stage as the trophy was given to Chelsea. Speaking afterwards, the England star was honest but slightly more measured than his facial contortions had suggested. Cole Palmer looked baffled as Commander-in-Chief Trump joined their trophy celebrations Trump had played a key role in presenting tournament awards following the final 'I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused, yeah,' he said. Trump had earlier presented Palmer with the golden ball award with the 23-year-old midfielder looking as equally baffled during that presentation.

Five reasons why Joan Garcia will prove to be an ideal signing for Barcelona Marc Cucurella, fresh off winning the FIFA Club World Cup with Chelsea, has weighed in on Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona, sharing his thoughts on how the England international might adapt to Spanish football. In addition to his views on Rashford, Cucurella also spoke about Barcelona's recent progress under Hansi Flick. As such, a lot of former players, including Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker, have voiced their opinion about the transfer and considering their takes, it is safe to say that he is likely to leave a strong impression.
