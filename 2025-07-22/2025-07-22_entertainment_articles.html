Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, a collaborator on Osbourne's final album, Patient Number 9, shared: “Sad to hear Ozzy died today. ‘War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time. It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. Then when The ‘Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.” Further notes have been shared by Public Enemy's Flavor Flav, Metallica, Nirvana, John Maus, Yungblud, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, the Roots' Questlove, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, the Rolling Stones' Ronnie Wood, Disturbed's David Draiman, Twisted Sister's Dee Snider, the Smashing Pumpkins, Sean Ono Lennon, Julian Lennon, Pantera, Sammy Hagar, and Jack White.

As of now, there's no word on how Osbourne died. “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” his family said in a statement. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.” The incredible lineup included Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Pantera, Slayer, Tool, Lamb of God, Billy Corgan, Steven Tyler, Tom Morello, Sammy Hagar, Anthrax, Alice in Chains, Zakk Wylde, and many others. Each played a handful of their own tunes along with Black Sabbath classics. Crowley,” “Suicide Solution,” “Mama, I'm Coming Home,” and “Crazy Train” with veteran members of his solo band. There were concerns beforehand about the state of his voice in light of his health issues, but he worked hard to prep for the night, and sounded incredible. This was a moment many metalheads thought they'd never see, considering the past bad blood with drummer Bill Ward, and the fact that Sabbath already played a farewell concert in 2017 at the end of their last tour.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Starz has picked up Power: Origins to series, becoming the Universe's fifth installment and the second prequel following Power Book III: Raising Kanan. It will consist of 18 episodes, with Raising Kanan boss Sascha Penn to serve as showrunner, writer, and executive producer. Power: Origins follows Ghost and Tommy as ambitious young entrepreneurs on the rise, determined to make their mark on the streets of New York City. Deadline understands the lead roles of Tommy and Ghost have yet to be cast. MeKai Curtis will reprise the role of early adult Kanan Stark in the new series, which he has portrayed across all four seasons of Power Book III: Raising Kanan. Franchise executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson played Kanan in the mothership series. According to show legend, Breeze plays a significant role in Ghost's budding career as part of New York's criminal underworld. Depending on what happens in the final season of Raising Kanan, Moore could return for Power: Origins. “I'm excited to continue to explore the origin stories of the Power Universe's founding fathers,” Penn shared in a statement. The original Power series ran for six seasons from 2014-2020, starring Omari Hardwick as James St. Patrick aka Ghost, and Joseph Sikora in the role of Tommy Egan. Power Book II: Ghost followed Ghost's son (and his killer), Tariq St. James (Michael Rainey Jr.), as he worked to build his empire. The series ran for four seasons from 2020-202, and also starred Mary J. Blige, Clifford “Method Man” Smith Jr., Woody McClain, Daniel Bellomy, Lovell Adams-Gray, Gianni Paolo and LaToya Tonodeo among others. As Deadline previously revealed exclusively, Power: Legacy (working title) is in the works from franchise vets Gary Lennon (Power Book IV: Force) and Kendra Chapman (Power Book IV: Force). The sixth installment is expected to be set in the present timeline, following the events of Power Book IV: Force, set to air its third and final season later this year. “Our fans have been asking for Ghost and Tommy's origins story since we first met them in Power — and with the launch of this series, we're delivering in a big way,” said Kathryn Busby, President of Original Programming for Starz. “This marks an electrifying new chapter in the franchise's evolution as we dive deep into the legacy of these iconic characters and the explosive moments that shaped their path.” Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The English rocker died July 22 after a long battle with Parkinson's. He had just performed his final concert, a farewell appearance featuring the original Black Sabbath lineup, earlier this month. In a statement to the BBC, his family said, “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.” For as much as he styled himself the Prince of Darkness, a heavy metal rocker devoted on stage to all things performatively evil, for the last nearly quarter century of his life, he was best known as a family man, the patriarch of a clan that shaped much of the media landscape we've lived in ever since. Related Stories Judd Apatow Praises Viral ‘Girls' Scene Amid ‘Too Much' Buzz: Andrew Rannells Is a ‘Remarkable' Actor Marc Maron Says Jon Stewart Doesn't Like Him: ‘There's No Love Here' Yes, there was “The Real World” on MTV for years before it — but that was always an artificial setup, a show that was cast and brought people together from different walks of life for an ostensible examination of “the way youth culture is now.” It was more social experiment than “this is the way these people actually live.” That show was all about the Kardashians branding themselves and creating a media empire, whereas “The Osbournes” was kind of an end unto itself — even if Ozzy's children Jack and Kelly Osbourne ended up competing on “Dancing with the Stars” and his wife Sharon had a long-running panelist gig on “The Talk.” And as much as he was associated with onstage evil, like a kind of male Elvira who also had an extraordinary screech of a voice — one of the most distinctive in rock — he was a lovable softie. One who just happened to bite the head off a bat onstage in 1982, which he claims to have thought was a rubber one. Doom metal begins with Osbourne's band Black Sabbath, whose self-titled album in 1970, followed by “Paranoid” and “Master of Reality” over the year after made wearing heavy eyeliner, large crosses, and singing lyrics with ostensibly satanic themes a mainstay in rock. Would there have been a Goth movement without Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath? A lot of Black Sabbath's work was intentionally provocative, designed to ruffle conventional sensibilities. But when Osbourne became a solo artist, look at how often the theme of family runs through his work: And never more so than in his 1991 masterpiece “Mama, I'm Coming Home.” That made his brood the perfect clan to launch the era of family-centric reality TV: They seem really, really different — but they're just like us! He's been accused of literally encouraging suicide with his song “Suicide Solution,” but he's actually a pillar for his wife and kids. For what it's worth, Jack Black, when giving Osbourne's induction speech at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, did not see anything thematically opposed to his onstage Prince of Darkness antics and his contribution to a genre that's defined so much of 21st century TV. “He teamed up with his family to create another genre, reality TV,” Black said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NBC has added another new comedy series for the 2025-26 season, handing a series order to Jeff Astrof and Liz Astrof's single-camera cheerleading pilot Stumble, headlined by Jenn Lyon. This is the second of three comedy pilots NBC has ordered so far in 2025 to score a series pickup, joining The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins, starring Tracy Morgan and Daniel Radcliffe and executive produced by Tina Fey, which was ordered to series in May. 2025 Premiere Dates For New & Returning Series On Broadcast, Cable & Streaming Chris Estrada To Headline Comedy 'Forklift' In Works At NBC With Kent Alterman & Sarah Babineau As EPs It has been hard to get a good read on the community center pilot, which has been flying largely under the radar unlike Stumble, which, as Deadline reported, sailed through internal screenings and testing with high marks, setting up a series pickup. NBC is yet to announce scheduling for its new comedy series with two half-hour holes remaining on the fall schedule come November, one behind St. Denis Medical on Monday and one behind Happy's Place on Friday. With its mockumentary style, Stumble would fit right in behind the similarly shot medical comedy St. Denis Medical through, as Deadline reported last month, NBCUnivetrsal also had been considering a run on NBC og Peacock's The Paper, a successor to mocumentary-style comedy staple The Office. Written by veteran comedy showrunners Liz and Jeff Astrof in the sibling duo's first team-up to create a series together, Stumble centers on Courteney Potter (Jenn Lyon) who is determined to rally her newly recruited junior college cheer squad to win her record-breaking 15th championship and improve their lives along the way. In addition to Lyon, who won the role in a competitive situation with several big-name actresses vying for it, the main cast includes Taran Killam, Ryan Pinkston, Jarrett Austin Brown, Anissa Borrego, Arianna Davis, Taylor Dunbar and Georgie Murphy. Kristin Chenoweth, who guest starred in the pilot, will be recurring. Liz Astrof and Jeff Astrof executive produce alongside cheerleading coach Monica Aldama, known for her appearance on the Netflix docuseries Cheer, and producer Dana Honor through her Defining Eve Productions. Jeff Blitz directs and executive produces the pilot only. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Almost a year to the day since his father dropped out of the 2024 presidential primary, Hunter Biden has embarked on a no-holds-barred interview tour that is loaded with criticism of the Democratic Party. In a more than three-hour-long interview with independent journalist and social media personality Andrew Callaghan of Channel 5, Biden dove into his anger over Democrats' treatment of his father during the 2024 primary; his struggles with addiction, trauma, and grief; and his views on the first months of the Trump administration. Where the former president is maintaining a strategic silence, his colorful son is speaking out on everything from George Clooney to the chemical nuances of crack cocaine. Here are 5 stand out moments from Hunter Biden's Channel 5 interview on Monday. President Biden didn't bother pretending that he was anything less than resentful over his involuntarily voluntary exit from the 2024 Democratic primary, and it seems the sentiment is shared by his son. “The intelligentsia of the Democratic Party with 2020 hindsight, believes that Joe Biden should have considered not running again because of their perception that he was too old,” Biden said. “Speaker Emeritus Pelosi did not give a full-throated endorsement, which allowed everybody else to kind of go OK. Biden also criticized George Clooney over a New York Times op-ed in which the actor called on President Biden to drop out of the Democratic primary. “What right do you have to step on a man who's given 52 years of his fucking life to the service of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are going to take out, basically, a full-page ad in the fucking New York Times to undermine the president?” Biden torched Clooney's association with former President Barack Obama, and the role other prominent Obama-era politicos had in the public debate around his father's age. He called former Obama Campaign Strategist David Axelrod a one-hit wonder who “had one success in his political life and that was Barack Obama and that was because of Barack Obama,” and referred to the hosts of Pod Save America — a political podcast founded by former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Tommy Vietor,  Jon Lovett, and Dan Pfeiffer — as “junior fucking speech writers on Barack Obama's Senate staff who have been dining out on the relationship with him” for over a decade. Biden has been very open about his past addiction to drugs and alcohol, and in his conversation with Callaghan denied conspiracy theories that a bag of cocaine found in a White House cubby last year belonged to him. Everyone Who's Backed Stephen Colbert Since CBS Canceled ‘The Late Show' Jimmy Fallon Responds to Colbert Cancellation: ‘I Don't Like What's Going On' Stephen Colbert Addresses Cancellation by Telling Trump to ‘Go F-ck Yourself' I have not touched a drop of alcohol or a drug, and I'm incredibly proud of that,” he said, going on to discuss the Republican obsession with his addiction and the actual differences between cocaine and crack cocaine. Biden said that he felt his addiction to crack was “an added bonus for [the media] that they could, they could say ‘crack addict,' and everybody would go, ‘Oh, my God, he's a monster. “I don't want to tell people how to make crack cocaine, but it literally is a mayonnaise  jar, cocaine, and baking soda.” “Alcohol is the most destructive drug not just to your body, but it puts you in more danger than any other drug I've ever experienced,” Biden said. “And then you add on top of that the amount of crack I was using at the time, and crack cocaine in terms of your physical health is not as dangerous as the situation you put yourself in to be able to obtain it.” Biden added that if any good has come from the media's treatment of him was that it forced him to confront the darkest and most “embarrassing” episodes of his addiction. Biden's disastrous debate against President Donald Trump marked a point of no return for many Democrats and voters skeptical of Biden's ability to handle a second term. “If you think the prison in El Salvador [that migrants are being sent to] is not a fucking concentration camp, you're out of your fucking mind,” Biden said of the Terrorism Confinement Cednter (CEDCOT), the maximum security propaganda prison where the United States has  dissappeared over 200 Venezuelan migrant men. “I'll tell you what, if I became president in two years from now —  or four years from now, or three years from now — I would pick up the phone and call the fucking president in El Salvador and say, ‘You either fucking send them back or I'm gonna fucking invade.' Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele responded with a dig at Biden's past addiction on social media. For years now, the former president's son has been the target of conspiracies and conjecture promoted by Republicans: from unproven allegations of corrupt business dealings with Ukraine, to the obsession over his laptop. Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath Singer and Heavy Metal Pioneer, Dead at 76 Jon Stewart to CBS After Colbert's 'Late Show' Cancellation: 'Go F-ck Yourself' Stephen Colbert Addresses Cancellation by Telling Trump to ‘Go F-ck Yourself' “These motherfuckers, they're selling gold telephones and sneakers and $2 billion investments in golf courses, and selling tickets to the White House for investment into their meme coin,” Biden said, adding that “if you believe the worst possible thing that they've ever said about,” him, it doesn't hold a candle to what the Trumps “are openly doing, and nobody's batting an eye.” Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

Shia LaBeouf and FKA Twigs are no longer in a legal battle after five years. Twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, filed a lawsuit against her “Honey Boy” co-star LaBeouf in December 2020, alleging the “Disturbia” actor inflicted emotional distress and assaulted her. “Committed to forging a constructive path forward, we have agreed to settle our case out of court,” Twigs's lawyer Bryan Freedman and LaBeouf's lawyer Shawn Holley said in a joint statement.

I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. In a separate email to the outlet, LaBeouf stated that “many of these allegations are not true” but that Twigs and fellow accusers should have “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and accept accountability for those things I have done.” LaBeouf also noted at the time that he was “not cured of [his] PTSD and alcoholism.” We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>FKA twigs has agreed to drop her long-running lawsuit against her former boyfriend Shia LaBeouf. According to documents obtained by Pitchfork, the musician and her lawyers filed a request to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, meaning that FKA twigs cannot refile the case. In a joint statement shared with Pitchfork, attorneys Bryan J. Freedman and Shawn Holley said, on behalf of their respective clients, FKA twigs and Shia LaBeouf: “Committed to forging a constructive path forward, we have agreed to settle our case out of court. FKA twigs originally sued Shia LaBeouf in December 2020, claiming that the actor subjected her to “relentless abuse,” sexual battery, assault, and emotional distress. She had been seeking $10 million in damages. Speaking with The New York Times, FKA twigs further described the alleged abuse she endured during her relationship with LaBeouf. “What I went through with Shia was the worst thing I've ever been through in the whole of my life,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For her latest trick, Lady Gaga demonstrated for fans how to recover like a pro after a stumble, jumping right back up after slipping and falling in the middle of a Mayhem Ball concert in Las Vegas over the weekend. Just seconds prior, a cameraman filming her appeared to trip as well, and the Grammy winner helped him adjust the aim of his lens before continuing to walk. Moments later, however, Gaga — wearing a hooded cloak while performing “Vanish Into You” — also dropped to the floor of the venue. But before you could blink, she jumped right back up to her feet and continued moving toward the Little Monsters waiting for her at the pit barricade. Gaga opened the trek July 16 in Vegas, playing a total of three shows at T-Mobile Arena. She'll next make stops in San Fransisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City. The tour comes in support of Gaga's critically acclaimed 2024 album, Mayhem, which debuted at No. And though mid-show snafus are hardly ideal, Gaga is in good company when it comes to people who have taken a tumble in concert. More recently, Beyoncé played it cool when her flying car prop stopped working during a Cowboy Carter stop in Houston, and Katy Perry persevered when her own levitating set piece malfunctioned in the middle of a number.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A summer without superhero movies may still be years or decades away, but at least Hollywood seems willing to achieve Origin Story Zero. Despite a title that tips a cap to the characters' Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, The Fantastic Four: First Steps joins this season's Superman and Thunderbolts as superhero stories that plop audiences in medias res, at least compared to the Fantastic Four retellings of decades' past. A title card lets the nerds know that this is all taking place on Earth-828, explaining the 1960s-ish retro-futuristic style and lack of any other visible MCU superheroes. Then off we go into an Easter eggy (but not off-puttingly so) newsreel-style montage chronicling the many adventures of stretchy scientist Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), his sometimes-invisible wife Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), her fiery brother Johnny (Joseph Quinn), and their rock-monster family friend Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), less charitably known as The Thing. Generally, their superhero monikers don't get much play in this story, which is so family-focused that it becomes almost weirdly insular, with few other characters to speak of—and even fewer that aren't computer-generated. Though the Surfer  evinces some oblique cosmic decency beneath her shiny metallic exterior, Galactus appears to be an unstoppable, unknowable force, and brainiac Reed must figure out how to protect his family and the rest of the Earth from this unimaginably massive threat. It must be said that some of the plans he comes up with do not sound like the work of a bona fide genius. They seem, in fact, like remnants of smaller, dumber movies that preceded this one, heralding oblivion. Specifically, despite a trip to space and through some time-dilating portals, on paper First Steps more or less remakes 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer. An odd moroseness takes over the movie in its back half, mostly due to a stakes-raising moral dilemma. Suffice to say that there's a thoughtful, almost Star Trek-like moral question that the movie ultimately feels unequipped to take seriously—though that doesn't stop director Matt Shakman and four credited screenwriters from trying, exacerbating Marvel's ongoing tension between their grown-up aspirations and their four-quadrant instincts (or possibly vice versa). Any break from the lightweight Marvel punch-up style is a welcome one, yet The Fantastic Four: First Steps still finds room for plenty of bad dialogue. The freedom once afforded actors as eclectic as the entire cast of Iron Man 2 is long gone, leaving this central quartet to play things respectably, honorably, and more than a little muted, with occasional outbreaks of Downey Lite yammering where certain words get repeated (“plan” is one here) like the characters are vamping on a third-tier single-camera sitcom. The endless possibilities of a retro-futuristic alternate universe are utilized, in part, to imagine that the laziness of writing in fist-bumps or dully contemporary phrasings and affectations can escape anachronism status on a technicality. The early scene where Sue announces her pregnancy is a deadly object lesson in forced multiple-draft chumminess, inspiring wistful thoughts of how Pascal was apparently warned off of doing a Mid-Atlantic accent. Stylish costumes are one thing; stylized acting is apparently quite another. Granted, past Fantastic Four movies, Incredibles movies, and any number of Avengers and X-Men variations have taken up a lot of bickering-super-family real estate, which may explain why First Steps doesn't bother depicting much familial discord. But this movie's family dynamics feel especially frictionless; in depicting actual (not de facto or metaphorical) parenthood, siblinghood, and especially marriage, Marvel is as wobbly and tentative as first-time parents, only without ever admitting how tired they are. Those piercing eyes, so consistently drained of personality, desire, or sexuality! Johnny Storm has a glimmer of those latter stirrings when he beholds the Silver Surfer—a naked woman astride a surfboard, he points out when protesting too much, though Reed performs a quick “actually” about any implied nudity as if quoting Pope Kevin Feige himself. These movies have become so piously devoid of romance, nevermind sex, that one half-expects to see the happily pregnant married couple inhabiting separate beds, as in an early sitcom-spoofing episode of WandaVision, which Shakman also worked on. It's probably not easy to make a good Fantastic Four movie. Occasionally it even conjures images of sci-fi majesty, like Sue in zero-gravity labor or the Surfer riding molten waves. For a lot of Marvel fans, it will be more than enough.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Hollywood Reporter was right in characterizing this year's Venice lineup as featuring “a frankly absurd number of must-see movies.” While it's been an up and down year for cinema thus far, the auteurs are bringing their A-game for festival season. Venice will see the premieres of multiple highly anticipated films, including Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, which stars Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi, Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, which follows the story of two-time UFC heavyweight champion Mark Kerr (played by Dwayne Johnson), and Luca Guadagnino's dark academic thriller After The Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which will premiere out of competition. Frequent collaborators Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone are back with Bugonia, an adaptation of Jang Joon-Hwan's Save The Green Planet!. The two had a pretty good fest back in 2023, when they took home the Golden Lion for four-time Oscar winner Poor Things. Speaking of Oscars, Mona Fastvold, who co-wrote The Brutalist with Brady Corbet, has her own “historical drama musical” in competition titled The Testament Of Ann Lee. Other major directors like Noah Baumbach (Jay Kelly) Kathryn Bigelow (A House Of Dynamite), Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan) are also in competition. Alexander Payne will be in attendance although he isn't screening a film. The 2025 festival runs from August 27 to September 9. Noah Baumbach (USA, UK, Italy) The Voice of Hind Rajab, dir.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>However, in recent podcast appearances, he has given rare insight into how becoming a husband and father has changed him. “I talk about my wife and daughter, but obviously I don't post them,” Warner said on his ‘Not All Hood podcast'. On the ‘Hot & Bothered podcast‘ earlier this year, Warner reflected on meeting his wife later in life and how his mindset had evolved. “I met my wife through a mutual friend,” he shared. “She said, ‘I'm definitely going to have kids,'” he recalled. “I also realized that if something happened and we weren't together romantically, she would still be the person I would want to raise a child with, co-parent with.” Their daughter, now 7, became the heart of Warner's world. “It's so funny because my daughter will say she already knew. She was just waiting for us to decide,” Warner said on ‘Not All Hood'. He credited meeting his wife at 45 and fatherhood soon after as timing that felt spiritually aligned. “There was a moment I realized, when people say, ‘when you know, you know,' that's what that feeling is,” he told host Melyssa Ford. Warner admitted he was often misunderstood by the public when it came to settling down. “For so long, people were like, he's a womanizer. May Malcolm-Jamal Warner's legacy live on through the love he shared with his wife and daughter, and the impact he left behind.</p>

The Fantastic Four: First Steps stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach continued their world tour in promotion of the film on Monday, bringing Marvel's First Family to Los Angeles. The film — set against a backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world — follows Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and The Thing as they defend Earth from Galactus and Silver Surfer. At #TheFantasticFour premiere, Joseph Quinn shows his excitement for the idea of teaming up with Tom Holland in future MCU projects. I think the most moving thing for me was that in a big movie like this, Sue spends half the time pregnant, she gives birth and then she has a newborn while facing some huge intergalactic, existential threat to humanity,” Kirby explained. As she does in the comics, I really hope that translates.” Vanessa Kirby describes some of the lessons she learned about motherhood through her role in #TheFantasticFour pic.twitter.com/3ELnbx6yyD Julia Garner, who plays the much buzzed-about Silver Surfer, joked that the team “made me look a lot cooler than I actually am” with special effects.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The tributes continue to pour in for Malcolm-Jamal Warner following his tragic death on July 20 at age 54. Yvette Nicole Brown, who played Shirley Bennett on “Community,” reflects on the loss of her beloved friend and co-star. Warner played Shirley's husband Andre on the sitcom. A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown) She continued, “This video is a glimpse of the love he would share just randomly. A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown) “Holding space for @malcolmjamalwar ❤️🕊️,” she noted in the caption. I was blessed to work with him and most importantly, I was blessed to call him friend. Brown continued, “I am not someone who takes friendship lightly. I cherish being allowed to walk through life with someone. I just talked to Malcolm maybe a week ago.” “This is devastating,” she shared through tears. “He deserves a personal moment from me,” Brown said. He was such a good dad … Please know that he was an amazing husband and an amazing father and he loved his family and his family loved him.” The actress touched on how Warner was “intentional” about contacting friends when he thought of them. “He never missed my birthday and I never missed his,” she said, reflecting on the ways he would make the day special for her every year. “When I did ‘Community' and knew Shirley had been married … I was so happy that [creator] Dan Harmon let me have Malcolm,” she recalled. Brown shared how she asked, during the first season, “If we go the distance, if we ever see Shirley's husband, can it please let it be Malcolm-Jamal Warner?” “I just wanted to work with him forever because he's such a good guy,” she added.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter 'Smashing Machine' star Dwayne Johnson will make his Lido debut, as will Julia Roberts, appearing on the Venice red carpet for Luca Guadagnino's out-of-competition title 'After the Hunt.' Among the hot awards titles heading to the Lido are Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, from A24, featuring Dwayne Johnson as two‑time UFC heavyweight champion Mark Kerr and Emily Blunt as his wife Dawn; Luca Guadagnino's #MeToo–inspired thriller After the Hunt, for Amazon MGM Studios, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, will premiere out of competition; and Guillermo del Toro's dark reimagining of Frankenstein, featuring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth, a Netflix production. BBC Studios Unscripted Boss on Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci Series and the Recipe for U.S. Busan Film Festival to Honor Jafar Panahi as Asian Filmmaker of the Year This will mark the Venice festival debut for both Roberts and Johnson. Netflix, which sat out Vence last year, is back in force for 2025. Alongside Frankenstein, the streamer has  Noah Baumbach's comedy‑drama Jay Kelly, co-written with Emily Mortimer, and headlined by George Clooney, premiering in competition, and Kathryn Bigelow's ticking bomb geopolitical thriller A House of Dynamite, starring Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Greta Lee, Gabriel Basso, and Jared Harris. The Venice line-up is an embarrassment of riches, for award-watchers and regular film fans alike, with the competition selection including the latest from A-list auteurs Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), François Ozon (L'Etranger), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan). A year after Brady Corbet's The Brutalist launched in Venice, en route to three Oscar wins, the film's co-writer (and producer) Mona Fastvold arrives in competition with The Testament of Ann Lee, a historical drama musical film starring Lewis Pullman, Amanda Seyfried, and Tim Blake Nelson, that she co-wrote with Corbet. The film tells the true story of Hind Rajab, a 6-year-old girl who, on January 29, 2024, was trapped in a car on fire in Gaza. She called Red Crescent emergency workers, who kept her on the line while they tried to get an ambulance to her. The Party Film Sales is handling worldwide sales on the film and co-representing North American rights with CAA Media Finance. Yorgos Lanthimos, a Venice Golden Lion winner for Poor Things, returns in competition with Bugonia, an adaptation of Jang Joon-Hwan's 2003 South Korean sci-fi film Save the Green Planet!, featuring his frequent collaborator Emma Stone. Focus Features will release the film stateside, with Universal Pictures handling internationally outside of Korea, where CJ ENM will release. And iconic indie director Jim Jarmusch, a Cannes regular, will bring his latest to the Lido this year, premiering Mubi's Father Mother Sister Brother, a triptych with an all-star ensemble cast including Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Indya Moore, Vicky Krieps, Tom Waits, Luka Sabbat, and Charlotte Rampling. The 82nd Venice competition line-up also includes the latest from A-list auteurs Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), François Ozon (L'Etranger), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan) Italian Oscar-winning Paolo Sorrentino (The Great Beauty) will open this year's festival with La Grazia (Grace), a love story starring his long-time collaborator Toni Servillo. La Grazia, co-starring Diamonds actor Anna Ferzetti, will premiere in competition on Aug. 27. Mubi picked up the film ahead of its Venice bow. Dog 51, a new action-packed French sci-fi thriller from Bac Nord director Cedric Jimenez will close the festival, out of competition. Gus Van Sant's return to feature films, Dead Man's Wire, starring Bill Skarsgard, will also screen out of competition. Other out-of-competition highlights include Anders Thomas Jensen's Danish dark comedy The Last Viking starring Mads Mikkelsen, Julian Schnabel's long-awaited The Hand of Dante, and Scarlet, the first anime feature in four years from Japanese master Mamoru Hosoda. Venice has selected four TV series for its small-screen sidebar: Etty, a limited series from Israeli showrunner Hagai Levi (In Treatment, The Affair), loosely based on the diary of Dutch Jewish writer Etty Hillesum, starring Julia Windischbauer and Sebastian Koch, which Studio TF1 is selling worldwide; Portobello, the first Italian original production for HBO Max in which Italian director Marco Bellocchio (The Traitor), follows the true story of the downfall of one of Italy's most beloved TV hosts; Studiocanal's A Prophet – The Series, a TV reboot of Jacques Audiard's classic French prison drama from 2009, directed by Enrico Maria Artale; and Il Mostro (The Monster), a true-life serial-killer drama from Gomorrah series director, Stefano Sollima, made for Netflix. This year's Golden Lion career achievement honorees are legendary German director Werner Herzog (Fitzcarraldo, Grizzly Man) and Vertigo star Kim Novak. Venice's Classic sidebar, which includes a selection on documentaries about cinema, this year includes Mike Figgis' Megadoc, a behind-the-scenes look at Francis Ford Coppola's decades-in-the-making Megalopolis. Two-time Oscar-winner Alexander Payne heads up this year's competition jury as president, and together with international film talents including Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, French director Stéphane Brizé, Italian director Maura Delpero, Chinese actress Zhao Tao, and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, will pick the 2025 Golden Lion winner.
