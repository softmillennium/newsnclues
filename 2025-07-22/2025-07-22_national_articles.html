                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Roughly 2,000 National Guard troops across multiple states are expected to be mobilized to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement at detention facilities, according to a US official and a source familiar with the planning. As of Tuesday, there were around 57,000 people in ICE custody, according to federal data obtained by CNN. Senior Trump officials are preparing to expand detention space nationwide in the coming weeks after receiving a historic amount of funding from Congress. The US official said the mobilization is expected to call up National Guard troops from as many as 20 states who will be tasked with some hands-on roles including conducting finger printing and mouth swabbing of detainees. National Guard forces have largely been used to provide administrative assistance to ICE thus far, though the US official said ICE has communicated the need for assistance in other areas. A defense official said the Pentagon would not “speculate on future operations or operational needs, but DoD stands ready to support our DHS partners in executing the President's executive orders and protecting the United States' sovereign territory.” The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment. The plans are in line with an earlier request from DHS to the Defense Department asking for thousands of National Guard personnel to assist with a range of tasks, including processing, transportation support and detention support. “If you're plotting the points on a graph of the way the administration has taken one step at a time, you continue that trajectory and it's going to look pretty similar to what DHS has been requesting, as far as 20,000 troops across the country performing what we'd consider to be immigration enforcement activities,” the aide said. CNN has reported that the White House and Department of Homeland Security have been seeking ways to use the National Guard and the military more broadly to help bolster immigration enforcement around the country, in an effort to ramp up arrests of migrants. While ICE is preparing to receive an unprecedented $75 billion in funding, current and former Homeland Security officials say the recruiting and training of ICE personnel is likely to take weeks or months, requiring outside assistance in the interim. Roughly 4,000 National Guardsmen were mobilized last month to assist ICE personnel in Los Angeles, in response to protests and to protect federal personnel and property, though half of them have since been released from the mission. The Florida National Guard has also been mobilized to conduct base camp security at a new detention center in the Everglades, the Pentagon announced earlier this month, though a spokesperson for the Florida Guard previously said they had not yet been tasked with “detention or enforcement operations.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Latest on Epstein case: President Donald Trump said it “sounds appropriate” for the Justice Department to reach out to convicted former Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. It comes amid recent calls for her to testify about the accused sex trafficker. • More on Epstein: The House will leave for its August recess a day earlier than planned, as GOP leaders hope to sap the momentum behind a push to force a vote on an Epstein-related measure. • Obama fires back: Trump's allegations of treason and sedition against former President Barack Obama are “bizarre” and “ridiculous,” his spokesperson said after Trump lobbed the claims during an Oval Office meeting. President Donald Trump's allegations of treason and sedition against former President Barack Obama are “bizarre” and “ridiculous,” a spokesman for Obama said today after Trump lobbed the claims during an Oval Office meeting. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,” said Patrick Rodenbush, the former president's spokesman. He appeared to be pointing to information declassified and released last week by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that she claimed was evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by top Obama administration officials to manufacture the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. The Trump administration has faced increasing backlash over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files after Attorney General Pam Bondi walked back her promise to release as many documents in the Justice Department's possession as possible, announcing that there is no evidence Epstein kept a “client list” or was murdered. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Possible delays: The federal judge overseeing Maxwell's case said he needs more information before he can unseal grand jury transcripts requested by the DOJ. Meanwhile, a person close to Maxwell said she will oppose the unsealing of grand jury materials related to her and Epstein. GOP lawmakers: Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team told House Republicans that the administration needs time to deal with the issue, sources say. But many lawmakers were not pleased with that call for patience. The deadlock has essentially ground House floor activity to a halt. The House will leave for its August recess a day earlier as Republican GOP leaders hope to sap the momentum behind a push by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie to force a vote on an Epstein-related measure. US out of UNESCO: Trump pulled the US out of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). US envoy departs: Steve Witkoff is heading to the Middle East to work toward a Gaza ceasefire, a spokesperson said. The agreement calls for 19% tariffs on goods coming from the Philippines, while American goods shipped there won't be charged a tariff, Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Meanwhile, goods from the Philippines were charged a minimum 17% “reciprocal” tariff in April before Trump paused those. Earlier this month, he threatened a 20% tariff on goods from the Philippines as of August 1. The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned whether a meeting between Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Ghislaine Maxwell would produce anything, saying his focus remains on wanting more information from the Department of Justice and FBI. “We've already had the attorney general announce that she is possession of client list information and then can't produce it. Durbin, who has requested documents from the FBI and DOJ, suggested that a subpoena could potentially be necessary to get top officials to testify before the Judiciary Committee. “So many agents who should have been investigating issues of national security, safety, narcotics and the like, were assigned the task of going through this file here by Jeffrey Epstein creation that, to me, seems like a waste of talent and law enforcement. Several conservative hardliners in the House are already warning Republican leadership against passing another short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, as the fiscal year end looms at the end of September. Meanwhile, in an intensified effort to ensure that Democrats are united ahead of a September 30 spending deadline, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will meet this afternoon with his House counterpart, Hakeem Jeffries, on how to tackle the upcoming funding fight, a Democratic leadership aide told CNN. Grand jury proceedings are conducted behind closed doors and are typically shielded from public view unless a judge allows the testimony to be unsealed. Judge Richard Berman, who oversaw the prosecution of Epstein — who died by suicide before trial — filed a separate but related order. Both judges ordered prosecutors to file their response as well as the complete set of grand jury transcripts, a proposed redacted version and a description of other grand jury materials, including exhibits, by July 29. Engelmayer said Maxwell's attorneys and lawyers for any victims have until August 5 to file their positions. Maxwell was convicted and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. She has asked the Supreme Court to hear her case. Berman said Epstein's representative has until August 5 to respond. A judge heard arguments in the case yesterday, where Harvard is arguing that the Trump administration's efforts to freeze federal funding violates free speech protections. The Trump administration says Harvard has failed to address antisemitism on campus. A reporter asked during a bilateral meeting with leader of the Philippines Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. if Trump would be willing to give any federal funding back to Harvard if the university reaches an agreement with administration. “We want money to go to all universities, not Harvard,” the president replied, adding: “Harvard got more than anybody else … they have $52 billion and they got $7 billion over a short period of time. And we have a very hostile judge appointed by Barack Hussein Obama — a very, very hostile judge who knows exactly right from wrong but, you know, we expect a win on appeal.” “She hasn't given a decision yet, but she's very hostile … and she was put by Barack Hussein Obama and generally speaking anybody that does that, it's going to, we're going to have problems with. More on the case: Burroughs heard opposing arguments over whether to reject or allow Harvard's funding freeze — and offered her own challenges to the government's legal rationale for implementing their order cutting off federal funds for the elite university. The hearing marked a critical moment for what's become the flashpoint of a major clash over academic freedom, federal funding, and campus oversight — and a belief inside the White House that targeting the country's most elite academic institutions is a winning political issue for Trump. The House will leave for its August recess a day earlier than initially planned as Republican leaders hope to sap the momentum behind a GOP push by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie to force the chamber to vote on a Jeffrey Epstein-related measure. A group of 11 Republicans and counting have signed onto what's known as a discharge petition requiring President Donald Trump's Justice Department to release all federal documents related to Epstein. Massie is leading the measure, alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California. If Khanna can deliver all Democrats, their maneuver would have enough support to circumvent Speaker Mike Johnson, who has signaled he doesn't support Congress taking action to release the Epstein files on the floor. Massie introduced the measure on July 15 and under House rules, it requires seven legislative days to “ripen” before he and Khanna can formally begin collecting signatures. President Donald Trump said that he's looking at the possibility of eliminating a capital gains tax on home sales in an effort to bolster the housing market. Certain real estate sales are currently subject to the capital gains tax if a home is sold for more than the seller initially paid for it. Trump in his centerpiece “big, beautiful bill” that Congress passed earlier this month has already ended certain taxes on tips and on overtime pay. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent now appear keen on allowing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remaining eight months of his tenure as head of the central bank. However, both are in agreement that interest rates should be lower. He will be out in eight months anyway,” Trump said Tuesday, speaking in the Oval Office while meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “People aren't able to buy a house because [Powell] is a numbskull and keeps the rates too high and probably doing it for political reasons,” Trump told reporters. Trump also criticized the central bank's ongoing multibillion-dollar renovation, which has invited increased scrutiny of the Fed and may be used as a means to push Powell out of his position. “It is inconceivable… (that) they can spend 2.7 billion to build a building. He also called on the Fed to lower rates. “Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” Trump said in the Oval Office, where he is hosting the Philippine president. He added later: “Obama's been caught directly,” saying his actions amounted to “treason.” “This is like proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious, that Obama led, was trying to lead a coup, and it was with Hillary Clinton, with all these other people, but Obama headed it up,” he said later. Last week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified and released new intelligence documents that she claimed were evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by top Obama administration officials to manufacture the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. But the Trump administration's allegations conflate and misrepresent what the intelligence community actually concluded, according to a review of a GOP-led Senate investigation from 2020 and interviews with congressional sources familiar with the probe. The newly unsealed documents do nothing to undercut the government's core findings in its 2017 assessment that Russia launched an influence and hacking campaign and sought to help Trump beat Clinton, the sources said. President Donald Trump said it “sounds appropriate” for the Justice Department to reach out to Jeffrey Epstein's former associate Ghislaine Maxwell for a meeting. “I don't know about it, but I think it's something that would be, sounds appropriate,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the plans. “He's very smart,” the president said about Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who announced earlier Tuesday that he intends to meet with Maxwell soon. “I didn't know that they were going to do it. President Donald Trump says he expects to visit China in the “not-too-distant future,” without specifying whether he would visit Beijing in September for a World War II anniversary commemoration that will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We have a lot of meetings possible,” Trump said when asked about a prospective summit with Putin around the Chinese visit. “President Xi has invited me to China, and we'll probably be doing that in the not-too-distant future, a little bit out, but not too distant,” he went on. Remember: Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping invited each other to visit their respective countries in a telephone call earlier this year. There are two upcoming occasions when a visit could occur: at a September 3 event marking the 80th anniversary of World War II — which Putin is also attending — or around the yearly APEC summit in late October, which this year is hosted by South Korea. Seated alongside Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the White House, Trump said he would encourage the Philippines to maintain strong relations with both Washington and Beijing. The National Capital Planning Commission will tour the Federal Reserve construction site Thursday, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair announced on X, as the White House continues its pressure campaign against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Blair was one of three loyalists appointed to the National Capital Planning Commission earlier this month. White House staff secretary Will Scharf and budget analyst Stuart Levenbach were also appointed by President Donald Trump at the same time, as he has called on Powell to resign over the Fed chair's refusal to lower interest rates. Blair told CNN Friday that the group would like to visit the site during the day and not after hours or weekends, after stating that they were initially invited to come that evening. Renovations under fire: The $2.5 billion renovation project at the Federal Reserve, which initially came with a $1.9 billion price tag in 2019, has emerged as Trump and his allies' new attack line against Powell. Those allegations came out after Trump had criticized Powell for weeks for his refusal to cut interest rates — with the president nicknaming Powell “Too Late.” Trump has previously said he has no plans to fire the Fed chair, which would likely cause a significant disruption in financial markets. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for declassifying and releasing new intelligence documents that the administration claims are evidence Obama administration officials manufactured the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. “This is huge news, and I give great credit to Tulsi Gabbard, who's doing a phenomenal job for declassifying key documents that prove the president, and you know, his supporters, millions of Americans, who always saw this for what it was, were right,” Leavitt told “The Ruthless Podcast” in an episode released today. Gabbard claimed the documents were evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” and she threatened to refer Obama administration officials to the Justice Department for prosecution. A criminal referral does not necessarily mean the Justice Department will investigate or prosecute. Leavitt echoed that claim, specifically pointing to former President Barack Obama. Key context: But as CNN has reported, the Trump administration's allegations conflate and misrepresent what the intelligence community actually concluded, according to a review of a GOP-led Senate investigation from 2020 and interviews with congressional sources familiar with the probe. Trump himself touted Gabbard's findings over the weekend, reposting videos of her speaking on Fox Business and memes of Obama and his top officials in prison jumpsuits. A number of House Republicans are voicing their concerns over House Speaker Mike Johnson's call to allow the Trump administration more time to deal with the Jeffrey Epstein case. Here's what they are saying following a closed door meeting the Johnson and his leadership team: The message from Johnson to House GOP members was “the administration is dealing with it,” according to a GOP lawmaker. But many were not pleased with that call for patience. Maxwell subpoena: Immediately after the closed-door meeting, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett forced the House Oversight Committee to vote on a motion to subpoena Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Speaker Mike Johnson said he does not plan to allow votes on any measures related to the Jeffrey Epstein case before September, despite intense pressure from some of his own GOP members. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is offering rare praise from the Trump administration for one of President Donald Trump's favorite targets: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Asked if he agrees with a Trump administration official who has demanded Powell's resignation, Bessent described the Fed chair as a “good public servant.” There is nothing that tells me he should step down right now,” Bessent told Fox Business. The comments mark a stark contrast with another Trump official, Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has relentlessly berated Powell and called for his resignation. Bessent also voiced support for a hands-off approach toward monetary policy, the Fed's ability to influence the economy by raising and lowering interest rates. “Monetary policy — we should keep that off to the side. That should be in a jewel box and protected,” Bessent said. The treasury secretary added, however, that this is a “good opportunity for Chair Powell's legacy” to conduct an internal review of the Fed's operations — outside of monetary policy Trump officials have scrutinized an ongoing $2.5 billion renovation at the Federal Reserve complex in Washington, DC. Powell was nominated to lead the Fed in 2017 by Trump himself. The issue had badly divided Democrats earlier this year, but the party will face an initial inflection point this afternoon when Senate Majority Leader John Thune pushes forward with a procedural vote on a bipartisan appropriations bill to fund military and veterans issues. The vote will be second in a series scheduled for 2:15 p.m. The measure — one of several appropriations bills — passed with bipartisan support in committee, but several Democrats have warned they are frustrated and losing faith in Republicans on spending issues after their colleagues charged ahead with a $9 billion rescission package last week to claw back already appropriated congressional spending for foreign aid and public broadcasting.</p>

                </div>
                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) is putting House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in a difficult position as the Kentucky Republican spearheads an effort to push for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files while having a target on his back from President Donald Trump. But members like Massie warn that the decision to wait until after August recess could cost Republicans politically with their conservative base, as many in Trump's MAGA voting bloc are demanding transparency and immediate action from either Congress or the White House to release the files. Massie is looking to put Republicans on record with a bill introduced by him and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), which instructs the DOJ to release the documents on the disgraced and since-deceased financier. But Johnson disagrees with this approach and is unhappy with Massie for taking up this fight while the Trump administration is in power. “I don't understand Thomas Massie's motivation,” the speaker said Tuesday. The speaker said Massie could have brought his bill via discharge petition up anytime during the last four years, but “now he's clamoring as if there's some sort of timeline.” I do, but you know, with me in my way, I try to follow Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment: Never speak evil of another Republican.” “So let me just say about Thomas Massie, could you just accept my Southern ‘bless his heart,'” the speaker added. Trump then pledged to “lead the charge” and back a primary challenger against Massie, whom he calls a “third-rate grandstander.” The president continued to slam Massie when he said he wouldn't vote for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and expressed doubt that Iran was an “imminent threat” that required the United States to bomb the foreign country's nuclear facilities in June. On Monday night, Trump blasted Massie as the “worst Republican congressman” and an “Embarrassment to Kentucky.” The post came after Massie spoke to reporters on Capitol Hill and posted on social media demanding the files be released. In 2024, he was primaried by two candidates and won with about 76% of the vote. In 2022, he defeated three primary opponents with about 73% of the vote. My wife would never let me do that — besides, you're a good congressman. While Johnson and Massie do not see eye to eye on most issues, Johnson is tasked with defending incumbents, particularly in the 2026 midterm elections, in which every GOP vote counts and Republicans currently have a two-seat majority. Once former Rep. Mark Green's replacement is sworn in, it will jump back up to a three-seat majority. Trump calling for an incumbent to be ousted puts Johnson in a difficult position. It is the practice of the National Republican Congressional Committee, in particular, not to make endorsements against incumbents as well. Johnson stopped short of endorsing Massie in June during the escalation of the Kentucky Republican's feud with Trump, noting he and Massie “never agree these days” and that he understood Trump's frustration with the congressman. “Look, the speaker's job, my role with my party cap on, is I'm leader of my party here, and the speaker leads the incumbent protection program, right, that's what we call it. “But I certainly understand the president's frustration about the colleague you named, and he and I talk about that quite a bit,” Johnson added. “Can't quite understand what the rationale is, but if you're here and you're wearing one team's jersey and every single time you vote with the other team, people begin to question what your motive is and what your philosophy is and why you're so consistently opposed to the platform, the agenda of your party.”</p>

A dual U.S.-Chinese citizen formerly employed as an engineer at a Southern California company has admitted to stealing U.S. trade secrets for next-generation national security technology. Prosecutors said Gong faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. According to his plea agreement, Gong transferred more than 3,600 files from a Los Angeles-area research and development company where he worked, to personal storage devices during his brief tenure with the company last year. Federal prosecutors said the files Gong transferred include blueprints for sophisticated infrared sensors designed for use in space-based systems to detect nuclear missile launches and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles. Other files were said to have included blueprints for sensors designed to enable U.S. military aircraft to detect incoming, heat-seeking missiles and take countermeasures, including by jamming the missiles' infrared tracking ability. "These files describe the methods, designs, techniques, processes, specifications, testing, and manufacture of these technologies and would be extremely damaging economically if obtained by the Victim Company's competitors, and would be dangerous to U.S. national security if obtained by international actors," the complaint says. Court documents note that much of the Malibu-based company's work is funded through contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government contractors. Gong was hired by the company in January 2023 as an application-specific integrated circuit design manager responsible for the design, development and verification of its infrared sensors. From approximately March 30 that year until his termination on April 26, 2023, Gong allegedly transferred thousands of files from his work laptop to three personal storage devices. That included more than 1,800 files after he had accepted a job at one of the company's main competitors, prosecutors said. Prosecutors said many of the files Gong transferred contained proprietary and trade-secret information related to the development and design of a readout integrated circuit that allows space-based systems to detect missile launches and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles and a readout integrated circuit that allows aircraft to track incoming threats in low-visibility environments. Gong also allegedly transferred files containing trade secrets relating to the development of "next generation" sensors capable of detecting low-observable targets while demonstrating increased survivability in space, as well as the blueprints for the mechanical assemblies used to house and cryogenically cool the company's sensors. That information was among the company's most important trade secrets and is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the DOJ. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying a payload of 23 Starlink internet satellites soars into space after sunset after launching from Vandenberg Space Force Base on Feb. 10, 2025 as seen from Thousand Oaks, California. Many of the files had warnings in bold letters that the information was proprietary, export-controlled and for "official use only." The FBI executed a search warrant on May 8, 2023 at Gong's temporary residence in Thousand Oaks, California, and also searched his vehicle and his person. Law enforcement recovered multiple digital devices belonging to Gong, some of which contained the company's propriety files. Prosecutors said Gong repeatedly denied processing those hard drives or knowing where they were located in May 2023 interviews with the FBI. His resume states that he earned a Master of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering from Clemson University and completed some PhD work at Stanford University, according to the complaint. In an aerial photo, single-family homes line the shore of Westlake Lake on July 3, 2025 in Thousand Oaks, California. Law enforcement also said Gong applied to "Talent Programs" administered by the People's Republic of China while he was employed at several major technology companies in the U.S. between approximately 2014 and 2022. In the proposal, Gong described a plan to produce high-performance analog-to-digital converters like those produced by his employer. In another "Talent Program" application from September 2020, prosecutors said, Gong proposed to develop "low light/night vision" image sensors for use in military night vision goggles and civilian applications. Gong's proposal included a video presentation that contained the model number of a sensor developed by an international defense, aerospace, and security company where Gong worked from 2015 to 2019, according to the DOJ. The Justice Department cited a 2019 email translated from Chinese in which Gong remarked that he "took a risk" by traveling to China to participate in the Talent Programs because he worked for "an American military industry company" and thought he could "do something" to contribute to China's "high-end military integrated circuits."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is pulling the United States out of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization or UNESCO, a White House official told CNN. “President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO — which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,” White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. UNESCO “promotes cooperation in education, science, culture and communication to foster peace worldwide,” its website states. The United States was a founding member of UNESCO in 1945 but withdrew in 1984, citing concerns over financial mismanagement and a perceived bias against US interests. Nearly two decades later, in 2003, the US rejoined the organization during President George W. Bush's administration, with Bush stating that UNESCO had implemented important reforms. After he took office for the second time, President Donald Trump ordered a review of US participation, including “an analysis of any anti-Semitism or anti-Israel sentiment within the organization.” Bruce alleged that “UNESCO works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy.” “This decision contradicts the fundamental principles of multilateralism, and may affect first and foremost our many partners in the United States of America — communities seeking site inscription on the World Heritage List, Creative City status, and University Chairs,” she said in a statement. “However regrettable, this announcement was anticipated, and UNESCO has prepared for it,” she added. The US decision was hailed by Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar, who called it “a necessary step, designed to promote justice and Israel's right for fair treatment in the UN system.” “Singling out Israel and politicization by member states must end, in this and all professional UN agencies,” he wrote in a post on X Tuesday. French President Emmanuel Macron, however, took a swipe at the move. “Unwavering support for UNESCO, a universal guardian of science, the Ocean, education, culture, and world heritage,” he wrote on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified and released new intelligence documents Friday that she claimed were evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by top Obama administration officials to manufacture the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election. But the allegations conflate and misrepresent what the intelligence community actually concluded, according to a review of a GOP-led Senate investigation from 2020 and interviews with congressional sources familiar with the probe. The newly unsealed documents do nothing to undercut the government's core findings in its 2017 assessment that Russia launched an influence and hacking campaign and sought to help Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, the sources said. Instead, the assessment focused on Russia's influence campaign ordered by President Vladimir Putin and cyber operations against US and Democratic Party officials, including the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. “These are two different things — cyberattacks on infrastructure and hacking the DNC — which they're conflating in an attempt to make a political point,” said a former senior congressional source familiar with the Senate review. “It's just wildly misleading on its face.” In 2020, a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review agreed with the intelligence community's conclusions on Russia's election interference and Putin's role directing the effort. Multiple congressional sources familiar with the Senate report said that Gabbard is trying to lean on intelligence assessments that no voting systems were breached to falsely make a broader leap that a Russian influence and cyber campaign did not occur. In response to questions from CNN, an ODNI official said, “What the IC assessed before the Obama-Brennan-Clapper politicization, was that attempts by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election were designed to undermine public confidence in the vote outcome, not ‘hack' U.S. elections.” Last month, CIA Director John Ratcliffe also released a review that criticized the intelligence community's conclusion that Putin sought to help Trump, which he said was reached “through an atypical & corrupt process.” Ratcliffe referred former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey to the Justice Department, which is now investigating, CNN previously reported. Gabbard also threatened on Friday to refer Obama officials to the Department of Justice for potential prosecution. Related card The mystery of the missing binder: How a collection of raw Russian intelligence disappeared under Trump Trump and his allies have spent years trying to denigrate all aspects of the Russia investigation, which consumed much of the first two years of Trump's first term – including the 2017 intelligence assessment; special counsel Robert Mueller's probe and the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation; and the infamous dossier written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and alleged coordination between the Russian government and people associated with the Trump campaign. Trump touted Gabbard's findings over the weekend, reposting videos of Gabbard speaking on Fox Business and memes of former President Barack Obama and his top officials in prison jumpsuits. Earlier this year, Trump declassified and released redacted documents from a binder that the White House compiled in 2020 criticizing the FBI's probe, including the bureau's errors in relying on the dossier to obtain foreign surveillance warrants on a Trump adviser. !” Trump posted on Truth Social Monday evening. The January 2017 intelligence assessment, released days before Trump took office, was a key first step in turning Trump against the “deep state.” He's long disputed the conclusion that Putin and the Russian government aspired to help him win, believing it undermined the legitimacy of his 2016 victory. Ratcliffe was a member of that committee at the time, and FBI Director Kash Patel was a top aide on the panel. Ratcliffe's review last month did not dispute the intelligence community's finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. In an 11-page memo accompanying the declassified documents, Gabbard cites emails from intelligence officials and an earlier September 2016 intelligence assessment stating that foreign adversaries don't have the capability to “covertly overturn the vote outcome.” The memo points to talking points in December 2016 for then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, stating: “Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.” Gabbard's memo alleges that when the January 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian interference was released, it “falsely alleges, based in part on ‘further information' that had ‘come to light' since the election, that Putin directed an effort to help President Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.” Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the panel's investigation resulted in a “unanimous, bipartisan conclusion” that Putin interfered in 2016 to benefit Trump. “This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,” Warner said. This story has been updated with comment from an ODNI official.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced on Tuesday he would meet with Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information about the late sex offender's case. “President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. In 2022, Maxwell was found guilty of child sex trafficking and other crimes. Her attorney, David Oscar Markus, confirmed the meeting, telling CNN, “I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. Her lawyers argued she should not have been prosecuted because of a plea deal Epstein struck in Florida in 2008 with then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Alex Acosta, who later served in the first Trump administration. Her attorney recently said of Trump, “He's the ultimate deal-maker — and I'm sure he'd agree that when the United States gives its word, it should keep it. With all the talk about who's being prosecuted and who isn't, it's especially unfair that Ghislaine Maxwell remains in prison based on a promise the government made and broke.” The Trump administration has been scrambling over the Epstein files for over two weeks after the Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo that said Epstein did not have a client list and that he died in jail by suicide in 2019. The memo has sparked intense backlash from Trump supporters against high-ranking members of his administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who speculated for years about Epstein's death and his alleged client list. On Blanche's meeting with Maxwell, Patel said, “Get it.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Department of Labor is looking to repeal or rewrite 60 workplace requirements it calls “obsolete.” If approved, these wide-ranging rollbacks would affect working conditions in mines, minimum wage for home healthcare workers, and the standards on exposures to harmful materials. “The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, adding that it was the “most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.” Critics said cutting the rules would put workers at greater risk of harm. Adding, amending, or ending a rule typically has three stages: finding the authority to make, change, or delete a rule, giving notice of that rule to the public, and agency consideration after public comments. The Labor Department is proposing that about 3.7 million workers in home care be paid below the federal minimum wage, $7.25, and be made ineligible for overtime pay depending on state law. Another proposed change would eliminate protections for immigrant farm workers with H-2A visas. Last year, H-2A visa holders were given more legal protections, including shielding them from retaliation for actions like filing a complaint, testifying, or participating in an investigation, hearing, or proceeding. And with H-2A, it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,” Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice, told the Associated Press. The administration is also looking to limit the general duty clause, which allows the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when no specific standard is in place to cover a situation.</p>

Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Sa'ar also commended the decision, which he said "is a necessary step, designed to promote justice and Israel's right to fair treatment in the U.N. system, a right which has often been trampled due to politicization in this arena." "Singling out Israel and politicization by member states must end, in this and all professional U.N. agencies," Sa'ar added. Additionally, Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed his concerns about the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts, which he said would be "especially devastating" to the world's vulnerable populations, according to Reuters. U.S. State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce gestures as she holds her first press briefing at the State Department in Washington, D.C., March 6, 2025. State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on the exit that "continued involvement with UNESCO is not in the national interest of the United States." "UNESCO works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy," the statement read. "UNESCO's decision to admit the ‘State of Palestine' as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election on July 21, 2024, sending shockwaves through a race already upended by the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in, only to be beaten by Trump. This Washington Examiner series “Dropout,” will look at what happened on that day, the aftermath for Biden, and how Harris's future is up in the air. Part 2 looks at Biden's attempts to save his legacy since leaving the White House.Since leaving the White House, former President Joe Biden‘s attempts to shore up his legacy and defend himself against GOP attacks have been met with a mixed reception. Biden has largely hit back against reports that he and allies hid his declining mental and physical ailments from the public, reexamined his abrupt exit from the 2024 election, and criticized President Donald Trump‘s second administration. “I made every decision,” Biden said when asked about directing staff to use the autopen for clemency actions. In other previous remarks this month, Biden also bemoaned the GOP's effort to undo legislation he signed into law by passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. But whether Biden's comments are helping his case is unclear. I don't think it's a good idea that he's out there every day if that's going to be the case,” said Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist. Brad Bannon, another Democratic strategist, said of Biden: “It would be better for him to lay low.” “Giving an interview to the New York Times was a bad idea,” he continued. “Trump baits Biden into these things because he wants Biden to be in the limelight because he is more unpopular than Trump is, and there are very few people who can claim that distinction.” “That's incredibly concerning, and I can tell you, it's something this president would never tolerate.” House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) has asked several former Biden aides to testify in front of the committee over the autopen use and alleged cover-up of Biden's mental decline. Biden's former White House physician, Kevin O'Connor, also invoked the Fifth Amendment during his appearance. During a Juneteenth celebration, Biden knocked Trump over his efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Folks, the darkness can hide much but erase nothing.” A Special Prosecutor must be appointed,” he wrote on Truth Social. “This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! What this Crooked man, and his CORRUPT CRONIES, have done to our Country in 4 years, is grossly indescribable!” Kaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for former Vice President Kamala Harris and a 2016 Hillary Clinton staffer, defended Biden's right to speak publicly against reporters and critics who have accused him of hiding his mental decline after exiting the 2024 race. “In fairness, he did agree to step down and so in some sense he has, I think, every right to do that,” Shroff said. “And I think even folks that made that decision were pretty resentful at the time of how Biden was treated, both in the party and obviously externally. But I think him responding to these types of stories is expected, and I actually don't know that it really does much to move the needle.” Matt Dole, a Republican strategist, said Biden's more than half-century tenure as a politician likely plays into his desire to establish his credibility on the national stage. “But he should be mad at the Democratic Party. The Democrats hung him out to dry twice, once by ignoring the problems with Joe Biden and not dealing with it, and then, when they couldn't ignore it anymore, when not even the national liberal media would cover for them, they hung him out to dry.” In particular, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson's book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again may have been the most damning account against Biden. The party has not unified on whether it's better to embrace a centrist position or lean more into progressive policies to push back against the president and win back the American electorate. But some Democrats were wary of Biden's comments and called for him to “go away.” Cayce Myers, a professor at Virginia Tech's School of Communication, said Biden is in a tough position as Trump and the GOP continue to investigate him. “It's a catch-22 for Biden because if he doesn't respond or say anything about his legacy, that fuels this narrative about his inability to function and communicate, and it calls into question his cognitive abilities,” Myers said. “On the other hand, it does give fodder for the Republican Party and for President Trump, and they make his statements into political talking points that they can repackage for 2026 and beyond.” Former President Barack Obama was also met with criticism from Democrats angered over his comments at a New Jersey fundraiser calling for his party members to “toughen up.” The idea that the guy who was just president five seconds ago can't speak up, I think, is a little silly,” he also said. “And presidential legacy is not something that's an immediate item; it evolves. And sometimes the legacy does not materialize until decades later. And so I think that while it is probably self-fulfilling in some respects to defend his administration, I don't know, long term, what effect that has, if anything.”</p>

'The Cyberguy' Kurt Knutsson weighs in and shares his tips for avoiding new email 'unsubscribe' scams. The U.S. Air Force says the B-52 bomber that had a near miss with a Delta Airlines flight over North Dakota on Friday was flying an approved flight path at the time. Required checklists were completed, and the crew remained in contact with Minot Approach as it flew to its holding point 12 miles east of the fairgrounds. While holding, the B-52 crew communicated the flyover plan to both RAPCON and Minot International Airport's air traffic control tower," the Air Force said in a statement. "Minot Approach directed the B-52 crew at 7:43 p.m. to contact Minot International Airport's air traffic control. The pilot of a SkyWest Airlines flight operated by Delta Air Lines performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with the B-52. The pilot then explained the frightening incident to passengers in audio that went viral on social media. The flight was carrying passengers from Minneapolis to Minot, N.D. "SkyWest flight 3788, operating as Delta Connection from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Minot, North Dakota on July 18, landed safely in Minot after being cleared for approach by the tower but performed a go-around when another aircraft became visible in their flight path," a spokesperson for SkyWest said in a statement to FOX Business. A video posted on social media appeared to include audio of the pilot explaining what happened to passengers. I don't know how fast they were going, but they were a lot faster than us. I felt it was the safest thing to do to turn behind it," the pilot said in the video that has now gone viral. "So sorry about the aggressive maneuver. It caught me by surprise," he continued. "This is not normal at all. I don't know why they didn't give us a heads-up, because the Air Force base does have radar ... long story short, it was not fun, but I do apologize for it, and thank you for understanding. Not a fun day at work." Fox News' Landon Mion contributed to this report Anders Hagstrom is a reporter with Fox News Digital covering national politics and major breaking news events.

Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley tells Fox News Digital touts that ‘we're seeing very robust fundraising here at the RNC' FIRST ON FOX: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Tuesday launched billboards outside three rural hospitals that Democrats say are closing or cutting back services due to President Donald Trump's recently signed domestic policy package. The DNC says it placed billboards in Silex, Missouri; Stillwell, Oklahoma; and Missoula, Montana, to make sure that rural voters, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in last year's presidential election, "know who is responsible for gutting rural health care." The billboards were shared first with Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning. The DNC is targeting rural voters with new billboards in Missouri, Oklahoma, and Montana, blaming Trump's ‘Big Beautiful Bill' for hospital closures and cuts to health services. The measure is stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. By making his first-term tax rates permanent — they were set to expire later this year — the bill will cut taxes by nearly $4.4 trillion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And the new law also restructures Medicaid — the almost 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans. President Trump celebrates signing the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill' into law on July 4, 2025 — a sweeping policy package Democrats claim guts rural health care services. The changes to Medicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage. Democrats, for months, have repeatedly blasted Republicans over the social safety net changes. And they spotlighted a slew of national polls last month and this month that indicate the bill's popularity in negative territory. "Rural hospitals were already on the brink of collapse thanks to Donald Trump, but now he has put the last nail in the coffin for rural hospitals with his billionaire budget bill," DNC chair Ken Martin argued in a statement to Fox News. DNC Chair Ken Martin is leading the charge against Trump's domestic policy package, accusing Republicans of abandoning rural Americans by slashing Medicaid funding. Martin highlighted that "in states across the country, hospitals are either closing their doors or cutting critical services, and it's Trump's own voters who will suffer the most. This is what Donald Trump does — screw over the people who are counting on him." Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Michael Whatley, in an interview with Fox News Digital last week, spotlighted that "if you take a look at the Medicaid side of this conversation, the fact is that we're going to be moving illegal aliens off of Medicaid. Those are things that absolutely need to happen." Included in the megabill is a $60 billion fund, named the Rural Health Transformation Program, which Republicans say would offset cuts to Medicaid and would also help overcome long-standing health disparities that rural communities have faced. But the DNC says their new analysis "shows this funding was never going to be enough to make a difference." And the DNC points to a non-partisan breakdown of the new law, which says that half of the rural hospital funding will be split evenly among all states that apply, regardless of need. Both parties see the "big, beautiful bill" as a key part of their messaging heading into next year's midterm elections, when the Republicans will be defending their slim majorities in the House and Senate.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The Black civil rights movement's greatest legal achievement is now on a Republican Supreme Court's chopping block. The Voting Rights Act was one of the Black civil rights movement's signature accomplishments, and is widely considered one of the most consequential laws in American history because it was extraordinarily successful in ending Jim Crow restrictions on voting. Just two years after it became law, for example, Black voter registration rates in the former Jim Crow stronghold of Mississippi rose from 6.7 percent to nearly 60 percent. The two Republicans' decision in Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe attempts to strip private litigants of their ability to enforce the law, which bans race discrimination in elections. As federal Judge Lavenski Smith noted in a 2023 opinion, over the past 40 years various plaintiffs have brought 182 successful lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act. Only 15 of these suits were brought solely by the DOJ. Turtle Mountain arises on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices decide on an expedited basis. The idea that the Voting Rights Act is virtually unenforceable — and that, somehow, no one noticed this fact for four decades — appears to originate from Justice Neil Gorsuch, who suggested that the law may be a near-nullity in a 2021 concurring opinion. Ironically, less than a month ago, Gorsuch authored the Court's majority opinion in Medina v. Planned Parenthood, which cuts against his own attack on the law. Still, Gorsuch may ultimately prevail in his attack on this landmark law. Gorsuch's Medina opinion did not just narrow the rights of private litigants to bring suits enforcing federal law; it appeared to overrule the Court's two-year-old opinion in Health and Hospital Corporation v. Talevski (2023), which read the rights of private litigants much more expansively. Unlike Talevski, the Medina lawsuit was brought by Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider that Republicans love to hate. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Republican justices deactivated a core provision of the law, which required states with a history of racist election practices to “preclear” any new election laws with federal officials before they took effect. Other Supreme Court decisions have written arbitrary limits into the Voting Right Act that appear nowhere in the law's text, such as legal protection for voting restrictions that were commonplace in 1982. Turtle Mountain is a dispute about what are known as “implied causes of action.” There are many federal laws that do not state explicitly that they can be enforced through private lawsuits, but that nonetheless are understood to permit such suits. For many years, the Court applied a strong presumption that federal laws must be enforceable. As the Court moved rightward, it started announcing increasingly more restrictive rules governing when federal laws could be enforced through private suits. In its 2023 Talevski decision, however, the Court finally seemed to settle on a rule that would govern these sorts of cases moving forward. Under Talevski, a federal law may be enforced by private litigants if it is “‘phrased in terms of the persons benefited' and contains ‘rights-creating,' individual-centric language with an ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited class. Thus, for example, a law stating that “no state may prevent a hungry person from eating French fries” would be enforceable through private-person lawsuits, because the law's text focuses on the people who benefit from it (people who are hungry). A similar statute saying that “states shall not impede access to fried potatoes” would not be enforceable, because it lacks the “individual-centric language” demanded by Talevski. Two years later, however, in Medina, the Supreme Court considered a federal law that permits “any individual eligible for medical assistance” under Medicaid to choose their own health provider. South Carolina violated this law by forbidding Medicaid patients from choosing Planned Parenthood as their health provider, but the Republican justices declared that this law is unenforceable — despite the fact that it is “phrased in terms of the persons benefited” as Talevski demands. Unlike Talevski, it does not state a clear legal rule explaining when federal laws are enforceable. It doesn't even quote Talveski's language about laws “phrased in terms of the persons benefited.” (Talevski involved several provisions of federal Medicaid law that protect nursing home residents, including a provision that protects the “right to be free from” physical or drug-induced restraints.) So, even under the silly standard that Gorsuch appeared to lay out in his Medina opinion, the Voting Rights Act may be enforced through private lawsuits. Congress could not possibly have known in 1965, when it enacted the Voting Rights Act, that the Supreme Court would declare decades later that statutes must have “individual-centric language” or they cannot be enforced by private litigants. Nor could it have known that, not long thereafter, the Supreme Court would hand down another decision that seems to scrap the Talevski rule and replace it with a new one that requires Congress to use the magic word “right.” Similarly, as the Turtle Mountain plaintiffs point out in their brief to the justices, “from 1982 through August 2024, ‘private plaintiffs have been party to 96.4% of Section 2 claims that produced published opinions … and the sole litigants in 86.7% of these decisions. '” None of the courts that decided these cases could have anticipated Gorsuch's logic in Medina. Senate Republicans are taking an enormous risk with the federal bench right now. Trying to keep track of all the chaos is overwhelming. So here's a one-stop guide to the turmoil this Court caused. The Republican justices' decision fundamentally altered how public schools must operate.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones — a record. Some experts say that number could soon top 1,000 a day. The spike comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has given Russia until early September to reach a ceasefire or face new sanctions -– a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible on Ukraine. Russia has sharply increased its drone output and appears to keep ramping it up. The Russian Defense Ministry says it's turning its drone force into a separate military branch. Other modifications include making it more jamming-resistant and able to carry powerful thermobaric warheads. The original Shahed and its Russian replica — called “Geran,” or “geranium” — have an engine to propel it at 180 kph (just over 110 mph). A faster jet version is reportedly in the works. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted that cooperation with China has allowed Russia to bypass Western sanctions on imports of electronics for drone production. Ukraine's military intelligence estimates that Russia receives up to 65% of components for its Geran drones from China. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production. We are ready for it,” said plant director Timur Shagivaleyev, adding it produces all components, including engines and electronics, and has its own training school. The report showed hundreds of black Geran drones stacked in an assembly shop decorated with Soviet-style posters. One featured images of the father of the Soviet nuclear bomb, Igor Kurchatov, legendary Soviet space program chief, Sergei Korolyov, and dictator Josef Stalin, with the words: “Kurchatov, Korolyov and Stalin live in your DNA.” In this photo taken from video distributed by Russian Defense Ministry Press Service on July 18, 2025, Russian soldiers prepare a strike drone aircraft to fly toward Ukrainian positions in an undisclosed location. The Russian military has improved its tactics, increasingly using decoy drones named “Gerbera” for a type of daisy. By using large numbers of drones in one attack, Russia seeks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and keep them from targeting more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles that Moscow often uses alongside the drones to hit targets like key infrastructure facilities, air defense batteries and air bases. Former Russian Defense Ministry press officer Mikhail Zvinchuk, who runs a popular war blog, noted the Russian military has learned to focus on a few targets to maximize the impact. The drones can roam Ukraine's skies for hours, zigzagging past defenses, he wrote. “Our defense industries' output allows massive strikes on practically a daily basis without the need for breaks to accumulate the necessary resources,” said another military blogger, Alexander Kots. “We no longer spread our fingers but hit with a punching fist in one spot to make sure we hit the targets.” Ukraine relies on mobile teams armed with machine guns as a low-cost response to the drones to spare the use of expensive Western-supplied air defense missiles. It also has developed interceptor drones and is working to scale up production, but the steady rise in Russian attacks is straining its defenses. Despite international sanctions and a growing load on its economy, Russia's military spending this year has risen 3.4% over 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which estimated it at the equivalent of about $200 billion. Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered to the military last year, said President Vladimir Putin. Frontelligence Insight, a Ukraine-based open-source intelligence organization, reported this month that Russia launched more than 28,000 Shahed and Geran drones since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, with 10% of the total fired last month alone. CSIS called them ”the most cost-effective munition in Russia's firepower strike arsenal.” Over the weekend, German Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding said in an interview that Russia aims for a capability of launching 2,000 drones in one attack. Once drones became available in big numbers, the military moved last fall to put those units under a single command. Russia has increasingly focused on battlefield drones that use thin fiber optic cables, making them immune to jamming and have an extended range of 25 kilometers (over 15 miles). It also has set up Rubicon, a center to train drone operators and develop the best tactics. Such fiber optic drones used by both sides can venture deeper into rear areas, targeting supply, support and command structures that until recently were deemed safe. Michael Kofman, a military expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russian advancements have raised new defensive challenges for Ukraine. “The Ukrainian military has to evolve ways of protecting the rear, entrenching at a much greater depth,” Kofman said in a recent podcast.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Martin Luther King Jr.'s two living children are urging people to tread lightly with a newly released trove of records related to their father's assassination. Ralph Abernathy, right, and Bishop Julian Smith, left, flank Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., during a civil rights march in Memphis, Tenn., March 28, 1968. Martin Luther King Jr., head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaks to thousands during his “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Aug. 28, 1963, in Washington. ▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration In a lengthy statement released Monday, King's two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, said their father's killing has been a “captivating public curiosity for decades.” But the pair emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that the files “be viewed within their full historical context.” Martin Luther King Jr., head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, speaks to thousands during his “I Have a Dream” speech at the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, Aug. 28, 1963, in Washington. Those efforts continued even as the government granted public access. It was not immediately clear whether the documents shed new light on King's life, the Civil Rights Movement or his murder. “As the children of Dr. King and Mrs. Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met -- an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continuing grief.” They also repeated the family's long-held contention that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all. She praised President Donald Trump for pushing the issue. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy's and MLK's 1968 assassinations. The announcement from Gabbard's office included a statement from Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, who is an outspoken conservative and has broken from King's children on various topics — including the FBI files. Alveda King said she was “grateful to President Trump” for his “transparency.” Besides fulfilling Trump's order, the latest release means another alternative headline for the president as he tries to mollify supporters angry over his administration's handling of records concerning the sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself behind bars while awaiting trial in 2019, during Trump's first presidency. Trump last Friday ordered the Justice Department to release grand jury testimony but stopped short of unsealing the entire case file. But Bernice King later posted on her personal Instagram account a black-and-white photo of her father, looking annoyed, with the caption “Now, do the Epstein files.” And some civil rights activists did not spare the president. “This righteous work should be our collective response to renewed attention on the assassination of a great purveyor of true peace.” The King records were initially intended to be sealed until 2027, until Justice Department attorneys asked a federal judge to lift the sealing order early. Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents for new information about his assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. The group, along with King's family, argued that the FBI illegally surveilled King and other civil rights figures, hoping to discredit them and their movement. It has long been established that then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was intensely interested if not obsessed with King and others he considered radicals. FBI records released previously show how Hoover's bureau wiretapped King's telephone lines, bugged his hotel rooms and used informants to gather information, including evidence of King's extramarital affairs. “He was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” the King children said in their statement. “The intent ... was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle and destroy Dr. King's reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continued. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth — undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.” Opposition to King intensified even after the Civil Rights Movement compelled Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. After those victories, King turned his attention to economic justice and international peace. He criticized rapacious capitalism and the Vietnam War. King asserted that political rights alone were not enough to ensure a just society. Many establishment figures like Hoover viewed King as a communist threat. King was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice. King family members and others have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the probe to be reopened, and in 1998, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new look. Reno's Justice Department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr. King.” In their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. “As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.” Associated Press journalist Safiyah Riddle contributed from Montgomery, Alabama.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Microsoft company logo is displayed at their offices in Sydney, Australia, on Feb. 3, 2021. NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft has issued an emergency fix to close off a vulnerability in Microsoft's widely-used SharePoint software that hackers have exploited to carry out widespread attacks on businesses and at least some U.S. government agencies. The company issued an alert to customers Saturday saying it was aware of the zero-day exploit being used to conduct attacks and that it was working to patch the issue. Microsoft updated its guidance Sunday with instructions to fix the problem for SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working on a fix for the older SharePoint Server 2016 software. Security researchers warn that the exploit, reportedly known as “ToolShell,” is a serious one and can allow actors to fully access SharePoint file systems, including services connected to SharePoint, such as Teams and OneDrive. Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned that the vulnerability may allow bad actors to “bypass future patching.” Eye Security said in its blog post that it scanned over 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and discovered that at least dozens of systems were compromised. Microsoft said the vulnerability affects only on-site SharePoint servers used within businesses or organizations, and does not affect Microsoft's cloud-based SharePoint Online service. But Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, warns that the exploit still leaves many potentially exposed to bad actors. “While cloud environments remain unaffected, on-prem SharePoint deployments — particularly within government, schools, health care including hospitals, and large enterprise companies — are at immediate risk.” The vulnerability targets SharePoint server software so customers of that product will want to immediately follow Microsoft's guidance to patch their on-site systems. “We are urging organizations who are running on-prem SharePoint to take action immediately and apply all relevant patches now and as they become available, rotate all cryptographic material, and engage professional incident response. An immediate, band-aid fix would be to unplug your Microsoft SharePoint from the internet until a patch is available,” Sikorski advises.</p>
