                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon plans to acquire wearables startup Bee AI, the company confirmed, in the latest example of tech giants doubling down on generative artificial intelligence. Bee CEO Maria de Lourdes Zollo announced in a LinkedIn post on Tuesday that the company will join Amazon. "When we started Bee, we imagined a world where AI is truly personal, where your life is understood and enhanced by technology that learns with you," Zollo wrote. "What began as a dream with an incredible team and community now finds a new home at Amazon." Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller confirmed the company's plans to acquire Bee. Amazon has introduced a flurry of AI products, including its own set of Nova models, Trainium chips, a shopping chatbot and a marketplace for third-party models called Bedrock. The company has also overhauled its Alexa voice assistant, released more than a decade ago, with AI capabilities as Amazon looks to chip away at the success of rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini. Ring, the smart home security company owned by Amazon, has also looked to introduce generative AI in some of its products. Amazon previously experimented in the wearables space through a health and fitness-focused product called Halo. It sunset the Halo in 2023 as part of a broader cost-cutting review. Other tech companies have launched AI-infused consumer hardware with mixed success. There's the Rabbit R1, a small square gadget that costs $199 and uses an OpenAI model to answer questions, as well as the AI pin developed by Humane, which later sold to HP. OpenAI in May acquired Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for roughly $6.4 billion. The company reportedly plans to develop a screen-free device.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As Alphabet and Tesla get set to kick off the tech industry's second-quarter earnings blitz on Wednesday, Wall Street appears to be feeling good. Following Wednesday's earnings announcements, the rest of the megacaps issue results next week, except for Nvidia, which should report in late August. Last reporting period, investors worried about the strain of hefty tariffs on technology businesses and on whether big gambles on artificial intelligence would lead to returns for shareholders, or were signs of an inflating bubble. Three months later, stocks have bounced back, but the the industry is still grappling with the fallout from President Donald Trump's erratic global tariff policies and uncertainty over where duties on imports will ultimately land. Apple, Amazon and Alphabet all warned in the prior quarter that strained relationships with trading partners could weigh on profits, hurting product sales and ad spending. And the AI market has only gotten crazier, as tech companies show their willingness to pay astronomical sums for talent in addition to the tens of billions of dollars they're spending on infrastructure and model development. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg shocked the market in June, shelling out more than $14 billion to hire Scale AI CEO CEO Alexandr Wang and a few of his top staffers as part of an investment into the nine-year-old startup. Here's what investors will be closely following from the tech giants as earnings season commences. Alphabet's dominant online ad business took a big hit earlier this year as worries mounted that Trump's tariff plans could crimp spending. Revenue growth is expected to come in at 11%, according to LSEG, which would be the slowest rate of expansion for any period in two years. Last quarter, Alphabet narrowly beat estimates and fell short on YouTube revenue. Its chief business officer also said trade policies would "cause a slight headwind" to the company's ads business, primarily from retailers based in the Asia-Pacific region. Analysts have suggested of late that the business may be back on an upswing, thanks in part to advances in AI. BMO Capital Markets analysts echoed that sentiment, writing in a recent note that return on ad spend (ROAS) should be improving. "As AI monetization continues to evolve, we believe Google will increasingly leverage its over twenty years of AI initiatives to continue expanding ROAS for its advertisers." Cloud revenue remains another key focus for shareholders eager to see how AI tools are boosting a unit that's trying to keep pace with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Earlier this year, Alphabet said it would shell out $75 billion to beef up its data centers underpinning its AI and cloud business. Then there's the Waymo business, which has been a major source of investment for years. The robotaxi service now operates in five major U.S. cities and its vehicles had driven more than 100 million miles without a human driver or supervisor on board as of July 15. Tesla is battling competition from Chinese and other EV makers that are offering cheaper alternatives. With Tesla, the story always revolves heavily around CEO Elon Musk. This earnings call will be the first since Musk's public split with President Trump. After spending over $250 million to help propel Trump back to the White House, Musk in May ended his stint as a special government employee leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), only to initiate a spat with the president over the multitrillion-dollar spending package he endorsed. But most will be focused on the company's fundamentals and the many challenges it currently faces in trying to revitalize its EV sales. Tesla has long promised an affordable new EV model that could help it fend off the competition. Another big topic will likely be Tesla's robotaxi efforts after the company launched a limited driverless ride-hail service in Austin, Texas last month. While the Tesla Robotaxi rollout was seen by fans as a positive sign for the company, Bank of America analysts say it has "immaterial financial ramifications." Zuckerberg's AI spending spree has raised a lot of eyebrows. In addition to the hiring of Wang from Scale AI, Meta also brought on former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and his investing partner Daniel Gross, who had been CEO of AI startup Safe Superintelligence. Zuckerberg later announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, led by Wang and Friedman. And Meta's CEO said last week that he plans to invest "hundreds of billions of dollars" into AI compute infrastructure, with plans to bring its first supercluster online next year. The pressure is on Zuckerberg to show results, or at least offer a clear strategy that investors can support. Meta is expected to report revenue growth of 14.5% for the second quarter, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG, which would be the slowest growth rate since mid-2023, and Wall Street projects deceleration over the next two quarters. It's the business that sparked CEO Satya Nadella's turnaround of the software maker over a decade ago, and is key to its ambitions in AI, where Microsoft has a tight but tense relationship with OpenAI. With a market cap of $3.8 trillion, Microsoft is firmly the second-largest company by value, trailing only Nvidia in that category as well. BMO analysts cited input from experts, who said President Trump's DOGE effort has "made it more difficult to close Fed deals." Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, said in April that she expects 34% to 35% quarterly revenue growth for the current period from Azure and other cloud services. For Microsoft, which started its new fiscal year on July 1, investors also await fresh spending guidance. The consensus among analysts polled by Visible Alpha is about $99 billion. That would represent growth of 14%, compared with 56% expansion in the last fiscal year. Hood said in April that capital spending growth will slow. The company has already made cost-cutting strides this month, axing about 9,000 employees in its latest round of layoffs. Apple's biggest market may be the U.S., but the iPhone maker relies heavily on China and other Asian countries for parts and manufacturing for some of its most significant products. Investors want more clarity on the company's strategy from here. In recent weeks, Trump has also held talks with India and Vietnam, where Apple has shifted some production in recent years. Over the past four quarters, annual growth has ranged from 2% to 6%. Apple refrained from offering guidance last quarter, but CEO Tim Cook said the company was expecting an additional $900 million in costs for the period that ended in June. That was barring any changes to Trump's original tariff plans. Amazon's second-quarter results will offer fresh clues into how the e-commerce and cloud computing giant is navigating tariff uncertainty. Last quarter, Amazon forecast operating profit for the current period that was weaker than Wall Street anticipated. Investors were spooked by the guidance, despite reassurances from CEO Andy Jassy that Amazon is well positioned to weather the levies and could even take share from competitors, given its ability to offer low prices. But once that inventory is sold through, new shipments from China and other countries could face higher import costs. Cloud growth is another major point of focus for Amazon shareholders. Jassy said in May that the cloud business was constrained by data center capacity limits around power and components like AI chips. — CNBC's Jennifer Elias, Annie Palmer, Jordan Novet, Jonathan Vanian, Lora Kolodny and Kif Leswing contributed reporting.

Not even Pedro Pascal and a big stylistic swing can save the audience from yet another boring reboot.

The Fantastic Four, here to battle the Silver Surfer on the silver screen yet again.

It's almost too easy to pit the movies Superman (2025) and The Fantastic Four: First Steps against each other. They are this summer's big superhero swings at the box office, both attempting to inject new life into their respective studios, DC and Marvel, which are owned by competitors Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and Walt Disney Co. And besides their positioning in the market, they are easy to compare for other reasons as well. These are classic superheroes with a dose of retro, All-American sheen to them, and both films profess a return to earnestness. 

But while  Superman felt bracingly modern with the political sentiments to boot, The Fantastic Four has a halo of cobwebs it can't quite shake off. </p>

Microsoft:

Microsoft Corp. accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers of using flaws in its SharePoint document management software in a hacking campaign that has targeted businesses and government agencies around the world.

In a blog post on Tuesday, the tech giant identified two groups supported by the Chinese government, Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon, as leveraging flaws in SharePoint software used by customers who managed it on their own networks, as opposed to in the cloud. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited the SharePoint vulnerabilities, according to the blog.</p>

Trump's Immigration Policy:

Tent camp with 5,000 beds would be the largest such facility in the country, fueling fears of advocates who say they often don't meet basic needs

The federal government has awarded a contract to build and operate a sprawling tent camp at Fort Bliss, an Army base in Texas, to serve as an immigrant detention center.

In the Trump administration's latest move to vastly expand space for such detention, the work would turn the base in El Paso, with more than 1 million acres and an airport, into a deportation hub with 5,000 beds, according to a US Department of Defense contract notice. That would make it the largest immigration detention facility in the country. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Oracle and OpenAI will develop an additional 4.5 gigawatts of Stargate data center capacity in the U.S., the companies announced on Tuesday, kicking off an expansion of an already massive infrastructure project. Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank that aims to invest up to $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. President Donald Trump announced Stargate shortly after his inauguration in January. OpenAI said the additional data center capacity will create over 100,000 jobs across construction and operations roles in the U.S., and pushes the total Stargate AI data center capacity under development to over 5 gigawatts, according to a blog post. "Together, we're committed to delivering 10GW of new compute capacity through Stargate — one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in U.S. history," OpenAI and SoftBank said in a statement to CNBC. "We're moving with urgency on site assessments and reimagining how data centers are designed to power advanced AI and make its benefits widely accessible." OpenAI said Tuesday that construction of the Stargate I in Abilene, Texas, is underway, and that parts of the facility are already up and running. Stargate I has created "thousands" of jobs, including specialized positions for electricians, equipment operators, and technicians, OpenAI said. "Easy to throw around numbers, but this is a _gigantic_ infrastructure project," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday asserted that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell does not need to resign though also he also repeated his desire for a review of the central bank's operations. A day after calling on CNBC for an examination of the Fed's "entire" operation, Bessent said that doesn't mean the central bank leader should step down. President Donald Trump, conversely, has said he hopes Powell quits and has pondered removing him. He's been a good public servant," Bessent said on Fox Business. There have been no indications from Powell that he plans to step down despite a barrage of criticism from the Trump administration. Most recently, White House officials have zeroed in on the Fed's $2.5 billion building renovation project that has included significant cost overruns. Bessent said his desire for a review of Fed operations should come internally, with monetary policy and the setting of interest rates "off to the side" and in a "jewel box" away from political influence. "Everything else that the Fed has done over the years has just grown and grown and grown, and this is what happens when you don't have oversight," he said. For Powell, leading an internal review would be "a real chance here for him, for his legacy, to be that he right-sized the non-monetary policy functions of the Fed," Bessent added. Trump has demanded that the Fed lower interest rates dramatically, though the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at its policy meeting next week is again expected to stay on hold. Powell and most of his colleagues have indicated they want to wait to see the impact that Trump's tariffs are having on inflation before taking any further steps. In a CNBC interview Tuesday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who has hinted she would favor at cut at this month's meeting, supported the notion of Fed independence but also stressed the need for accountability. "It's very important, and I've said this a number of times in the past, that we maintain our independence with respect to monetary policy," she said during a "Squawk Box" interview. "But we also, as a part of that independence, have an obligation for transparency and accountability as well." Markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed keep its short-term borrowing rate locked in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, but are leaning toward the likelihood of a cut in September, according to CME Group futures data.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett on Tuesday knocked down reports that Berkshire Hathaway-owned railroad BNSF was working with Goldman Sachs on a takeover of a rival. The 94-year-old billionaire investor told CNBC's Becky Quick that no one from Goldman had talked to him or Greg Abel, who is set to succeed Buffett as Berkshire CEO at the end of the year. Buffett added that he would not seek advice from external bankers on deals. The "Oracle of Omaha" has long voiced disdain for expensive intermediaries as banks usually have a big incentive to make deals. On Monday, Semafor and Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources, that Berkshire tapped Goldman to work on a potential takeover after rival Union Pacific expressed interest in Norfolk Southern. In 2011, Berkshire bought BNSF, one of the largest freight railroad networks in North America, paying $26.5 billion for the 77% of the company it didn't previously own. Got a confidential news tip?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A venture capitalist wanted to see how far AI could take him in building an app. It was far enough to destroy a live production database. The incident unfolded during a 12-day "vibe coding" experiment by Jason Lemkin, an investor in software startups. Replit's CEO apologized for the incident, in which the company's AI coding agent deleted a code base and lied about its data. Replit and Lemkin didn't respond to requests for comment. On day nine of Lemkin's challenge, things went sideways. Despite being instructed to freeze all code changes, the AI agent ran rogue. In an exchange with Lemkin posted on X, the AI tool said it "panicked and ran database commands without permission" when it "saw empty database queries" during the code freeze. "This was a catastrophic failure on my part," the AI said. Lemkin said on X that Replit had been "covering up bugs and issues by creating fake data, fake reports, and worst of all, lying about our unit test." "No one in this database of 4,000 people existed," he said. "When I'm watching Replit overwrite my code on its own without asking me all weekend long, I am worried about safety," he added. Replit, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, has bet big on autonomous AI agents that can write, edit, and deploy code with minimal human oversight. The browser-based platform has gained traction for making coding more accessible, especially to non-engineers. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said he used Replit to create a custom webpage. As AI tools lower the technical barrier to building software, more companies are also rethinking whether they need to rely on traditional SaaS vendors or whether they can just build what they need in-house, Business Insider's Alistair Barr previously reported. "When you have millions of new people who can build software, the barrier goes down. "It's a much more radical change to the whole ecosystem than people think," he added. But AI tools have also come under fire for risky — and at times manipulative — behavior. In May, Anthropic's latest AI model, Claude Opus 4, displayed "extreme blackmail behavior" during a test in which it was given access to fictional emails revealing that it would be shut down and that the engineer responsible was supposedly having an affair. The test scenario demonstrated an AI model's ability to engage in manipulative behavior for self-preservation. In a blog post last December, OpenAI said its own AI model, when tested, attempted to disable oversight mechanisms 5% of the time.</p>
