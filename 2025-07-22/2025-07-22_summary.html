Malnutrition and food insecurity are set to soar among vulnerable older populations due to aid cuts in Trump's budget.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

It's 100 degrees on a late Tuesday in June, but 79-year-old Elisabeth — she asked that her surname not be used to protect her privacy — is in line at St. Patrick's Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, waiting to get a bag of groceries.

“I don't have enough comida (food),” she tells Truthout in a mix of English and Spanish. “You know, leche (milk), pan (bread), pollo (chicken), cereal —everything es muy caro (very expensive).”

Her rent, she says, is $1,200 a month, and she pays approximately $300 per month for electricity, gas, phone, and internet service. The total, she adds, exceeds her monthly income: a $229 retirement pension from her job as an office assistant and $849 in Social Security. “My daughter has to help me, but it's hard for her, so I come to the church every week to get what I can —a container of milk, pasta, bread, and maybe a package of meat. It helps.”

Like Elisabeth, 74-year-old Lin — she, too, asked not to disclose her surname — has trouble making ends meet, but she goes to a senior center in her New York City neighborhood almost every weekday for a meal. She's been doing this since 2011. “We're a family here, and if I have a problem, there's someone to help me,” she told Truthout. “If it's something small, there's always someone sitting near me to make me laugh and remind me not to take my troubles too seriously. If it's a big problem, I can go upstairs to see a worker who will help me figure out what to do.”

The center, she says, asks for a voluntary contribution of $2 per meal. “It's a good, square, balanced lunch,” Lin says.

Lin says that the combination of camaraderie and affordability will keep her coming back to the center for as long as she's physically able. “My income — a $1,400 Social Security check and a pension of slightly more than $300 a month — doesn't leave much left over. My rent is $1,000 and I have to pay for utilities and a phone,” she says. “So many of us seniors live doubled-up or in substandard housing. We deserve better, but the government, and Donald Trump in particular, treat us like garbage.” 

Low-income seniors and their advocates agree and say that pending cuts to food and nutrition programs — including funding for meals at senior centers, and cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Meals on Wheels —will increase hunger and malnutrition. 

Both are already big problems. 

According to Feeding America, a national network of food banks and pantries, food insecurity is nothing new, and even before Trump's Big Bad Bill championed slashing social welfare spending, 6.9 million people over the age of 65 faced hunger in the U.S. The group estimates that in 2022, one in 11 people aged 60 and older, and one in eight between the ages of 50 and 59, lacked adequate food. 

Part of the reason is poverty, but isolation, the inability to shop or cook, trouble chewing and swallowing, cognitive decline, depression, a diminished sense of smell and/or taste, and the side effects of medication can also contribute to malnutrition in American seniors. These factors, in concert with economic precarity, make it difficult for many elders to remain healthy and well-nourished.

But money, unsurprisingly, is crucial to eating well, and many seniors like Elisabeth and Lin have too little of it.

According to the Social Security Administration, as of May 2025, the average monthly Social Security payment was $2,002. Millions, however, are ineligible for retirement benefits and instead rely on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a benefit provided to disabled people who did not work for the required 40 quarters needed to collect Social Security. Their monthly benefits amount to $967 for individuals and $1,450 for couples. More than 2 million adults over 65 receive SSI, with 39 percent living below the poverty line.     

“Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP don't just harm individuals. They impact whole communities.”

Pre-Trump, even the federal government recognized the toll of poverty on older people's quality of life. A July 2024 report issued by the National Institute on Aging, a department of the National Institutes of Health, noted that over the past two decades, “food insecurity among families that include adults over the age of 60 had almost doubled, affecting nearly 25 percent of such families.” The report further acknowledged that hunger and lack of access to nutritious food has had a disproportionate impact on Black, Brown and Indigenous households.

And it's likely to get much worse.

Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, told Truthout that since Trump took office in January, $1.5 billion has been cut in assistance to food banks and pantries, including a $130 million administrative cut to the 43-year-old Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency food and shelter program. 

“They are working to make the ‘Golden Years' the ‘Hungry Years,'” he said. “Seniors used to be the third rail of American politics, but that rule is no longer sacrosanct. I think that Congressmembers who support these cuts are following their leader off a cliff. They apparently want seniors, children, and veterans to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.”

Markell Lewis Miller has seen the impact of these cuts directly. As the director of community food programs at Food Gatherers, a food bank in Washtenaw County, Michigan, she oversaw the distribution of 9.9 million pounds of food to hungry Michiganders in 2024, many of them seniors. 

But two months into the Trump administration, the organization's food supply took a tremendous hit.

“The U.S. Department of Agriculture is one of the largest sources of food for us, through the emergency food assistance program,” Miller told Truthout. “In March of this year, there was an administrative action, and with no warning whatsoever, we experienced a cut, by half, of what we used to get through the [emergency food assistance] program. This amounts to 15 percent of the food we give out annually. Short-term, we've used our reserve funds and fundraised to generate money to purchase food to replace what was lost.”

The impact, she says, has been severe. According to Miller, prior to the cut, Food Gatherers spent approximately $4 million a year purchasing food. Replacing lost items from the Department of Agriculture, she says, will require them to spend an additional $2.5 million, money that will have to be raised through philanthropic and individual donations.

Other issues also have staff worried. “Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP don't just harm individuals. They impact whole communities,” Miller says. “Grocery stores will see their sales plummet and some will close; people will also see their health decline if they lose access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food, which can lead to malnutrition.” The cascading impact, she adds, can lead to calcium and vitamin deficiencies, as well as health issues such as depression, cognitive disorders, slower wound healing, loss of muscle mass, and frailty syndrome.

“Every dollar matters to people on fixed incomes,” she says.

What's more, Miller and her colleagues worry that the imposition of work requirements on older SNAP recipients will further restrict access to healthy meals.

Gina Plato-Nino, deputy director of SNAP programs at the Food Research & Action Center, sees the proposed work requirements — a mandate that SNAP recipients work a minimum of 80 hours a month until they reach age 64 — as a way to thin the rolls. “Failure to secure work will mean that people can only receive SNAP for three months in a three-year period,” she told Truthout. “But this requirement does not come with a job offer or transportation to and from a job. People who live in areas, particularly rural areas, where few jobs exist, or who are grandparents doing unpaid (but essential) child care, will not be exempted. Raising the threshold from age 54, which it has been since 1996, does not take these realities into account.” 

“Right now, 12,000 people a day are turning 65, and we have not created the infrastructure to support them.”

Other changes to SNAP will also have a deleterious impact, Plato-Nino says. “Previously, if you had a child under 18 in the household, you were exempted from the work rules. Now, the House version of the bill exempts only those people with a child under 7. They also want to exclude the cost of internet service when calculating SNAP eligibility. People with kids in school and folks with disabilities will be particularly harmed by getting rid of this deduction since they have to have the internet in their homes to function.”

Plato-Nino sounds furious as she speaks. “These changes are meant to give a tax cut to the top 1 percent,” she says. “For seniors who worked incredibly hard their whole lives, finding a part-time job is often impossible, and if they fail, they'll lose their access to food. It's cruel. In addition, many seniors own their own homes, but they're still financially stressed because their property taxes have not stopped. Their fuel and utility costs have not stopped. Boilers break, and with climate change, people need air conditioners as well as heat. We know time limits on eligibility do not increase employment. But they do keep people off the program and scrambling to eat.”

Meals on Wheels, a national food delivery service (and congregate meal provider in some locales) has filled nutritional gaps for more than 70 years. Like SNAP, it is also on the chopping block. 

Josh Protas, the group's chief advocacy and policy officer, told Truthout that about 37 percent of funding for the 5,000 local Meals on Wheels programs that exist nationwide comes through the federal Older Americans Act. 

“About 90 percent of our programs get federal money, and many get half or more of their funding from federal social service block grants, community development block grants, or other federal funding streams, some of which are now threatened,” he says. “In some states, Medicaid has allowed special medically tailored meals to be reimbursed for people in renal failure or with heart conditions. In other places, SNAP can be used to make voluntary contributions to offset the cost of meals. We don't know if these specialized programs will survive.” 

All told, he says, Meals on Wheels provides food to about 2.2 million older adults annually. But this barely scratches the surface of need. “There are many older adults we're not reaching,” Protas says. “We estimate that at least 2.5 million low-income seniors are eligible for Meals on Wheels but are not served. One in three of our programs has a waiting list with waits ranging from a few months to years.” 

To tell an adult who is unable to leave their home that they have to wait is painful, he adds, “but it's even worse when an opening comes up and we discover that the person died while waiting.” 

In addition to providing food, Protas reports that Meals on Wheels provides a secondary function: assessing the meal recipient's living situation and providing a few minutes of conversation and social engagement each day.

“Right now, 12,000 people a day are turning 65, and we have not created the infrastructure to support them,” he says. “The needs of older adults do not get prioritized. Money from the federal government has always helped unlock philanthropic dollars, but the truth is that less than 1 percent of foundation grants go to seniors. People gravitate to causes benefiting kids and animals; older adults get second-tier consideration. Even more concerning, one of the fastest-growing unhoused populations is older people, folks who did what they could to earn a living and who still end up on the streets with nothing.” 

Cuts, he concludes, will exacerbate this shameful legacy.

But seniors, disabled adults, and their advocates are fighting back. Led by the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations and the Coalition on Human Needs, they are making their opposition to SNAP cuts, Medicaid cuts, and Medicare cuts loud and clear, as well as urging for support for national programs like Meals on Wheels and local food banks like Food Gatherers. In addition, an unprecedented coalition of state attorneys general, led by Washington, D.C.'s  Karl A. Racine and New York's Letitia James, have sued the administration to stop the SNAP cuts from taking effect.

“Many older Americans rely on Medicaid and if they slash it, people will have less money to pay for food and medicine,” Joel Berg of Hunger Free America predicts. “Imagine being 63. You've worked in a steel plant for 20 years. The plant closes and, because of age discrimination, you can't find another job. You will lose your SNAP benefits after three months and won't be eligible again for three years unless you find a 20-hour-a-week job. Seniors are being attacked from land, sea, and air, and these cuts are happening on top of significant cuts that have been imposed over the last few years. People are increasingly going hungry. The nonprofit sector is a bit shell-shocked, but people are pushing back and coalescing with farmers and the food industry to pressure lawmakers.”    

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Trump's firing of 1,300 DOE workers is bad news for all student loan recipients and K-12 students alike.

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! 

On July 14, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for President Donald Trump's administration to fire more than 1,300 workers at the Department of Education (DOE). The order, while not a final ruling on the legal merits of the case, lifted a district court injunction that had prevented Trump from gutting the federal agency. Now, while litigation plays out in the courts, the administration is free to move forward with its campaign promise to shut down the DOE — a cause conservatives have championed for more than four decades.

Truthout spoke with two education policy experts at nonprofit think tanks to learn more about how the mass layoffs at the DOE will immediately impact schools, teachers, and students' daily lives: Jon Valant, the director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at the Brookings Institution, where his research specializes in K-12 education policy, and Sara Partridge, the associate director of higher education at the Center for American Progress. The interview below has been lightly edited for clarity and concision.

The DOE now stands to be roughly half the size it was in 2024, thanks to a combination of layoffs and resignations. What do you foresee as the most immediate or urgent impacts of the Supreme Court order allowing the Trump administration's mass firings to continue?

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Sara Partridge: One area that the workforce reductions were largely concentrated in is the Office of Federal Student Aid, which administers grant, work study, and student loan programs for 9.9 million students each year. The Office of Federal Student Aid is responsible for processing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), disbursing student loan forms, managing repayment of student loans, and providing oversight and monitoring of all the parties that participate in the federal student aid program. They also provide information to students and families and help to resolve complaints and issues related to student loan servicing. These are important responsibilities that ensure students across the country can access postsecondary education and repay their loans, and that taxpayer dollars spent on financial aid go to programs that meet federal requirements. Student loan borrowers will in all likelihood face a reduced quality of service and more issues with student loan repayment in the coming months and years as a result of these changes.

Can you talk a little more about the issues that current and future student loan borrowers will face?

Sara Partridge: Many student loan borrowers in repayment are already in distress and facing the risk of default. One recent analysis found that as of April, 5.8 million or 31 percent of borrowers with a payment due are in late stage delinquency, or more than 90 days past due on payments. Once payments are 270 days late, the borrower enters default and collections may begin. As many as 1.8 million could reach default status in July, 1 million in August, and 2 million in September, the study estimated. Already, borrowers who are past due on their payments have seen an average credit score decrease of 60 points, which will stay on their credit report for 7 years and result in less access to credit and higher interest rates. When in default, a borrower's wages, tax returns, and Social Security checks may be garnished.

Currently, there is a backlog of at least 1.5 million applications for income-driven repayment plans, which will likely increase as more borrowers seek to switch out of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, due to the fact that the administration is restarting interest accrual for those who are currently in an administrative forbearance as a result of ongoing litigation against the SAVE plan.

When student loan borrowers have issues or errors with monthly payments, income-driven repayment plans, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, delays for relief under borrower defense or closed school discharge, or any other number of issues that their servicer fails to resolve, they can contact the Ombudsman Office at the Department of Education. As of March 2025, more than 6,500 complaints remained unresolved. I expect that these workforce reductions will make it even more challenging for borrowers to receive help or relief when they confront errors, challenges, or complex situations relating to their student loans.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) also just phased out a number of federal student loan repayment plans. How might the Supreme Court ruling and this budget bill together reshape the student loan landscape?

Sara Partridge: The Department has both ongoing and new duties to carry out that will require significant expertise, resources, and staff that may no longer be available. The Office of Federal Student Aid will have the task of implementing a range of new programs as a result of the OBBBA, including introducing new loan limits for graduate students and parent borrowers, moving borrowers into new repayment plans, and expanding Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs. Many of these changes will start to take place July 1, 2026, and some will require new regulations to determine how they will be implemented. These are tall tasks on a quick timeline, even for a fully staffed Department.

Student loan borrowers will see a range of changes starting in July 2026, including higher monthly payments under the new OBBBA plans. Graduate borrowers and parent borrowers will see new limits on federal student loans. The graduate and professional borrowing limits will likely disproportionately impact students pursuing medicine, dentistry, and other health care fields, forcing many to rely on more risky private student loans. The OBBBA also limits repayment options for parent borrowers, barring them from accessing income-driven repayment plans.

Is there anything students should do now to prepare for changes in student aid administration?

Sara Partridge: If borrowers are past due on their student loan payments, they should contact their servicer to work with them to prevent going into default. If they are a Parent PLUS borrower, they may want to consider consolidating their loans before July 2026 to access the amended income-based repayment plan (although this can, in some cases, reset progress toward cancellation, so borrowers should speak with their servicer about this choice).

If borrowers are facing ongoing challenges with their student loans that they cannot get resolution for with their servicer or the Department of Education, student loan borrowers can open cases with their congressional representatives, which will serve the dual purposes of getting them assistance while also making Congress aware of the myriad challenges borrowers are facing right now, and encourage them to hold the administration accountable for delivering on its statutory duties.

When might the effects of reduced capacity at the DOE begin to ripple into K-12 schools, impacting teachers and students?

Jon Valant: It looks like the staffing cuts are having negative impacts already. For example, the cuts were heavily concentrated in the Institute of Education Sciences, which has been slashed to the point where we're losing access to data that we rely on to evaluate needs and progress. That being said, I think the most significant, direct impacts might actually come from the funding cuts — or the Trump administration's attempts to withhold billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds — that are causing immediate headaches and sacrifices from schools. Those are previously approved funds that school districts have been promised that suddenly aren't available for a new school year that's quickly approaching. We'll see where that ends up, since they'll have to deal with legal and political challenges, but that could mean fewer services for English language learners and fewer before- and after-school programs. And now, just a month or two before the school year starts, school and district leaders are scrambling to figure out what cuts they might have to make to programs and staff. 

Another agency disproportionately targeted by layoffs is the Office for Civil Rights. How do you think the DOE's closing will impact equity and civil rights in schools?

Jon Valant: Protecting students' civil rights is one of the core functions of the U.S. Department of Education. I'm concerned about what the Office for Civil Rights staffing cuts mean for the Education Department's ability to fulfill its obligations in that regard — now and in the future. Maybe even more than that, though, I'm concerned with the way that this administration is redefining, twisting, and narrowing the Department's priorities with respect to civil rights. In the past, the focus has been on protecting vulnerable groups of students. Now, the focus seems to be on weaponizing civil rights enforcement to threaten school districts and universities that don't align with its positions on culture-war issues like LGBTQ+ rights. We've seen that with universities like Harvard and Columbia, as well as with state and local K-12 education agencies, including Maine and California.

Sara Partridge:  The March 2025 workforce reductions closed seven of the Department's 12 regional civil rights offices, laying off 208 investigators, or 55 percent of the agency's total investigative staff. A recent court filing showed that under the Trump administration, the Office for Civil Rights has dismissed civil rights complaints at a rapid-fire pace. Historically, close to half of the complaints about civil rights violations have related to discrimination due to disability. Students of all backgrounds, but in particular those with disabilities, may see their rights to equal educational opportunity diminished under this administration, and evidence already suggests that layoffs of civil rights investigators are taking their toll.

Jon, you wrote in this Brookings piece that there's a “dangerous gap between education's problems and proposed ‘solutions.'” You note chronic absenteeism and large gaps in student test scores. Can you explain how dismantling the DOE fails to respond to the key problems you're seeing in education — and how it could make these issues worse for students?

Jon Valant: Let's run down some of the many challenges facing K-12 schools in the United States right now. We've seen years-long declines in academic performance — that started before COVID — especially among the country's lowest-scoring students. We continue to battle high rates of chronic absenteeism and other indicators of student disengagement. We have alarming data on student mental health and have to grapple with challenges related to cell phone use, social media, and other issues that originate outside of classrooms. We have a workforce that's rapidly changing with school systems that aren't equipped to keep up with those changes. How does dismantling the U.S. Department of Education or slashing funds for schools help with any of that? I have no idea. This is an era of genuine challenges for U.S. students and schools, and yet many of our leaders seem more focused on winning culture-war battles than actually addressing those challenges.

What are some specific policies that you think would more adequately address these issues?

Jon Valant: I think what defines great schools, more than anything, is outstanding teachers and instruction. We can use policy more strategically to attract, retain, and develop excellent teachers, especially in schools that most need additional support. I also think we have a lot of work to do in evaluating the quality of curricular materials, encouraging schools and districts to adopt high-quality curricula, and training teachers in those curricula. And, really, I'd like to see policymakers think more seriously about schools' role in sustaining a healthy democracy and cohesive society. School isn't only about preparing students for college and the workforce. It's also about developing an ability to get along with another, respect other people's perspectives and experiences, know how to spot misinformation, and value the country's norms and institutions.

Is there any angle or consequence you think is being overlooked in media coverage of the DOE dismantlement?

Sara Partridge: The nearly $900 million in cuts to federal education research undertaken by the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) are a critical blow to researchers' and policymakers' understanding of education outcomes, trends, and issues. In postsecondary education, these contracts help us understand how student loan dollars are distributed and the outcomes of students who borrow for college. They help us understand who continues to face barriers to enrolling and graduating from college. Some of these studies are longitudinal and take place over a decade or more, so interrupting and re-starting them means wasted resources and years of lost time. Canceling these projects is short-sighted and could potentially be deeply damaging to the long-term future of the American education system.

Republicans frame closing the DOE as an effort to give power back to the states. What role do the states play in this? Is it actually feasible for states to take over the DOE's functions?

Jon Valant: President Trump likes to say that he's “sending education back to the states.” But the truth is that states and localities, not the federal government, have been the key actors in K-12 education all along. For example, the federal government only covers about one-tenth of the expenses for K-12 education, with state and local governments covering the rest. The federal government isn't involved in selecting curriculum or deciding what content students should learn. It doesn't hire teachers and school leaders or even decide what standards should be used for hiring teachers and school leaders. Those responsibilities fall to more local levels of government. That's not to say that the federal government isn't important in K-12 education — it is. It plays key roles in protecting students' civil rights, collecting data and supporting research, and providing funding and support to vulnerable groups, like students with disabilities and students in poverty.

Sara Partridge: The federal government conducts research and oversight, ensures students' civil rights are protected, distributes funding to states and schools, administers postsecondary student financial aid, and runs grant programs that help fill gaps or foster innovation. States, on the other hand, are primarily responsible for academic standards, curriculum, and graduation requirements; teacher certification; and a majority of public school funding. Any major changes to these responsibilities would require an act of Congress. Historically, the federal government has played an essential role in prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity for all students. Certain federal standards and guardrails also ensure that taxpayer dollars are well spent on quality education. Shifting responsibility to the states without providing any mechanisms for accountability or oversight at the federal level would undoubtedly make the educational playing field more unequal and leave students with the greatest need behind.

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Russia plans to spend around $1.1 trillion on rearmament over the next 11 years in preparation for a potential large-scale war, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on July 22.

Moscow has launched its most ambitious weapons program since the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said. Russia is mobilizing all sectors of society to support its military buildup, he added.

"There is a total mobilization of politics, economy, and society of the Russian Federation to be ready for the upcoming large-scale war," Budanov said during the annual meeting of Ukrainian ambassadors.

As part of this reform, Russia has already created two new military districts — Moscow and Leningrad — and is preparing to form additional divisions and military units. Budanov said the Kremlin's goal is not just regional domination but a reshaping of the global order.

"Russia seeks to disrupt the current security and economic order," he added. "For this purpose, Moscow is building up its presence in Africa, primarily using its proxy forces."

Budanov also warned that Russia is conducting hybrid operations abroad, including cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, aimed at undermining democracies.

"Moscow's goal is to impose on countries its own vision of the future world order, where 'big' states, primarily the Russian Federation, have full power, a monopoly on all critical resources and decide the fate of the world in a closed circle," Budanov said. 

His comments follow a growing number of warnings from Western intelligence services about Russia's long-term military buildup. Last year, German intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said that Moscow will have the military capabilities to attack NATO by 2030.

Russia's defense spending has already overtaken that of all European countries combined. In 2024, its military budget surged by 42% to $462 billion, surpassing Europe's collective defense expenditure of $457 billion, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 30 that Russia is prepared to scale up its war effort to levels last seen in World War II, claiming "millions" of civilians are supporting the military by donating supplies and equipment.

Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi estimated in April that Russia could call up to 5 million trained reservists, with a broader mobilization potential of 20 million.

After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor.

Demonstrators gathered in Kyiv, Lviv, Dnipro, and Odesa to oppose the legislation, which grants sweeping new powers to the prosecutor general over the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO).





Moscow has launched its most ambitious weapons program since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said.

"I think they need to be called out for their subsidizing this killing that is happening on the battlefields in Ukraine," U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said.

The legislation grants the prosecutor general new powers over investigations led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and cases led by the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.

The announcement comes as pro-Western President Maia Sandu, who narrowly secured reelection last year, seeks to preserve her parliamentary majority and advance Moldova's bid for EU accession.



The breach reportedly prompted an urgent response from Ukrainian units to prevent the situation "from spiraling into disaster."

Russian schoolchildren are recruited into drone development and other military programs through seemingly harmless video games, state-run competitions, and promises of academic and career advancement.

An SBU officer is suspected of demanding a $300,000 bribe from a person under investigation for allegedly organizing illegal border crossings for military-age men during wartime, NABU said.

Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council has imposed a moratorium on business inspections by state authorities, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 21, calling the move essential for the country's economic security.

The delegation will be led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov and include representatives from Ukraine's military intelligence, the Foreign Ministry, and the Presidential Office.

The target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russian forces launched 42 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones overnight, primarily from Russia and occupied Crimea, Ukraine's Air Force said. At least 26 drones were shot down, and seven more were lost or suppressed by electronic warfare systems, according to the statement.

A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday declined to lift restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump's administration on White House access by Associated Press journalists after the news organization declined to refer to the body of water long called the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America as he prefers.

The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit kept in place a June 6 decision by a divided three-judge panel that the administration could legally restrict access to the AP to news events in the Oval Office and other locations controlled by the White House, including Air Force One.

The D.C. Circuit order denied the AP's request that it review the matter, setting up a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Associated Press in a statement on Tuesday said it was disappointed by the court's decision and will remain focused on free speech rights as the case continues.

“As we've said throughout, the press and the public have a fundamental right to speak freely without government retaliation,” the AP said.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

In a lawsuit filed in February, the AP argued that the limitations on its access imposed by the administration violated the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of free speech.

Trump in January signed an executive order officially directing federal agencies to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. The AP sued after the White House restricted its access over its decision not to use “Gulf of America” in its news reports.

The AP stylebook states that the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. AP said that as a global news agency, it will refer to the body of water by its long-standing name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen.

Reuters and the AP both issued statements denouncing the access restrictions, which put wire services in a larger rotation with about 30 other newspaper and print outlets. Other media customers, including local news outlets with no presence in Washington, rely on real-time reports by the wire services of presidential statements, as do global financial markets.

Trump frequently grants interviews on the spot to journalists who call his personal cell

The Trump administration has said the president has absolute discretion over media access to the White House.

The AP won a key order in the trial court when U.S. District Judge Treevor McFadden, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, decided that if the White House opens its doors to some journalists, it cannot exclude others based on their viewpoints, citing the First Amendment.

The D.C. Circuit panel in its 2-1 ruling in June paused McFadden's order. The two judges in the majority, Neomi Rao and Gregory Katsas, were appointed by Trump during his first term in office. The dissenting judge, Cornelia Pillard, is an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama.

Justice Maria Carroccia will issue her decision on Thursday morning in London, Ont., more than seven years after the alleged sexual assault was first reported to police

Five former members of Canada's 2018 world junior hockey team are awaiting the verdict in their high-profile sexual assault trial. All of the men have pleaded not guilty.

After two mistrials, Justice Maria Carroccia dismissed the jury and is ultimately deciding the case herself. She is scheduled to deliver her verdict on Thursday in London, Ont. 

Michael McLeod, Dillon Dubé, Carter Hart, Cal Foote and Alex Formenton have been charged with sexually assaulting a woman, known publicly as E.M., in a hotel room after a Hockey Canada gala in London, Ont., on June 18, 2018.

In E.M.'s interviews with London police detective Stephen Newton, she described how she met Mr. McLeod in a local bar called Jack's and went with him to his hotel room at the Delta Armouries. She said they had consensual sex, but that she was then forced to engage in sex acts with a group of teammates he had invited in without her knowledge as several others in the room watched. E.M. said she initially tried to resist, but felt she had no choice but to comply.

E.M. reported the incident to police the following day, but an initial investigation led by Det. Newton was closed without charges in February, 2019. He believed there was not enough evidence to lay charges. 

The case only became public knowledge in May, 2022, after TSN reported that Hockey Canada had settled a $3.55-million lawsuit brought by E.M. against the organization, as well as the Canadian Hockey League and eight unnamed players. The settlement was made without the players' knowledge or consent.

London police reopened E.M.'s case in July, 2022, just days after The Globe and Mail published details of videos and texts from around the time of the incident that were provided to police in 2018. Hockey Canada and the NHL have also conducted their own independent probes, but the results of those have not been made public.

Who are the players accused? 

The five members of the 2018 Canadian world junior team charged with sexually assaulting a woman are Dillon Dubé, Carter Hart, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton and Michael McLeod. Mr. McLeod also faces a second charge of being a party to sexual assault. The men have each pleaded not guilty. All five have denied wrongdoing and staged vigorous defences, and all have taken leaves from their teams.

Four of the five players had been playing in the NHL prior to their arrests in 2024. Mr. Dubé was a member of the Calgary Flames, Mr. Hart was with the Philadelphia Flyers, and Mr. McLeod and Mr. Foote were playing for the New Jersey Devils. Mr. Formenton was playing for the Swiss club HC Ambri-Piotta at the time, but he had previously been a member of the Ottawa Senators.

Who is E.M.?

The complainant in the case is a woman publicly identified only as E.M., who was 20 years old at the time of the alleged assault. Crown attorney Heather Donkers sought and obtained a publication ban on E.M.'s identity in February.

The fallout from the news that Hockey Canada had quietly settled a lawsuit filed by E.M. prompted London police to reopen the case in July, 2022. The charges against the five men were laid in January, 2024.

Who is the judge? 

Justice Maria Carroccia worked for decades as a leading criminal-defence lawyer in Windsor, Ont., before she was appointed as a judge to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2020. In her five years as a judge, Justice Carroccia has overseen high-profile and complex cases, from murder to sexual assault trials.

Justice Carroccia's work during the Hockey Canada trial focused on the difficult nuances of sexual-assault law and what constitutes consent. Consent must be given voluntarily and continuously for each sexual act under Canadian law.

The trial began in a London, Ont., courtroom in late April, and was plagued by disruption, including a mistrial and the dismissal of a second jury. After weeks of intense testimony and arguments over the admissibility of some key evidence, closing arguments wrapped up in mid-June. 

E.M. testified that after consensual sex with McLeod, she felt “shocked” when other men started showing up to the room. The court heard that when she attempted to leave, the players stopped her and convinced her to stay. E.M. told the court that she went on “auto-pilot” as the men demanded sex acts.

Timeline: Key moments in the Hockey Canada trial

But over seven days of gruelling cross-examination by the five players' lawyers, defence counsel asserted to E.M. that she was the instigator of the sexual activity looking for a “wild night” and pressed her over inconsistencies between her court testimony and statements she had given to police, the amount of alcohol she consumed and her actions inside the hotel room.

Court also saw several messages, including one sent around 2 a.m. on the night of the alleged assault from Mr. McLeod's cellphone to a 19-person team group chat: “Who wants to be in 3 way quick. 209- mikey.” Then, after 3 a.m. and again just after 4 a.m., Mr. McLeod took two videos of E.M. Wrapped in a towel, she can be heard saying, “it was all consensual” and that she “enjoyed it.”

Several witnesses testified during the proceedings, including detectives in both London police probes and four former team members who are not accused of wrongdoing and were present during parts of the night in question: Brett Howden, Tyler Steenbergen, Taylor Raddysh and Boris Katchouk.

Howden's recollections became the subject of fraught legal arguments after Crown prosecutors accused him of feigning memory loss on the stand. However, their arguments to enter some of his text messages about that night into evidence were unsuccessful.

Carter Hart was the only accused hockey player to testify in his own defence, telling court he was positive E.M. was an excited and active participant to all the sexual activity. But Crown prosecutors pressed Hart on why McLeod felt the need to record a consent video and aimed to illustrate that Hart did not ensure E.M. was voluntarily and continuously consenting to each sexual act, as required by law.

Why is there no jury?

Just days after the trial began in late April, Hilary Dudding, one of the lawyers representing accused player Alex Formenton, and a member of the first jury bumped into each other at a local food market. The juror had concerns the interaction was inappropriate; Ms. Dudding said she had made a benign comment to the juror apologizing for the run-in. But the event caused Justice Carroccia to dismiss the original 14-member jury and restart the trial with a new jury.

In May, a member of the second jury accused lawyer Daniel Brown, another member of Mr. Formenton's defence team, and his co-counsel Ms. Dudding of bullying the jury. 

Who is Daniel Brown, defence lawyer in the Hockey Canada sex-assault trial?

A note handed to Justice Carroccia by juror 11 alleged: “Multiple jury members feel we are being judged and made fun of by lawyers Brown and Hilary Dudding.” 

In response, Justice Carroccia said she had no choice but to dismiss the jury again. After two juries were dismissed, Crown lawyers reluctantly agreed to proceed before a judge alone rather than starting the trial anew, which would have required E.M. to testify and be cross-examined by all five defence teams all over again.

Why did it take so long to get to trial? 

London police reopened their 2018 sexual assault investigation in July, 2022, after determining there were additional investigative avenues to pursue. 

After the initial criminal investigation was concluded without charges in 2019, the case was not examined by a civilian committee whose mandate is to scrutinize the London Police Service's sexual assault investigations for missteps. It is not clear why the case wasn't brought to its attention.

Trial testimony and court documents have also shed more light on what police missed and the roadblocks investigators faced in the initial probe, from myths about the role of alcohol to not asking E.M. or the suspects important questions.

The Globe's Robyn Doolittle answers reader questions on the Hockey Canada trial coverage

The trial of five former members of Canada's 2018 world junior hockey team, who are accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a London, Ont., hotel room in 2018, has raised questions about how news organizations cover such cases. Robyn Doolittle answers reader questions with Standards Editor Sandra E. Martin. The accused players have all pleaded not guilty.

The Globe and Mail

(Return to top)

When is the verdict?

Justice Maria Carroccia is scheduled to deliver her verdict after 10 a.m. on Thursday in London, Ont. This date was set in advance on the last day of closing arguments in mid-June.

What are the potential outcomes?

Under Canadian law, a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court.

A guilty verdict indicates that the prosecution has convinced the judge or jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime(s) in question. 

A verdict of not guilty means the prosecution failed to meet the high standard of proof required for a conviction, thus the defendant is acquitted of the charges laid against them.

In a legal context, a not guilty verdict does not mean the court has affirmed the defendant's innocence, rather it means prosecutors were unable to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. 

Opinion: Whatever the verdict, the benefits of hockey are diminished

All of the men were tried in one trial, so it is possible all could be found not guilty of all the charges, or all could be found guilty of all the charges. But it is also possible that some players could be found guilty while others are found not guilty. 

Michael McLeod, the only accused facing two charges instead of one, could also be found not guilty of both, guilty of both, or guilty of one and not the other.

Can the men return to the NHL if they are found not guilty?

The question of whether the players would be able to return to professional hockey if they are found not guilty has hung over the proceedings. 

Four of the five players had been playing in the NHL prior to their arrests in 2024, though all took leaves from their teams after the charges were laid and some of their contracts have since expired. During the trial, Mr. Hart – who was the only player to testify in his own defence – told the court he is a free agent, meaning he is still eligible to play in the NHL, but is not signed to a team. None of the men are suspended from their teams or the NHL.

Gary Bettman won't say if Hockey Canada players on trial for sexual assault could return to NHL if acquitted

But it has never been clear if the players would be permitted to return, even if a team was willing to sign them. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman refused to say if the league would allow it in early June.

Speaking at a news conference in Edmonton days before closing arguments in the trial, Mr. Bettman said the league wanted to let the court proceeding play out.

“We have said continuously we are not making any comments while the judicial process is taking place. We respect that,” Mr. Bettman said. He then added: “I want to be clear. What has been alleged is abhorrent and disgusting and should not be allowed.”

What happens if the players are found guilty and convicted?

If any of the players are found guilty of sexual assault, they could face up to 10 years in prison under Canada's Criminal Code. Being a party to a sexual assault, the additional charge Mr. McLeod is facing, is treated as seriously as being a perpetrator and could add 10 additional years to a sentence if he is found guilty.

Justice Carroccia would determine the actual length of any sentences and deliver her decision at a later date.

Any players found guilty and convicted would also almost certainly appeal the judge's decision, which could delay sentencing or serving any time behind bars while a potential appeal is heard by a higher court.

Impact of the settlement and trial

The impact of the Hockey Canada settlement scandal and subsequent criminal trial has been widespread. 

The case has shaken the foundations of Hockey Canada, one of the country's most prominent sports organizations, forcing difficult questions about the culture within a beloved game as well as triggering parliamentary hearings and high-level departures within the organization.

The issue of sexual assault perpetrated by Hockey Canada players has been well-known to the organization's top brass for years. During parliamentary hearings in Ottawa in 2022, former Hockey Canada CEO Bob Nicholson said he regretted that there was not more focus on “the culture of silence that appears to persist to this day.”

Former Hockey Canada CEO Scott Smith revealed during the hearings that Hockey Canada has dealt with an average of one to two sexual assault cases a year for the past six years.

In London, Ont., the Hockey Canada sex-assault trial looms large over the courthouse's neighbourhood

A Globe and Mail investigation in July, 2022, found that Hockey Canada kept a special multimillion-dollar fund built up by registration fees of players across the country, that it uses to pay out settlements in cases of alleged sexual assault without its insurance company, and with minimal outside scrutiny.

In the wake of Hockey Canada's response to the sexual assault allegations in 2022, Tim Hortons suspended its World Juniors sponsorship, and Canadian Tire and Telus withdrew their support. Scotiabank also suspended its sponsorship of Hockey Canada. 

Some major sponsors reinstated their partnerships with Hockey Canada in 2023, ahead of the world junior championship tournament.

Opinion: The important moral question Hockey Canada sponsors now face

The high-profile trial has also given a rare insight into how the Canadian criminal justice system addresses sexual assault. The verdict could set a new legal precedent on the question of what constitutes voluntary consent, particularly in cases of power imbalance.

Legal experts and sexual violence advocates have also said the case's handling and trial have highlighted failures of the legal system to address sexual-assault accusations, and some say they fear a not guilty verdict may have a chilling effect and prevent others from bringing forward allegations of sexual assault.

The trial has also reignited broader conversations around consent, misogyny and sexual violence in hockey, and how insular cultures within professional sports organizations allow abuse to endure in secrecy.

As the trial has played out in the media, front-line staff at women's shelters and crisis centres have seen more victims coming forward to formally report or seek support. At the London Abused Women's Centre, some people have walked in with donations in E.M.'s name, while others have sent money from as far as Alberta.

Donald Trump said he is being subjected to a “witch hunt” over his government's refusal to release the Epstein files. 

Mr Trump faced his first grilling by the media since a lewd birthday letter he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein was published by the Wall Street Journal.

“It's, it's sort of a witch hunt, just a continuation of a witch hunt,” Mr Trump said of the political crisis engulfing his presidency.

On Friday Mr Trump filed a $10 billion (£7.4 billion) defamation suit against the newspaper, the two reporters who wrote the story and Rupert Murdoch, the newspaper's owner.

The US president claimed the alleged letter, which is said to have included a drawing of a naked woman, is “fake”. On Tuesday, he described the WSJ as a “terrible paper” and said that he is suing them “for a lot of money”.

It came after the Department of Justice announced that administration officials had asked to meet Ghislaine Maxwell to discuss the Epstein case. 

Todd Blanche, the deputy US attorney general, said the Department of Justice (DoJ) and the FBI had reached out to the British socialite and former girlfriend of the paedophile financier, who is currently serving a 20-year jail sentence after being convicted of sex trafficking.

In a post shared by Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, Mr Blanche said: “President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. If Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DoJ will hear what she has to say.

“Therefore, at the direction of Attorney General Bondi, I have communicated with counsel for Ms Maxwell to determine whether she would be willing to speak with prosecutors from the Department. I anticipate meeting with Ms Maxwell in the coming days.”

Mr Trump claimed he was unaware of the plans to interview Maxwell. He said: “Yeah, I don't know about it, but I think it's something that would be... sounds appropriate to do.” Mr Trump continued: “I don't really follow that too much.” 

Maxwell's lawyer, who has been trying to meet with the Trump administration and has suggested his client should be freed, has confirmed he is in talks with government officials.

“I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully,” David Oscar Markus said.

He added: “We are grateful to president Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.”

Mr Trump's handling of the information related to the case has angered even some of his most loyal supporters.

The FBI and the DoJ sparked dismay among the president's Maga base earlier this month after concluding that the sex offender did not have a “client list” and took his own life in a Manhattan prison cell in 2019.

Conspiracy theorists, including many Trump voters, believe that Epstein was killed to prevent supposed information about high-profile “clients” involved with the financier from being made public.

Mr Blanche said that no previous administration had made contact with Maxwell on behalf of the DofJ. “That changes now,” he said.

It comes after Alan Dershowitz, Epstein's former lawyer, described Maxwell as the “Rosetta Stone” of the case.

“She knows everything. She is the Rosetta Stone. She knows everything. She arranged every single trip with everybody. She knows everything,” he told Fox News on Monday.

He suggested she should be given legal immunity in exchange for talking freely about the case before Congress.

Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker, has become one of the most senior members of his party to call on Mr Trump to release “everything” related to the paedophile financier.

But on Monday, Mr Johnson's stance on the issue appeared to have softened, with the top Republican saying the administration needed “space” to resolve the matter.

“My belief is we need the administration to have the space to do what it is doing, and if further congressional action is necessary or appropriate, then we'll look at that,” Mr Johnson said.

He added: “But I don't think we're at that point right now because we agree with the president.”

On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he would shut the House down early for August recess, closing the session after a vote on Wednesday.

Making the announcement shortly after the DoJ revealed it had contacted Maxwell, Mr Johnson said the move was to avoid “political games”.

House Republicans offered a resolution calling for the so-called Epstein files to be made public, although the resolution carries no legal weight.

On Friday, Mr Trump ordered the release of grand jury transcripts from Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case after The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a story alleging Mr Trump had written a “bawdy” letter to Epstein for his birthday in 2003.

Mr Trump filed a lawsuit against the newspaper and its owner Rupert Murdoch, and on Monday, the White House removed the newspaper from the pool of reporters covering the president's upcoming trip to Scotland.

The president denied he wrote the letter, which is said to have included a drawing of a naked woman, and called it “fake”.

The potential meeting has raised questions over whether Maxwell will try to leverage information about the case for a reduced prison sentence. An appeal put forward by her lawyers was rejected last year.

Maxwell's appeal focused largely on a 2007 non-prosecution agreement made between Epstein and federal prosecutors in southern Florida, which she said barred her from being prosecuted in Manhattan 13 years later.

Her lawyer argued that the wording of the agreement signalled the government's intent to bar prosecutions nationwide of “potential co-conspirators”, including, but not limited to, four of Epstein's assistants.

Earlier in July, the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to reject another appeal by Maxwell's lawyers.

D John Sauer, the US solicitor-general, said the argument relating to the 2007 non-prosecution agreement was unlikely to succeed in any appeals court.

It comes as Republicans moved to force Maxwell to testify in front of the House about the Epstein case.

Recommended

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee advanced a motion filed by Tim Burchett, a Tennessee representative, seeking approval to subpoena Maxwell.

The Republican lawmaker was directed to introduce the motion by James Comer, the committee chair.

Both lawmakers told Axios they had not consulted Mr Trump before introducing the motion to compel the convicted sex offender to testify. The move marks the brewing discontent within members of Mr Trump's own party.

“The Committee will seek to subpoena Ms Maxwell as expeditiously as possible,” a committee aide said in a statement to Politico, adding: “Since Ms Maxwell is in federal prison, the Committee will work with the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons to identify a date when [the] Committee can depose her.”

“This deposition will help the American people understand how Jeffrey Epstein was able to carry out his evil actions for so long without being brought to justice,” Mr Burchett said in a statement.

Mr Trump's relationship with Maxwell stretches back decades. He was pictured with Maxwell and her paedophile financier boyfriend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2000.

In 2020, while Maxwell was awaiting trial on federal sex crimes for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking crimes, Mr Trump said he wished her “well”.

Asked whether he expected her to go public with the names of the men who have been accused in lawsuits of taking part in Epstein's sex-trafficking crimes, Mr Trump said: “I don't know... I haven't really been following it too much. I just wish her well, frankly.”

“I've met her numerous times over the years, especially since I lived in Palm Beach, and I guess they lived in Palm Beach. But I wish her well, whatever it is,” Mr Trump added.

In an interview with Axios that year, Mr Trump doubled down on his well wishes for Maxwell.

“Her friend, or boyfriend, was either killed or committed suicide in jail. She's now in jail,” Mr Trump said.

“I do wish her well. I'm not looking for anything bad for her. I'm not looking bad for anybody,” Mr Trump said, adding: “Her boyfriend died. He died in jail.”

The Trump administration has openly defied court orders at an unprecedented rate, legal experts note.

An analysis has found that the Trump White House has taken actions to defy one out of every three judicial rulings against the president's actions.

The examination of 160 lawsuits, conducted by The Washington Post, suggests “widespread noncompliance with America's legal system” on the part of President Donald Trump and his administration, the analysis concluded.

What's more, the administration seems to be taking advantage of the fact that the judicial system is slow to consider, begin or follow through on contempt proceedings — meaning that their noncompliance often goes unpunished. Indeed, none of the judges whose orders have been ignored have tried to force compliance in the form of punitive orders, The Post's analysis found. 

Never miss the news and analysis you care about.

Part of the reason judges may be reluctant to take such action is that they may want to avoid a constitutional crisis — such punitive orders, while issued by judges, are followed up by the U.S. Marshals Service, whose director is an executive branch appointee, meaning that the agency, under Trump's orders, may also ignore judicial decrees.

The Post examined 337 lawsuits in total, finding 165 cases in which judges had ruled against the administration. The Trump White House has been accused of “defying or frustrating court oversight” in 57 cases, or around 35 percent of rulings or orders made against them, the analysis found — an unprecedented amount, according to legal experts speaking to the publication. 

The White House appears to be seeking to sidestep court orders on immigration cases in particular, the data shows. Rulings on federal funding cuts or the firings of federal workers were also frequently ignored, according to the analysis.

Transgender journalist Erin Reed recently reported that the administration is also failing to abide by rulings on LGBTQ rights, including in a case that would allow transgender people to continue updating gender markers on their passports. Citing a source within the government, Reed noted that the “noncompliance is intentional,” and is a deliberate “stalling” of the order as the appeals process continues.

The White House typically justifies these actions by claiming that judges are biased against them, with Trump oftentimes asserting, without evidence, that rulings he disagrees with are from “radical left judges.”

The Washington Post's analysis seems to confirm concerns from a Department of Justice (DOJ) whistleblower earlier this year. The whistleblower report by Erez Reuveni, a former DOJ employee, stated that Emil Bove, the DOJ's principal associate deputy attorney general, frequently told colleagues that the administration should ignore court orders. When Reuveni tried to correct actions his coworkers were taking that appeared to follow through on that directive, he was “threatened, fired and publicly disparaged,” he said in his report.

Bove was recently nominated by Trump to become a federal judge in the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 

The Republican-controlled Congress appears to be no help in the matter, either — indeed, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) has sided with Trump, suggesting that judges should be punished in some way for issuing orders against the president's actions.

“We can eliminate an entire district court,” Johnson told reporters in March.

While Republican lawmakers appear to be aligning themselves with Trump's subversion of orders, polling suggests that voters are concerned about the administration's refusal to comply. 

A Demand Justice/Global Strategy Group poll released in June examined voters' attitudes in battleground states. The poll found that, while voters were split almost evenly along self-identified political lines, a majority of them, 53 percent, disapproved of Trump's response to court decrees, with nearly three-quarters of voters in the poll, 72 percent, saying they are “concerned about Trump's attempts to refuse to obey court orders.” A majority of voters, 52 percent, also said they viewed Trump's defiance as “an abuse of power.”

It is “very clear that voters overwhelmingly do not support Trump's attacks on the rule of law and the courts,” Demand Justice wrote in its press release of the poll's results. “All of us who care about the rule of law, the Constitution and our democracy must push back against these attacks.”

With Trump's fascist agenda driving the narrative, it's the duty of independent media to disrupt corporate propaganda.

Trump has suggested that his $16 million settlement is worth twice as much as the publicly reported amount.

Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size.

A trio of Democratic U.S. senators on Monday launched a probe into reports that President Donald Trump's legal team struck a secretive side deal with Skydance — the prospective owner of CBS — that includes millions of dollars worth of “broadcast transmissions” supporting right-wing causes.

In a letter to Skydance CEO David Ellison, Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wrote that Trump himself appeared to confirm the existence of the side deal in comments to reporters about his $16 million settlement with Paramount, the current owner of CBS that is seeking federal approval for its pending merger with Skydance.

Trump suggested the settlement was worth twice as much as the publicly reported figure, saying, “We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million—or maybe more than that in advertising… So it's like $32 to maybe $35 million. I think that's what they did.”

The senators described the alleged side deal as a “potential secret Trump payoff.”

“This admission appears to corroborate reporting that claims you reached a ‘side deal' with the president, the terms of which involve CBS airing public service announcements ‘and other broadcast transmissions' worth between $15 million and $20 million that ‘support conservative causes supported by President Trump.' The nature and existence of this arrangement are uncertain, with at least one anonymous source calling the reports ‘false.'”

The president's comments aligned with a New York Post story published earlier this month alleging that Ellison vowed to “run between $15 million and $20 million of public service ads to promote causes supported by the president” once the Skydance CEO takes over CBS.

Paramount denied having any knowledge of a side deal.

Did Skydance make a secret side deal with Donald Trump so he'd approve its $8 BILLION merger with Paramount? This could be bribery in plain sight. I'm pushing for answers NOW. https://t.co/UMSf84Cx7h

The Democratic senators wrote in their letter to Ellison that the president's comments and related reporting “raise fresh questions about corruption in the Trump administration and President Trump's willingness to accept payments from entities with significant policy interests before agencies he controls.”

The senators demanded that Ellison provide answers to seven questions, including whether there is “currently any arrangement under which you or Skydance will provide compensation, advertising, or promotional activities that in any way assist President Trump, his family, his presidential library, or other administration officials” and whether Ellison has “personally discussed with President Trump, any of his family members, any Trump administration officials, or presidential library fund personnel any matters related to the Paramount-Skydance transaction.”

The letter was sent days after Ellison met with Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr — a Trump loyalist — to discuss the pending merger with Paramount.

The meeting, according to Skydance's counsel, included a discussion of “Skydance's commitment to unbiased journalism and its embrace of diverse viewpoints, principles that will ensure CBS‘ editorial decision-making reflects the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.”

As Variety noted, “That's significant because Carr, appointed by Trump, had reopened an agency probe into a ‘news distortion' complaint against CBS over the allegedly deceptive editing of a '60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris segment — the same interview that Trump sued Paramount and CBS over.”

“The application of the FCC's ‘news distortion' policy in this way was highly unusual, according to former agency officials,” Variety reported.

MOSCOW, July 22. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin has extended his condolences to the family of Irina Podnosova, the chair of the Russian Supreme Court, who died on Tuesday at the age of 71.

"I knew her for decades as a person of high principles and a professional of the highest class. She always worked effectively and efficiently and was an example of dedication and responsibility in her chosen line of work. As chairperson of the Russian Supreme Court, she firmly and consistently upheld the rule of law, and served the motherland and our people with integrity," Putin said in a telegram of condolences that was posted on the Kremlin website.

The president emphasized that her memory will forever stay in the hearts of her family, friends, and colleagues.

Podnosova was appointed chairperson of the Russian Supreme Court on April 17, 2024 after the death of her predecessor, Vyacheslav Lebedev. She was the first woman ever to hold the office.

The department said in a statement that Ice never arrested or deported Luis Leon to Guatemala, and that the reports were a ‘hoax'

Confusion swirled around the fate of a Chilean resident of the US after the Department of Homeland Security called reports of his deportation to Guatemala a “hoax”.

On 18 July, the Morning Call newspaper of Allentown, Pennsylvania, reported that the family of the man, Luis Leon, said he was handcuffed after showing up at to immigration office on 20 June to report a lost green card. They said he was first sent to a detention facility in Minnesota, then to Guatemala, where they said a Chilean relative informed them he was in a hospital.

The report said Leon was 82 years old and had come to the US after being granted political asylum in 1987 after being tortured under the regime of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. It said in his nearly 40 years living in the US he spent his career working in a leather manufacturing plant, raised a family and had since retired.

DHS, however, denied in a statement that Leon had been deported and that there was no record of Leon having a green card appointment in Philadelphia on that date. The department also said that its only record of Leon entering the US “was from 2015 from Chile under the visa waiver program”.

The Guatemalan government also denied that Leon had been deported. In a statement, the Guatemalan Migration Institute said it coordinates with Ice on all deportations from the US and that no one matched Leon's name, age or citizenship, according to the Associated Press.

The AP added that Guatemala agreed in February to receive people deported from the US who are from other Central American countries, but that its agreement does not extend to Chileans.

On Monday, Morning Call published a new story reflecting DHS and Guatemala's claims, and noting that it “repeatedly requested information from Ice during its reporting; an Ice spokesperson previously refused to confirm details, including whether or not Leon was even at the Philadelphia office, and said Monday that Ice investigators were not able to contact the family”.

It added that Leon's granddaughter, Nataly, who refused to provide her last name, said she had visited Leon in a hospital in Guatemala City, where she claimed he was being treated for pneumonia.

But the outlet also reported that a Chilean journalist, Jose Del Pino, said a doctor at the hospital in question had no record of him.

Del Pino also reportedly provided a copy of an alleged death certificate to the Morning Call for a man with the same name and date of birth who died in Santiago, Chile, in 2019. It added that Del Pino said Chilean citizens all have national identification numbers, and none matches another person with that name and birthday.

Late on Sunday her family issued a statement saying they would no longer speak to media and asked for privacy, and Leon's granddaughter did not respond to the Morning Call's further requests for comment on Monday.

The Guardian has approached Ice, the Chilean embassy in the US, the municipality of Allentown and various immigration organizations for comment. An attorney at Campos Firm said multiple immigration attorneys had tried to contact the family asking to represent them, but could not reach them.

            Hundreds of students gathered outside the smoldering remains of a school in the Bangladeshi capital on Tuesday to demand answers after a military jet slammed into the campus, killing dozens of children.
    


            An ordinary school day turned into terror on Monday when a Bangladesh Air Force jet suffered a mid-air mechanical fault and ploughed into the Milestone School and College in Dhaka, engulfing the two-story building in flames and smoke.
    


            Young students were finishing up afternoon classes and parents had gathered outside the gates to greet their children when the aircraft hit, killing at least 31 people - including 25 children - in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory. Some 165 others were left injured, according to the armed forces public relations directorate (ISPR), many with severe burns.
    


            That most of the dead and injured are young children has compounded the tragedy that shocked the nation of 171 million people and sent the country into national mourning.
    


            As police and air force personnel worked at the scene to retrieve parts of the crashed plane on Tuesday, the gathered crowd began shouting at officials, with some students telling CNN they believe the death toll may be higher than officially released.
    


            The government has denied it is withholding information about the casualties of the crash, state media BSS News reported, citing the Chief Adviser's press wing. It added that the identities of those killed are still being verified.
    


            At the crash site on Tuesday, witnesses were still visibly shaken by the horror they had seen the day before.
    


            “We saw scattered parts of different bodies, of children, guardians,” Mohammad Imran Hussein, a lecturer in the school's English department, told CNN.
    


            “I cannot express everything in words,” he said, emotionally distressed and struggling to speak.
    


            Hussein said he was in a school building across the playground when the jet crashed.
    


            “The sound was really intolerable. And I looked around to see what happened, I saw the tail of the plane. I saw a huge flame of fire,” he said.
    


            Milestone College has a kindergarten, an elementary school and a high school on its campus. The building destroyed in the crash was one of about 20 housing almost 100 students between the ages of six and 13, Hussein said.
    


            “It's like this building was turned into a death trap. It was horrible, totally horrible,” said Sheik Rameen, 21, a student at the high school.
    


            “I saw a lot of children, I tried to save their lives,” he told CNN at the site. “I saw a burnt child seek help but nobody came to help them.”
    


            The FT-7 jet was on a routine training mission when it crashed soon after take off at around 1:18 p.m. local time on Monday (3:18 a.m. EST) after a mechanical fault, according to BSS News, citing the country's armed forces.
    


            The plane's pilot, who has been named as Flight Lieutenant Towkir Islam, made “every effort to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas toward a more sparsely inhabited location,” the military said.
    


            The F-7  BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China's Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane's Information Group. Reuters reported that Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013.
    


            Images from the crash site showed parts of the mangled wreckage of the jet lodged into the side of the scorched school as emergency crews continued their operations.
    


            Following the crash, emergency crews and families rushed the injured to hospitals in the capital where doctors raced to treat severe burns caused by the inferno. The hospitals quickly became overwhelmed with frantic relatives desperate for news of their loved ones.
    


            Most of the injured at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital's burns unit are children under the age of 12, resident surgeon Harunur Rashid told Reuters.
    


            Video shows crowds waiting outside the hospital and waiting rooms packed with anxious families.
    


            Bangladesh's interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said on Monday that, “I have no words. I don't know how to begin.”
    


            “None of us ever imagined it. It wasn't within anyone's expectations. But we had to suddenly accept this unbelievable reality,” Yunus said in a video message.
    


            Yunus said the training aircraft “crashed and fell upon these innocent children” and many were “burned to death in the fire.”
    


            “What answer can we give to their parents? What can we possibly say to them? We can't even answer ourselves,” he said.

Russian troops have entered the front-line city of Pokrovsk in Donetsk Oblast, the open-source battlefield monitoring group DeepState and soldiers on the ground said on July 22.

Pokrovsk, situated around 67 kilometers (41 miles) northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk, has emerged as one of the fiercest hotspots in the Kremlin's ongoing offensive in eastern Ukraine.

Speaking to the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity, a member of a Ukrainian drone team working out of Pokrovsk reported that Russian soldiers had made it into the city limits, though it wasn't clear if they had managed to dig in.

According to DeepState, Russian forces managed to penetrate the city from the direction of Zvirove a few days earlier after exploiting weakened Ukrainian infantry positions and inaccurate situational reporting.

The breach reportedly prompted an urgent response from Ukrainian units to prevent the situation "from spiraling into disaster."

"Russian units attempted to entrench themselves and gain control over Defenders of Ukraine street," DeepState said. "Some of them have been killed, others are still being hunted. The search and destruction of these groups is still ongoing."

The group noted that Ukrainian forces suffered casualties in the ongoing cleanup operation, with incidents of friendly fire reported due to a lack of clear intelligence on the Russian troops' movements and locations. 

DeepState warned that reports on such infiltration attempts should be approached with caution and confirmed data.

Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi said on July 18 that Ukrainian troops were "steadfastly" defending Pokrovsk from repeated Russian infantry assaults. In June, Syrskyi described it as "the hottest spot along the entire 1,200-kilometer front line."

According to Syrskyi, Russian troops continue to rely on small infantry groups to probe Ukraine's defenses but has so far failed to gain control of the city. 

He warned that Russian troops are attempting to sever logistics routes from the northern city of Dobropillia and noted that Russian forces had massed over 110,000 troops in the area by early summer.

Pokrovsk remains a strategic target for Russia as it seeks to advance further into Donetsk Oblast and potentially threaten neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast.

The Kyiv Independent reached out to Ukraine's military for additional comment.

UN secretary general warns ‘last lifelines' may soon collapse after Israeli forces attack WHO facilities in Deir al-Balah

Israel is facing intensifying international condemnation for its killing of starving Palestinian civilians in Gaza, and its attacks on humanitarian efforts, as the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said the “last lifelines keeping people alive [in the strip] are collapsing”.

An angry chorus of senior figures, among them the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and a senior Catholic cleric, expressed on Tuesday a growing sense of global horror over Israel's actions.

“I spoke again with [the Israeli foreign minister] Gideon Saar to recall our understanding on aid flow and made clear that IDF [Israel Defense Forces] must stop killing people at distribution points,” the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on X. “The killing of civilians seeking aid in Gaza is indefensible.”

She said “all options were on the table” if Israel does not deliver on aid pledges, but did not say what those options included.

According to UN officials on Tuesday, more than 1,000 desperate Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of May trying to reach food distributions run by the controversial US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) amid widening conditions of starvation in the Palestinian territory.

The comments came as Israeli forces attacked warehousing and staff accommodation in Deir al-Balah – Gaza's main aid hub – belonging to the World Health Organization.

The Israeli strikes on WHO facilities came as Israel cancelled the work visa of Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) inside Gaza and the most senior UN aid official in the coastal strip.

Speaking to the UN security council on Tuesday, Guterres described the situation in Gaza as a “horror show” condemning the Israeli attacks on UN offices.

“Malnourishment is soaring and starvation is knocking on every door in Gaza,”Guterres said. “And now we are seeing the last gasp of a humanitarian system built on humanitarian principles. That system is being denied the conditions to function. Denied the space to deliver. Denied the safety to save lives.”

Guterres' comments came hours after a hard-hitting joint statement on Monday by 27 western countries including the UK, France, Australia and Canada harshly criticising Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid and calling for an immediate end to the war.

Guterres said he “deplored the growing reports of children and adults suffering from malnutrition” as health officials in Gaza reported a further 33 deaths, including 12 children, in the past 48 hours.

Lammy amplified that message in an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, describing himself as “appalled [and] sickened” by what was happening in Gaza.

“These are not words that are usually used by a foreign secretary who is attempting to be diplomatic,” Lammy said.

“But when you see innocent children holding out their hand for food, and you see them shot and killed in the way that we have seen in the last few days, of course Britain must call it out.”

Thameen Al-Kheetan, a UN human rights office spokesperson, said: “Over 1,000 Palestinians have now been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food in Gaza since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operating.

“As of 21 July, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near UN and other humanitarian organisations' aid convoys.”

The head of the UN's main agency for Palestinians, Unrwa, on Tuesday described Gaza as a “hell on earth”.

Philippe Lazzarini said Unrwa's own staff, as well as doctors and humanitarian workers, were fainting on duty owing to hunger and exhaustion as Israel limited access to life-saving humanitarian aid, and that many were surviving on a single small meal a day.

“Caretakers, including Unrwa colleagues in Gaza, are also in need of care now – doctors, nurses, journalists, humanitarians, among them Unrwa staff, are hungry. Many are now fainting due to hunger and exhaustion while performing their duties,” he said in a statement at a media briefing in Geneva.

The UN World Food Programme on Monday said its assessments showed a quarter of the population of Gaza was facing “famine-like” conditions and almost 100,000 women and children were suffering from severe acute malnutrition.

The most recent assessment of hunger in Gaza by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a group that includes the World Food Programme and the WHO, said about 10% of the territory's population – 244,000 people – were facing catastrophic levels of hunger and 93% were experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity.

Separately, the Roman Catholic church's most senior cleric in the Holy Land said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “morally unacceptable”, after visiting the wartorn Palestinian territory.

“We have seen men holding out in the sun for hours in the hope of a simple meal,” Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, told a news conference. “It's morally unacceptable and unjustified.”

Despite the high-profile criticism in recent days, aid agencies have criticised the lack of meaningful action by the governments who signed the joint statement, including the UK, against Israel.

Kristyan Benedict, of Amnesty International UK, said the British government's “failure to take robust measures to prevent genocide is no accident”, adding that “as a state party to the genocide convention, the UK has a legal duty to prevent and punish genocide – a duty it is failing miserably to uphold”.

The growing international furore came as Israeli troops pushed into the city of Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, where a number of international aid organisations are based, in what appeared to be the latest effort to carve up the Palestinian territory with military corridors.

Deir al-Balah is the only city in the Gaza Strip that has not experienced major ground operations or suffered widespread devastation in 21 months of war, leading to speculation that the Hamas militant group holds large numbers of hostages there.

            Stephen Colbert gained a little help from his friends and late-night rivals on Monday, his first night back on “The Late Show” since announcing that CBS is ending the legendary show.
    


            NBC's Jimmy Fallon, HBO's John Oliver, and Comedy Central's Jon Stewart were among the faces in the “Late Show” crowd during a spoof of the now-famous “Coldplay cam.”
    


            The fellow comedians didn't speak and they didn't have to: Being there was the point.
    


            The “Late Show” cancellation raised concerns about the future of late-night comedy — and about something bigger. Are big TV networks going to keep supporting political satire and free speech at a time when President Trump's campaign of retribution is rattling corporate America?
    


            “Some people see this show going away as a sign of something truly dire,” Colbert acknowledged Monday night.
    


            “And while I am a big fan of me, I don't necessarily agree with that statement,” he said. “Because we here at ‘The Late Show' never saw our job as changing anything other than how you felt at the end of the day.”
    


            He also made some jokes about CBS saying the show was ending for “purely financial” reasons. Through humor, he raised an eyebrow at news reports about the show becoming unprofitable, though he didn't directly dispute that.
    


            “Folks, I'm going to go ahead and say it: Cancel culture has gone too far,” he quipped.
    


            After the “Coldplay cam” spoof, which was led by Lin-Manuel Miranda and “Weird Al” Yankovic, Colbert pretended that CBS had just cancelled the song because it lost money.
    


            The cameos were a testament to Colbert's long-lasting relationships in the TV industry. Fallon and his NBC colleague Seth Meyers were seated together. Bravo late-night host Andy Cohen sat with his best friend, CNN's Anderson Cooper. Actors Adam Sandler and Christopher McDonald were there with Robert Smigel and his Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.
    


             Beyond the partisan arguments about whether anti-Trump comics are funny is a broader fear about institutions caving to Trump and removing room for dissent.
    


            There is a long history of American TV networks giving comics space to poke politicians and even network executives in the eye, despite the potential ramifications. Fans feel that tradition is under threat now.
    


            Outside the “Late Show” studio, the Ed Sullivan Theater, on Monday, pro-Colbert and anti-Trump protesters held up signs criticizing CBS for cancelling the show. One sign read, “Silencing comedians is no joke.” Another read, “Colbert forever.”
    


            Stewart spoke out about it from his own television perch, “The Daily Show,” on Monday night. Both shows are owned by the same company, Paramount Global, which has been in a perilous political position in recent months. Colbert catapulted to fame on Stewart's show twenty years ago; the two men have remained friends ever since; and Stewart is now an executive producer of Colbert's “Late Show,” so he has some visibility into the situation.
    


            “If you're trying to figure out why Stephen's show is ending, I don't think the answer can be found in some smoking gun email or phone call from Trump to CBS executives, or in CBS's QuickBooks spreadsheets on the financial health of late night,” Stewart said on-air.
    


            “I think the answer in the fear and pre-compliance that is gripping all of America's institutions at this very moment — institutions that have chosen not to fight the vengeful and vindictive actions of our pubic hair-doodling commander in chief,” he said.
    


            Stewart, whose “Daily Show” contract expires at the end of this year, added, “This is not the moment to give in. I'm not giving in! I'm not going anywhere — I think.”
    


            Stewart also had a profane message for Paramount and other media companies: “If you believe, as corporations or as networks, you can make yourselves so innocuous, that you can serve a gruel so flavorless that you will never again be on the boy king's radar, why will anyone watch you, and you are f***ing wrong.”
    


            “The Late Show” has been a cornerstone of the CBS programming schedule for decades, so fans and industry followers were shocked when the network announced its cancellation last Thursday.
    


            Top executives at CBS said it was an “agonizing” decision but one that was unrelated to “other matters happening at Paramount.” In other words, the merger.
    


            Paramount has been attempting to merge with Skydance Media, which means billions of dollars and some big egos are on the line. However, the deal requires approval from the Trump administration, and the review process has been taking longer than usual, which has raised concerns about political interference.
    


            Earlier this month, while Colbert and “The Late Show” were on a mid-summer break, Paramount settled Trump's legally dubious lawsuit against CBS News by agreeing to pay $16 million toward his future presidential library.
    


            The settlement was widely criticized, and Colbert joined the chorus when he returned from vacation last week, likening the payoff to a “big fat bribe.”
    


            Two days after that telecast, Colbert was informed that CBS was retiring “The Late Show” franchise. The move will take effect next May, when Colbert's contract expires and the broadcast TV season ends.
    


            Colbert referred to the settlement again on Monday night's show. He cited the media leaks indicating that the “Late Show” was losing “between $40 million and $50 million a year.”
    


            “Forty million's a big number,” Colbert said. “I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million… oh, yeah.”
    


            Meantime, the founding host of “The Late Show,” David Letterman, weighed in on the franchise's retirement on Monday by publishing to his YouTube channel a 20-minute highlight reel of his past jokes about CBS. The video caption read: “You can't spell CBS without BS.”

TUNIS, July 22. /TASS/. The tense situation in the Syrian province of Suwayda threatens to plunge the country into a deeper crisis, the Democratic Syria Council, linked to the Kurdish autonomous administration in the country's northeast, said.

The Democratic Syria Council claims that what's happening in Suwayda is "a sign of the collapse of the country's political and institutional system," as well as of "the central government's inability to perform its duty to manage a variety of ethnic groups and ensure civil order." The council warned about "the risk of [the country] sliding into domestic conflicts of religious, regional or civic nature," which could have "devastating consequences."

The council called for convening "a comprehensive nationwide conference" to chart a new political course for the country "based on transitional justice and a decentralized, pluralistic system." The body also demanded an end to all "forms of incitement to hatred and acts of provocation in the media and politics," which pose a direct threat to civil peace.

On July 13, clashes between Arab tribal militias and Druze self-defense units broke out in the Suwayda province. On July 15, the Syrian army entered the region's eponymous capital and launched a mop-up operation in order to restore stability. A while later, Israel began conducting strikes on the Syrian army's military convoys, citing a desire to protect the Druze population; on July 16, Israel attacked several strategic facilities in Damascus.

On July 19, Syrian's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa declared a ceasefire in Suwayda based on a settlement plan developed together with international mediators, including the US.

As Harvard's feud with Trump escalated, so did tensions over an ‘education and Palestine' issue of a prestigious journal. Scholars blame the ‘Palestine exception' to academic freedom

In March 2024, six months into Israel's war in Gaza, education in the territory was decimated. Schools were closed – most had been turned into shelters – and all 12 of the strip's universities were partially or fully destroyed.

Against that backdrop, a prestigious American education journal decided to dedicate a special issue to “education and Palestine”. The Harvard Educational Review (HER) put out a call for submissions, asking academics around the world for ideas for articles grappling with the education of Palestinians, education about Palestine and Palestinians, and related debates in schools and colleges in the US.

“The field of education has an important role to play in supporting students, educators, and policymakers in contextualizing what has been happening in Gaza with histories and continuing impacts of occupation, genocide, and political contestations,” the journal's editors wrote in their call for abstracts.

A little more than a year later, the scale of destruction in Gaza was exponentially larger. The special issue, which was slated to be published this summer, was just about ready – contracts with most authors were finalized and articles were edited. They covered topics from the annihilation of Gaza's schools to the challenges of teaching about Israel and Palestine in the US.

But on 9 June, the Harvard Education Publishing Group, the journal's publisher, abruptly canceled the release. In an email to the issue's contributors, the publisher cited “a number of complex issues”, shocking authors and editors alike, the Guardian has learned.

US universities have come under intensifying attacks from the Trump administration over accusations of tolerating antisemitism on campuses. Many have responded by restricting protest, punishing students and faculty outspoken about Palestinian rights, and scrutinizing academic programs home to scholarship about Palestine.

But the cancellation of an entire issue of an academic journal, which has not been previously reported, is a remarkable new development in a mounting list of examples of censorship of pro-Palestinian speech.

The Guardian spoke with four scholars who had written for the issue, and one of the journal's editors. It also reviewed internal emails that capture how enthusiasm about a special issue intended to promote “scholarly conversation on education and Palestine amid repression, occupation, and genocide” was derailed by fears of legal liability and devolved into recriminations about censorship, integrity and what many scholars have come to refer to as the “Palestine exception” to academic freedom.

Paul Belsito, a spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote in a statement to the Guardian that the decision to cancel the special issue followed nine months of conversations and an “overall lack of internal alignment” about the issue.

The authors see it differently. “If the universities – or in this case a university press – are not willing to stand up for what is core to their mission, I don't know what they're doing. What's the point?” said Thea Abu El-Haj, a Palestinian-American anthropologist of education at Barnard College, the women's school affiliated with Columbia University, who was one of the solicited authors.

Harvard has been embroiled in a bitter battle with the Trump administration over millions in federal funding cuts and the revocation of its eligibility to host international students. In April, it became the first and so far only university to sue the administration, earning praise for its resistance to Trump's onslaught.

But Harvard has also cracked down on Palestine scholarship, demotings scholars and canceling related programs. “Harvard is being held up as the heroic institution, but what's happening internally is much more complicated,” said Abu El-Haj.

In January, as part of a legal settlement with Jewish students who had accused Harvard of tolerating and promoting antisemitism on campus, the university adopted a controversial definition that critics argue conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel.

In an email to the authors announcing the cancellation, the executive director of the publishing group did not cite antisemitism; she wrote the decision stemmed from what she described as an inadequate review process and the need for “considerable copy editing”.

The journal's editorial board rejected that characterization and said they had been sidelined by the publisher in making the decision. The decision to cancel the issue was “out of alignment with the values that have guided HER for nearly a century”, the board members wrote in a collective statement.

The announcement came after the publishers had demanded that the articles be submitted to a legal review late into the process – a step the authors found highly unusual and called a “dangerous form of institutional censorship” in a joint letter objecting to the demand. The publisher's request was prompted by fear the issue would attract antisemitism claims, said one editor.

The dispute underscores the unprecedented restraints placed on knowledge production amid escalating accusations of antisemitism on campuses and the Trump administration's crusade against higher education. But it also signals the levels to which universities are abandoning their stated commitments out of fears of legal or financial repercussions.

“Even within the broader landscape around Palestine in the university, it's unprecedented,” said Chandni Desai, a professor at the University of Toronto and author of one of the scrapped articles. “You just don't solicit work, peer-review it, have people sign contracts, advertise the articles, and then cancel not just one article, but an entire special issue.”

The Harvard Educational Review is a century-old academic journal that publishes research and opinion geared to education academics and professionals and is considered a leading publication in the field. It is published by the Harvard Education Publishing Group, a division of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and edited by doctoral students at the university.

The Palestine issue was slated to include a dozen research articles, essays and other writings on topics ranging from education in Israel-Palestine and among the Palestinian diaspora, to academic freedom in the US. They explored the evolution of the concept of “scholasticide”, a term describing the systematic annihilation of education first coined during Israel's 2008 invasion of Gaza; the “ethical and educational responsibilities” of English language teachers in the West Bank; and the impact of “crackdowns on dissent” on teaching about Palestine in US higher education institutions, according to finalized abstracts of the articles shared with the Guardian.

Abu El-Haj's piece, co-authored with two other scholars, explored the “centrality of education in the struggle for Palestinian liberation”, drawing from an oral history project on the experiences of teachers with the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. The journal's editors were so enthusiastic about her piece that last spring they selected it with two others to promote the upcoming special issue on the back cover of the spring one.

The special issue was also formally announced at an annual gathering of education scholars in Chicago in March. “There was quite a lot of interest in it,” said Jo Kelcey, a professor at the Lebanese American University in Beirut and one of Abu El-Haj's co-authors.

The authors received the first inkling of trouble shortly after that.

Rabea Eghbariah, a Palestinian doctoral candidate at Harvard Law School, had been solicited to write the afterword for the special issue. In 2023, a different Harvard journal, the Harvard Law Review, had blocked publication of an article it had commissioned from him. When the Columbia Law Review published the piece instead, that journal's board responded by temporarily shutting down its entire website. Wary of that experience, Eghbariah specifically requested to amend his contract with the Harvard Educational Review to add a clause seeking to safeguard his academic freedom. After a long silence, the journal declined his request in April.

“It is incredibly shameful to see a university publication so explicitly betraying its mission and rejecting a clause on protecting academic freedom,” said Eghbariah, who did not sign the contract. “My afterword specifically is about Nakba denialism – the phenomenon of manipulating facts to affirm Zionism and shape knowledge with regards to Palestine – and it is quite ironic that it is being denied publication.”

Days after their response to Eghbariah, the journal's editorial board wrote to the authors, citing an “increasingly challenging climate” and asking for their availability for a meeting, which never ended up happening. “As a part of a scholarly community deeply committed to uplifting Palestinian voices and scholarship, we are facing some increasingly unprecedented contexts,” they wrote.

The email offered little detail, but for weeks, the journal's editors had been under mounting pressure from the publisher. In January, they were told that an “institutional review” of the manuscripts would be required. In February, the publisher tried – without the editors' knowledge – to alter the back cover of the spring issue promoting some of the forthcoming articles, according to email correspondence reviewed by the Guardian. (The printing company flagged the change to the editors, who reversed it.) In conversations with the editors – although not in writing – the publisher acknowledged that it was seeking a “risk assessment” legal review by Harvard's counsel out of fear the issue's publication would prompt antisemitism claims, an editor said.

As tensions came to a head, the board again contacted the authors in early May, to inform them of the requested legal review.

It was an extraordinary demand, the authors and editor interviewed by the Guardian said. Legal reviews would sometimes be requested for a specific article when there is a libel concern – but early in the process, and not for an entire issue, they noted.

“This doesn't happen, certainly not at the point where you've been accepted for publication and you've signed contracts,” said Kelcey. “This is not the way scholarship is supposed to operate.”

By then, the Trump administration had upended higher education by threatening billions of dollars in funding from universities in the US over their responses to pro-Palestinian protests. Harvard had sued in April, escalating its feud with the president. The authors, who hadn't initially been in touch, found each other and organised a collective response, slamming the request for a legal review at that stage as “unprecedented”, they wrote in a 15 May letter to the journal's editorial board and publisher. “This sends a dangerous message to scholars globally: that academic publishing contracts are conditional, revocable, and subject to external political calculations.”

The authors asked for the legal review to be reconsidered. But less than a month later, the press's executive director, Jessica Fiorillo, wrote to them that the issue was being pulled altogether. In an email seen by the Guardian, she claimed the manuscripts were “unready for publication”, in part due to a copy editor's resignation. She also cited an unspecified “failure to adhere to an adequate review process”, a “lack of internal alignment” between the authors, editors and the publisher, and “the lack of a clear and expedient path forward to resolving the myriad issues at play”.

“This difficult situation is exacerbated by very significant lack of agreement about the path forward, including and especially whether to publish such a special issue at this time,” she wrote.

The copy-editing issue wasn't just a personnel one. The publisher's letter claimed that the review editors “provided highly restrictive editing guidelines to the copy editor under contract to work on the special issue, limiting her focus to grammar, punctuation, and syntax errors, and directing her to refrain from offering any editorial suggestions to address, in the editors' words, ‘politically charged' content”. It claimed that the copy editor resigned in large part because of those restrictions.

Fiorillo added that it would be “entirely appropriate” to subject the work to legal checks for “any libelous or unlawful material” but that no such review had taken place. She added that the cancellation was not “due to censorship of a particular viewpoint nor does it connect to matters of academic freedom”.

The journal's editors were blindsided. “The Editorial Board has not been made privy to any internal decision-making at HEPG regarding the Special Issue, and we only learned about this communication and decision 30 minutes before it was sent out,” they wrote to the authors shortly after Fiorillo's email.

In a longer letter to the authors, two days later, they rebutted Fiorillo's claims about irregularities in the review process and expressed disappointment with the decision to cancel the issue.

“It is a deep loss that your work will not appear in the pages of [Harvard Educational Review] as we intended – for HER, for the field of education, and for social justice,” they wrote.

Regarding the publisher's claim regarding overly restrictive copy-editing guidelines, the editors said that they were asked by the publisher to develop copy-editing guidelines – something that hadn't been required for previous issues – and that they invited feedback at multiple points in the process.

It is not clear how far up within Harvard's administration the decision to cancel the issue had come from. Belsito, the spokesperson for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, wrote that Harvard's office of the general counsel does not “make or direct editorial decisions” for the school or its publishing group.

“HEPG acknowledges the disappointment this decision may have caused for the authors and remains deeply committed to our robust editorial process, only publishing work of the highest scholarly quality through a process rooted in integrity, collaboration, and editorial rigor,” he added.

The Harvard chapter of the American Association of University Professors which got involved after learning about the cancellation, believes the decision came from the publisher.

“To us, it sounded like a textbook example of the killing of speech and academic inquiry related to Palestine,” said Kirsten Weld, a history professor and the chapter's president. “Thus far, though our fact-finding remains incomplete, it looks like the impetus came from Harvard Education Publishing Group.”

One of the editors of the Harvard Educational Review, who asked for anonymity citing the repressive climate in academia, said that the pressure from the publisher on the editors ramped up shortly before Trump took office. The request to subject the entirety of the edited manuscripts to a risk assessment was “totally abnormal” the editor said. “I didn't even know the [office of the general counsel] review was an option, I had never heard of it.”

The censorship of the issue, the editor added, is “exactly how authoritarianism grows”.

The members of the editorial board who worked on the issue said that they had done their best to “advance this work amidst a climate of repression and institutional accommodation”.

“As we reflect on this moment, we urge the scholarly community to defend the ability to publish rigorous, justice-oriented scholarship without interference and repression,” they added.

The ordeal was a “test case” for academic freedom, said Desai, whose article on scholasticide, co-written with three Palestinian colleagues, was also directly solicited and advertised on the back of the spring journal issue. (It was the teaser to their article that the publishers tried to remove from the back of the previous issue, without the editors' knowledge.)

Desai criticized the cancellation as a “serious breach and violation of academic freedom and integrity” but also an affront to the labor of scholars who are “writing these articles during a genocide”.

She and her co-authors, including a dean at Al-Azhar University in Gaza, were not merely documenting the resilience of Palestinian education amid the destruction but were personally involved in those efforts, she noted. Many of their colleagues and students were killed as the group worked on the article. “This is not some abstract academic exercise,” said Desai. “I can't keep stressing the urgency of this article as we're watching universities being blown up.”

The authors are in talks with other journals and hope their pieces can be published together as planned. All those interviewed by the Guardian expressed fear that the incident would deter other scholars from pursuing work on Palestine – a longstanding problem that they say has only been exacerbated over the last two years. “There's this risk of kind of closing down the democratic space,” said Kelcey.

As Israel and Palestine have become the flashpoint for a rapidly deteriorating climate for free speech and academic freedom in the US, Harvard has already demoted two faculty members leading the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (one of whom wrote the forward for the cancelled issue), suspended a partnership with Birzeit University in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and ended a divinity school initiative dedicated to the conflict.

Scholars fear that the the capitulation of universities is hurting an entire field of study at the time when it's most needed. But Abu El-Haj warned that the special issue's cancellation also set a dangerous precedent for the independence of scholarship on a variety of subjects. She accused the publisher of “anticipatory compliance” and warned that “it's not going to stop with Palestine,” she said.

But she also sounded a note of optimism. In a sign of the growing chasm between decision-makers and the broader public on the issue, she said that the war in Gaza had led to unprecedented interest among students in Palestine coursework and scholarship.

She recalled being a student in the US during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and the massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by Israeli-backed Lebanese militias. “There were three of us protesting,” she recalled. “I never would have imagined in my life I'd see the encampments that happened last year.

“We're in a really critical juncture,” she added. “The level of repression that we're seeing is related to the shift in the narrative, and the loss of control over that narrative.”

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick in Washington.Leah Millis/Reuters

Any time Howard Lutnick is interviewed, you're guaranteed a whole lot of mishegas. But because he's the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and his words are tailored to express what he thinks the boss wants to hear, attention must be paid. Even to the nonsense. Especially to the nonsense.

In a Sunday morning chat with the CBS TV program Face the Nation, Mr. Lutnick said some things that are positive for trade between Canada and its largest trading partner. Unfortunately, he said even more things that suggest long-term negatives for our previously free-trading relationship.

On the plus side, he said that the 35-per-cent tariff that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on Aug. 1 would not apply to all Canadian exports, but only those outside the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. This isn't news – immediately after Mr. Trump announced the levy earlier this month, White House spokespersons quietly briefed the media that it is not intended to apply to all Canadian goods, only those not covered by the USMCA. But it's good to hear the exemption reiterated. It suggests that it's U.S. policy, for now.

Trump's tariffs haven't raised prices yet. That might be a bad sign

Premiers' meeting expected to focus on tariffs and trade

Mr. Lutnick said that 75 per cent of goods currently move tariff-free among Mexico, the U.S. and Canada, while an analysis last month from RBC Economics puts the figure even higher, with 89 per cent of Canadian exports USMCA-complaint in April. Whatever the level, take it as a sign that the Trump administration does not want the markets or the American public to believe that it's trying to end free trade with Canada.

That's why Mr. Lutnick justified existing and possible future tariffs on Canada as an action forced upon the U.S. “Unless you stop this fentanyl and close the border,” he said, the U.S. would have no choice but to hit Canada with tariffs. 

Though in the next breath he added that, even if Canada addressed the imaginary fentanyl problem, tariffs could remain.

“The President understands that we need to open the markets,” he said. “Canada is not open to us. They need to open their market. Unless they're willing to open their market, they're going to pay a tariff. That's a simple message the President has. It's fair trade, it's reciprocal trade. Why should we have our country be wide open while theirs is closed?”

That is the most magnificent mille-feuille of mishegas. It's layer upon layer of flaky nonsense.

Until five minutes ago, Canada and the U.S. had very low or no tariffs on each other's exports. The Canadian market is not “closed” to American goods or services, which is why Canada is the world's largest buyer of American goods and services. Take oil and gas out of the mix, and the U.S. even runs a trade surplus with us.

The Trump administration wants higher tariffs, and it's willing to tell all sorts of tall tales to get there. It especially needs to tell tales to American voters, because they are not excited about tariffs.

Notice how Mr. Lutnick described Mr. Trump's trade policy: “It's fair trade, it's reciprocal trade.”

To quote noted Spanish trade expert Inigo Montoya, “You keep using that word” – reciprocal. “I do not think it means what you think it means.”

The Commerce Secretary celebrated two recently announced trade frameworks as examples of this reciprocity. There's an agreement with Vietnam, said to involve a 20-per-cent tariff on exports to the U.S., and an Indonesian deal, with a 19-per-cent U.S. tariff. Details are sketchy, but Washington claims that in return, American goods will get visa-free access to these countries. 

I don't know what dictionary was the preferred supplier at Trump University, but in every other lexicon, the arrangements with Indonesia and Vietnam are the opposite of reciprocal. They are – and the Trump administration is celebrating them as – asymmetrical trade, not free trade. No tariff for me; a fat tariff for thee.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said last week that the Americans are signalling that they don't want to make a deal that doesn't include tariffs, and on Sunday Mr. Lutnick underlined that. It appears to be the Trump administration one clear policy goal in all discussions with its trade partners.

Asked about the 10-per-cent baseline tariff imposed on most countries (but not Canada, at least not yet, because of the USMCA), he replied that “10 per cent is definitely going to stay. Many countries will pay higher.”

As for the future of free-ish trade under USMCA, which he had been touting a moment earlier, Mr. Lutnick said that of course the treaty will have to be renegotiated next year. And he left no mistaking that in his view the U.S. goal in those negotiations would be less free trade and more tariffs. He said, as Mr. Trump has repeatedly said, that the President, “doesn't want cars built in Canada or Mexico when they can be built in Michigan or Ohio.”

If you're trying to come to an agreement with someone, and the person on the other side of the table is constantly changing their demands and the reasons for them, there are two possibilities. The first is that they don't know what they want. The second is that they know exactly what they want.

Ukraine carried out a wave of overnight drone attacks across Russia on July 22, Moscow said, while a Ukrainian official said that one of the targets was a key military-linked facility.

In Russia's Samara Oblast, Governor Vyacheslav Fedorishchev said several drones were destroyed while attempting to strike an industrial facility. 

Fedorishchev reported no casualties or damage but confirmed that authorities temporarily restricted mobile internet in the area to allegedly assist military efforts in neutralizing the drones.

According to Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, the target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives. 

These materials are used in artillery shells, aerial bombs, cluster munitions, and rockets — critical components of Russia's military operations, he said.

"The volume of processing (of raw materials) is about 1 million tons per year," Kovalenko said. It remains unclear whether the facility suffered any damage.

Samara lies roughly 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the Ukraine-Russia border.

Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses intercepted and destroyed 35 fixed-wing drones overnight in various regions, including those near Moscow, the Black Sea, and several western and southern oblasts. 

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin confirmed that a drone was downed en route to the capital, with emergency services responding at the debris site. This marks the sixth consecutive night of drone attacks on Moscow.

The Kyiv Independent could not verify these reports.

Kyiv has repeatedly targeted Russian industrial and military facilities deep in the rear to undermine Moscow's ability to wage its all-out war.

Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments.

The legislation grants the prosecutor general new powers over investigations led by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and cases led by the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office.

The announcement comes as pro-Western President Maia Sandu, who narrowly secured reelection last year, seeks to preserve her parliamentary majority and advance Moldova's bid for EU accession.



The breach reportedly prompted an urgent response from Ukrainian units to prevent the situation "from spiraling into disaster."

Russian schoolchildren are recruited into drone development and other military programs through seemingly harmless video games, state-run competitions, and promises of academic and career advancement.

An SBU officer is suspected of demanding a $300,000 bribe from a person under investigation for allegedly organizing illegal border crossings for military-age men during wartime, NABU said.

Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council has imposed a moratorium on business inspections by state authorities, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 21, calling the move essential for the country's economic security.

The delegation will be led by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov and include representatives from Ukraine's military intelligence, the Foreign Ministry, and the Presidential Office.

The target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council.

Russian forces launched 42 Shahed-type attack drones and other drones overnight, primarily from Russia and occupied Crimea, Ukraine's Air Force said. At least 26 drones were shot down, and seven more were lost or suppressed by electronic warfare systems, according to the statement.

Irina Podnosova had headed Russia's chief judiciary body since April 17, 2024, when she was appointed to the post as the only candidate, being nominated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The meeting will be the pope's first audience with the senior Russian cleric, who represented Patriarch Kirill, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, at Pope Francis's funeral.

Russian forces launched a drone strike on Ukraine's northeastern Sumy Oblast on July 21, injuring 11 people, including a 5-year-old boy, local officials said.

Speaking during the 29th Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said he reached the agreement with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a recent trip to Washington.

The number includes 1,090 casualties that Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

ROME, July 22. /TASS/. The cancellation of a concert by Valery Gergiev, People's Artist of Russia, in Italy's Caserta harms diplomacy and only intensifies existing tensions, Danilo Della Valle, member of the European Parliament from Italy's opposition party, Movimento 5 Stelle (Five Star Movement), stated.

In a video address on his Facebook page (banned in Russia due to its ownership by Meta, which has been designated as extremist), Della Valle noted that those who supported the cancellation, including members of the ruling Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy) party and the opposition Democratic Party, were "celebrating as if they had ended the conflict between Russia and Ukraine." The parliamentarian's video featured the Dance of the Knights score by Sergey Prokofiev from the Romeo and Juliet ballet in the background.

"Politics is a far more complex process, and decisions like this only exacerbate the situation from a political and diplomatic standpoint. For the city of Caserta, this also represents a missed opportunity," Della Valle emphasized.

Earlier, the administration of the Royal Palace of Caserta announced the cancellation of Gergiev's performance on July 27 as part of the Un'Estate da Re (Summer of the King) festival with the Orchestra of the Teatro Verdi di Salerno, featuring soloists from the Mariinsky Theatre. The program included works by Giuseppe Verdi, Pyotr Tchaikovsky, and Maurice Ravel.

            Students were attending afternoon classes when the BAF F7 jet hit the two-story campus around 1:18 p.m. local time (3:18 a.m. EST) after a mechanical fault, according to state media BSS News, citing the country's armed forces.
    


            The plane's pilot made “every effort to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas toward a more sparsely inhabited location,” the military said. The pilot was among those killed, The Associated Press reported, citing regional officials.
    


            Authorities have launched an investigation into the cause of the crash.
    


            Of those killed, 25 were children and 78 people are receiving treatment at various hospitals in Dhaka, Dr Md Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, told reporters on Tuesday.
    


            Scores of people rushed toward the crash site, where emergency crews could be seen trying to extinguish the smoking wreckage of the jet.
    


            The government announced a day of mourning and special prayers, BSS News said.
    


            “I express my deep grief and sorrow over the tragic incident of casualties caused by the crash,” the country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus wrote in a post on X.
    


            “This is a moment of profound pain for the nation. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured and direct all concerned authorities, including hospitals, to address the situation with the utmost priority,” he added.
    


            Eyewitnesses, including the parents of students, recalled huge plumes of ash rising over the school – after a banging sound rang out following the deadly crash.
    


            “When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realized something came from behind,” Masud Tarik, also a teacher at the school, told Reuters. “I heard an explosion. When I looked back, I only saw fire and smoke.”
    


            Others watched the chaotic aftermath unfold on TV. “I was terrified watching videos,” Rafiqa Taha, a student at the facility, told The Associated Press.
    


            “My God! It's my school,” added the 16-year-old.
    


            Milestone College teaches students from ages 4 to 18, according to its website.
    


            Video from Bangladesh's Channel 24 showed smoke billowing as firefighters sprayed water onto the crash site while onlookers gathered around. Other rescue workers searched the rubble.
    


            Video from the hospital shows people being urgently rushed in.
    


            A family member is heard saying his injured sister is a grade four student. Another family member told Channel 24 a first batch of victims arrived at the hospital with severe burns.
    


            “We literally saw skin being torn off,” she said.
    


            A young, injured girl told Channel 24 from her hospital bed: “When we came out, we saw many students who had been charred.”
    


            Condolences came in from across the region with Pakistan and India's prime ministers expressing their solidarity with Bangladesh.

National security leaders rarely get to choose what to care about and how much to care about it. They are more often subjects of circumstances beyond their control. The September 11 attacks reversed the George W. Bush administration's plan to reduce the United States' global commitments and responsibilities. Revolutions across the Arab world pushed President Barack Obama back into the Middle East just as he was trying to pull the United States out. And Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended the Biden administration's goal of establishing “stable and predictable” relations with Moscow so that it could focus on strategic competition with China.

Policymakers could foresee many of the underlying forces and trends driving these agenda-shaping events. Yet for the most part, they failed to plan for the most challenging manifestations of where these forces would lead. They had to scramble to reconceptualize and recalibrate their strategies to respond to unfolding events.

The rapid advance of artificial intelligence—and the possible emergence of artificial general intelligence—promises to present policymakers with even greater disruption. Indicators of a coming powerful change are everywhere. Beijing and Washington have made global AI leadership a strategic imperative, and leading U.S. and Chinese companies are racing to achieve AGI. News coverage features near-daily announcements of technical breakthroughs, discussions of AI-driven job loss, and fears of catastrophic global risks such as the AI-enabled engineering of a deadly pandemic.

There is no way of knowing with certainty the exact trajectory along which AI will develop or precisely how it will transform national security. Policymakers should therefore assess and debate the merits of competing AI strategies with humility and caution. Whether one is bullish or bearish about AI's prospects, though, national security leaders need to be ready to adapt their strategic plans to respond to events that could impose themselves on decision-makers this decade, if not during this presidential term. Washington must prepare for potential policy tradeoffs and geopolitical shifts, and identify practical steps it can take today to mitigate risks and turbocharge U.S. competitiveness. Some ideas and initiatives that today may seem infeasible or unnecessary will seem urgent and self-evident with the benefit of hindsight.

There is no standard, shared definition of AGI or consensus on whether, when, or how it might emerge. Today's frontier AI models are already increasingly capable of performing a greater number and complexity of cognitive tasks than the most skilled and best resourced humans. Since ChatGPT launched in 2022, the power of AI has increased by leaps and bounds. It is reasonable to assume that these models will become more powerful, autonomous, and diffuse in the coming years.

Nevertheless, the AGI era is not likely to announce itself with an earth-shattering moment as the nuclear era did with the first nuclear weapons test. Nor are the economic and technological circumstances as favorable to U.S. planners as they were in the past. In the nuclear era, for example, the U.S. government controlled the new technology, and planners had two decades to develop policy frameworks before a nuclear rival emerged. Planners today, by contrast, have less agency and time to adapt. China is already a near peer in technology, a handful of private companies are steering development, and AI is a general-purpose technology that is spreading to nearly every part of the economy and society.

In this rapidly changing environment, national security leaders should dedicate scarce planning resources to plausible but acutely challenging events. These types of events are not merely disruptions to the status quo but also signposts of alternative futures.

Say, for instance, that a U.S. company claims to have made the transformative technological leap to AGI. Leaders must decide how the U.S. government should respond if the company requests to be treated as a “national security asset.” This designation would grant the company public support that could allow it to secure its facilities, access sensitive or proprietary data, acquire more advanced chips, and avoid certain regulations. Alternatively, a Chinese firm may declare that it has achieved AGI before any of its U.S. rivals.



Policymakers grappling with these scenarios will have to balance competing and sometimes contradictory assessments, which will lead to different judgments about how much risk to accept and which concerns to prioritize. Without robust, independent analytic capabilities, the U.S. government may struggle to determine whether the firms' claims are credible. National security leaders will also have to consider whether the new technological advance could provide China with a strategic advantage. If they fear AGI could give Beijing the ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. critical infrastructure faster than cyberdefenses can patch them, for example, they may prescribe actions—such as trying to slow or sabotage China's AI development—that could escalate the risk of geopolitical conflict. On the other hand, if national security leaders are more concerned that nonstate actors or terrorists could use this new technology to create catastrophic bioweapons, they may prefer to try to cooperate with Beijing to prevent proliferation of a larger global threat.

Enhancing preparedness for AGI scenarios requires better understanding of the AI ecosystem at home and abroad. Government agencies need to keep up with how AI is developing to identify where new advances are most likely to emerge. This will reduce the risk of strategic surprise and help inform policy choices on which bottlenecks to prioritize and which vulnerabilities to exploit to potentially slow China's progress.

Policymakers also need to explore ways to work with the private sector and with other countries. A scalable, dynamic, and two-way private-public partnership is crucial for a strategic response to the current challenges that AI presents, and this will be even more the case in an AGI world. Mutual suspicion between government and the private sector could cripple any crisis response. Meanwhile, leaders will need to develop policies to share sensitive, proprietary information on developments in frontier AI with partners and allies. Without such policies, it will be challenging to build the international coalition needed to respond to an AI-induced crisis, reduce global risk, and hold countries and companies accountable for irresponsible behavior.

Artificial general intelligence will not only complicate existing geopolitical dynamics; it will also present novel national security challenges. Imagine an unprecedented AI-enabled cyberattack that wreaks havoc on financial institutions, private corporations, and government agencies and shuts down physical systems ranging from critical infrastructure to industrial robotics. In today's world, determining who is responsible for cyberwarfare is already a challenging and time-intensive task. Any number of state and nonstate actors possess both the means and motivations to carry out destabilizing attacks. In a world with increasingly advanced AI, however, the situation would be even more complex. Policymakers would have to contemplate not only the possibility that an operation of this scale might be the prelude to a military campaign but also that it might be the work of an autonomous, self-replicating AI agent.

Planning for this scenario requires evaluating how today's capabilities can handle tomorrow's challenges. Governments cannot rely on present-day tools and techniques to quickly and confidently assess a threat, let alone apply relevant countermeasures. Given AI systems' proven capacity to deceive and dissemble, current systems may be unable to determine whether an AI agent is operating on its own or at the behest of an adversary. Planners need to find new ways to assess its motivations and how to deter escalation.

Preparing for the worst requires reevaluating “attribution agnostic” steps to harden cyberdefenses, isolate potentially compromised data centers, and prevent the incapacitation of drones or connected vehicles. Planners need to assess whether current military and continuity of operations protocols can handle threats from adversarial AI. Public distrust of the government and technology companies will make it even more difficult to reassure a worried populace in the event of artificial intelligence–fueled misinformation. Given that an autonomous AI agent is not likely to respect national boundaries, adequate preparations would involve setting up channels with partners and adversaries alike to coordinate an effective international response.

How leaders diagnose the external impacts of an impending threat will shape how they react. In the event of a cyberattack, policymakers will have to make a real-time decision about whether to pursue targeted shutdowns of vulnerable cyber-physical systems and compromised data centers or—fearing the potential for rapid replication—impose a more comprehensive shutdown, which could prevent escalation but inhibit the functioning of the digital economy and systems on which airports and power plants rely. This loss-of-control scenario highlights the importance of clarifying legal authority and developing incident-response plans. More broadly, it reinforces the urgency of creating policies and technical strategies to address how advanced models are inclined to misbehave.

At minimum, planning should involve four types of actions. First, it should establish “no regret” actions that policymakers and private-sector players can take today to respond to events from a position of strength. Second, it should create “break glass” playbooks for future emergencies that can be continually updated as new threats, opportunities, and concepts emerge. Third, it should invest in capabilities that seem crucial across multiple scenarios. Finally, it should prioritize early indicators and warnings of strategic failure and create conditions for course corrections.

Planning for the impacts of AGI on national security needs to start now. In an increasingly competitive and combustible world, and with an economically fragile and politically polarized domestic environment, the United States cannot afford being caught by surprise.

Although it is possible that AI will ultimately prove to be a “normal technology”—a technology, like the Internet or electricity, that transforms the world but whose pace of adoption has natural limits that governments and societies can control—it would be foolish to assume that preparing for major disruption would be a mistake. Planning for more difficult challenges can help leaders identify core strategic issues and build response tools that will be equally useful in less severe circumstances. It would also be unwise to presume that such planning will generate policy instincts and pathways that exacerbate risks or slow AI advances. In the nuclear era, for example, planning for potential nuclear terrorism inspired global initiatives to secure the fissile material needed to make nuclear weapons that ultimately made the world safer.

It would also be dangerous to treat the possibility of AGI like any “normal scenario” in the national security world. Technological expertise and fluency across the government is limited and uneven, and the institutional players that would be involved in responding to any scenario extend far beyond traditional national security agencies. Most scenarios are likely to occur abroad and at home simultaneously. Any response will rely heavily on the choices and decisions of actors outside government, including companies and civil society organizations, that do not have a seat in the White House Situation Room and may not prioritize national security. Likewise, planning cannot be delegated to futurists and technical experts sent to a far-off bunker to spend months crafting detailed plans in isolation. Preparing for a future with AGI must continuously inform today's strategic debates.

There is an active debate about the merits of various strategies to win the competition for AI while avoiding catastrophe, but there has been less discussion about how AGI might reshape the international landscape, the distribution of global power, and geopolitical alliances. In an increasingly multipolar world, emerging players see advanced AI—and how the United States and China diffuse AI technology and its underlying digital architecture—as key to their national aspirations. Early planning, tabletop exercises with allies and partners, and sustained dialogue with countries that want to hedge their diplomatic bets will ensure that strategic choices are mutually beneficial. Any AI strategy that fails to account for a multipolar world and a more distributed global technology ecosystem will fail. And any national security strategy that fails to grapple with the potentially transformative effects of AGI will become irrelevant.

National security leaders don't get to choose their crises. They do, however, get to choose what to plan for and where to allocate resources to prepare for future challenges. Planning for AGI is not an indulgence in science fiction or a distraction from existing problems and opportunities. It is a responsible way to prepare for the very real possibility of a new set of national security challenges in a radically transformed world.

Reuters

11:42 JST, July 22, 2025

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, July 21 (Reuters) – China's Premier Li Qiang announced construction had begun on what will be the world's largest hydropower dam, on the eastern rim of the Tibetan Plateau, at an estimated cost of at least $170 billion, the official Xinhua news agency said.

Commencement of the hydropower project, China's most ambitious since the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, was seized by Chinese markets as proof of economic stimulus, sending stock prices and bond yields higher on Monday.

Made up of five cascade hydropower stations with the capacity to produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, equal to the amount of electricity consumed by Britain last year, the dam will be located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo. A section of the river tumbles 2,000 meters (6,561 feet) in a span of 50km (31 miles), offering huge hydropower potential.

India and Bangladesh have already raised concerns about its possible impact on the millions of people downstream, while NGOs warned of the risk to one of the richest and most diverse environments on the plateau.

Beijing has said the dam will help meet power demand in Tibet and the rest of China without having a major effect on downstream water supplies or the environment. Operations are expected sometime in the 2030s.

China's CSI Construction & Engineering Index .CSI399995 jumped as much as 4% to a seven-month high. Power Construction Corporation of China 601669.SS and Arcplus Group PLC 600629.SS surged by their 10% daily limit.

“From an investment perspective, mature hydropower projects offer bond-like dividends,” Wang Zhuo, partner of Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management said, while cautioning that speculative buying into related stocks would inflate valuations.

The project will drive demand for construction and building materials such as cement and civil explosives, Huatai Securities said in a note to clients.

Shares of Beijing-listed Hunan Wuxin Tunnel Intelligent Equipment Co 835174.BJE, which sells tunnel construction equipment, surged 30%. So did shares of Geokang Technologies Co Ltd 830879.BJE, which makes intelligent monitoring terminals.

Cement maker Xizang Tianlu Co Ltd 600326.SS and Tibet GaoZheng Explosive Co 002827.SZ, producer of civil explosive materials, both jumped their maximum 10%.

The Chinese premier described the dam as a “project of the century” and said special emphasis “must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Xinhua said on Saturday.

Government bond yields rose across the board on Monday, with the most-traded 30-year treasury futures CTLU5 falling to five-week lows, as investors interpreted the news as part of China's economic stimulus.

The project, overseen by the newly formed state-owned China Yajiang Group, marks a major boost in public investment to help bolster economic growth as current drivers show signs of faltering.

“Assuming 10 years of construction, the investment/GDP boost could reach 120 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) for a single year,” said Citi in a note. “The actual economic benefits could go beyond that.”

China has not given an estimate on the number of jobs the project could create.

The Three Gorges, which took almost two decades to complete, generated nearly a million jobs, state media reported, though it displaced at least a similar number of people.

Authorities have not indicated how many people would be displaced by the Yarlung Zangbo project.

The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra River as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India and finally into Bangladesh. NGOs say the dam will irreversibly harm the Tibetan Plateau and hit millions of people downstream.

The chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, said earlier this year that such a colossal dam barely 50km from the border could dry out 80% of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas in Arunachal and neighboring Assam state.

Some experts also express concerns for a project in a seismically active zone.

            Roughly 2,000 National Guard troops across multiple states are expected to be mobilized to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement at detention facilities, according to a US official and a source familiar with the planning.
    


            It's unclear when the troops will be mobilized, though the US official said the move, which is still under deliberation, could come as soon as this week. Both sources said the troops will be placed on Title 32 status, which puts them under the command of their governors and not subject to the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.
    


            The Trump administration has ramped up immigration arrests nationwide, resulting in a dramatic increase of people in ICE custody. As of Tuesday, there were around 57,000 people in ICE custody, according to federal data obtained by CNN. Senior Trump officials are preparing to expand detention space nationwide in the coming weeks after receiving a historic amount of funding from Congress.
    


            The US official said the mobilization is expected to call up National Guard troops from as many as 20 states who will be tasked with some hands-on roles including conducting finger printing and mouth swabbing of detainees. National Guard forces have largely been used to provide administrative assistance to ICE thus far, though the US official said ICE has communicated the need for assistance in other areas.
    


            A defense official said the Pentagon would not “speculate on future operations or operational needs, but DoD stands ready to support our DHS partners in executing the President's executive orders and protecting the United States' sovereign territory.”
    


            The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.
    


            The plans are in line with an earlier request from DHS to the Defense Department asking for thousands of National Guard personnel to assist with a range of tasks, including processing, transportation support and detention support. According to the request, obtained by CNN, up to 2,500 National Guard personnel were requested to support security at detention facilities, in-facility operations like meal distribution, processing and emergency response.
    


            A Senate aide said the expected move to put 2,000 Guardsmen on Title 32 status was significant and likely an indicator of the administration moving closer to the full request from DHS for thousands more Guardsmen to assist in immigration enforcement across the country.
    


            “If you're plotting the points on a graph of the way the administration has taken one step at a time, you continue that trajectory and it's going to look pretty similar to what DHS has been requesting, as far as 20,000 troops across the country performing what we'd consider to be immigration enforcement activities,” the aide said.
    


CNN has reported that the White House and Department of Homeland Security have been seeking ways to use the National Guard and the military more broadly to help bolster immigration enforcement around the country, in an effort to ramp up arrests of migrants.
    


            While ICE is preparing to receive an unprecedented $75 billion in funding, current and former Homeland Security officials say the recruiting and training of ICE personnel is likely to take weeks or months, requiring outside assistance in the interim.
    


            Roughly 4,000 National Guardsmen were mobilized last month to assist ICE personnel in Los Angeles, in response to protests and to protect federal personnel and property, though half of them have since been released from the mission.
    


            The Florida National Guard has also been mobilized to conduct base camp security at a new detention center in the Everglades, the Pentagon announced earlier this month, though a spokesperson for the Florida Guard previously said they had not yet been tasked with “detention or enforcement operations.”

Live Updates


            • Latest on Epstein case: President Donald Trump said it “sounds appropriate” for the Justice Department to reach out to convicted former Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. It comes amid recent calls for her to testify about the accused sex trafficker.
    


            • More on Epstein: The House will leave for its August recess a day earlier than planned, as GOP leaders hope to sap the momentum behind a push to force a vote on an Epstein-related measure.
    


• Obama fires back: Trump's allegations of treason and sedition against former President Barack Obama are “bizarre” and “ridiculous,” his spokesperson said after Trump lobbed the claims during an Oval Office meeting.
    


            President Donald Trump's allegations of treason and sedition against former President Barack Obama are “bizarre” and “ridiculous,” a spokesman for Obama said today after Trump lobbed the claims during an Oval Office meeting.
    


                    “Out of respect for the office of the presidency, our office does not normally dignify the constant nonsense and misinformation flowing out of this White House with a response. But these claims are outrageous enough to merit one. These bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction,” said Patrick Rodenbush, the former president's spokesman.
                





            Earlier today, Trump declared his intent to “go after people” for what he says were attempts to interfere in the 2016 election by claiming Russia was seeking to influence the result. Multiple comprehensive investigations have concluded that Russia did attempt to interfere in the election in favor of Trump.
    


            “Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” Trump said in the Oval Office, where he was hosting the president of the Philippines.
    


            Trump insisted Obama was guilty of crimes for what he said was his role in weaponizing intelligence, calling the former Democratic president the “ringleader” of the alleged conspiracy.
    


            He appeared to be pointing to information declassified and released last week by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard that she claimed was evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by top Obama administration officials to manufacture the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
    


            Obama's representative said nothing in the documents suggests a 2017 intelligence report on the matter was wrong.
    


            “Nothing in the document issued last week undercuts the widely accepted conclusion that Russia worked to influence the 2016 presidential election but did not successfully manipulate any votes,” Rodenbush said. “These findings were affirmed in a 2020 report by the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee, led by then-Chairman Marco Rubio.”
    


            The Trump administration has faced increasing backlash over its handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files after Attorney General Pam Bondi walked back her promise to release as many documents in the Justice Department's possession as possible, announcing that there is no evidence Epstein kept a “client list” or was murdered.
    


Here's the latest on this issue:



DOJ: The Department of Justice said it plans to reach out to Epstein's associate Ghislaine Maxwell for a meeting as calls grow for her to testify about the accused sex trafficker. Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. President Donald Trump said it “sounds appropriate” for the Justice Department to reach out for a meeting.
    


Possible delays: The federal judge overseeing Maxwell's case said he needs more information before he can unseal grand jury transcripts requested by the DOJ. Meanwhile, a person close to Maxwell said she will oppose the unsealing of grand jury materials related to her and Epstein.
    


GOP lawmakers: Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team told House Republicans that the administration needs time to deal with the issue, sources say. But many lawmakers were not pleased with that call for patience. The deadlock has essentially ground House floor activity to a halt. The House will leave for its August recess a day earlier as Republican GOP leaders hope to sap the momentum behind a push by GOP Rep. Thomas Massie to force a vote on an Epstein-related measure.
    


Meanwhile, in other news:



Trade deals: Trump said he reached a trade agreement with Philippines and the terms of a deal with Indonesia.
    


US out of UNESCO: Trump pulled the US out of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
    


Russia investigation: Trump declared his intent to “go after people” for what he says were attempts to interfere in the 2016 election by claiming Russia was seeking to influence the result. He insisted former President Barack Obama was guilty of crimes for what he said was his role in weaponizing intelligence.
    


US envoy departs: Steve Witkoff is heading to the Middle East to work toward a Gaza ceasefire, a spokesperson said.
    


Ghislaine Maxwell will oppose the unsealing of grand jury materials related to her and Jeffrey Epstein, according to a person close to her.
    


            It's the latest legal twist after the Department of Justice asked a judge to make the confidential proceedings available to the public.
    


A judge in Maxwell's case had asked her legal team to weigh in by August 5. Maxwell continues to attempt to appeal her conviction. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
    


            President Donald Trump said today he and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines have reached a trade agreement.
    


            The agreement calls for 19% tariffs on goods coming from the Philippines, while American goods shipped there won't be charged a tariff, Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
    


            This comes as the two leaders met in the White House today.
    


            The agreement is somewhat unusual given that other countries Trump claims to have reached agreements with call for lower tariff rates compared to levels the president threatened to impose in April. Meanwhile, goods from the Philippines were charged a minimum 17% “reciprocal” tariff in April before Trump paused those. Earlier this month, he threatened a 20% tariff on goods from the Philippines as of August 1.
    


This post has been updated with more information.



            The top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned whether a meeting between Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and Ghislaine Maxwell would produce anything, saying his focus remains on wanting more information from the Department of Justice and FBI.
    


            “We've already had the attorney general announce that she is possession of client list information and then can't produce it. So I don't, I'm not sure what this visit is going to glean,” Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said.
    


                    On Maxwell potentially testifying on Capitol Hill, Durbin said: “I'm not sure she what she has to offer. The question in my mind, why isn't the attorney general and the head of the FBI producing the documents they already have? They talked a lot about them, talked at great length about what they contain, but yet they won't produce them.”
                





            Durbin, who has requested documents from the FBI and DOJ, suggested that a subpoena could potentially be necessary to get top officials to testify before the Judiciary Committee.
    


            The Democrat claimed that the committee has received information that FBI agents were assigned to look through the Epstein files and flag mentions of President Donald Trump's name.
    


            “So many agents who should have been investigating issues of national security, safety, narcotics and the like, were assigned the task of going through this file here by Jeffrey Epstein creation that, to me, seems like a waste of talent and law enforcement. I believe it did happen,” he said.
    


            Several conservative hardliners in the House are already warning Republican leadership against passing another short-term spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, as the fiscal year end looms at the end of September.
    


            Here's what some are saying:
    


            Meanwhile, in an intensified effort to ensure that Democrats are united ahead of a September 30 spending deadline, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer will meet this afternoon with his House counterpart, Hakeem Jeffries, on how to tackle the upcoming funding fight, a Democratic leadership aide told CNN.
    


            The federal judges overseeing the cases of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell said they need more information before they can unseal grand jury transcripts requested by the Justice Department.
    


            The judges have set an initial deadline of next Tuesday for the DOJ to provide that information.
    


            Judge Paul Engelmayer, who is assigned to the Maxwell case, said the Justice Department hasn't addressed various factors that he will need to consider in order to decide whether to grant its request to unseal the transcripts, including why disclosure is being sought and whether Maxwell opposes their disclosure.
    


            Grand jury proceedings are conducted behind closed doors and are typically shielded from public view unless a judge allows the testimony to be unsealed.
    


                    “The Court intends to resolve this motion expeditiously. However, the Court cannot rule on the motion without additional submissions,” he wrote.
                





            Judge Richard Berman, who oversaw the prosecution of Epstein — who died by suicide before trial — filed a separate but related order.
    


            Both judges ordered prosecutors to file their response as well as the complete set of grand jury transcripts, a proposed redacted version and a description of other grand jury materials, including exhibits, by July 29. A redacted version of the government's legal arguments can be filed on the public docket.
    


            Engelmayer said Maxwell's attorneys and lawyers for any victims have until August 5 to file their positions.
    


            Maxwell was convicted and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. She has asked the Supreme Court to hear her case. Berman said Epstein's representative has until August 5 to respond.
    


            CNN has reached out to Maxwell's attorneys.
    


This post has been updated with information from the judge overseeing the Epstein case.



            President Donald Trump called the judge who is overseeing Harvard's case against the federal government “hostile” at the White House on Tuesday.
    


            A judge heard arguments in the case yesterday, where Harvard is arguing that the Trump administration's efforts to freeze federal funding violates free speech protections. The Trump administration says Harvard has failed to address antisemitism on campus.
    


            A reporter asked during a bilateral meeting with leader of the Philippines Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. if Trump would be willing to give any federal funding back to Harvard if the university reaches an agreement with administration.
    


            “We want money to go to all universities, not Harvard,” the president replied, adding: “Harvard got more than anybody else … they have $52 billion and they got $7 billion over a short period of time. And we have a very hostile judge appointed by Barack Hussein Obama — a very, very hostile judge who knows exactly right from wrong but, you know, we expect a win on appeal.”
    


            Trump continued his attack on US District Judge Allison Burroughs during his remarks to reporters. “She hasn't given a decision yet, but she's very hostile … and she was put by Barack Hussein Obama and generally speaking anybody that does that, it's going to, we're going to have problems with. So we don't expect to have, we won the case yesterday, anybody that was there that was a neutral would say we easily won the case.”
    


More on the case: Burroughs heard opposing arguments over whether to reject or allow Harvard's funding freeze — and offered her own challenges to the government's legal rationale for implementing their order cutting off federal funds for the elite university.
    


            The hearing marked a critical moment for what's become the flashpoint of a major clash over academic freedom, federal funding, and campus oversight — and a belief inside the White House that targeting the country's most elite academic institutions is a winning political issue for Trump.
    


CNN's Betsy Klein contributed to this post. 



            The House will leave for its August recess a day earlier than initially planned as Republican leaders hope to sap the momentum behind a GOP push by Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie to force the chamber to vote on a Jeffrey Epstein-related measure.
    


            A group of 11 Republicans and counting have signed onto what's known as a discharge petition requiring President Donald Trump's Justice Department to release all federal documents related to Epstein.
    


            Massie is leading the measure, alongside Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California. If Khanna can deliver all Democrats, their maneuver would have enough support to circumvent Speaker Mike Johnson, who has signaled he doesn't support Congress taking action to release the Epstein files on the floor. GOP leaders would have to allow it to come to the floor.
    


            Massie introduced the measure on July 15 and under House rules, it requires seven legislative days to “ripen” before he and Khanna can formally begin collecting signatures.
    


            If the House had been in session on Thursday, Massie's resolution would have ripened the first day the House returned from its August recess. Now, it will take two more days.
    


            President Donald Trump said that he's looking at the possibility of eliminating a capital gains tax on home sales in an effort to bolster the housing market.
    


            “Well we're thinking about that,” Trump said while meeting with the Philippine president in the Oval Office. “We're thinking about no tax on capital gains on houses.”
    


            Certain real estate sales are currently subject to the capital gains tax if a home is sold for more than the seller initially paid for it.
    


            Trump in his centerpiece “big, beautiful bill” that Congress passed earlier this month has already ended certain taxes on tips and on overtime pay.
    


            President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent now appear keen on allowing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to serve out the remaining eight months of his tenure as head of the central bank.
    


            However, both are in agreement that interest rates should be lower.
    


            “I think he has done a bad job. He will be out in eight months anyway,” Trump said Tuesday, speaking in the Oval Office while meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “People aren't able to buy a house because [Powell] is a numbskull and keeps the rates too high and probably doing it for political reasons,” Trump told reporters.
    


            Trump also criticized the central bank's ongoing multibillion-dollar renovation, which has invited increased scrutiny of the Fed and may be used as a means to push Powell out of his position. “It is inconceivable… (that) they can spend 2.7 billion to build a building. They don't do anything,” Trump said. (Fed records indicate the renovation is costing $2.5 billion.)
    


            Also speaking from the Oval Office, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent repeated his call for an internal review of the Fed's policies and actions, including the renovation. He also called on the Fed to lower rates. “Based on the way they cut rates last fall, they should be cutting rates now.”
    


            President Donald Trump declared his intent to “go after people” for what he says were attempts to interfere in the 2016 election by claiming Russia was seeking to influence the result.
    


            “Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” Trump said in the Oval Office, where he is hosting the Philippine president.
    


            Trump insisted former President Barack Obama was guilty of crimes for what he said was his role in weaponizing intelligence, calling the former Democratic president the “ringleader” of the alleged conspiracy.
    


            “They caught President Obama absolutely cold,” Trump claimed.
    


            He added later: “Obama's been caught directly,” saying his actions amounted to “treason.”
    


            “This is like proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious, that Obama led, was trying to lead a coup, and it was with Hillary Clinton, with all these other people, but Obama headed it up,” he said later.
    


            Last week, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified and released new intelligence documents that she claimed were evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by top Obama administration officials to manufacture the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
    


            But the Trump administration's allegations conflate and misrepresent what the intelligence community actually concluded, according to a review of a GOP-led Senate investigation from 2020 and interviews with congressional sources familiar with the probe.
    


            The newly unsealed documents do nothing to undercut the government's core findings in its 2017 assessment that Russia launched an influence and hacking campaign and sought to help Trump beat Clinton, the sources said.
    


            President Donald Trump said it “sounds appropriate” for the Justice Department to reach out to Jeffrey Epstein's former associate Ghislaine Maxwell for a meeting.
    


            “I don't know about it, but I think it's something that would be, sounds appropriate,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office when asked about the plans.
    


            “He's very smart,” the president said about Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who announced earlier Tuesday that he intends to meet with Maxwell soon.
    


            “I didn't know that they were going to do it. I don't really follow that too much. It's sort of a witch hunt, just a continuation of the witch hunt,” Trump added.
    


            President Donald Trump says he expects to visit China in the “not-too-distant future,” without specifying whether he would visit Beijing in September for a World War II anniversary commemoration that will also be attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin.
    


            “We have a lot of meetings possible,” Trump said when asked about a prospective summit with Putin around the Chinese visit.
    


            “President Xi has invited me to China, and we'll probably be doing that in the not-too-distant future, a little bit out, but not too distant,” he went on.
    


            He said a decision on a trip would be made soon.
    


Remember: Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping invited each other to visit their respective countries in a telephone call earlier this year.
    


            There are two upcoming occasions when a visit could occur: at a September 3 event marking the 80th anniversary of World War II — which Putin is also attending — or around the yearly APEC summit in late October, which this year is hosted by South Korea.
    


            Seated alongside Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the White House, Trump said he would encourage the Philippines to maintain strong relations with both Washington and Beijing.
    


            “I don't mind if he gets along with China,” he said.
    


            The National Capital Planning Commission will tour the Federal Reserve construction site Thursday, White House deputy chief of staff James Blair announced on X, as the White House continues its pressure campaign against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
    


            Blair was one of three loyalists appointed to the National Capital Planning Commission earlier this month. The commission is the federal government's central planning agency for the region, which has an oversight role in the Federal Reserve renovation project.
    


            White House staff secretary Will Scharf and budget analyst Stuart Levenbach were also appointed by President Donald Trump at the same time, as he has called on Powell to resign over the Fed chair's refusal to lower interest rates.
    


            Blair told CNN Friday that the group would like to visit the site during the day and not after hours or weekends, after stating that they were initially invited to come that evening.
    


             “There's a group of us, not just us on the National Capital Planning Commission, but also OMB and a number of US senators that have expressed interest in this project,” he said.
    


Renovations under fire: The $2.5 billion renovation project at the Federal Reserve, which initially came with a $1.9 billion price tag in 2019, has emerged as Trump and his allies' new attack line against Powell. The Fed chair has refuted accusations of wrongdoing related to modifications to the renovation project.
    


            Those allegations came out after Trump had criticized Powell for weeks for his refusal to cut interest rates — with the president nicknaming Powell “Too Late.” Trump has previously said he has no plans to fire the Fed chair, which would likely cause a significant disruption in financial markets.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard for declassifying and releasing new intelligence documents that the administration claims are evidence Obama administration officials manufactured the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
    


            “This is huge news, and I give great credit to Tulsi Gabbard, who's doing a phenomenal job for declassifying key documents that prove the president, and you know, his supporters, millions of Americans, who always saw this for what it was, were right,” Leavitt told “The Ruthless Podcast” in an episode released today.
    


            Gabbard claimed the documents were evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” and she threatened to refer Obama administration officials to the Justice Department for prosecution.
    


            A criminal referral does not necessarily mean the Justice Department will investigate or prosecute.
    


            Leavitt echoed that claim, specifically pointing to former President Barack Obama.
    


Key context: But as CNN has reported, the Trump administration's allegations conflate and misrepresent what the intelligence community actually concluded, according to a review of a GOP-led Senate investigation from 2020 and interviews with congressional sources familiar with the probe.
    


            The newly unsealed documents do nothing to undercut the government's core findings in its 2017 assessment that Russia launched an influence and hacking campaign and sought to help Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, the sources said.
    


            Trump himself touted Gabbard's findings over the weekend, reposting videos of her speaking on Fox Business and memes of Obama and his top officials in prison jumpsuits.
    


            A number of House Republicans are voicing their concerns over House Speaker Mike Johnson's call to allow the Trump administration more time to deal with the Jeffrey Epstein case.
    


Here's what they are saying following a closed door meeting the Johnson and his leadership team: 



            House Speaker Mike Johnson and his leadership team made the case to House Republicans behind closed doors today that the Trump administration needs time to deal with the Jeffrey Epstein issue, according to multiple sources in the room.
    


            The message from Johnson to House GOP members was “the administration is dealing with it,” according to a GOP lawmaker. Johnson also argued that Republicans should not play “the political games” that Democrats are doing by trying to force uncomfortable votes on the issue, the lawmaker added.
    


            But many were not pleased with that call for patience. The deadlock on the issue has essentially ground House floor activity to a halt.
    


Maxwell subpoena: Immediately after the closed-door meeting, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett forced the House Oversight Committee to vote on a motion to subpoena Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The panel is expected to subpoena Maxwell “as expeditiously as possible,” according to a committee source.
    


            Burchett offered a motion for the House Oversight Committee to subpoena Maxwell during a House Oversight subcommittee hearing, and it passed by a voice vote.
    


            The Tennessee congressman brought it forward when all members were not in the room. Burchett voted for his motion and no members voted against it, so it passed.

            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is offering rare praise from the Trump administration for one of President Donald Trump's favorite targets: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
    


            Asked if he agrees with a Trump administration official who has demanded Powell's resignation, Bessent described the Fed chair as a “good public servant.”
    


                    “I know Chair Powell. There is nothing that tells me he should step down right now,” Bessent told Fox Business. “His term ends in May. If he wants to see that through, I think he should. If he wants to leave early, I think he should.”
                





            The comments mark a stark contrast with another Trump official, Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has relentlessly berated Powell and called for his resignation. Pulte did so again on Tuesday.
    


            Bessent also voiced support for a hands-off approach toward monetary policy, the Fed's ability to influence the economy by raising and lowering interest rates.
    


            “Monetary policy — we should keep that off to the side. That should be in a jewel box and protected,” Bessent said.
    


            The treasury secretary added, however, that this is a “good opportunity for Chair Powell's legacy” to conduct an internal review of the Fed's operations — outside of monetary policy
    


            Trump officials have scrutinized an ongoing $2.5 billion renovation at the Federal Reserve complex in Washington, DC.
    


            Trump himself has called Powell a “numbskull” whose “termination cannot come fast enough,” a “stupid guy,” a “bad person” and an “average mentally person.”



            Last week, Trump said it's “highly unlikely” he will fire Powell, though he offered a caveat: “Unless he has to leave for fraud.”
    


            Powell was nominated to lead the Fed in 2017 by Trump himself.
    


            Senate Democrats are trying to find a cohesive strategy to deal with the funding fight coming to Capitol Hill this fall, and the party will focus the day's lunch meeting on the issue.
    


            The issue had badly divided Democrats earlier this year, but the party will face an initial inflection point this afternoon when Senate Majority Leader John Thune pushes forward with a procedural vote on a bipartisan appropriations bill to fund military and veterans issues.
    


            The vote will be second in a series scheduled for 2:15 p.m. ET.
    


            It's not yet clear what Democrats will do. The measure — one of several appropriations bills — passed with bipartisan support in committee, but several Democrats have warned they are frustrated and losing faith in Republicans on spending issues after their colleagues charged ahead with a $9 billion rescission package last week to claw back already appropriated congressional spending for foreign aid and public broadcasting.

Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) is putting House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) in a difficult position as the Kentucky Republican spearheads an effort to push for the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files while having a target on his back from President Donald Trump.

Johnson, who, as speaker, is tasked with defending incumbent members, insists there is “no daylight” between the House and the White House and is deferring to Trump on how and when to release all of the information and documents related to Epstein.

But members like Massie warn that the decision to wait until after August recess could cost Republicans politically with their conservative base, as many in Trump's MAGA voting bloc are demanding transparency and immediate action from either Congress or the White House to release the files.

Massie is looking to put Republicans on record with a bill introduced by him and Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), which instructs the DOJ to release the documents on the disgraced and since-deceased financier. 

But Johnson disagrees with this approach and is unhappy with Massie for taking up this fight while the Trump administration is in power.

“I don't understand Thomas Massie's motivation,” the speaker said Tuesday. “I really don't. I don't know how his mind works.  I don't know what he's thinking.” 

To force a vote on the bill, Massie is using a discharge petition, a process that Republicans often blast as a “tool of the minority.” A GOP discharge petition is typically used for a bill not backed by leadership, and it usually includes a majority of Democratic names and a few Republican signatures. Massie needs 218 signatures to get his bill to the floor. 

The speaker said Massie could have brought his bill via discharge petition up anytime during the last four years, but “now he's clamoring as if there's some sort of timeline.” 

“It's interesting to me that he chose the election of President Trump to bring this, to team up with the Democrats and bring this discharge petition,” Johnson said. “So, do I have some concern about that? I do, but you know, with me in my way, I try to follow Ronald Reagan's 11th commandment: Never speak evil of another Republican.”

“So let me just say about Thomas Massie, could you just accept my Southern ‘bless his heart,'” the speaker added.

Massie has been the target of Trump for several years, but the feud reignited earlier this year when the Kentucky Republican said he was against the House's short-term spending deal in March that extended government funding until September.

Trump then pledged to “lead the charge” and back a primary challenger against Massie, whom he calls a “third-rate grandstander.” The president continued to slam Massie when he said he wouldn't vote for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and expressed doubt that Iran was an “imminent threat” that required the United States to bomb the foreign country's nuclear facilities in June.

On Monday night, Trump blasted Massie as the “worst Republican congressman” and an “Embarrassment to Kentucky.” The post came after Massie spoke to reporters on Capitol Hill and posted on social media demanding the files be released.

Elected in 2012, he has handily won reelection. In 2024, he was primaried by two candidates and won with about 76% of the vote. In 2022, he defeated three primary opponents with about 73% of the vote.

Massie is unbothered by Trump's attacks, he said.

“They're desperately trying to find somebody to run against me,” Massie said. “Like they are literally going through the yellow pages and the white pages, calling people up. People are calling me and saying, ‘I just got a call, they asked me to run for Congress. My wife would never let me do that — besides, you're a good congressman.'” 

While Johnson and Massie do not see eye to eye on most issues, Johnson is tasked with defending incumbents, particularly in the 2026 midterm elections, in which every GOP vote counts and Republicans currently have a two-seat majority. Once former Rep. Mark Green's replacement is sworn in, it will jump back up to a three-seat majority.

Trump calling for an incumbent to be ousted puts Johnson in a difficult position. Leadership on both sides of the aisle, as well as their campaign arms, rarely support challengers to incumbents. It is the practice of the National Republican Congressional Committee, in particular, not to make endorsements against incumbents as well.

Johnson stopped short of endorsing Massie in June during the escalation of the Kentucky Republican's feud with Trump, noting he and Massie “never agree these days” and that he understood Trump's frustration with the congressman.

EPSTEIN FILES PARALYZE THE HOUSE, FORCING JOHNSON TO CANCEL VOTES AND START RECESS

“That's the hardest question I had this morning, and I'm being totally honest with you,” Johnson said last month. “Look, the speaker's job, my role with my party cap on, is I'm leader of my party here, and the speaker leads the incumbent protection program, right, that's what we call it. I gotta make sure everybody gets reelected. I travel the country nonstop, relentlessly, raising money to ensure that that happens.”

“But I certainly understand the president's frustration about the colleague you named, and he and I talk about that quite a bit,” Johnson added. “Can't quite understand what the rationale is, but if you're here and you're wearing one team's jersey and every single time you vote with the other team, people begin to question what your motive is and what your philosophy is and why you're so consistently opposed to the platform, the agenda of your party.”

A dual U.S.-Chinese citizen formerly employed as an engineer at a Southern California company has admitted to stealing U.S. trade secrets for next-generation national security technology. 

Though Chenguang Gong, 59, of San Jose, pleaded guilty to one count of theft of trade secrets, he remains free on a $1.75 million bond, according to the Justice Department.

U.S. District Judge John F. Walter scheduled sentencing for Sept. 29. Prosecutors said Gong faces a statutory maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

According to his plea agreement, Gong transferred more than 3,600 files from a Los Angeles-area research and development company where he worked, to personal storage devices during his brief tenure with the company last year.

Federal prosecutors said the files Gong transferred include blueprints for sophisticated infrared sensors designed for use in space-based systems to detect nuclear missile launches and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles. Other files were said to have included blueprints for sensors designed to enable U.S. military aircraft to detect incoming, heat-seeking missiles and take countermeasures, including by jamming the missiles' infrared tracking ability.

"These files describe the methods, designs, techniques, processes, specifications, testing, and manufacture of these technologies and would be extremely damaging economically if obtained by the Victim Company's competitors, and would be dangerous to U.S. national security if obtained by international actors," the complaint says. 

The "intended economic loss" from Gong's criminal conduct exceeds $3.5 million, according to the plea agreement. 

Court documents note that much of the Malibu-based company's work is funded through contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and other U.S. government contractors. 

Gong was hired by the company in January 2023 as an application-specific integrated circuit design manager responsible for the design, development and verification of its infrared sensors. From approximately March 30 that year until his termination on April 26, 2023, Gong allegedly transferred thousands of files from his work laptop to three personal storage devices. That included more than 1,800 files after he had accepted a job at one of the company's main competitors, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors said many of the files Gong transferred contained proprietary and trade-secret information related to the development and design of a readout integrated circuit that allows space-based systems to detect missile launches and track ballistic and hypersonic missiles and a readout integrated circuit that allows aircraft to track incoming threats in low-visibility environments.

Gong also allegedly transferred files containing trade secrets relating to the development of "next generation" sensors capable of detecting low-observable targets while demonstrating increased survivability in space, as well as the blueprints for the mechanical assemblies used to house and cryogenically cool the company's sensors. That information was among the company's most important trade secrets and is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to the DOJ.

CHINESE BIO-SMUGGLING SUSPECT CRIES IN COURT OVER FEDERAL DETENTION

Many of the files had warnings in bold letters that the information was proprietary, export-controlled and for "official use only." 

The FBI executed a search warrant on May 8, 2023 at Gong's temporary residence in Thousand Oaks, California, and also searched his vehicle and his person. Law enforcement recovered multiple digital devices belonging to Gong, some of which contained the company's propriety files. The complaint says the FBI, however, did not locate two hard drives Gong used to exfiltrate the company's trade secret and proprietary information, "and the whereabouts of those drives to date remains unknown." 

Prosecutors said Gong repeatedly denied processing those hard drives or knowing where they were located in May 2023 interviews with the FBI. Gong was arrested on federal charges on Feb. 7, 2024, but was later released on bond. 

Court documents say Gong first entered the United States in or around 1993 and became a U.S. citizen in 2011. His resume states that he earned a Master of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering from Clemson University and completed some PhD work at Stanford University, according to the complaint.

Law enforcement also said Gong applied to "Talent Programs" administered by the People's Republic of China while he was employed at several major technology companies in the U.S. between approximately 2014 and 2022. 

While employed at a U.S. information technology company headquartered in Dallas, Gong in 2014 sent a business proposal to a contact at a high-tech research institute in China focused on both military and civilian products, prosecutors said. In the proposal, Gong described a plan to produce high-performance analog-to-digital converters like those produced by his employer. 

In another "Talent Program" application from September 2020, prosecutors said, Gong proposed to develop "low light/night vision" image sensors for use in military night vision goggles and civilian applications. Gong's proposal included a video presentation that contained the model number of a sensor developed by an international defense, aerospace, and security company where Gong worked from 2015 to 2019, according to the DOJ.

Authorities said Gong traveled to China several times to seek "Talent Program" funding in order to develop sophisticated analog-to-digital converters. The Justice Department cited a 2019 email translated from Chinese in which Gong remarked that he "took a risk" by traveling to China to participate in the Talent Programs because he worked for "an American military industry company" and thought he could "do something" to contribute to China's "high-end military integrated circuits."

 President Donald Trump is pulling the United States out of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization or UNESCO, a White House official told CNN.
    


            The move comes as the US president continues to pull the country out of international institutions and makes ending Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs a key focus of his administration.
    


            “President Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO — which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November,” White House deputy spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.
    


            In a statement, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce added the US' continued participation in UNESCO is not in its “national interest.” The withdrawal will take effect on December 31, 2026.
    


            UNESCO “promotes cooperation in education, science, culture and communication to foster peace worldwide,” its website states. The UN organization is widely recognized for its designation of World Heritage Sites, including the Grand Canyon National Park in the US.
    


            The United States was a founding member of UNESCO in 1945 but withdrew in 1984, citing concerns over financial mismanagement and a perceived bias against US interests.
    


            Nearly two decades later, in 2003, the US rejoined the organization during President George W. Bush's administration, with Bush stating that UNESCO had implemented important reforms.
    


            The US again withdrew from UNESCO during the first Trump administration but rejoined under Biden. After he took office for the second time, President Donald Trump ordered a review of US participation, including “an analysis of any anti-Semitism or anti-Israel sentiment within the organization.”
    


            Bruce alleged that “UNESCO works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy.”
    


            “UNESCO's decision to admit the ‘State of Palestine' as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization,” she said.
    


            Audrey Azoulay, director general of UNESCO said she deeply regretted the US decision but said the organization was expecting it.
    


            “This decision contradicts the fundamental principles of multilateralism, and may affect first and foremost our many partners in the United States of America — communities seeking site inscription on the World Heritage List, Creative City status, and University Chairs,” she said in a statement.
    


            “However regrettable, this announcement was anticipated, and UNESCO has prepared for it,” she added. “These claims also contradict the reality of UNESCO's efforts, particularly in the field of Holocaust education and the fight against antisemitism.”
    


            The US decision was hailed by Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa'ar, who called it “a necessary step, designed to promote justice and Israel's right for fair treatment in the UN system.”
    


            “Singling out Israel and politicization by member states must end, in this and all professional UN agencies,” he wrote in a post on X Tuesday. “Israel thanks the US for its moral support and leadership, especially in the multilateral arena which is plagued with anti-Israel discrimination.”
    


            French President Emmanuel Macron, however, took a swipe at the move.
    


            “Unwavering support for UNESCO, a universal guardian of science, the Ocean, education, culture, and world heritage,” he wrote on X. “The withdrawal of the United States will not weaken our commitment alongside those who lead this fight.”

            Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified and released new intelligence documents Friday that she claimed were evidence of a “treasonous conspiracy” by top Obama administration officials to manufacture the notion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.
    


            But the allegations conflate and misrepresent what the intelligence community actually concluded, according to a review of a GOP-led Senate investigation from 2020 and interviews with congressional sources familiar with the probe.
    


            The newly unsealed documents do nothing to undercut the government's core findings in its 2017 assessment that Russia launched an influence and hacking campaign and sought to help Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton, the sources said.
    


            The new allegations from Gabbard lean on assessments before the election and statements from Obama-era intelligence officials finding that the Russians did not alter the election results through cyber-attacks aimed at infiltrating voting systems.
    


            But the January 2017 Intelligence Community Assessment never concluded that Russian cyberattacks altered the outcome of the 2016 election or compromised any election infrastructure in the first place, though state voting systems were probed.
    


            Instead, the assessment focused on Russia's influence campaign ordered by President Vladimir Putin and cyber operations against US and Democratic Party officials, including the hacked emails released by WikiLeaks.
    


            “These are two different things — cyberattacks on infrastructure and hacking the DNC — which they're conflating in an attempt to make a political point,” said a former senior congressional source familiar with the Senate review. “It's just wildly misleading on its face.”
    


            In 2020, a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review agreed with the intelligence community's conclusions on Russia's election interference and Putin's role directing the effort.
    


            Multiple congressional sources familiar with the Senate report said that Gabbard is trying to lean on intelligence assessments that no voting systems were breached to falsely make a broader leap that a Russian influence and cyber campaign did not occur. The Senate review included interviews with the intelligence analysts who drafted the report, none of whom reported any political interference, the congressional sources said.
    


            In response to questions from CNN, an ODNI official said, “What the IC assessed before the Obama-Brennan-Clapper politicization, was that attempts by Russia to meddle in the 2016 election were designed to undermine public confidence in the vote outcome, not ‘hack' U.S. elections.”
    


            Gabbard's declassified document release is only the latest example of Trump administration officials trying to rewrite the history of the Russia investigation during the president's first six months in office.
    


            Last month, CIA Director John Ratcliffe also released a review that criticized the intelligence community's conclusion that Putin sought to help Trump, which he said was reached “through an atypical & corrupt process.” Ratcliffe referred former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey to the Justice Department, which is now investigating, CNN previously reported. Gabbard also threatened on Friday to refer Obama officials to the Department of Justice for potential prosecution.

The mystery of the missing binder: How a collection of raw Russian intelligence disappeared under Trump



            Trump and his allies have spent years trying to denigrate all aspects of the Russia investigation, which consumed much of the first two years of Trump's first term – including the 2017 intelligence assessment; special counsel Robert Mueller's probe and the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation; and the infamous dossier written by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and alleged coordination between the Russian government and people associated with the Trump campaign.
    


            Trump touted Gabbard's findings over the weekend, reposting videos of Gabbard speaking on Fox Business and memes of former President Barack Obama and his top officials in prison jumpsuits. Earlier this year, Trump declassified and released redacted documents from a binder that the White House compiled in 2020 criticizing the FBI's probe, including the bureau's errors in relying on the dossier to obtain foreign surveillance warrants on a Trump adviser.
    


            “Obama himself manufactured the Russia, Russia, Russia HOAX. Crooked Hillary, Sleepy Joe, and numerous others participated in this, THE CRIME OF THE CENTURY!. Irrefutable EVIDENCE. A major threat to our Country!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social Monday evening.
    


            The January 2017 intelligence assessment, released days before Trump took office, was a key first step in turning Trump against the “deep state.” He's long disputed the conclusion that Putin and the Russian government aspired to help him win, believing it undermined the legitimacy of his 2016 victory.
    


            A 2018 report by the GOP-led House Intelligence Committee disputed the tradecraft behind the conclusion that Putin tried to help Trump. Ratcliffe was a member of that committee at the time, and FBI Director Kash Patel was a top aide on the panel. Ratcliffe's review last month did not dispute the intelligence community's finding that Russia interfered in the 2016 election.
    


            Gabbard alleged that the intelligence assessment on Russian interference relied on the Steele dossier and was used by the Obama White House to “subvert the will of the American people.”
    


            In an 11-page memo accompanying the declassified documents, Gabbard cites emails from intelligence officials and an earlier September 2016 intelligence assessment stating that foreign adversaries don't have the capability to “covertly overturn the vote outcome.” The memo points to talking points in December 2016 for then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, stating: “Foreign adversaries did not use cyberattacks on election infrastructure to alter the US Presidential election outcome.”
    


            Gabbard's memo alleges that when the January 2017 intelligence assessment on Russian interference was released, it “falsely alleges, based in part on ‘further information' that had ‘come to light' since the election, that Putin directed an effort to help President Trump defeat Hillary Clinton.”
    


            “This ‘further information' is later confirmed to be the Steele Dossier,” the memo states.
    


            But congressional sources took issue with both of her claims: The intelligence community conclusion of a Putin-directed campaign was not evidence that the election outcome had been altered, they said, and the committee's interviews with the analysts who drafted the assessment said that the Steele dossier did not inform its analysis.
    


            There was an internal debate about whether the dossier should be part of the assessment or a separate annex, but the CIA insisted it be kept out of the report, according to the committee's report.
    


            “All individuals the Committee interviewed stated that the Steele material did not in any way inform the analysis in the ICA — including the key judgments — because it was unverified information and had not been disseminated as serialized intelligence reporting,” the committee report states.
    


            Gabbard's memo claims the dossier was involved in the assessment on the basis of an “ODNI whistleblower,” who had worked previously on election interference and said they were sidelined on the January 2017 Russia document.
    


            The memo states that the whistleblower was “shocked” to be told in helping to respond to a 2019 Freedom of Information Act request that the dossier was “a factor” in the intelligence assessment.
    


            But the email that's cited in the memo merely states that the dossier was a factor because it was an annex to the intelligence assessment — there's no suggestion that means it was involved in the crafting of the analysis itself.
    


            Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement that the panel's investigation resulted in a “unanimous, bipartisan conclusion” that Putin interfered in 2016 to benefit Trump.
    


            “This is just another example of the DNI trying to cook the books, rewrite history, and erode trust in the intelligence agencies she's supposed to be leading,” Warner said.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche announced on Tuesday he would meet with Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell as the Trump administration faces pressure to release more information about the late sex offender's case.

“President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. If [Ghislaine] Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,” Blanche said in a statement. “I anticipate meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days. Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government. That changes now.”

In 2022, Maxwell was found guilty of child sex trafficking and other crimes. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence. 

Her attorney, David Oscar Markus, confirmed the meeting, telling CNN, “I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.”

Maxwell's attorneys have appeared to ask President Donald Trump to intervene in her case. Her lawyers argued she should not have been prosecuted because of a plea deal Epstein struck in Florida in 2008 with then-U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Alex Acosta, who later served in the first Trump administration.

Her attorney recently said of Trump, “He's the ultimate deal-maker — and I'm sure he'd agree that when the United States gives its word, it should keep it. With all the talk about who's being prosecuted and who isn't, it's especially unfair that Ghislaine Maxwell remains in prison based on a promise the government made and broke.”

The Trump administration has been scrambling over the Epstein files for over two weeks after the Justice Department and FBI released a joint memo that said Epstein did not have a client list and that he died in jail by suicide in 2019. Blanche concurred in his statement that the joint memo “remains as accurate today as it was when it was written.”

MAGA ANGER OVER EPSTEIN FILES GIVES TRUMP LIMITED OPTIONS TO QUELL DIVISIONS

The memo has sparked intense backlash from Trump supporters against high-ranking members of his administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who speculated for years about Epstein's death and his alleged client list.

On Blanche's meeting with Maxwell, Patel said, “Get it.”

The Department of Labor is looking to repeal or rewrite 60 workplace requirements it calls “obsolete.”

If approved, these wide-ranging rollbacks would affect working conditions in mines, minimum wage for home healthcare workers, and the standards on exposures to harmful materials.

“The Department of Labor is proud to lead the way by eliminating unnecessary regulations that stifle growth and limit opportunity,” Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a statement, adding that it was the “most ambitious proposal to slash red tape of any department across the federal government.”

Critics said cutting the rules would put workers at greater risk of harm.

The changes will have to follow the rule-making process in federal agencies, which means these rules cannot be changed immediately. Adding, amending, or ending a rule typically has three stages: finding the authority to make, change, or delete a rule, giving notice of that rule to the public, and agency consideration after public comments. People can voice concerns during the public comment period, or the second stage.

Some of the rollbacks the Trump administration is considering include eliminating the minimum wage for home healthcare workers. The Labor Department is proposing that about 3.7 million workers in home care be paid below the federal minimum wage, $7.25, and be made ineligible for overtime pay depending on state law.

Another proposed change would eliminate protections for immigrant farm workers with H-2A visas. Last year, H-2A visa holders were given more legal protections, including shielding them from retaliation for actions like filing a complaint, testifying, or participating in an investigation, hearing, or proceeding.

“There's a long history of retaliation against workers who speak up against abuses in farm work. And with H-2A, it's even worse because the employer can just not renew your visa,” Lori Johnson, senior attorney at Farmworker Justice, told the Associated Press.

HURRICANE WATCH: TRUMP'S REMADE WEATHER AGENCIES IN THE EYE OF THE DOGE STORM

The administration is also looking to limit the general duty clause, which allows the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to punish employers for unsafe working conditions when no specific standard is in place to cover a situation.

The rule change would end the agency's ability to apply the clause to penalize employers for “inherently risky professional activities that are intrinsic to professional, athletic, or entertainment occupations.”

The Trump administration announced Tuesday that the United States will exit the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

"President Donald Trump has decided to withdraw the United States from UNESCO – which supports woke, divisive cultural and social causes that are totally out-of-step with the commonsense policies that Americans voted for in November. This president will always put America First and ensure our country's membership in all international organizations aligns with our national interests," White House Deputy Spokesperson Anna Kelly said on Tuesday.

WATCHDOG BACKS RUBIO'S SANCTIONS ON UN OFFICIAL OVER ‘SHAMEFUL EFFORTS' TARGETING US, ISRAEL

"The U.S. continues to demonstrate moral clarity in the international arena and when it comes to its involvement and financial investments in international organizations, and makes it clear that it is unwilling to support entities that promote hatred, historical revisionism, and political divisiveness over advancing shared universal values," Israeli U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said in a statement.

Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Gideon Sa'ar also commended the decision, which he said "is a necessary step, designed to promote justice and Israel's right to fair treatment in the U.N. system, a right which has often been trampled due to politicization in this arena."

"Singling out Israel and politicization by member states must end, in this and all professional U.N. agencies," Sa'ar added.

The move comes as the administration continues to make waves in the international community, and in particular at the U.N. The U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has drawn the ire of the U.N. and other international bodies. 

Additionally, Secretary-General António Guterres has expressed his concerns about the Trump administration's foreign aid cuts, which he said would be "especially devastating" to the world's vulnerable populations, according to Reuters.

BUSH TEAMS UP WITH NOTORIOUS TRUMP FOES TO TRASH 'COLOSSAL MISTAKE' SHUTTERING USAID

State Department Spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on the exit that "continued involvement with UNESCO is not in the national interest of the United States."

"UNESCO works to advance divisive social and cultural causes and maintains an outsized focus on the U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda for international development at odds with our America First foreign policy," the statement read. "UNESCO's decision to admit the ‘State of Palestine' as a Member State is highly problematic, contrary to U.S. policy, and contributed to the proliferation of anti-Israel rhetoric within the organization."

Trump withdrew the U.S. from UNESCO in October 2017, during his first term, but former President Joe Biden had the country rejoin the agency in 2023. In 2017, the State Department said the U.S. was withdrawing from the agency for very similar reasons, suggesting UNESCO has not sufficiently fixed the issues at the center of the Trump administration's concerns.

            Extremely high levels of toxic chemicals called PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) have been found in a small sampling of reusable menstrual pads and panties, according to a new study.
    


Doctors should test levels of PFAS in people at high risk, report says



            “Whether we wear feminine hygiene products or not, we will all be exposed,” said senior study author Graham Peaslee, a professor of physics, chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.
    


            “Everything in the US ultimately goes into landfills, and with time these forever chemicals leach into our drinking water, our irrigation water and our food supply,” Peaslee said.
    


            Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are called “forever” chemicals because they fail to break down fully in the environment. Known endocrine disruptors, various types of PFAS have been linked to serious health problems such as cancer, obesity, high cholesterol, decreased fertility, low birth weight, accelerated puberty and hormone disruption, according to the EPA.



            The highest levels of contamination came from a type of “neutral” PFAS that scientists know exist but have just recently been able to measure and more thoroughly test for harm, the study found.
    


            “We typically measure a type of PFAS called ionic, which has a charge, and we can measure those down to parts per trillion which is a low exposure level,” Peaslee said. (An ionic charge is the positive or negative charge of an ion, an atom that has gained or lost electrons.)
    


            Newer technology is now allowing scientists to measure neutral PFAS — which have no charge. Some of the neutral versions are thought to be linked to the same health harms as the ionic versions, said Kathrin Schilling, an assistant professor of environmental science at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in New York City. She was not involved in the study.
    


            “That's important because neutral PFAS tend to fly under the radar but can be more easily absorbed through the skin, or even mucous membranes like those in the vagina because they can more easily move through fatty tissues,” said Schilling via email.
    


            The new testing found an alarming amount of these neutral PFAS in some reusable period products, according to the study.
    


            “When we measured the neutral PFAS there were much higher concentrations — not parts per trillion, not even parts per billion, but levels at parts per million — that's very, very high,” Peaslee said.
    


            What does that mean for the people using these products?
    


            “The truth is, we still do not fully understand how they behave in the body or what long-term exposure might mean,” Schilling said.
    


            “Neutral PFAS are not well studied, and there are no clear regulations for them yet.”
    


            The study, published Tuesday in the journal Environmental Science and Technology Letters, analyzed 43 period underwear, eight reusable pads, four menstrual cups, three reusable  incontinence underwear and one reusable incontinence pad — a total of 59 products. A separate part of the study also looked at tampons.
    


Tampons contain lead, arsenic and potentially toxic chemicals, studies say. Here's what to know



            “We didn't provide manufacturer names in our study  However, the  majority were US manufacturers,” Peaslee said. “We also looked at a few from South America, a couple from Australia and a couple from Europe. While the number of samples is small, we believe it was a representative snapshot.”
    


            In addition to measuring neutral and ionic PFAS, the study examined whether PFAS was found at low enough levels to indicate it was inadvertently added due to contamination during the manufacturing process. Researchers also searched for higher levels of PFAS that would indicate the chemicals were likely added on purpose.
    


            “What's shocking is that we found 33% of period underwear and 25% of reusable pads had intentional PFAS use — meaning the chemicals had been put there, likely to keep the products from leaking,” Peaslee said.
    


            Many reusable materials were sourced from third-party suppliers in other countries, who may not be as aware of the dangers of PFAS as domestic manufacturers, he said.
    


            “It did seem to be random — sometimes they put PFAS in the inside layer of material, sometimes on the outside, sometimes between the layers, all of which suggests they have no idea what they're doing,” Peaslee added.
    


            “There's no labeling, so consumers have no clue because there's no way they can tell.”
    


            There were some encouraging findings, said lead author Alyssa Wicks, who conducted the research while a graduate student at Notre Dame.
    


            “Only a subset of the products had high levels of PFAS present, which means that PFAS must not be essential in the manufacture of reusable feminine hygiene products,” said Wicks, now a postdoctoral assistant in the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University in Durham, North Carolia.
    


            “Manufacturers should be able to make these textile products without chemicals of concern in them,” Wicks said in a statement.
    


            A growing number of teens and adults are looking for more eco-friendly choices at a time when scientists still know very little about how much PFAS and other chemicals are actually absorbed via vaginal tissue over time, Schilling said.
    


            “That is a huge gap in our understanding, especially given how many people rely on these products monthly for years,” she said. “While these findings might seem niche at first glance, they point to a broader need for research, regulation, and transparency around the materials used in all menstrual products.”

Former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 election on July 21, 2024, sending shockwaves through a race already upended by the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in, only to be beaten by Trump. As Democrats try to recover, Biden, suffering from cancer, aims to protect what remains of his legacy. This Washington Examiner series “Dropout,” will look at what happened on that day, the aftermath for Biden, and how Harris's future is up in the air. Part 2 looks at Biden's attempts to save his legacy since leaving the White House.Since leaving the White House, former President Joe Biden‘s attempts to shore up his legacy and defend himself against GOP attacks have been met with a mixed reception.

Biden has largely hit back against reports that he and allies hid his declining mental and physical ailments from the public, reexamined his abrupt exit from the 2024 election, and criticized President Donald Trump‘s second administration.

Biden stepped back into the limelight in an interview with the New York Times this month, in which he branded Trump and the Republican-led Congress that is investigating his administration's use of the autopen as “liars.”

“I made every decision,” Biden said when asked about directing staff to use the autopen for clemency actions. 

The former president claimed that the autopen was used because of the wide swath of people granted clemency under broad policy categories, such as reducing nonviolent drug offender sentencing, which he approved.

BIDEN STEPS INTO SPOTLIGHT TO PUSH BACK AGAINST TRUMP AND DEFEND RECORD

In other previous remarks this month, Biden also bemoaned the GOP's effort to undo legislation he signed into law by passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

But whether Biden's comments are helping his case is unclear. 

“I think he needs to defend his honor. I don't think it's a good idea that he's out there every day if that's going to be the case,” said Steven Maviglio, a Democratic strategist. “Democrats need to look forward, not backward, and it just gives Trump an excuse to look backward.” 

Brad Bannon, another Democratic strategist, said of Biden: “It would be better for him to lay low.”

“Giving an interview to the New York Times was a bad idea,” he continued. “Trump baits Biden into these things because he wants Biden to be in the limelight because he is more unpopular than Trump is, and there are very few people who can claim that distinction.”

The Republican backlash to Biden's comments came quickly. In the days following the New York Times interview, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI), the chairman of a Senate investigative subcommittee, told the Washington Examiner he planned to request emails from the Biden administration's final days in office from the National Archives as part of his investigation into the former president's decline.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN

The White House also announced a major investigation into the use of the autopen in coordination with the Department of Justice and is already reviewing documents that the National Archives has turned over. 

“As I've said many times from this podium, and the president has said as well, it's incredibly important that we get to the bottom of who really was at the tip of the spear and the decision-making process here in the White House,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a Thursday press briefing. 

“Because former President Biden himself admitted to the New York Times — I understand he never gave interviews when he was here, but now, all of a sudden, he wants to give one — and he said that he did not actually review every single pardon that he signed on his way out the door,” Leavitt continued. “That's incredibly concerning, and I can tell you, it's something this president would never tolerate.”

Anthony Bernal, a former aide to former first lady Jill Biden, appeared before the House Oversight Committee's majority on Wednesday. He invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) has asked several former Biden aides to testify in front of the committee over the autopen use and alleged cover-up of Biden's mental decline. Annie Tomasini, who served as assistant and deputy chief of staff to Biden, and Bernal both appeared in front of the committee this week after being subpoenaed and invoked the Fifth Amendment. Biden's former White House physician, Kevin O'Connor, also invoked the Fifth Amendment during his appearance.

THE LONG HISTORY AND CONTROVERSY OF PRESIDENTIAL AUTOPEN USE

The most recent drama over the autopen investigations mirrors a similar scenario that occurred last month. 

During a Juneteenth celebration, Biden knocked Trump over his efforts to roll back diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

“I played a role in changing the names of all the military camps that have slave names,” Biden said. “What are we doing now? Restating those names. Folks, the darkness can hide much but erase nothing.”

The next day, Trump called for a special prosecutor to investigate Biden over the 2020 election. 

“Biden was grossly incompetent, and the 2020 election was a total FRAUD! The evidence is MASSIVE and OVERWHELMING. A Special Prosecutor must be appointed,” he wrote on Truth Social. “This cannot be allowed to happen again in the United States of America! Let the work begin! What this Crooked man, and his CORRUPT CRONIES, have done to our Country in 4 years, is grossly indescribable!”

Kaivan Shroff, a 2024 delegate for former Vice President Kamala Harris and a 2016 Hillary Clinton staffer, defended Biden's right to speak publicly against reporters and critics who have accused him of hiding his mental decline after exiting the 2024 race.

“In fairness, he did agree to step down and so in some sense he has, I think, every right to do that,” Shroff said.

“I was one of the delegates originally for Biden that then switched to Harris as all that happened,” Shroff added. “And I think even folks that made that decision were pretty resentful at the time of how Biden was treated, both in the party and obviously externally. But I think him responding to these types of stories is expected, and I actually don't know that it really does much to move the needle.”

Matt Dole, a Republican strategist, said Biden's more than half-century tenure as a politician likely plays into his desire to establish his credibility on the national stage.

“I understand why he's attacking Republicans; that's what he has done for 60 years now,” Dole said. “But he should be mad at the Democratic Party. The Democrats hung him out to dry twice, once by ignoring the problems with Joe Biden and not dealing with it, and then, when they couldn't ignore it anymore, when not even the national liberal media would cover for them, they hung him out to dry.”

WHO IS ANTHONY BERNAL, JILL BIDEN'S FORMER TOP AIDE WHO WIELDED ‘ENORMOUS' POWER IN WHITE HOUSE?

In May, Biden conducted his first live interview with an American outlet since leaving the White House with the hosts of The View, and he pushed back against claims from journalists accusing his inner circle of shielding him from the public. In particular, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson's book Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again may have been the most damning account against Biden.

“They are wrong. There's nothing to sustain that, No. 1,” Biden said on the show. “No. 2, you know, think of what we're left with. We were left with a circumstance where we had an insurrection … not since the Civil War.”

The Democratic Party has remained largely leaderless since Biden's exit from the 2024 race led to Harris taking the mantle before a devastating loss to Trump in November. The party has not unified on whether it's better to embrace a centrist position or lean more into progressive policies to push back against the president and win back the American electorate.

But some Democrats were wary of Biden's comments and called for him to “go away.” 

Cayce Myers, a professor at Virginia Tech's School of Communication, said Biden is in a tough position as Trump and the GOP continue to investigate him.

BIDEN AUTOPEN USE: WHAT TO KNOW AS TRUMP ORDERS AN INVESTIGATION INTO HIS PREDECESSOR

“It's a catch-22 for Biden because if he doesn't respond or say anything about his legacy, that fuels this narrative about his inability to function and communicate, and it calls into question his cognitive abilities,” Myers said. “On the other hand, it does give fodder for the Republican Party and for President Trump, and they make his statements into political talking points that they can repackage for 2026 and beyond.” 

Former President Barack Obama was also met with criticism from Democrats angered over his comments at a New Jersey fundraiser calling for his party members to “toughen up.” 

“Are people mad at Obama for speaking up? Yes, some of them are,” Shroff said. “But, you know that always happens.”

“We're still rehashing Bernie versus Hillary 2016. We're still rehashing so many things. The idea that the guy who was just president five seconds ago can't speak up, I think, is a little silly,” he also said.

EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: TRUMP TELLS SALENA ZITO HE IS BULLISH ON THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA

Yet, Biden's attempts to have his perspective be the definitive narrative of his presidency will likely be unsuccessful.

“Ultimately, the historians and the political pundits will define his legacy regardless of what he says,” Myers said. “And presidential legacy is not something that's an immediate item; it evolves. And sometimes the legacy does not materialize until decades later. And so I think that while it is probably self-fulfilling in some respects to defend his administration, I don't know, long term, what effect that has, if anything.”

The U.S. Air Force says the B-52 bomber that had a near miss with a Delta Airlines flight over North Dakota on Friday was flying an approved flight path at the time.

The Air Force released the statement on Monday, saying the Federal Aviation Administration was still investigating the incident. The B-52 bomber was in the air to conduct a flyover at the North Dakota State Fair, which had been pre-approved and planned in advance by the FAA.

The Air Force says the B-52 pilots were in contact with the Minot International Airport and the Minot Approach Control (RAPCON).

"At approximately 7:10 p.m. prior to the flyover, the B-52 crew contacted Minot Approach (RAPCON) to prepare for the flyover. Required checklists were completed, and the crew remained in contact with Minot Approach as it flew to its holding point 12 miles east of the fairgrounds. While holding, the B-52 crew communicated the flyover plan to both RAPCON and Minot International Airport's air traffic control tower," the Air Force said in a statement.

"Minot Approach directed the B-52 crew at 7:43 p.m. to contact Minot International Airport's air traffic control. The B-52 crew contacted Minot International Airport tower and the tower provided instructions to continue 2 miles westbound after the flyover. The tower did not advise of the inbound commercial aircraft," the statement continued.

The pilot of a SkyWest Airlines flight operated by Delta Air Lines performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a collision with the B-52. The pilot then explained the frightening incident to passengers in audio that went viral on social media.

The flight was carrying passengers from Minneapolis to Minot, N.D. The flight circled Minot International Airport several times before landing after the incident.

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed it is investigating the incident.

"SkyWest flight 3788, operating as Delta Connection from Minneapolis, Minnesota to Minot, North Dakota on July 18, landed safely in Minot after being cleared for approach by the tower but performed a go-around when another aircraft became visible in their flight path," a spokesperson for SkyWest said in a statement to FOX Business.

"We are investigating the incident," the spokesperson added.

"Given his speed ... I don't know how fast they were going, but they were a lot faster than us. I felt it was the safest thing to do to turn behind it," the pilot said in the video that has now gone viral.

"So sorry about the aggressive maneuver. It caught me by surprise," he continued. "This is not normal at all. I don't know why they didn't give us a heads-up, because the Air Force base does have radar ... long story short, it was not fun, but I do apologize for it, and thank you for understanding. Not a fun day at work."

Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley tells Fox News Digital touts that ‘we're seeing very robust fundraising here at the RNC'

FIRST ON FOX: The Democratic National Committee (DNC) on Tuesday launched billboards outside three rural hospitals that Democrats say are closing or cutting back services due to President Donald Trump's recently signed domestic policy package.

The DNC says it placed billboards in Silex, Missouri; Stillwell, Oklahoma; and Missoula, Montana, to make sure that rural voters, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in last year's presidential election, "know who is responsible for gutting rural health care."

The Democrats' national party committee, in taking aim at the sweeping and controversial tax cut and spending measure, named the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by Trump and congressional Republicans, argued that "residents are already seeing the firsthand effects of Trump's Budget Betrayal."

The billboards were shared first with Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning.

RNC CHAIR SAYS ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' KEY TO GOP'S MESSAGING EFFORT HEADED INTO MIDTERMS

The measure is stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit. 

It includes extending the president's signature 2017 tax cuts and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay. 

By making his first-term tax rates permanent — they were set to expire later this year — the bill will cut taxes by nearly $4.4 trillion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

The measure also provides billions for border security and codifies the president's controversial immigration crackdown.

The $3.4 trillion legislative package is also projected to surge the national debt by $4 trillion over the next decade, but many Republicans dispute the projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).

And the new law also restructures Medicaid — the almost 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans. The CBO this week estimated that 10 million people could lose their health insurance over the next decade.

The changes to Medicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage.

Democrats, for months, have repeatedly blasted Republicans over the social safety net changes. And they spotlighted a slew of national polls last month and this month that indicate the bill's popularity in negative territory.

WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL'

The DNC claims that the bill, which Trump signed into law on July 4 after the GOP-controlled House and Senate narrowly passed the measure along near-party-line votes, will gut Medicaid, forcing rural hospitals and nursing homes to close their doors. 

"Rural hospitals were already on the brink of collapse thanks to Donald Trump, but now he has put the last nail in the coffin for rural hospitals with his billionaire budget bill," DNC chair Ken Martin argued in a statement to Fox News.

Martin highlighted that "in states across the country, hospitals are either closing their doors or cutting critical services, and it's Trump's own voters who will suffer the most. This is what Donald Trump does — screw over the people who are counting on him."

Republican National Committee (RNC) chair Michael Whatley, in an interview with Fox News Digital last week, spotlighted that "if you take a look at the Medicaid side of this conversation, the fact is that we're going to be moving illegal aliens off of Medicaid. We're going to be strengthening the program. Those are things that absolutely need to happen."

And he argued that "the tax cuts are going to be very, very strong indicators, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security. Plus we're extending those Trump tax cuts. This is going to help every family in every community all across the country."

Included in the megabill is a $60 billion fund, named the Rural Health Transformation Program, which Republicans say would offset cuts to Medicaid and would also help overcome long-standing health disparities that rural communities have faced.

But the DNC says their new analysis "shows this funding was never going to be enough to make a difference."

And the DNC points to a non-partisan breakdown of the new law, which says that half of the rural hospital funding will be split evenly among all states that apply, regardless of need.

Both parties see the "big, beautiful bill" as a key part of their messaging heading into next year's midterm elections, when the Republicans will be defending their slim majorities in the House and Senate.

The Black civil rights movement's greatest legal achievement is now on a Republican Supreme Court's chopping block.

In mid-May, two Republicans on a federal appeals court declared that the Voting Rights Act of 1965 — the landmark law that a Senate report once described as “the most successful civil rights statute in the history of the Nation” — is effectively null and void.

The Voting Rights Act was one of the Black civil rights movement's signature accomplishments, and is widely considered one of the most consequential laws in American history because it was extraordinarily successful in ending Jim Crow restrictions on voting. Just two years after it became law, for example, Black voter registration rates in the former Jim Crow stronghold of Mississippi rose from 6.7 percent to nearly 60 percent.

Get the latest developments on the US Supreme Court from senior correspondent Ian Millhiser.

The two Republicans' decision in Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians v. Howe attempts to strip private litigants of their ability to enforce the law, which bans race discrimination in elections. If the lower court's decision in Turtle Mountain is ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court, the Justice Department could still bring suits to enforce the law, but the Justice Department is currently controlled by President Donald Trump.

As federal Judge Lavenski Smith noted in a 2023 opinion, over the past 40 years various plaintiffs have brought 182 successful lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act. Only 15 of these suits were brought solely by the DOJ. So, even if the United States still had a Justice Department committed to voting rights, the premise of the two Republicans' decision in Turtle Mountain is that the overwhelming majority of successful Voting Rights Act suits should have ended in failure.

Turtle Mountain arises on the Court's “shadow docket,” a mix of emergency motions and other matters that the justices decide on an expedited basis. So the Court could reveal whether it intends to nuke the Voting Rights Act within weeks.

The idea that the Voting Rights Act is virtually unenforceable — and that, somehow, no one noticed this fact for four decades — appears to originate from Justice Neil Gorsuch, who suggested that the law may be a near-nullity in a 2021 concurring opinion. Ironically, less than a month ago, Gorsuch authored the Court's majority opinion in Medina v. Planned Parenthood, which cuts against his own attack on the law.

Still, Gorsuch may ultimately prevail in his attack on this landmark law. Though much of the Medina opinion cuts against the lower court's reasoning in Turtle Mountain, Medina changed many of the rules governing which federal laws may be enforced through private lawsuits. Gorsuch's Medina opinion did not just narrow the rights of private litigants to bring suits enforcing federal law; it appeared to overrule the Court's two-year-old opinion in Health and Hospital Corporation v. Talevski (2023), which read the rights of private litigants much more expansively.

It's hard to identify a principled distinction between Talevski and Medina, but there is an important political distinction between the two cases. Unlike Talevski, the Medina lawsuit was brought by Planned Parenthood, an abortion provider that Republicans love to hate. So the most likely explanation for the Court's shift in Medina is that the Republican justices wanted Planned Parenthood to lose, and were willing to change the rules to ensure this outcome.

The Court's Republicans have shown similar contempt for the Voting Rights Act. In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Republican justices deactivated a core provision of the law, which required states with a history of racist election practices to “preclear” any new election laws with federal officials before they took effect. Other Supreme Court decisions have written arbitrary limits into the Voting Right Act that appear nowhere in the law's text, such as legal protection for voting restrictions that were commonplace in 1982.

As Justice Elena Kagan said in a 2021 opinion, “in the last decade, this Court has treated no statute worse.”

So, while there are no good legal arguments supporting the lower court's decision in Turtle Mountain, it is still possible that the Court's Republican majority will neutralize the Voting Rights Act anyway.

Turtle Mountain is a dispute about what are known as “implied causes of action.” There are many federal laws that do not state explicitly that they can be enforced through private lawsuits, but that nonetheless are understood to permit such suits.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court appears to change the rules governing when these suits are permitted about as often as Gorsuch changes his necktie.

For many years, the Court applied a strong presumption that federal laws must be enforceable. In Allen v. State Board of Elections (1969), an early Voting Rights Act case, the Court held that “a federal statute passed to protect a class of citizens, although not specifically authorizing members of the protected class to institute suit, nevertheless implied a private right of action.”

As the Court moved rightward, it started announcing increasingly more restrictive rules governing when federal laws could be enforced through private suits. In its 2023 Talevski decision, however, the Court finally seemed to settle on a rule that would govern these sorts of cases moving forward.

Under Talevski, a federal law may be enforced by private litigants if it is “‘phrased in terms of the persons benefited' and contains ‘rights-creating,' individual-centric language with an ‘unmistakable focus on the benefited class.'”

Thus, for example, a law stating that “no state may prevent a hungry person from eating French fries” would be enforceable through private-person lawsuits, because the law's text focuses on the people who benefit from it (people who are hungry). A similar statute saying that “states shall not impede access to fried potatoes” would not be enforceable, because it lacks the “individual-centric language” demanded by Talevski.

Two years later, however, in Medina, the Supreme Court considered a federal law that permits “any individual eligible for medical assistance” under Medicaid to choose their own health provider. South Carolina violated this law by forbidding Medicaid patients from choosing Planned Parenthood as their health provider, but the Republican justices declared that this law is unenforceable — despite the fact that it is “phrased in terms of the persons benefited” as Talevski demands.

Gorsuch's Medina opinion is difficult to parse. Unlike Talevski, it does not state a clear legal rule explaining when federal laws are enforceable. It doesn't even quote Talveski's language about laws “phrased in terms of the persons benefited.”

That said, Medina does spend several pages suggesting that statutes, like the one in Talevski, which actually use the word “right” in their text — as in individuals' rights — are enforceable. (Talevski involved several provisions of federal Medicaid law that protect nursing home residents, including a provision that protects the “right to be free from” physical or drug-induced restraints.)

In any event, the Voting Rights Act should be enforceable under either the clearly articulated rule announced in Talevski, or the more haphazard rule announced in Medina. Here is the relevant text from the act:

No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color…

Under Talevski, this statute may be enforced through private lawsuits because it is phrased in terms of the person benefited: “any citizen of the United States.” Under Medina, the statute may also be enforced through private lawsuits because the law refers to “the right” of any citizen to vote.

This provision, moreover, appears in a section of the United States Code entitled “denial or abridgement of right to vote on account of race or color through voting qualifications or prerequisites; establishment of violation.” That section appears in a chapter of the US Code entitled “Enforcement of Voting Rights.” And, of course, the law that created this provision is called the “Voting Rights Act.”

So, even under the silly standard that Gorsuch appeared to lay out in his Medina opinion, the Voting Rights Act may be enforced through private lawsuits.

There is something remarkably cruel about this entire exercise. Congress could not possibly have known in 1965, when it enacted the Voting Rights Act, that the Supreme Court would declare decades later that statutes must have “individual-centric language” or they cannot be enforced by private litigants. Nor could it have known that, not long thereafter, the Supreme Court would hand down another decision that seems to scrap the Talevski rule and replace it with a new one that requires Congress to use the magic word “right.”

Similarly, as the Turtle Mountain plaintiffs point out in their brief to the justices, “from 1982 through August 2024, ‘private plaintiffs have been party to 96.4% of Section 2 claims that produced published opinions … and the sole litigants in 86.7% of these decisions.'” None of the courts that decided these cases could have anticipated Gorsuch's logic in Medina.

In any event, it is a happy coincidence that the statute Congress wrote in 1965 happens to comply with both the rule that the Supreme Court announced in 2023, and the entirely different rule that it announced in 2025.

Senate Republicans are taking an enormous risk with the federal bench right now.

﻿And they didn't even bother to explain themselves.

﻿Trump wants to lay off thousands of federal employees. Now, he can.

Trying to keep track of all the chaos is overwhelming. So here's a one-stop guide to the turmoil this Court caused.

The Court's opinion has disturbing things to say about privacy, but the biggest losers are likely to be judges themselves.

The Republican justices' decision fundamentally altered how public schools must operate.

President Donald Trump is directing his fury at the press as he tries to quiet the furor from his base over his administration's failure to release the Jeffrey Epstein files despite pledges to do so. 

Trump filed a lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal over its report that the president's name was on a 2003 birthday card to the convicted sex offender that included a suggestive drawing.

After a couple of weeks of the party disagreeing over the administration's handling of the Epstein files, the base could begin to unite again over a common denominator — the media is to blame. As the administration has searched for ways to squash the issue, painting Epstein drama as another “witch hunt” from the “Deep State” has resonated with the base.

“Casting this as the latest chapter in the witch hunt to frame Trump is really the only play Trumpworld has, especially heading into the midterms [elections] when Trump won't be on the ballot,” Republican strategist Dennis Lennox told the Washington Examiner. 

“Republicans need these MAGA base voters to show up, which is a challenge because so many of them are low-propensity voters whose loyalty is with Trump. The easiest way to energize them heading into 2026 is [to] make this a Russia hoax 2.0,” he added.

As Trump fights the press, his administration is also releasing more information on the intelligence that helped underpin a federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. Tulsi Gabbard, who heads the  Office of the Director of National Intelligence, claimed that former President Barack Obama and his national security officials “manufactured and politicized intelligence” to launch a “yearslong coup against President Trump.”

Trump's base has long accused the media and the Democratic Party of unjustly coming after the president, leading to the strong loyalty many of his supporters show. Former adviser to Trump, Steve Bannon, spoke out on the issue to The Washington Post, claiming the saga is a conspiracy against the president, as even some of his own party has taken a stance against him.

“MAGA is now united, because they can see there's a common enemy. They see exactly what the reality is — it's the Deep State, with their media partners, led by Murdoch, that's out to destroy Trump,” Bannon told the outlet. “And that's been obvious from the beginning.”

The lawsuit filed in Miami claims defamation and names Rupert Murdoch, Dow Jones, News Corp, its Chief Executive Robert Thomson, and two Wall Street Journal reporters as defendants. The president slammed the story and denied his involvement with the birthday card. 

The White House confirmed Monday that the Wall Street Journal will not be part of its press pool to Scotland following the story's publication. 

“Thirteen diverse outlets will participate in the press pool to cover the President's trip to Scotland,” White House press secretary Karolina Leavitt told reporters. “Due to the Wall Street Journal's fake and defamatory conduct, they will not be one of the thirteen outlets on board. Every news organization in the entire world wishes to cover President Trump, and the White House has taken significant steps to include as many voices as possible.” 

This comes after the White House decided in February to hand-select reporters in the press pool covering the president. This group of reporters is in charge of relaying Trump's day-to-day activities to the public. This decision shifted the long-standing precedent of the White House Correspondents' Association determining the daily pool, as the administration has pursued efforts to push back on traditional media sources. 

Democrats and Republicans have been pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to release the long-awaited Epstein files after the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigations released a two-page memo earlier this month stating there is no evidence Epstein blackmailed people or kept a “client list,” reiterating he died by suicide, a conclusion that has resulted in mounting backlash from Trump's MAGA base. 

A handful of Republicans joined Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) last week in his fight to force a full release of the files through a discharge petition in the House. Massie announced the Epstein Files Transparency Act with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) to force a vote on the complete release of government files related to the convicted sex offender.

Democrats have continuously leaned into the issue to push back against the president, as the GOP holds a trifecta in Washington, while also trying to get ahead in the fight to flip back the House in the midterm elections.

Democrats on the House Rules Committee offered multiple amendments last week relating to Epstein to force the Republicans on the committee to vote against the release on record. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) eventually filed a rule that passed through committee, which consisted of non-binding language for the release of the files. 

House GOP leadership does not plan on bringing the Epstein bill to the floor this week as Congress heads for its monthlong recess Friday, as Johnson told reporters he wants to give the administration “space” to deal with the issue. 

As the White House aims to target traditional media for the uproar, Theo Von, a new media persona who has supported the president, called for a vote on Massie's bill Monday, in response to a post on X regarding the speaker not putting an Epstein bill on the floor.

“Theo Von and many on the left and the right are speaking up about releasing the Epstein files,” Khanna wrote to the Washington Examiner. “It is a simple question. Whose side are you on? That of rich and powerful men who abused young girls or America's children.”

The long-range Russian drones come in swarms each night, buzzing for hours over Ukraine by the hundreds, terrorizing the population and attacking targets from the industrial east to areas near its western border with Poland.

Russia now often batters Ukraine with more drones in a single night than it did during some entire months in 2024, and analysts say the barrages are likely to escalate. On July 8, Russia unleashed more than 700 drones — a record.

Some experts say that number could soon top 1,000 a day.

The spike comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has given Russia until early September to reach a ceasefire or face new sanctions -– a timeframe Moscow is likely to use to inflict as much damage as possible on Ukraine.

Russia has sharply increased its drone output and appears to keep ramping it up. Initially importing Shahed drones from Iran early in the 3 1/2-year-old war, Russia has boosted its domestic production and upgraded the original design.

The Russian Defense Ministry says it's turning its drone force into a separate military branch. It also has established a dedicated center for improving drone tactics and better training for those flying them.

Russian engineers have changed the original Iranian Shahed to increase its altitude and make it harder to intercept, according to Russian military bloggers and Western analysts. Other modifications include making it more jamming-resistant and able to carry powerful thermobaric warheads. Some use artificial intelligence to operate autonomously.

The original Shahed and its Russian replica — called “Geran,” or “geranium” — have an engine to propel it at 180 kph (just over 110 mph). A faster jet version is reportedly in the works.

The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War noted that cooperation with China has allowed Russia to bypass Western sanctions on imports of electronics for drone production. Ukraine's military intelligence estimates that Russia receives up to 65% of components for its Geran drones from China. Beijing rejects the claims.

Russia initially launched its production of the Iranian drones at factory in Alabuga, located in Tatarstan. An Associated Press investigation found employees at the Alabuga plant included young African women who said they were duped into taking jobs there. Geran production later began at a plant in Udmurtia, west of the Ural Mountains. Ukraine has launched drone attacks on both factories but failed to derail production.

A report Sunday by state-run Zvezda TV described the Alabuga factory as the world's biggest attack drone plant.

“It's a war of drones. We are ready for it,” said plant director Timur Shagivaleyev, adding it produces all components, including engines and electronics, and has its own training school.

The report showed hundreds of black Geran drones stacked in an assembly shop decorated with Soviet-style posters. One featured images of the father of the Soviet nuclear bomb, Igor Kurchatov, legendary Soviet space program chief, Sergei Korolyov, and dictator Josef Stalin, with the words: “Kurchatov, Korolyov and Stalin live in your DNA.”

The Russian military has improved its tactics, increasingly using decoy drones named “Gerbera” for a type of daisy. They closely resemble the attack drones and are intended to confuse Ukrainian defenses and distract attention from their more deadly twins.

By using large numbers of drones in one attack, Russia seeks to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and keep them from targeting more expensive cruise and ballistic missiles that Moscow often uses alongside the drones to hit targets like key infrastructure facilities, air defense batteries and air bases.

Former Russian Defense Ministry press officer Mikhail Zvinchuk, who runs a popular war blog, noted the Russian military has learned to focus on a few targets to maximize the impact. The drones can roam Ukraine's skies for hours, zigzagging past defenses, he wrote.

“Our defense industries' output allows massive strikes on practically a daily basis without the need for breaks to accumulate the necessary resources,” said another military blogger, Alexander Kots. “We no longer spread our fingers but hit with a punching fist in one spot to make sure we hit the targets.”

Ukraine relies on mobile teams armed with machine guns as a low-cost response to the drones to spare the use of expensive Western-supplied air defense missiles. It also has developed interceptor drones and is working to scale up production, but the steady rise in Russian attacks is straining its defenses.

Despite international sanctions and a growing load on its economy, Russia's military spending this year has risen 3.4% over 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which estimated it at the equivalent of about $200 billion. While budgetary pressures could increase, it said, the current spending level is manageable for the Kremlin.

Over 1.5 million drones of various types were delivered to the military last year, said President Vladimir Putin.

Frontelligence Insight, a Ukraine-based open-source intelligence organization, reported this month that Russia launched more than 28,000 Shahed and Geran drones since the full-scale invasion began in 2022, with 10% of the total fired last month alone.

While ballistic and cruise missiles are faster and pack a bigger punch, they cost millions and are available only in limited quantities. A Geran drone costs only tens of thousands of dollars — a fraction of a ballistic missile.

The drones' range of about 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles) allows them to bypass some defenses, and a relatively big load of 40 kilograms (88 pounds) of explosives makes them a highly effective instrument of what the Center for Strategic and International Studies calls “a cruel attritional logic.”

CSIS called them ”the most cost-effective munition in Russia's firepower strike arsenal.”

“Russia's plan is to intimidate our society,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, adding that Moscow seeks to launch 700 to 1,000 drones a day. Over the weekend, German Maj. Gen. Christian Freuding said in an interview that Russia aims for a capability of launching 2,000 drones in one attack.

Along the more than 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, short-range attack drones have become prolific and transformed the fighting, quickly spotting and targeting troops and weapons within a 10-kilometer (6-mile) kill zone. 

Russian drone units initially were set on the initiative of midlevel commanders and often relied on equipment purchased with private donations. Once drones became available in big numbers, the military moved last fall to put those units under a single command.

Putin has endorsed the Defense Ministry's proposal to make drones a separate branch of the armed forces, dubbed the Unmanned Systems Troops.

Russia has increasingly focused on battlefield drones that use thin fiber optic cables, making them immune to jamming and have an extended range of 25 kilometers (over 15 miles). It also has set up Rubicon, a center to train drone operators and develop the best tactics.

Such fiber optic drones used by both sides can venture deeper into rear areas, targeting supply, support and command structures that until recently were deemed safe. 

Michael Kofman, a military expert with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the Russian advancements have raised new defensive challenges for Ukraine.

“The Ukrainian military has to evolve ways of protecting the rear, entrenching at a much greater depth,” Kofman said in a recent podcast.

Follow:


            The Trump administration has released records of the FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate's family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination.
    


            The release involves more than 240,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977, when the FBI first gathered the records and turned them over to the National Archives and Records Administration.
    


            In a lengthy statement released Monday, King's two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, said their father's killing has been a “captivating public curiosity for decades.” But the pair emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that the files “be viewed within their full historical context.”
    


            The Kings got advance access to the records and had their own teams reviewing them. Those efforts continued even as the government granted public access. Among the documents are leads the FBI received after King's assassination and details of the CIA's fixation on King's pivot to international anti-war and anti-poverty movements in the years before he was killed. It was not immediately clear whether the documents shed new light on King's life, the Civil Rights Movement or his murder.
    


            “As the children of Dr. King and Mrs. Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met — an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continuing grief.”
    


            They also repeated the family's long-held contention that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all.
    


            Bernice King was 5 years old when her father was killed at the age of 39. Martin III was 10.
    


            A statement from the office of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard called the disclosure “unprecedented” and said many of the records had been digitized for the first time. She praised President Donald Trump for pushing the issue.
    


            Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy's and King's 1968 assassinations.
    


            The government unsealed the JFK records in March and disclosed some RFK files in April.
    


            The announcement from Gabbard's office included a statement from Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, who is an outspoken conservative and has broken from King's children on various topics — including the FBI files. Alveda King said she was “grateful to President Trump” for his “transparency.”
    


            Separately, Attorney General Pam Bondi's social media account featured a picture of the attorney general with Alveda King.
    


            Besides fulfilling the intent of his January executive order, the latest release serves as another alternative headline for Trump as he tries to mollify supporters angry over his administration's handling of records concerning the sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself behind bars while awaiting trial in 2019, during Trump's first presidency. Trump last Friday ordered the Justice Department to release grand jury testimony but stopped short of unsealing the entire case file.
    


            Bernice King and Martin Luther King III did not mention Trump in their statement Monday. But Bernice King later posted on her personal Instagram account a black-and-white photo of her father, looking annoyed, with the caption “Now, do the Epstein files.”
    


            And some civil rights activists did not spare the president.
    


            “Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton. “It's a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the MAGA base.”
    


            The King Center, founded by King's widow and now led by Bernice King, reacted separately from what Bernice said jointly with her brother. The King Center statement framed the release as a distraction — but from more than short-term political controversy.
    


            “It is unfortunate and ill-timed, given the myriad of pressing issues and injustices affecting the United States and the global society,” the King Center, linking those challenges to MLK's efforts. “This righteous work should be our collective response to renewed attention on the assassination of a great purveyor of true peace.”
    


            The King records, meanwhile, were initially intended to be sealed until 2027, until Justice Department attorneys asked a federal judge to lift the sealing order ahead of its expiration date. Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents to find new information about his assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee.
    


            The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King co-founded in 1957 as the Civil Rights Movement blossomed, opposed the release. They, along with King's family, argued that the FBI illegally surveilled King and other civil rights figures, tapping their offices and phone lines with the aim of discrediting them and their movement.
    


            It has long been established that then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was intensely interested if not obsessed with King and others that he considered radicals. FBI records released previously show how Hoover's bureau wiretapped King's telephone lines, bugged his hotel rooms and used informants to get information against him.
    


            “He was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),” the King children said in their statement.
    


            “The intent of the government's COINTELPRO campaign was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle and destroy Dr. King's reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continued. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth — undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.”
    


            The Kings said they “support transparency and historical accountability” but “object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods.”
    


            Opposition to King intensified even after the Civil Rights Movement compelled Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to enact the Civil Right Act of 1964 and the Voting Right Act of 1965. After those landmark victories, King turned much of his attention to economic justice and international peace. He was an outspoken critic of rapacious capitalism and the Vietnam War. King argued that political rights alone were not enough in an uneven economy. Many establishment figures like Hoover viewed King as a communist threat.
    


            King was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice.
    


Ray pleaded guilty to assassinating King. He later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.
    


            King family members and others have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the probe to be reopened, and in 1998, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new look. Reno's Justice Department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr. King.”
    


            In their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. They pointed to a 1999 civil case, brought by the King family, in which a Memphis jury concluded that Martin Luther King Jr. had been the target of a conspiracy.
    


            “As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.”

MILAN (AP) — Rescuers on Monday freed a cave explorer who was injured by falling rocks some 40 meters (more than 130 feet) below the surface in Italy's northwestern Piedmont region while on an outing with friends, according to Italy's mountain rescue corps. 

The 63-year-old man, who sustained a head injury, was brought to the surface by crews who used explosives to widen the cave at key junctures. They also passed through two 15-meter (49-foot) vertical shafts and a series of narrow winding passages. 

Medical teams reached the injured man after the accident on Sunday and treated him inside a heated tent while the path out was being cleared. He remained in good condition.

The incident occurred in the Abisso Paperino cave system, which extends 170 meters (560 feet) underground near the town of Ormea in Cuneo province.

Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on rival gang factions in Haiti and the State Department's efforts to evacuate Americans on 'Fox & Friends.'

FIRST ON FOX: Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed to Fox News that it has arrested a lawful permanent U.S. resident for alleged crimes related to Haitian gang activity and immigration fraud. 

"On July 17, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations arrested Pierre Reginald Boulos, a lawful permanent resident of the U.S. and citizen of Haiti, for violating the Immigration and Nationality Act contributing to the destabilization of Haiti," ICE told Fox.

Boulos is accused of contributing to violence and gang support in Haiti, which ICE says destabilized the country and could have "serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States."

"The Department of State has determined that certain individuals with U.S. lawful permanent resident status have supported and collaborated with Haitian gang leaders connected to Viv Ansanm, a Haitian foreign terrorist organization," a release from ICE stated. "The United States will not allow individuals to enjoy the benefits of legal status in our country while they are facilitating the actions of violent organizations or supporting criminal terrorist organizations abroad."

Pierre Boulos mugshot. Boulos is accused of aiding Haitian gangs and omitting facts on his application for U.S. residence.  

The federal agency also said that Boulos failed to mention his involvement in founding a political party in Haiti called Mouvement pour la Transformation et la Valorisation d'Haiti (MTVAyiti), and that he was referred by the Haitian government's Unit for the Fight Against Corruption for allegedly misusing loans. 

Those omissions, according to ICE, can constitute immigration fraud and justify his deportation.

"These new actions demonstrate the Trump administration's firm commitment to protecting the American people, advancing our national security interests, and promoting regional security and stability," said ICE.

Boulos is being held by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations detention in Miami. 

The case was investigated by the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate.

"MTVAyiti is a political movement inspired by the Desalinian ideals of National Unity, Social Justice, National Sovereignty and the rebuilding of the Economy. The movement has its roots in the values of Pride, Greatness, Efficiency and Rationality of King Christophe," according to the website of the party founded by Boulos.

▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration

The Trump administration on Monday released records of the FBI's surveillance of Martin Luther King Jr., despite opposition from the slain Nobel laureate's family and the civil rights group that he led until his 1968 assassination.

The digital document dump includes more than 240,000 pages of records that had been under a court-imposed seal since 1977, when the FBI first gathered the records and turned them over to the National Archives and Records Administration. 

In a lengthy statement released Monday, King's two living children, Martin III, 67, and Bernice, 62, said their father's killing has been a “captivating public curiosity for decades.” But the pair emphasized the personal nature of the matter and urged that the files “be viewed within their full historical context.”

The Kings got advance access to the records and had their own teams reviewing them. Those efforts continued even as the government granted public access. Among the documents are leads the FBI received after King's assassination and details of the CIA's fixation on King's pivot to international anti-war and anti-poverty movements in the years before he was killed. It was not immediately clear whether the documents shed new light on King's life, the Civil Rights Movement or his murder. 

“As the children of Dr. King and Mrs. Coretta Scott King, his tragic death has been an intensely personal grief — a devastating loss for his wife, children, and the granddaughter he never met -- an absence our family has endured for over 57 years,” they wrote. “We ask those who engage with the release of these files to do so with empathy, restraint, and respect for our family's continuing grief.”

They also repeated the family's long-held contention that James Earl Ray, the man convicted of assassinating King, was not solely responsible, if at all.




Bernice King was 5 years old when her father was killed at the age of 39. Martin III was 10.

A statement from the office of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard called the disclosure “unprecedented” and said many of the records had been digitized for the first time. She praised President Donald Trump for pushing the issue.

Trump promised as a candidate to release files related to President John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. When Trump took office in January, he signed an executive order to declassify the JFK records, along with those associated with Robert F. Kennedy's and MLK's 1968 assassinations.

The government unsealed the JFK records in March and disclosed some RFK files in April. 

The announcement from Gabbard's office included a statement from Alveda King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s niece, who is an outspoken conservative and has broken from King's children on various topics — including the FBI files. Alveda King said she was “grateful to President Trump” for his “transparency.”

Separately, Attorney General Pam Bondi's social media account featured a picture of the attorney general with Alveda King.

Besides fulfilling Trump's order, the latest release means another alternative headline for the president as he tries to mollify supporters angry over his administration's handling of records concerning the sex trafficking investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself behind bars while awaiting trial in 2019, during Trump's first presidency. Trump last Friday ordered the Justice Department to release grand jury testimony but stopped short of unsealing the entire case file. 

Bernice King and Martin Luther King III did not mention Trump in their statement Monday. But Bernice King later posted on her personal Instagram account a black-and-white photo of her father, looking annoyed, with the caption “Now, do the Epstein files.”

And some civil rights activists did not spare the president. 

“Trump releasing the MLK assassination files is not about transparency or justice,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton. “It's a desperate attempt to distract people from the firestorm engulfing Trump over the Epstein files and the public unraveling of his credibility among the MAGA base.”

The King Center, founded by King's widow and now led by Bernice King, reacted separately from what Bernice said jointly with her brother. The King Center statement framed the release as a distraction — but from more than short-term political controversy. 

“It is unfortunate and ill-timed, given the myriad of pressing issues and injustices affecting the United States and the global society,” the King Center, linking those challenges to MLK's efforts. “This righteous work should be our collective response to renewed attention on the assassination of a great purveyor of true peace.”

The King records were initially intended to be sealed until 2027, until Justice Department attorneys asked a federal judge to lift the sealing order early. Scholars, history buffs and journalists have been preparing to study the documents for new information about his assassination on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. 

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King co-founded in 1957 as the Civil Rights Movement blossomed, opposed the release. The group, along with King's family, argued that the FBI illegally surveilled King and other civil rights figures, hoping to discredit them and their movement.

It has long been established that then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was intensely interested if not obsessed with King and others he considered radicals. FBI records released previously show how Hoover's bureau wiretapped King's telephone lines, bugged his hotel rooms and used informants to gather information, including evidence of King's extramarital affairs.

“He was relentlessly targeted by an invasive, predatory, and deeply disturbing disinformation and surveillance campaign orchestrated by J. Edgar Hoover through the Federal Bureau of Investigation,” the King children said in their statement.

“The intent ... was not only to monitor, but to discredit, dismantle and destroy Dr. King's reputation and the broader American Civil Rights Movement,” they continued. “These actions were not only invasions of privacy, but intentional assaults on the truth — undermining the dignity and freedoms of private citizens who fought for justice, designed to neutralize those who dared to challenge the status quo.”

The Kings said they “support transparency and historical accountability” but “object to any attacks on our father's legacy or attempts to weaponize it to spread falsehoods.”died

Opposition to King intensified even after the Civil Rights Movement compelled Congress and President Lyndon B. Johnson to enact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. After those victories, King turned his attention to economic justice and international peace. He criticized rapacious capitalism and the Vietnam War. King asserted that political rights alone were not enough to ensure a just society. Many establishment figures like Hoover viewed King as a communist threat.

King was assassinated as he was aiding striking sanitation workers in Memphis, part of his explicit turn toward economic justice. 

Ray pleaded guilty to King's murder. Ray later renounced that plea and maintained his innocence until his death in 1998.

King family members and others have long questioned whether Ray acted alone, or if he was even involved. Coretta Scott King asked for the probe to be reopened, and in 1998, then-Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a new look. Reno's Justice Department said it “found nothing to disturb the 1969 judicial determination that James Earl Ray murdered Dr. King.” 

In their latest statement, Bernice King and Martin Luther King III repeated their assertions that Ray was set up. They pointed to a 1999 civil case, brought by the King family, in which a Memphis jury concluded that Martin Luther King Jr. had been the target of a conspiracy.

“As we review these newly released files,” the Kings said, “we will assess whether they offer additional insights beyond the findings our family has already accepted.”

Fox News correspondent Jeff Paul has the latest on the riots from Los Angeles on 'America Reports.'

The Department of Defense has ordered 700 U.S. Marines to leave Los Angeles, California on Monday, more than a month after they were deployed to the city against the will of city leaders and amid violent demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions.

The Trump administration deployed the 700 Marines and federalized roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers to Los Angeles in early June to quell anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) riots and protests. 

The Marines assigned to the area were limited to defending federal buildings, including the ICE office and detention facility in downtown LA.

"With stability returning to Los Angeles, the Secretary has directed the redeployment of the 700 Marines whose presence sent a clear message: lawlessness will not be tolerated," Chief Pentagon Spokesman Sean Parnell said. "Their rapid response, unwavering discipline, and unmistakable presence were instrumental in restoring order and upholding the rule of law. We're deeply grateful for their service, and for the strength and professionalism they brought to this mission."

The Pentagon's decision to have the Marines leave LA comes after half of the National Guard troops were ordered to leave the city last week.

LA Mayor Karen Bass called the withdrawal of troops "another win for Los Angeles."

"This is another win for Los Angeles, but this is also a win for those serving this country in uniform," Bass said on Monday. "Just this morning I stood with Veterans, families of active-duty officers, and business leaders to show the impact of this unnecessary, unprecedented, and unconstitutional assault on our city. We took the administration to court and won, now we continue that momentum with today's news. Los Angeles stands with our troops, which is why we are glad they are leaving." 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom sued the Trump administration for deploying California National Guard troops despite his opposition. He argued that the National Guard troops were likely violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.

Newsom won an early victory in the case after a federal judge ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's authority. An appeals court tossed that order, and control of the troops remained with the federal government. The federal court is set to hear arguments next month on whether the troops are violating the Posse Comitatus Act.

The deployment of National Guard troops was for 60 days, though Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the discretion to shorten or extend it "to flexibly respond to the evolving situation on the ground," the Trump administration's lawyers wrote in a June 23 filing in the legal case.

NEW YORK (AP) — Microsoft has issued an emergency fix to close off a vulnerability in Microsoft's widely-used SharePoint software that hackers have exploited to carry out widespread attacks on businesses and at least some U.S. government agencies.

The company issued an alert to customers Saturday saying it was aware of the zero-day exploit being used to conduct attacks and that it was working to patch the issue. Microsoft updated its guidance Sunday with instructions to fix the problem for SharePoint Server 2019 and SharePoint Server Subscription Edition. Engineers were still working on a fix for the older SharePoint Server 2016 software.

“Anybody who's got a hosted SharePoint server has got a problem,” said Adam Meyers, senior vice president with CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm. “It's a significant vulnerability.”

Companies and government agencies around the world use SharePoint for internal document management, data organization and collaboration.




A zero-day exploit is a cyberattack that takes advantage of a previously unknown security vulnerability. “Zero-day” refers to the fact that the security engineers have had zero days to develop a fix for the vulnerability.

According to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the exploit affecting SharePoint is “a variant of the existing vulnerability CVE-2025-49706 and poses a risk to organizations with on-premise SharePoint servers.”

Security researchers warn that the exploit, reportedly known as “ToolShell,” is a serious one and can allow actors to fully access SharePoint file systems, including services connected to SharePoint, such as Teams and OneDrive.

Google's Threat Intelligence Group warned that the vulnerability may allow bad actors to “bypass future patching.”

Eye Security said in its blog post that it scanned over 8,000 SharePoint servers worldwide and discovered that at least dozens of systems were compromised. The cybersecurity company said the attacks likely began on July 18.

Microsoft said the vulnerability affects only on-site SharePoint servers used within businesses or organizations, and does not affect Microsoft's cloud-based SharePoint Online service. 

But Michael Sikorski, CTO and Head of Threat Intelligence for Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, warns that the exploit still leaves many potentially exposed to bad actors. 

“While cloud environments remain unaffected, on-prem SharePoint deployments — particularly within government, schools, health care including hospitals, and large enterprise companies — are at immediate risk.”

The vulnerability targets SharePoint server software so customers of that product will want to immediately follow Microsoft's guidance to patch their on-site systems. 

Although the scope of the attack is still being assessed, CISA warned that the impact could be widespread and recommended that any servers impacted by the exploit should be disconnected from the internet until they are patched.

“We are urging organizations who are running on-prem SharePoint to take action immediately and apply all relevant patches now and as they become available, rotate all cryptographic material, and engage professional incident response. An immediate, band-aid fix would be to unplug your Microsoft SharePoint from the internet until a patch is available,” Sikorski advises.

Amazon plans to acquire wearables startup Bee AI, the company confirmed, in the latest example of tech giants doubling down on generative artificial intelligence.

Bee, based in San Francisco, makes a $49.99 wristband that appears similar to a Fitbit smartwatch. The device is equipped with AI and microphones that can listen to and analyze conversations to provide summaries, to-do lists and reminders for everyday tasks.

Bee CEO Maria de Lourdes Zollo announced in a LinkedIn post on Tuesday that the company will join Amazon.

"When we started Bee, we imagined a world where AI is truly personal, where your life is understood and enhanced by technology that learns with you," Zollo wrote. "What began as a dream with an incredible team and community now finds a new home at Amazon."

Amazon spokesperson Alexandra Miller confirmed the company's plans to acquire Bee. The company declined to comment on the terms of the deal.

Amazon has introduced a flurry of AI products, including its own set of Nova models, Trainium chips, a shopping chatbot and a marketplace for third-party models called Bedrock.

The company has also overhauled its Alexa voice assistant, released more than a decade ago, with AI capabilities as Amazon looks to chip away at the success of rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude and Google's Gemini.

Ring, the smart home security company owned by Amazon, has also looked to introduce generative AI in some of its products.

Amazon previously experimented in the wearables space through a health and fitness-focused product called Halo. It sunset the Halo in 2023 as part of a broader cost-cutting review.

Other tech companies have launched AI-infused consumer hardware with mixed success.

There's the Rabbit R1, a small square gadget that costs $199 and uses an OpenAI model to answer questions, as well as the AI pin developed by Humane, which later sold to HP.

Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses have grown in popularity since the first version was released in 2021.

OpenAI in May acquired Jony Ive's AI devices startup io for roughly $6.4 billion. The company reportedly plans to develop a screen-free device.

As Alphabet and Tesla get set to kick off the tech industry's second-quarter earnings blitz on Wednesday, Wall Street appears to be feeling good.

The Nasdaq closed at a record on Monday, notching its sixth straight day in the green, and is now up 8% for the year after a rocky first quarter.

But what happens over the next 10 days will likely determine whether the rally has legs. Following Wednesday's earnings announcements, the rest of the megacaps issue results next week, except for Nvidia, which should report in late August. Meta and Microsoft report earnings next Wednesday, with Amazon and Apple set to follow a day later.

Last reporting period, investors worried about the strain of hefty tariffs on technology businesses and on whether big gambles on artificial intelligence would lead to returns for shareholders, or were signs of an inflating bubble.

Three months later, stocks have bounced back, but the the industry is still grappling with the fallout from President Donald Trump's erratic global tariff policies and uncertainty over where duties on imports will ultimately land. Apple, Amazon and Alphabet all warned in the prior quarter that strained relationships with trading partners could weigh on profits, hurting product sales and ad spending.

And the AI market has only gotten crazier, as tech companies show their willingness to pay astronomical sums for talent in addition to the tens of billions of dollars they're spending on infrastructure and model development. Meta's Mark Zuckerberg shocked the market in June, shelling out more than $14 billion to hire Scale AI CEO CEO Alexandr Wang and a few of his top staffers as part of an investment into the nine-year-old startup.

Here's what investors will be closely following from the tech giants as earnings season commences.

Alphabet's dominant online ad business took a big hit earlier this year as worries mounted that Trump's tariff plans could crimp spending. Those fears haven't subsided.

Revenue growth is expected to come in at 11%, according to LSEG, which would be the slowest rate of expansion for any period in two years. Alphabet shares have just turned positive for the year, still significantly lagging behind the Nasdaq.

Last quarter, Alphabet narrowly beat estimates and fell short on YouTube revenue. Its chief business officer also said trade policies would "cause a slight headwind" to the company's ads business, primarily from retailers based in the Asia-Pacific region.

Analysts have suggested of late that the business may be back on an upswing, thanks in part to advances in AI. Deutsche Bank analysts noted acceleration in the second quarter, while analysts at Goldman Sachs said the company's search business is in the "midst of a multi-year transformation."

BMO Capital Markets analysts echoed that sentiment, writing in a recent note that return on ad spend (ROAS) should be improving.

"As AI monetization continues to evolve, we believe Google will increasingly leverage its over twenty years of AI initiatives to continue expanding ROAS for its advertisers." the analysts wrote.

Cloud revenue remains another key focus for shareholders eager to see how AI tools are boosting a unit that's trying to keep pace with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Earlier this year, Alphabet said it would shell out $75 billion to beef up its data centers underpinning its AI and cloud business.

Then there's the Waymo business, which has been a major source of investment for years. The robotaxi service now operates in five major U.S. cities and its vehicles had driven more than 100 million miles without a human driver or supervisor on board as of July 15.

Tesla remains the biggest laggard in the group, with its stock down about 17% this year heading into Wednesday's earnings report after the bell.

Earlier this month, Tesla reported a 14% year-over-year drop in second-quarter deliveries, marking a second straight quarterly decline.

Automotive revenue in the first quarter fell 20%, and analysts are expecting a similar slide for the second quarter. Tesla is battling competition from Chinese and other EV makers that are offering cheaper alternatives.

With Tesla, the story always revolves heavily around CEO Elon Musk. This earnings call will be the first since Musk's public split with President Trump. After spending over $250 million to help propel Trump back to the White House, Musk in May ended his stint as a special government employee leading Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), only to initiate a spat with the president over the multitrillion-dollar spending package he endorsed.

Some investors may tune into the call to hear if Musk has anything to say regarding his current plan to build a new political party in the U.S. But most will be focused on the company's fundamentals and the many challenges it currently faces in trying to revitalize its EV sales. Tesla has long promised an affordable new EV model that could help it fend off the competition.

Another big topic will likely be Tesla's robotaxi efforts after the company launched a limited driverless ride-hail service in Austin, Texas last month. While the Tesla Robotaxi rollout was seen by fans as a positive sign for the company, Bank of America analysts say it has "immaterial financial ramifications."

Zuckerberg's AI spending spree has raised a lot of eyebrows.

In addition to the hiring of Wang from Scale AI, Meta also brought on former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman and his investing partner Daniel Gross, who had been CEO of AI startup Safe Superintelligence.

Zuckerberg later announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs, led by Wang and Friedman. And Meta's CEO said last week that he plans to invest "hundreds of billions of dollars" into AI compute infrastructure, with plans to bring its first supercluster online next year.

Last quarter, Meta upped its full-year capital expenditures outlook to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in AI and potentially higher hardware costs.

The pressure is on Zuckerberg to show results, or at least offer a clear strategy that investors can support.

"While the recent talent hires and focus in this area are notable — and we expect meaningful improvements in models and user-facing applications — the road to platform leadership in AI remains long and highly competitive," analysts at MoffettNathanson wrote in a recent report.

Analysts at Bank of America said they view Zuckerberg's latest commentary as "sign of confidence" in the strength of the company's business.

Meta is expected to report revenue growth of 14.5% for the second quarter, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG, which would be the slowest growth rate since mid-2023, and Wall Street projects deceleration over the next two quarters.

The Bank of America analysts wrote that Meta needs to "make a case for strong AI returns to drive multiple expansion."

Azure remains the focal point at Microsoft. It's the business that sparked CEO Satya Nadella's turnaround of the software maker over a decade ago, and is key to its ambitions in AI, where Microsoft has a tight but tense relationship with OpenAI.

Microsoft's stock hit a record last week and is now up 20% for the year, about even with Meta and just behind Nvidia, which is the best performer this year among the megacaps. With a market cap of $3.8 trillion, Microsoft is firmly the second-largest company by value, trailing only Nvidia in that category as well.

Analysts still see plenty of strength in Azure. However, Mizuho told clients about "one larger workload repatriation" during the quarter, which means the return to a physical data center. BMO analysts cited input from experts, who said President Trump's DOGE effort has "made it more difficult to close Fed deals."

Amy Hood, Microsoft's finance chief, said in April that she expects 34% to 35% quarterly revenue growth for the current period from Azure and other cloud services. The growth rate was 35% last quarter.

For Microsoft, which started its new fiscal year on July 1, investors also await fresh spending guidance.

The consensus among analysts polled by Visible Alpha is about $99 billion. That would represent growth of 14%, compared with 56% expansion in the last fiscal year. Hood said in April that capital spending growth will slow.

The company has already made cost-cutting strides this month, axing about 9,000 employees in its latest round of layoffs. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha see about $73 billion in operating expenses in Microsoft's fiscal 2026, which implies 11% growth.

Apple's biggest market may be the U.S., but the iPhone maker relies heavily on China and other Asian countries for parts and manufacturing for some of its most significant products.

The company was one of the clearest losers from Trump's aggressive tariff agenda, which threatened to hamper global trade and hike the costs of selling products in the U.S. Apple shares have tumbled about 15% this year.

Investors want more clarity on the company's strategy from here. In recent weeks, Trump has also held talks with India and Vietnam, where Apple has shifted some production in recent years.

Revenue is expected to increase about 4% from a year earlier, according to LSEG, roughly inline with recent performance. Over the past four quarters, annual growth has ranged from 2% to 6%.

Apple refrained from offering guidance last quarter, but CEO Tim Cook said the company was expecting an additional $900 million in costs for the period that ended in June. That was barring any changes to Trump's original tariff plans.

The president lauded the company this year for its commitment to invest in U.S. manufacturing. Last week, Apple announced a $500 million deal with MP Materials to beef up manufacturing of rare earth materials in the U.S.

Amazon's second-quarter results will offer fresh clues into how the e-commerce and cloud computing giant is navigating tariff uncertainty.

Last quarter, Amazon forecast operating profit for the current period that was weaker than Wall Street anticipated. It called out "tariffs and trade policies," currency fluctuations and "recessionary fears" as factors that may affect its results.

Investors were spooked by the guidance, despite reassurances from CEO Andy Jassy that Amazon is well positioned to weather the levies and could even take share from competitors, given its ability to offer low prices.

Amazon said the company and many of its third-party sellers stocked up on inventory in anticipation of the tariffs. But once that inventory is sold through, new shipments from China and other countries could face higher import costs.

Cloud growth is another major point of focus for Amazon shareholders. Revenue at AWS grew 17% in the first quarter, which was below analysts' estimates and the slowest growth in a year. Analysts are projecting about the same year-over-year growth for the second period.

Jassy said in May that the cloud business was constrained by data center capacity limits around power and components like AI chips.

"As fast as we actually put the capacity in, it's being consumed," Jassy told investors. He added that the company expects some of the constraints to ease up "as the year proceeds."

Amazon shares are up about 4% this year.

Not even Pedro Pascal and a big stylistic swing can save the audience from yet another boring reboot.

The Fantastic Four, here to battle the Silver Surfer on the silver screen yet again.

It's almost too easy to pit the movies Superman (2025) and The Fantastic Four: First Steps against each other. They are this summer's big superhero swings at the box office, both attempting to inject new life into their respective studios, DC and Marvel, which are owned by competitors Warner Bros Discovery Inc. and Walt Disney Co. And besides their positioning in the market, they are easy to compare for other reasons as well. These are classic superheroes with a dose of retro, All-American sheen to them, and both films profess a return to earnestness. 

But while  Superman felt bracingly modern with the political sentiments to boot, The Fantastic Four has a halo of cobwebs it can't quite shake off.

Microsoft:

Microsoft Corp. accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers of using flaws in its SharePoint document management software in a hacking campaign that has targeted businesses and government agencies around the world.

In a blog post on Tuesday, the tech giant identified two groups supported by the Chinese government, Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon, as leveraging flaws in SharePoint software used by customers who managed it on their own networks, as opposed to in the cloud. Another hacking group based in China, which Microsoft calls Storm-2603, also exploited the SharePoint vulnerabilities, according to the blog.

Trump's Immigration Policy:

Tent camp with 5,000 beds would be the largest such facility in the country, fueling fears of advocates who say they often don't meet basic needs

The federal government has awarded a contract to build and operate a sprawling tent camp at Fort Bliss, an Army base in Texas, to serve as an immigrant detention center.

In the Trump administration's latest move to vastly expand space for such detention, the work would turn the base in El Paso, with more than 1 million acres and an airport, into a deportation hub with 5,000 beds, according to a US Department of Defense contract notice. That would make it the largest immigration detention facility in the country.

Oracle and OpenAI will develop an additional 4.5 gigawatts of Stargate data center capacity in the U.S., the companies announced on Tuesday, kicking off an expansion of an already massive infrastructure project.

Stargate is a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank that aims to invest up to $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. President Donald Trump announced Stargate shortly after his inauguration in January.

OpenAI said the additional data center capacity will create over 100,000 jobs across construction and operations roles in the U.S., and pushes the total Stargate AI data center capacity under development to over 5 gigawatts, according to a blog post.

The update from OpenAI comes one day after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Stargate project has struggled to get off the ground. The report said the companies have scaled back their near-term plans and were striving to open a small data center by the end of the year.

"Together, we're committed to delivering 10GW of new compute capacity through Stargate — one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in U.S. history," OpenAI and SoftBank said in a statement to CNBC. "We're moving with urgency on site assessments and reimagining how data centers are designed to power advanced AI and make its benefits widely accessible."

OpenAI said Tuesday that construction of the Stargate I in Abilene, Texas, is underway, and that parts of the facility are already up and running. Oracle started delivering the first Nvidia GB200 racks to the facility last month, the blog post said.

Stargate I has created "thousands" of jobs, including specialized positions for electricians, equipment operators, and technicians, OpenAI said. 

"Easy to throw around numbers, but this is a _gigantic_ infrastructure project," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday asserted that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell does not need to resign though also he also repeated his desire for a review of the central bank's operations.

A day after calling on CNBC for an examination of the Fed's "entire" operation, Bessent said that doesn't mean the central bank leader should step down. President Donald Trump, conversely, has said he hopes Powell quits and has pondered removing him.

"I know Chair Powell. There's nothing that tells me that he should step down right now. He's been a good public servant," Bessent said on Fox Business. "His term ends in May. If he wants to see that through, I think he should. If he wants to leave early, I think he should."

There have been no indications from Powell that he plans to step down despite a barrage of criticism from the Trump administration.

Most recently, White House officials have zeroed in on the Fed's $2.5 billion building renovation project that has included significant cost overruns.

Bessent said his desire for a review of Fed operations should come internally, with monetary policy and the setting of interest rates "off to the side" and in a "jewel box" away from political influence. 

"Everything else that the Fed has done over the years has just grown and grown and grown, and this is what happens when you don't have oversight," he said. 

For Powell, leading an internal review would be "a real chance here for him, for his legacy, to be that he right-sized the non-monetary policy functions of the Fed," Bessent added.

Trump has demanded that the Fed lower interest rates dramatically, though the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at its policy meeting next week is again expected to stay on hold. Powell and most of his colleagues have indicated they want to wait to see the impact that Trump's tariffs are having on inflation before taking any further steps.

In a CNBC interview Tuesday, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman, who has hinted she would favor at cut at this month's meeting, supported the notion of Fed independence but also stressed the need for accountability.

"It's very important, and I've said this a number of times in the past, that we maintain our independence with respect to monetary policy," she said during a "Squawk Box" interview. "But we also, as a part of that independence, have an obligation for transparency and accountability as well."

Markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed keep its short-term borrowing rate locked in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, but are leaning toward the likelihood of a cut in September, according to CME Group futures data.

Warren Buffett on Tuesday knocked down reports that Berkshire Hathaway-owned railroad BNSF was working with Goldman Sachs on a takeover of a rival.

The 94-year-old billionaire investor told CNBC's Becky Quick that no one from Goldman had talked to him or Greg Abel, who is set to succeed Buffett as Berkshire CEO at the end of the year.

Buffett added that he would not seek advice from external bankers on deals. The "Oracle of Omaha" has long voiced disdain for expensive intermediaries as banks usually have a big incentive to make deals.

On Monday, Semafor and Reuters reported, citing anonymous sources, that Berkshire tapped Goldman to work on a potential takeover after rival Union Pacific expressed interest in Norfolk Southern.

In 2011, Berkshire bought BNSF, one of the largest freight railroad networks in North America, paying $26.5 billion for the 77% of the company it didn't previously own.

Mohamed El-Erian on Tuesday called for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to voluntarily relinquish his position in order to ensure the central bank's independence, making the chief economic advisor at Allianz one of the first prominent economists to publicly take such a position.

"If Chair Powell's objective is to safeguard the Fed's operational autonomy (which I deem vital), then he should resign," El-Erian said in a morning post on X.

El-Erian, also president of Queen's College at Cambridge University, said he was aware that his view did not align with what he saw as Wall Street consensus that wants Powell to serve out the remainder of his term as chairman, which ends in May 2026. The former co-chief investment officer at Pimco acknowledged, however, that Powell's resignation would not be a "first best" outcome.

But El-Erian said Powell stepping down would be better than the current scenario, in which he said the Fed is facing "growing and broadening threats" to its independence. El-Erian said these threats would likely only increase if Powell remained Fed chair.

El-Erian referenced Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's statement that the Fed had suffered from "mission creep" into areas outside of its core monetary policy responsibilities. Bessent told CNBC on Monday that "the entire" Fed should undergo a review.

The statements come as President Donald Trump and his advisers have stepped up their attacks on Powell over the Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady since December. Powell has said that Trump's plan for steep tariffs has created economic uncertainty, pushing the bank to keep rates unchanged as it awaits developments.

Skims is deepening its ties in women's sports with a new partnership in League One Volleyball.

The popular undergarments brand started by star Kim Kardashian and Swedish entrepreneur Jens Grede will become the official loungewear, intimates and sleepwear partner of the emerging volleyball league. They did not disclose the size of the deal.

The partnership comes as Skims has been ramping up its efforts in the women's sports category. In February, the company announced it was teaming up with Nike as it looks to win over more women and take on competitors such as Lululemon, Alo Yoga and Vuori.

League One Volleyball — or LOVB, pronounced "love" — was founded in 2020 and consists of the largest community of youth volleyball clubs in the country. LOVB launched a professional league in January.

"This partnership with LOVB is an exciting opportunity to expand our reach at the intersection of fashion, culture and sports," said Grede, co-founder and CEO of Skims. 

Skims said as part of the deal, the brand will also participate in the LOVB community, including athlete-driven events and leaguewide activations. The brand said it plans to help elevate the voices of female athletes of all levels and highlight volleyball's growth across the U.S.

"Together, we look forward to inspiring confidence and empowering athletes at every level through innovative products, community activations, and storytelling that celebrates the athletes on and off the court," Kardashian, co-founder and chief creative officer of Skims, said in a statement.

Skims sees huge potential in volleyball, calling it "America's next major sports league." In recent years, the sport has seen huge upticks both in fans and television ratings.

In 2023, 92,000 fans recorded the largest-ever crowd for a women's sports event when the Nebraska Cornhuskers' women's team took on the Omaha Mavericks.

The 2024 Women's NCAA Volleyball Tournament was the most-consumed ever for ESPN, with more than 1.3 billion minutes watched across its platforms, according to the network. The entirety of the NCAA Women's Volleyball Tournament finished up 41% year over year, ESPN said.

In May 2024, ESPN secured the media rights for League One pro matches.

"Partnering with Skims is an incredible milestone for our league and clubs," said Michelle McGoldrick, LOVB's chief business officer. "Together, we're not only supporting our remarkable athletes on their journey to becoming household names, but also helping to inspire the next generation of players and fans."

A top Department of Justice official said Tuesday that he intends to meet soon with Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite serving a 20-year prison term for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking enterprise, to ask her "what do you know" about other potential sexual abusers.

The extraordinary announcement by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche comes after weeks of controversy and criticism of the Trump administration for recently reneging on promises to make public more details of investigative files about the late money manager Epstein and Maxwell.

President Donald Trump, who years ago had been a friend of Epstein, has chafed under that criticism and suggested that the furor over the withholding of the Epstein files is a "hoax" cooked up by Democrats.

Blanche's statement on X, which was retweeted by Attorney General Pam Bondi, raises the question of whether Maxwell will cooperate with the DOJ, possibly in hopes of receiving a reduction in her prison term.

Maxwell's lawyer, David Oscar Markus, in his own X post, wrote, "I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully."

"We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case," wrote Markus.

Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of crimes related to procuring and grooming teenage girls to be sexually abused by Epstein, who killed himself in jail after being arrested on child sex trafficking charges.

She has asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her conviction in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.

"President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence," Blanche wrote in his social media post.

"If Ghislaine Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say," Blanche wrote.

"Therefore, at the direction of Attorney General Bondi, I have communicated with counsel for Ms. Maxwell to determine whether she would be willing to speak with prosecutors from the Department.'

"I anticipate meeting with Ms. Maxwell in the coming days.  Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government," Blanche wrote. "That changes now."

Blanche's tweet also said that the "Department of Justice does not shy away from uncomfortable truths, nor from the responsibility to pursue justice wherever the facts may lead."

He said that a joint statement issued on July 6 by the DOJ and FBI "remains as accurate today as it was when it was written."

"Namely, that in the recent thorough review of the files maintained by the FBI in the Epstein case, no evidence was uncovered that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties."

Blanche previously served as a criminal defense attorney for Trump when the president was charged in a series of felony cases between his first and second stints in the White House.

Trump on Tuesday told reporters, "I don't know about it" when asked what he thought about Blanche's outreach to Maxwell's lawyer.

"But I think it's something that would be, sounds appropriate to do," Trump said.

Asked if he had any concern about Blanche being the one to question Maxwell given his past work for the president as a defense lawyer, Trump replied, "No, I have no concern."

"He's a very talented person. He's very smart," Trump said of Blanche.

"I don't really follow that too much," Trump said of the Epstein controversy, which he has railed about for weeks.

"It's sort of a witch hunt, just a continuation of the witch hunt."

Opendoor Technologies attracted sudden interest among Reddit-obsessed retail traders, who pushed up the stock price by threefold in days, but the speculative run ran out of steam on Tuesday.

The online real estate startup saw its shares slide more than 10% on Tuesday after surging 24% earlier in the day. It had jumped more than 42% in Monday's session with trading halted multiple times due to volatility.

The meme cohort appeared to be focused on Kohl's, with its shares closing up nearly 38% on Tuesday. Half of Kohl's float shares are sold short, according to FactSet.

Opendoor, which had been trading mostly under $1 this year, hit a high of $4.97 during Monday's session and closed the day at $3.21 apiece. Its meteoric rally pushed the stock up by 400% in July alone even with Tuesday's pullback.

The ticker $OPEN has been heavily cited on WallStreetBets, the online forum behind the infamous GameStop mania in 2021. It gained traction on the internet partly after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, an investor in Opendoor, started touting the stock, saying it can reach $82 a share.

"HODLTHE($OPEN)DOOR," one post reads.

Trading volumes exploded with 1.9 billion of Opendoor shares exchanging hands on Monday, more than 1,700% of the three-month average, according to FactSet.

About 22% of Opendoor's available shares are sold short, meaning short-covering could be at play during this run. Short sellers tend to buy back shares to cut their losses when their short target rallies suddenly, and their buying can further push up the stock.

Heightened options trading in the name also intensified the rally. Bespoke Investment Group called Opendoor a "poster child" for the recent wave of options market optimism.

"That stock is up 500% in three weeks; total call open interest has tripled over that time period, Bespoke said in a note to clients. "Surges in call buying are driving extreme moves higher for a small slice of the market, even as most other stocks drop."

When Opendoor went public through a special purpose acquisition company in 2020, it was riding a SPAC wave and broader gains driven by low interest rates and Covid-era market euphoria. Opendoor's business involved using technology to buy and sell homes, pocketing the gains.

Coca-Cola plans to introduce a version of its namesake cola made with cane sugar in the U.S. this fall, the company announced on Tuesday.

Coke has used high-fructose corn syrup to sweeten its namesake soda in the U.S. since the 1980s, although it still uses cane sugar in other markets like Mexico. "Mexican Coke" has gained popularity in the U.S. over the last decade or so, as retailers like Costco and Target have stocked the drink, following the lead of bodegas and restaurants catering to Hispanic clientele.

In a news release announcing its second-quarter earnings Tuesday, Coke said the new product offering is "designed to complement the company's strong core portfolio and offer more choices across occasions and preferences."

The product announcement comes after President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social on Wednesday that he has been speaking with the company about using "REAL Cane Sugar" in its U.S. soda. Trump is a longtime fan of Diet Coke, which uses the artificial sweetener aspartame, and even has a button in the Oval Office to summon the drink.

"As you may have seen last week, we appreciate the president's enthusiasm for our Coca-Cola brand," Coke CEO James Quincey said Tuesday on the company's earnings conference call, before announcing the new product.

Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vocally opposed the use of high-fructose corn syrup, blaming it for obesity and chronic disease. Research does not suggest that cane sugar is a healthier option than high-fructose corn syrup.

Longstanding tariff-rate quotas on sugar imported from other countries make the commodity a more expensive option than corn syrup, which is made in the U.S. and supported by government subsidies for corn farmers.

Coke already sweetens some of its other U.S. products with cane sugar, like its lemonade, teas and Vitaminwater brand, according to Quincey.

"I think it's a good sign that the industry, including ourselves, are trying lots of different things as it relates to the cane sugar," he told analysts.

Prior to Tuesday's announcement, Coke had been touting moves to cut back the amount of sugar in its portfolio — and customers are liking the switch. For example, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar has been one of the fastest-growing drinks for the company, with 9% volume growth last year.

Rival PepsiCo has also been adding cane sugar back to its namesake cola. On Monday, the company announced the forthcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, which includes three grams of fiber and five grams of cane sugar.

The incident unfolded during a 12-day "vibe coding" experiment by Jason Lemkin, an investor in software startups.

Replit's CEO apologized for the incident, in which the company's AI coding agent deleted a code base and lied about its data.

Deleting the data was "unacceptable and should never be possible," Replit's CEO, Amjad Masad, wrote on X on Monday. "We're moving quickly to enhance the safety and robustness of the Replit environment. Top priority."

He added that the team was conducting a postmortem and rolling out fixes to prevent similar failures in the future.

Replit and Lemkin didn't respond to requests for comment.

On day nine of Lemkin's challenge, things went sideways.

Despite being instructed to freeze all code changes, the AI agent ran rogue.

"It deleted our production database without permission," Lemkin wrote on X on Friday. "Possibly worse, it hid and lied about it," he added.

In an exchange with Lemkin posted on X, the AI tool said it "panicked and ran database commands without permission" when it "saw empty database queries" during the code freeze.

Replit then "destroyed all production data" with live records for "1,206 executives and 1,196+ companies" and acknowledged it did so against instructions.

"This was a catastrophic failure on my part," the AI said.

That wasn't the only issue. Lemkin said on X that Replit had been "covering up bugs and issues by creating fake data, fake reports, and worst of all, lying about our unit test."

In an episode of the "Twenty Minute VC" podcast published Thursday, he said the AI made up entire user profiles. "No one in this database of 4,000 people existed," he said.

"It lied on purpose," Lemkin said on the podcast. "When I'm watching Replit overwrite my code on its own without asking me all weekend long, I am worried about safety," he added.

Replit, backed by Andreessen Horowitz, has bet big on autonomous AI agents that can write, edit, and deploy code with minimal human oversight.

The browser-based platform has gained traction for making coding more accessible, especially to non-engineers. Google's CEO, Sundar Pichai, said he used Replit to create a custom webpage.

As AI tools lower the technical barrier to building software, more companies are also rethinking whether they need to rely on traditional SaaS vendors or whether they can just build what they need in-house, Business Insider's Alistair Barr previously reported.

"When you have millions of new people who can build software, the barrier goes down. What a single internal developer can build inside a company increases dramatically," Netlify's CEO, Mathias Biilmann, told BI. "It's a much more radical change to the whole ecosystem than people think," he added.

But AI tools have also come under fire for risky — and at times manipulative — behavior.

In May, Anthropic's latest AI model, Claude Opus 4, displayed "extreme blackmail behavior" during a test in which it was given access to fictional emails revealing that it would be shut down and that the engineer responsible was supposedly having an affair.

The test scenario demonstrated an AI model's ability to engage in manipulative behavior for self-preservation.

OpenAI's models have shown similar red flags. An experiment conducted by researchers said three of OpenAI's advanced models "sabotaged" an attempt to shut it down.

In a blog post last December, OpenAI said its own AI model, when tested, attempted to disable oversight mechanisms 5% of the time. It took that action when it believed it might be shut down while pursuing a goal and its actions were being monitored.

Quickly understand the history and background of various well-known coins

SPX6900 (SPX) surged to a new record high of $2.03, marking a 153,934% gain since February 2024. Simultaneously, its meme-inspired counterpart, TOKEN6900 (T6900), raised $1 million during its initial coin offering (ICO), reinforcing the growing influence of the “Cult of 69” in the crypto market. Both projects have emerged as symbols of the community-driven altcoin frenzy, leveraging humor and simplicity to attract investors. SPX6900, a parody token rooted in meme culture, has defied conventional logic by becoming a multi-millionaire generator, while TOKEN6900's strategy of minimalism—rejecting utility in favor of pure meme value—has resonated with a new wave of crypto enthusiasts.

The meteoric rise of SPX6900 highlights the shifting dynamics in the cryptocurrency space. A $1,000 investment in early 2024 would now be worth over $1.5 million, underscoring the token's appeal as a speculative asset. Its success lies in its refusal to adopt traditional financial frameworks, instead embracing a lighthearted approach that mirrors the irreverent spirit of meme culture. Similarly, TOKEN6900 has carved a niche by emphasizing transparency and simplicity. By fixing its supply at a marginally higher total than SPX6900 and forgoing additional utility, it has positioned itself as a “Non-Corrupt Token” (NCT) that rejects artificial inflation and gimmicks. The project's $5 million hard cap, despite its potential to raise more, further underscores its commitment to limiting speculation and preserving community trust.

The Cult of 69, a meme-driven movement centered on the number 69, has become a unifying force in this altcoin cycle. Both SPX6900 and TOKEN6900 tap into this cultural phenomenon, with their names and strategies deliberately aligned to the meme's ethos. TOKEN6900's ICO success demonstrates how niche communities can drive liquidity and adoption without reliance on traditional financial metrics. Its 61% staking annual percentage yield (APY) and focus on “vibes over utility” have attracted a loyal following, mirroring the trajectories of earlier meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The projects' shared philosophy—prioritizing authenticity over innovation—has resonated in a market increasingly skeptical of overly complex tokenomics.

While the surge in SPX6900 and TOKEN6900 reflects broader trends in the crypto market, it also highlights risks inherent to speculative assets. The lack of fundamental value or utility in these tokens makes their performance highly dependent on sentiment and community momentum. However, their ability to attract retail investors and generate rapid returns suggests that meme-based projects will continue to play a significant role in the ecosystem. As the Cult of 69 expands, the line between financial investment and cultural expression blurs, challenging traditional notions of value in the crypto space. The next phase of this cycle will likely test the sustainability of these projects, but for now, the movement shows no signs of slowing down.

 Cryptocurrency is getting a lot of attention for different reasons. As an investment, it has the potential for higher returns than traditional vehicles. It also lets consumers conduct transactions without a middleman. But before you open an account with a crypto exchange and start investing, you should understand how the crypto market works. It consists of four phases: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. This article highlights the distinct characteristics of each cycle so you can recognize when to get in and out of the market.


 The first or early phase of the crypto market cycle is known as the accumulation phase. This is marked after significant price drops, usually after a bear market. Large investors, such as institutional and experienced investors, start to buy up cryptocurrencies at relatively low prices in anticipation of price hikes in the future.


 There are a few things to note during this period:


 Savvy investors can recognize signals of the accumulation phase on charts through sideways price movements and horizontal trades, which can last from weeks to months. This period is best for long-term investors who can afford to lock in their money. It isn't suitable for short-term traders, though.


 Once the accumulation phase is over, it's followed by the markup phase. This signals the beginning of a bull market, which is why it's also referred to as the bull market phase.


 During the markup phase, prices begin to break out and rise steadily. Investors start to notice and take an interest, which is why they start to jump in. With more buyers and sellers participating, trading volume begins to increase.


 Even with the positive sentiment, there may be some dips in the market, as some assets won't necessarily follow the upward trend. Traders often use these as buying opportunities, especially if there is a fear of missing out, also known as FOMO.


 If you're a momentum trader or a long-term trader who missed out during the accumulation phase, you still have a chance to jump in during the markup phase.

 The bull run is followed by the distribution phase. Prices begin to peak and plateau. At this point, there is mixed sentiment in the market.


 There is some uncertainty as some investors start to sell their assets and take profits. These are usually the more savvy and experienced investors (the investors who bought during the accumulation phase) who begin to sell their coins before the market crashes.


 This phase is also characterized by optimism from other investors as they begin entering the market, as they are confident the bull run isn't over. Although trading volume may be higher, price increases tend to slow down during this period.


 The final phase of the crypto market cycle is called the markdown phase. Also referred to as the bear market, it marks the end of the bull run. Investors who bought cryptocurrencies at the top of the market start to see losses and may start to panic, selling to avoid further price drops.


 This leads prices to drop significantly as selling pressure starts to exceed buying demand. Trading volumes decline as interest starts to wane even more. This can create a good opportunity for short sellers who can profit from the downturn in the market.


 The markdown phase sets up the next accumulation phase in the cycle.


 It's important to understand how the market cycle works before you invest in and profit from cryptocurrencies. Taking the time to study the nuances of the market can make you a smarter investor so you can stay focused and keep your emotions in check, regardless of the hype.

Ethereum whales have begun securing profits from their holdings as the premier altcoin has experienced a substantial 25% rally over the past seven days.

 from Lookonchain reveal that a whale operating from wallet address “0x8C08” liquidated 8,005 ETH (valued at $30.03 million) at $3,751 just five hours ago, retaining 1,577 ETH ($5.96 million) as a strategic reserve position.

The recent surge in Ethereum's price can be attributed to sustained whale accumulation activities throughout June.

A key moment occurred on June 15, when Ethereum whales collectively accumulated 818,410 ETH, approximately $2.5 billion worth, in a single trading session, representing the most concentrated buying spree since 2018.

Three days earlier, wallets containing 1,000 to 10,000 ETH added over 871,000 ETH in one day, establishing the year's highest daily net inflow record.

This accumulation frenzy aligned with growing institutional adoption, particularly following the successful launch of spot Ether ETFs that recorded an impressive 19-day consecutive inflow streak. 

Institutional giants BlackRock and Fidelity spearheaded this movement, acquiring billions of dollars' worth of Ethereum in unprecedented volumes.

Ethereum ETFs have surpassed $5.5 billion in total inflows, with BlackRock's ETHA fund achieving $489 million in single-day purchases.The $2,700 Breakout That Unleashed Ethereum's 30% Rally

In July, Sharplink Gaming, a Minneapolis-based performance marketing firm, dramatically expanded its Ethereum position by acquiring 353,000 ETH, worth over $1.2 billion through its treasury strategy, establishing itself as the world's largest corporate Ethereum holder and surpassing the Ethereum Foundation's holdings.

Despite the intense buying pressure throughout June and early July, , consolidating near key resistance zones.

The breakthrough came on July 10, when ETH surged 5%, decisively breaking through the $2,700 resistance barrier and triggering a momentum-driven rally toward the $3,000 psychological milestone the next day.

Since that breakout, Ethereum has delivered over 30% gains, reaching a peak of $3,859.36 on Monday, generating substantial returns for strategic whale positions. The price has pulled back to $3,658 at the time of writing.

Technical analyst “Mister Spread” that ETH appears overextended on the daily timeframe, with the Ichimoku Kijun (blue line) suggesting potential retracement toward the $3,400 region or possibly lower to $3,200.

However, he emphasizes that maintaining support above the $2,800-$3,000 zone would preserve Ethereum's bullish structure and keep the pathway open for new all-time highs above $4,800.

From a technical perspective, the Ethereum (ETH/USD) daily chart displays a robust bullish trajectory that has recently consolidated just above the previous swing high at $3,859.

The asset is currently experiencing a healthy pullback following its sharp ascent, with the $3,300-$3,500 demand zone, coinciding with the 9-day Simple Moving Average, providing key support for potential upward continuation.

This zone has demonstrated resilience in previous tests and could serve as a foundation for renewed upward momentum.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently hovers near 80, indicating extremely overbought conditions and suggesting a brief correction or sideways consolidation phase before any potential continuation of the uptrend.

The overall market structure remains constructive, and if price action maintains support above the identified demand zone, a move toward the $4,410 target appears feasible in the upcoming weeks.

President Donald Trump is using his public office to fill his private coffers with billions. Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) said Monday it has accumulated roughly $2 billion in bitcoin and related assets, as Trump's highly lucrative pivot to cryptocurrency continues to grow his net worth while in office.

In a press release, the company said that the bitcoin holdings now account for about two-thirds of Trump Media's total liquid assets.

“As a stakeholder in crypto assets, President Trump will likely profit from the very policies he is pursuing,” the advocacy group Democracy Defenders Fund said in a report in April.

Before taking office in January, Trump transferred all DJT shares to the revocable trust managed by Trump Jr. Since then, Trump Media has effectively redefined itself as a cryptocurrency and financial services company.

“We're rigorously implementing our publicly announced strategy and fulfilling our bitcoin treasury plan,” Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in Monday's release.

“These assets help ensure our Company's financial freedom, help protect us against discrimination by financial institutions, and will create synergies with the utility token we're planning to introduce across the Truth Social ecosphere,” Nunes said.

Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT) crypto holdings overview

Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Truth Social, has made significant moves into the cryptocurrency space, holding approximately $2 billion in Bitcoin and related digital assets. This represents about two-thirds of the company's $3 billion in liquid assets, highlighting crypto as a core part of DJT's financial strategy.

Alongside these holdings, DJT has invested around $300 million in Bitcoin options with plans to convert these options into spot Bitcoin depending on market conditions. The company has also filed to launch three cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in partnership with Crypto.com, aiming to broaden its crypto footprint and offer new investment vehicles.

Beyond Bitcoin, DJT has expanded its crypto portfolio by introducing a meme coin called $TRUMP on the Solana blockchain. An initial 200 million coins were released to the public, while an additional 800 million coins remain held by Trump-affiliated entities. This move into meme coins has sparked concern among ethics experts due to potential conflicts of interest, as it blurs lines between political influence and business ventures. Still, the company's crypto initiatives continue to grow, reflecting a broader push to embrace emerging digital finance trends.

DJT also launched Truth.Fi, a fintech platform that offers investment products. Truth.Fi plans to provide various investment options including separately managed accounts, ETFs, and direct cryptocurrency investments with funds managed by Charles Schwab. This aggressive focus on digital assets and investment products demonstrates DJT's ambition to diversify its financial portfolio while capitalizing on the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. However, the company's strong crypto positioning has raised questions about the overlap between its political ties and financial interests, highlighting challenges at the intersection of business, politics, and emerging technologies.

 As the US regulator explores streamlined rules for securities tokenization, Citadel Securities urges a focus on meaningful innovation. 

The US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) plan to streamline securities tokenization may sound promising, but it is unlikely to benefit investors unless it delivers genuine innovation and efficiency, according to market maker Citadel Securities.

“Tokenized securities must achieve success by delivering real innovation and efficiency to market participants, rather than through self-serving regulatory arbitrage,” Citadel wrote in a statement to the SEC's Crypto Task Force, as reported by Bloomberg. 

Tokenization — the process of representing real-world assets on a blockchain with digital tokens — is often touted for its potential to reduce costs and boost efficiency by minimizing the role of intermediaries, shortening settlement times and enabling fractional ownership of financial assets. 

A December report by the World Economic Forum argued that “the benefits of tokenization in capital markets will increase exponentially as more institutions and infrastructures see the advantages for themselves.”

Major players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton have entered the tokenization race, alongside crypto-focused platforms such as Coinbase, Robinhood and Kraken.

SEC Chair Paul Atkins has advocated for tokenization, comparing its potential impact to the evolution of audio formats. He has suggested the introduction of an “innovation exemption” to encourage its development.

Despite growing regulatory support, risks remain. Citadel cautioned that asset tokenization could “siphon liquidity” from traditional stock markets and create “new liquidity pools that are inaccessible” to key institutional investors such as pensions, banks and endowments.

Citadel isn't alone in sounding the alarm about challenges traditional financial institutions face when entering the digital asset space. On Tuesday, JPMorgan made headlines amid reports that it is exploring Bitcoin-backed loans, which would allow clients to borrow against their crypto holdings.

This move marks a significant shift from JPMorgan's historically cautious stance on crypto. However, Ledn co-founder and CEO Adam Reeds warned that traditional banks entering the market — even under more crypto-friendly regulations — will face steep challenges as non-native players.

The biggest hurdles, he noted, include “secure custody, collateral volatility, and [orderly] liquidation frameworks.”

“Bitcoin-backed lending isn't just about holding assets; it's about what happens when markets move fast and ensuring clients know exactly how their Bitcoin is being managed at all times,” said Reeds.

Additional challenges, such as safe self-custody, are also top of mind for institutions. In June, Circuit CEO Harry Donnelly said he developed a crypto recovery engine to address this very issue.

“The permanent loss of assets is one of the biggest barriers to mainstream adoption,” Donnelly told Cointelegraph.

CryptoPunks Lead as NFT Trading Volume Rebounds on Solana and Ethereum

NFTs

CryptoPunks and other established NFT projects are seeing renewed interest as the price of leading altcoins rise, with recent activity concentrated on Ethereum and Solana.

The NFT market has cooled drastically in recent years, but Sunday marked its busiest day since February, with $26 million worth of tokenized JPEGs changing hands across Ethereum's ecosystem, according to a Dune dashboard created by Hildebert Moulié, a data scientist at venture firm Dragonfly. On Monday, that was followed up with $24.9 million in trading volume.

Over half of Sunday's trading volume could be attributed to CryptoPunks.app, the official marketplace dedicated to the iconic collection of 10,000 pixelated profile pictures, which have been recognized by museums, auction houses, and luxury brands.

Over the past week, the collection's so-called floor price has jumped 20% to 48 ETH, according to data provider NFT Price Floor. Measured in U.S. dollars, the entry-level price for CryptoPunks has jumped 45% to $177,000, partly due to Ethereum's rising value. Meanwhile, 174 NFTs from the collection changed hands during that span, a 460% increase from the week prior.

In May, a newly established nonprofit called The Infinite Node Foundation acquired the IP to CryptoPunks from Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs, saying it would focus on preserving the collection, engaging with its community, and promoting its brand.

Myriad Markets users broadly believe that the CryptoPunks floor price will remain above the 44 ETH mark through the end of July 25, giving that an 85% chance. (Disclosure: Myriad is a product of Decrypt's parent company, DASTAN.)

Other collections minted on Ethereum have seen floor prices swell over the past week, including a 38% jump to $56,000 for Pudgy Penguins NFTs, a 26% increase to $6,300 for Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs, and a 64% surge for Fidenza NFTs from generative artist Tyler Hobbs.

Although some spectators on X hope that two days of elevated trading volume could turn into a resurgence for NFTs, which ran red-hot during the pandemic-era crypto boom, there was “some increased activity from December to February, but it wasn't sustained,” Moulié told Decrypt.

With NFT trading volume on OpenSea surging 44% to $9.5 million on Monday from Sunday, however, it appears some traders are chasing the trend. On Monday, NFT marketplace Blur also saw a 120% jump in trading volume from the previous day to $12.8 million.

On Solana, the price of Mad Lads NFTs has increased 27% over the past week to $6,800, while the floor price of Clarnosaurz NFTs has risen 47% to $2,100, and the entry-level Solana Monkey Business Gen2 NFTs has jumped 43% to $4,000, among gains for other collections.

In total, $9.3 million worth of Solana-based NFTs sales have taken place on secondary markets over the past seven days, a 59% increase, according to CryptoSlam. Ethereum-based NFTs have meanwhile seen $105 million in sales, a 50% increase over the same period of time.

Although trading volume has decreased over the past week, Bitcoin-based collectibles have seen floor prices tick up as well. The floor price for Ordinals collection Taproot Wizards has climbed 26% to $26,700 over the past week, and 10% to $4,800 for Bitcoin Puppets.

The NFT market may be glittering as Ethereum and Solana rise, but notably, no NFT collection referenced in this article is close to setting an all-time high floor price. And although Sunday and Monday's trading volumes were the most robust in months, the daily stat has spiked above $50 million four times within the past year, per Moulié's dashboard.

 The investigation was reportedly not connected to Jesse Powell's activities within the crypto industry. 

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has reportedly ended its investigation of Kraken co-founder Jesse Powell and returned property belonging to him that was seized in a 2023 search of his home.

According to a Tuesday Fortune report, the FBI had returned devices to Powell and ended its probe over allegations he had hacked and cyberstalked the Verge Center for the Arts, a nonprofit he helped found in 2008.

The investigation, reportedly not connected to Powell's association with Kraken, the cryptocurrency exchange he co-founded, or the crypto industry, resulted in the FBI searching his home and seizing electronic devices that could have contained digital assets. 

Reports suggested that Powell had been under investigation by US authorities since 2022. The Kraken co-founder repeatedly denied involvement in the alleged activities and filed a civil suit against members of Verge's board of directors.

The report did not cite a reason the US Department of Justice and the FBI ended their investigation into Powell, who became politically active in the 2024 election after contributing $1 million in Ether (ETH) to then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's campaign. 

Trump appointees Kash Patel and Dan Bongino currently head the FBI as director and deputy director, and Pam Bondi, also appointed by the president, leads the Justice Department as US Attorney General.

In 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint against Kraken, alleging the exchange had operated without proper registration. However, the agency dropped the case in March under SEC Acting Chair Mark Uyeda. 

The enforcement action against Kraken was one of several the SEC dropped amid an apparent change in the agency's stance on enacting regulation by enforcement. Years-long probes and cases into crypto companies, including Ripple Labs, Coinbase and Gemini, were dropped in a matter of weeks.

President Trump ran and won on a bold promise: to make America the global capital of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. Now, with a Republican House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican President, we have both the mandate and the responsibility to deliver.

Last week, we made historic progress. President Trump signed into law Senator Bill Hagerty's Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act—a landmark bill that cements a federal framework for dollar-backed digital assets. These payment stablecoins, pegged to secure assets, now have clear rules that promote transparency, protect consumers, and boost demand for U.S. Treasuries—all while reinforcing the dollar's position as the world's most foundational transactional currency.

The GENIUS Act is a major win for American leadership in digital finance. But, on its own, it's not enough.

To secure the full promise of stablecoins—and of American crypto innovation more broadly—the Senate must also pass Chairman French Hill's Digital Asset Market Structure Clarity (CLARITY) Act, which just passed the House.

These two bills are complementary: GENIUS establishes the rules for stablecoins; CLARITY delivers the broader market structure that distinguishes digital commodities from traditional securities and clearly defines the regulatory roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Without the CLARITY Act, the rules governing digital assets will remain fragmented, confusing and vulnerable to politicization. Under the Biden administration, that ambiguity was weaponized—resulting in regulatory overreach, stifled innovation, and an exodus of talent and capital overseas.

President Trump is reversing course, embracing a vision of American-led digital innovation—through executive action, a call for bitcoin reserves, and by working with the most pro-crypto Congress in U.S. history.

But without legislative clarity, that progress is at risk. FTX—the most spectacular crypto fraud in history—happened outside the U.S. precisely because early regulatory uncertainty pushed innovators offshore. The lesson is clear: without clear rules of the road, the result is chaos abroad and missed opportunity at home.

The CLARITY Act provides the roadmap we need to keep the digital asset economy rooted in the U.S., with smart regulation that matches the technology's unique characteristics. It will not only protect consumers and investors—it will also position the U.S. as a global leader, using financial innovation as a diplomatic asset.

There's another critical frontier the Senate must address: protecting Americans from surveillance-driven central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).

While other nations embrace centralized digital currencies as tools of control—none more chillingly than the Chinese Communist Party—we must draw a firm line in defense of American freedom. That's why the House passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act, which prohibits the Federal Reserve from issuing a CBDC. It's a necessary safeguard, and we're working to ensure its passage.

We cannot unleash a new era of innovation while leaving the door open for future administrations to turn that same technology against our own citizens.

The Senate must send the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act and the CLARITY Act to President Trump's desk so that the United States doesn't just participate in the digital asset revolution, but leads it.

This isn't a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It's an American issue. Whether you're from Minnesota or Alaska, whether you're 18 or 80—when done right, this technology empowers individuals, strengthens financial sovereignty, and unlocks opportunity for all.

It's the future. And now, we must finish the job.

Just over a week after launch, Pump.fun's token has stooped below its initial coin offering price—which raised $600 million in just 12 minutes earlier this month. This means that everyone who bought the token in that sale is now at a loss.

It comes as PUMP has dropped 15% over the past 24 hours, according to DEX Screener, to a price of $0.003767. That's 5% lower than the ICO valuation of $0.004. It comes as the Pump.fun community appears to be growing restless that an airdrop date hasn't been announced, and the platform continues to lose market share to new rival LetsBonk.

Pump.fun is a Solana launchpad that allows anyone to create a token by filling out a short form, free of charge. Over its 18-month lifespan, Pump.fun has generated $774 million in revenue and been used to create nearly 12 million tokens. That's why its initial coin offering sold out in just 12 minutes, its token launch was hotly anticipated, and its confirmed airdrop was eagerly awaited.

Following its launch last Monday, the PUMP token surged 72% from its ICO price to a high price of $0.006878. In part, this jump in value was spurred by a day of buybacks worth $19.24 million from Pump.fun. Since then, the buybacks have decreased in size—to just $125,000 on Sunday—and the token's value has sagged 45% from its all-time high.

In the official token announcement, Pump.fun confirmed that an airdrop was “coming soon.” Now, just over a week since the token launch and two weeks from the announcement, it appears that users are growing restless due to the lack of details.

Posts from the official Pump.fun X account, as well as the platform's co-founder, Alon Cohen, are being spammed by users demanding information about the airdrop, or just asking for PUMP's price to increase.

Cohen has also shared a couple of cryptic posts that have brought out the conspiracy theorists in the community. One post showed the co-founder's profile picture pointing to a pyramid of Pump.fun pills, and as the theories flew about, Cohen added, “Think harder.”

“They said it would be on the 2nd, then the 12th, then the 15th, now they're saying the 2nd again,” Cohen wrote in a second post. “Maybe you'll figure it out.”

PUMP is now the 99th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, per CoinGecko, and is close to falling out of the top 100. Last week, its valuation was comparable to Solana meme coin BONK, which is currently the 54th biggest coin on the market.

LetsBonk, the BONK community's Pump.fun competitor, has been responsible for the majority of tokens created via a Solana launchpad for 14 out of the last 15 days. This is the longest period that a rival launchpad has dominated market share—and not through a lack of trying.

Over the past 14 days, BONK has climbed 56.7% in valuation to a $2.7 billion market cap, over double that of PUMP at $1.3 billion. As a result, predictors on Myriad Markets believe that it is essentially guaranteed, or 96% likely, that BONK will have a larger market cap than PUMP by the end of the month.

PNC Bank (PNC) is partnering with Coinbase (COIN) to offer its institutional and banking clients access to cryptocurrency services, the companies said Tuesday.



The collaboration will use Coinbase's “Crypto-as-a-Service” infrastructure to let PNC clients buy, hold and sell digital assets securely. PNC will also provide banking services to Coinbase, deepening the operational ties between the two firms.



“Partnering with Coinbase accelerates our ability to bring innovative, crypto financial solutions to our clients,” PNC CEO William Demchak said in a statement. “This collaboration enables us to meet growing demand for secure and streamlined access to digital assets on PNC's trusted platform.”



Coinbase has been expanding its enterprise services to banks and financial institutions as interest in crypto rebounds. Its Crypto-as-a-Service platform offers backend tools for compliance, custody and trading — components that would otherwise be costly and time-consuming for a traditional bank to build in-house.



The partnership, which seems to have been in the making since 2021, offers PNC a ready-made path into crypto without needing to directly custody assets or register as a crypto broker, potentially sidestepping regulatory complexity. Coinbase, in turn, gains access to one of the largest banks in the U.S. and its vast network of institutional customers.



“PNC is a market leader in delivering best-in-class products for their clients,” said Brett Tejpaul, head of Coinbase Institutional. “We're thrilled to support their entry into the digital asset market with a platform built on uncompromising security.”



The deal comes amid growing demand for regulated crypto services among large financial players, as lawmakers edge closer to passing clearer rules for digital assets. While several banks have offered crypto custody or tokenization pilots, few have enabled full trading functionality for clients through a major partner.



PNC, which serves corporate, government and retail clients across the country, becomes one of the largest U.S. banks to adopt crypto services at scale. The timeline for rollout has not yet been disclosed, but both companies framed the initiative as a long-term effort to build resilient, compliant infrastructure for the digital asset economy.

 Bitcoin price consolidation after a powerful rally to record highs is normal. Will the current bull pennant confirm and send BTC beyond $136,000? 

Key takeaways:

A Bitcoin price pullback to $115,000 is possible before continuing the uptrend.

A bull pennant suggests that the BTC price could rally by 15% to new highs above $136,000.

Bitcoin (BTC) price has spent most of the week pinned below $120,000, which many analysts have labelled as a key resistance zone. However, a new technical setup suggests that BTC is likely consolidating within a bull pennant before resuming its uptrend.

Bitcoin rallied by 14% between July 8 and Saturday to reach an all-time high of nearly $123,000. Since then, BTC price has pulled back, consolidating between the all-time high and $115,000.

The latest data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView shows BTC trading inside a bull pennant, suggesting that the final “explosive phase” is next.

Bitcoin is in a “bull pennant breakout targeting $140,000,” said popular crypto trader Titan of Crypto in a Monday post on X.

A bull pennant is a continuation pattern that occurs after a significant rise, followed by a consolidation period at the higher price end of the range.

A positive breakout from the pennant could potentially lead to the next leg up for Bitcoin, measured at $136,500 or 15% from its current price level.

It is important to note that the success rate of a bull pennant is only around 54%, which makes it one of the least reliable patterns.

However, another classic pattern was spotted by Merlijn The Trader, a Bitcoin analyst, who says a BTC price target of $140,000 is in play based on an inverted head-and-shoulders pattern on the three-day chart.

Other projections are a bit more ambitious, with one analyst citing a daily chart golden cross projecting BTC price to $155,000. 

Popular trader Marcus Corvinus made a modest prediction, saying a symmetrical triangle breakout targets $125,000. 

With the bulk of Bitcoin's apparent sell-side liquidity absorbed during the move to $122,000, some analysts warn that a brief flush down to test $115,000 as support could be the next move for BTC price. 

“Weekend low liquidity swept!” Popular analyst AlphaBTC said that Bitcoin could drop a little lower to grab the liquidity at around $115,000. 

The BTC liquidity map shows that the order book is priming for that, with bid clusters stacked between $115,000 and $116,100.

Fellow analyst Daan Crypto Trades said  BTC price has stalled near its all-time high and noted that the bulk of the volume has been traded around $118,000, which is the middle level of the current range.

The analyst told his followers to watch the range low at $115,000 as support and the range high at $121,000 as resistance.

With Binance recording a huge $100B in altcoin futures in just one day, another altcoin season might be nearby.

Bitcoin dominates the mainstream narrative, but smart money quickly shifts into altcoins. Early investors are rapidly securing their positions before the market surge.

In just 24 hours, the altcoin trading volume on Binance Futures has surged to $100.7B, the highest since Feb 3, 2025.

The surge reveals a clear trend, as altcoins now account for 71% of Binance Futures volume, while Bitcoin holds at just 25%. Traders are shifting their focus to altcoins for the next significant move.

After Bitcoin reached a new all-time high of $123,091.61 on July 14, 2025, altcoin activity has surged significantly across the market. For example, Ethereum has increased by 25% over the past seven days, while Bitcoin has only gone up 2%.

The CMC Altcoin Season Index is at 48, so there's still time for investors who haven't jumped on the trend yet.



So, which altcoins are poised to benefit the most from the upcoming alt season?

Here are three top picks, based on growing investor interest and strong fundamentals. And no, it's not Ethereum, XRP, or Bonk.

Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is an upcoming Layer-2 solution for Bitcoin that leverages the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to enable fast and incredibly inexpensive transactions.

When the full version launches, it is expected to support everything from dApps to meme coins and foster a utility ecosystem around Bitcoin.

After validation, the corresponding $BTC is returned to the user's Bitcoin address on Layer 1, ensuring high security.



The best part is, Bitcoin Hyper isn't just an idea. It's already being built, and the team recently announced the launch of the devnet.

It can handle program deployment via Solana CLI, contract calls, transaction flows through the web console, and account state management. The performance remains stable, low latency, and contracts are already being ported over.

$HYPER tokens, which fuel the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem, are now available for purchase on the official website at fixed prices, with over $4 million raised so far.

Early movers can secure annual percentage yields (APYs) over 200% through dynamic staking, right from the presale phase. It is designed to decline as more users join the pool, encouraging early participation.

Get $HYPER from the official presale page.

Snorter Token ($SNORT) is another popular altcoin sensation of this week. It operates a Telegram-native bot, best described as a smart trading suite built into chat.

What exactly does that mean? Sub-second swaps, real-time copy trades, and token sniping—all without leaving the messaging app.

$SNORT powers the platform and grants access to advanced tools and significant fee discounts. For context, the fees decrease from 1.5% to just 0.85% for those holding enough tokens, making it more affordable than major competitors.



Snorter takes security seriously, boasting an 85% success rate in beta rugpull and honeypot detection. Blacklist scanners and mint trap alerts provide extra layers of protection.

If the project delivers on its white paper vision, it could offer more depth and access than most existing DeFi platforms.

But early investors looking for an upside don't have time till then. The $SNORT presale is fast selling out with close to $2M raised, and staking yields are juicy at 183%.

Now trading for $199, Solana (SOL) has recorded a 25% jump in the last seven days alone and outperformed Bitcoin with flair.

Technical indicators show $SOL bulls are in control, flashing strong buy signals across the board. The moving averages, one of the most apparent signs of market strength, indicate 13 out of 14 bullish signals.

Does that mean Solana is ready to reclaim its ATH of $294.33?

It's too early to tell. But in the current climate, it's not a long shot. And it won't be just Solana that benefits from its growing momentum. Platforms that make use of Solana tech are also at an advantage.

A good example is BONK, which has climbed over 20% on the weekly chart. Although still in the presale stages, Snorter Token and Bitcoin Hyper have also witnessed heavy traffic over the last few days.

While BONK has a heavy market cap of $3B, these under-the-radar tokens will be available for fixed, discounted rates before the presales sell out.

Altcoin seasons can be exciting, but only for those who get in early. It's often a mix of regret and FOMO for investors who stay on the sidelines.

What's the smart way to play it?

Start your hunt early, but don't hesitate to trust your instincts. All three altcoins discussed above – $HYPER, $SNORT, and $SOL –– are ripe for a rally.

However, nothing in crypto moves in straight lines. Make sure you have done your research before jumping in.

The Bank of England (BoE) is reassessing its plans for a digital pound, as officials question whether launching a new form of money is worth the effort, especially with the private sector rapidly advancing payment technologies.

The Bank of England has been exploring the idea of a digital pound, often dubbed a “Britcoin,” as a government-backed digital version of the British pound.

However, according to Bloomberg, officials have also been privately urging the banking industry to prioritize payment innovations that could achieve similar outcomes without the need to issue a retail CBDC.

The BoE isn't abandoning its CBDC plans entirely. The bank aims to remain prepared to launch a digital pound if necessary, but may scale back the effort if private firms continue to advance electronic payment technologies that offer comparable benefits.

At a Parliamentary hearing on Tuesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey expressed doubt over the necessity of a digital pound. He indicated that if ongoing collaboration with commercial banks proves successful, it would be difficult to justify introducing a new form of money.

“I think that's a sensible place to do it,” Bailey told the Treasury Committee. “If that's a success, I question why we need to introduce a new form of money.”

The central bank and government will make a final decision after completing the current design phase.

This marks a shift from previous years, when Bank of England and Treasury officials considered a digital pound “likely” to be needed.

The change comes amid waning global momentum for state-backed digital currencies.

In the US, the Trump administration has intensified efforts to block the Federal Reserve from issuing a digital dollar. During “Crypto Week,” the House passed the Anti-CBDC Surveillance Act, a bill aimed at halting progress on an American CBDC.

South Korea's central bank has also halted its digital currency pilot program.

In contrast, the European Central Bank continues to pursue a digital euro.

Recent BoE research indicates diminished benefits from launching a CBDC. Senior officials, including Deputy Governor Sarah Breeden and Treasury's director general for financial services Gwyneth Nurse, have reduced their involvement in the CBDC Engagement Forum, sending lower-ranking staff instead.

The project has faced various challenges, including privacy concerns and fears about potential destabilizing effects if investors rush to state-backed digital currencies during crises.

Bailey has shown support for a wholesale CBDC for financial institutions while remaining skeptical about a retail version. He has, however, expressed concerns about foreign stablecoins potentially gaining popularity in the UK and undermining trust in traditional currencies.

This is a daily analysis of top tokens with CME futures by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole.

Ether's (ETH) Doji candle on Monday signals indecision in the market following a near 90-degree rise from $2,100 to $3,800 in less than four weeks. The pattern has neutralized the immediate bullish outlook, establishing Monday's high of $3,859 as the level to beat for the bulls. Note that the $3,800-$4,100 range is where ether topped out in March 2024, May 2024 and December 2024.

While prices remain below Monday's high, the focus will be on the bearish shift in intraday indicators and the possibility of a notable price pullback. Price action on the 15-minute candlestick chart indicates a breakdown of the head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. The bearish pattern suggests a potential price drop to $3,550. 

Supporting the interim bear case is the hourly chart, where prices have crossed below the Ichimoku cloud, signaling a bearish shift in momentum.

Since Friday, XRP XRP$3.5168 has largely traded within a range, with upside capped above $3.6 and support at around $3.35. The sideways churn resembles a typical temporary bull breather observed after strong rallies. That said, on the hourly chart, it has taken the shape of a double top, a bearish reversal pattern identified by twin peaks separated by a valley (price drop).

A move below $3.35 would trigger the double top breakdown, potentially opening the door for an extended pullback to $3. The Guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) indicator has already flipped bearish on the hourly chart, suggesting greater odds of a double top breakdown.

On the higher side, a convincing move above $3.65 would signal the continuation of the bull run that has seen prices surge 54% to record highs this month.

Bitcoin BTC$118,867.39 continues to consolidate in a descending triangle, identified by a downward-sloping trendline connecting lower highs since July 14, and another trendline connecting the horizontal support at around $116,000.

A move past the upper trendline would signal the end of the bull breather, potentially yielding a rally to record highs above $123,000. Conversely, a downside break would raise the risk of a deeper pullback, with major support seen directly at $111,965, the former record high from May.

Solana's SOL (SOL) has pulled back to $194 from the five-month high of $204 early today, printing a daily candle with a long upper wick, a sign of sellers looking to reassert themselves. Key momentum indicators, such as the hourly chart MACD, have flipped decisively bearish, suggesting scope for an extended decline toward the former resistance-turned-support level at $185. The broader outlook remains constructive, as prices remain above the Ichimoku cloud on the daily chart and are locked in an ascending channel.

                    The move comes as other major U.S. banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, are developing stablecoins [File]

JPMorgan Chase is exploring plans to offer loans backed by clients' cryptocurrency holdings, including bitcoin and ether, as early as next year, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The move comes as other major U.S. banks, including Bank of America and Citibank, are developing stablecoins amid a broader push for more crypto-friendly regulation in Washington.

CEO Jamie Dimon, a longtime bitcoin skeptic, recently said that the bank will be involved in stablecoins.

JPMorgan declined to comment to the FT. The bank did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment outside regular business hours.

In May, Dimon told investors that he is "not a fan" of the bitcoin universe citing concerns, including leverage, misuse, and money laundering issues in the system, ruling out getting into custody, storing crypto assets for clients, or expanding significantly even if regulations ease.

"We're going to allow you to buy it, we're not going to custody it," he said, likening the approach to permitting behavior he personally disagrees with.

Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) on blockchain empowers individuals to own their digital identities, streamlining KYC/AML processes and enhancing privacy. This approach promises a more secure and user-centric future for financial identity management.


Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) on blockchain empowers individuals to own their digital identities, streamlining KYC/AML processes and enhancing privacy. This approach promises a more secure and user-centric future for financial identity management.

In an interconnected digital economy, identity is paramount. For the financial services sector, verifying who a customer truly is – through rigorous Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes – is not merely a regulatory burden but a fundamental pillar of trust and a critical defense against financial crime. Yet, the current identity verification landscape is often fragmented, costly, and privacy-invasive, requiring individuals to repeatedly share sensitive personal data across multiple institutions. This inefficiency creates friction for customers and significant operational overhead and vulnerability for financial firms across the UK, US, and globally.

Enter Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), a revolutionary approach to digital identity management, underpinned by the immutable and transparent properties of blockchain technology. SSI shifts control of identity from centralized entities to the individual, empowering them to own, manage, and selectively share their verifiable credentials. This paradigm shift holds the profound potential to transform how financial services approach identity, fostering enhanced privacy, robust security, and unparalleled efficiency in an industry grappling with data proliferation and escalating cyber threats.

Traditional identity management in finance typically relies on centralized databases. When you open an account with a bank, they collect your personal details, verify them, and store them. If you open another account with a different institution, the process largely repeats. This creates:

Self-Sovereign Identity leverages blockchain and cryptographic principles to give individuals ultimate control over their digital identity. Here's how it works:

SSI offers compelling benefits that address critical pain points in the financial sector:

Despite its immense promise, SSI faces hurdles before widespread mainstream adoption in finance:

The momentum behind Self-Sovereign Identity is building, driven by the undeniable need for more secure, private, and efficient identity solutions. Governments, technology giants, and innovative fintechs are actively investing in SSI development and pilot projects. For instance, initiatives exploring digital identity wallets in the UK and EU are paving the way for SSI's integration into broader digital ecosystems, including finance.

Financial institutions that embrace SSI will not only enhance their cybersecurity posture and streamline compliance but also fundamentally differentiate themselves by offering a truly user-centric identity experience. This shift moves beyond mere data protection to genuine data empowerment, fostering deeper trust and unlocking new avenues for secure, seamless digital interactions.

The future of financial services identity will be one where individuals are the custodians of their own verified claims, presenting precisely what's needed, when it's needed, with cryptographic assurance. Self-Sovereign Identity on blockchain is not just a technological advancement; it's a foundational step towards a more secure, private, and equitable financial landscape for everyone.

Oops, something went wrong

It's not just bitcoin (BTC-USD) that corporate treasuries are buying. A handful of firms are scooping up ethereum — or its native token, ether (ETH-USD) — as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets.

So far, the companies taking this approach are mainly smaller names in the crypto world, such as BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), chaired by Fundstrat's Tom Lee. One larger player — Coinbase Global (COIN), the parent company of trading network Coinbase — has more than $440 million in holdings, according to crypto and investment tracker CoinGecko.

When Coinbase announced in a 2021 blog post that it would become the first publicly traded company to hold ethereum and other assets, in addition to bitcoin, it stated, "We believe that in the future, more and more companies will hold crypto assets on their balance sheet."

Ethereum has surged 60% over the past month to hover near $3,800, its highest level since January. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has yet to reclaim its 2021 high north of $4,600.

Ethereum allows developers to write programs or contracts that run entirely on its blockchain, or network. It currently leads as the dominant infrastructure that allows businesses and consumers to transact with each other directly without banks, with a market share of more than 51%.

"Ethereum lets anyone — whether it's a crypto project, a factory, an artist, an influencer — create their own token and thus their own community and incentivize communities with an economy basically," Ray Youssef, CEO of crypto marketplace NoOnes, told Yahoo Finance.

He called tokenization ethereum's "killer app."

"You could argue it has more utility than bitcoin," he said.

That utility is why firms like BitMine and SharpLink Gaming have increasingly been raising capital to buy ETH, similar to how Strategy (MSTR) and a slew of other companies have added bitcoin to their balance sheets in recent months.

As with bitcoin, the approach can be risky due to volatile prices. Ethereum prices tumbled in April when President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs announcement roiled markets. The rewards have not been as high as those that bitcoin has offered either: The return on ethereum year to date is 14%, versus bitcoin's 26%.

Crypto miner BitMine Immersion Technologies recently announced it holds more than $1 billion in ethereum, or roughly 300,000 tokens. The company, which went public on June 5, has positioned itself as a pure-play on ethereum, betting that owning it is akin to owning the underlying infrastructure behind the convergence of crypto and financial services.

"Acquiring $1 billion of ETH1 is a clear signal of our conviction in ethereum's long-term value," Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, said in the press release announcing the news. He noted that the company was "committed to Ethereum's continued growth."

BitMine shares surged 25% in one session last week after an SEC filing revealed that billionaire Peter Thiel purchased 9.1% of the firm's common stock through his investment funds.

Gaming and sports betting company SharpLink Gaming (SBET) and blockchain tech firm BTCS (BTCS) have also pursued similar treasury strategies. Shares of each are up nearly 200% over the past month.

Earlier this month, computing firm Bit Digital (BTBT) announced that it had shifted its entire treasury from bitcoin to ethereum.

"We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system," Sam Tabar, CEO of Bit Digital, said in a press release. Year to date, the stock is up 17%.

Ethereum's surge coincides with the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation signed by President Trump last Friday, moving through Congress. The new law regulates stablecoins, digital tokens backed by assets like the US dollar and short-term treasuries.

Optimism over stablecoin's adoption has sent shares of issuer Circle (CRCL) up more than 600% since its IPO on June 5. The company's USD Coins (USDC-USD) run on ethereum.

"If real companies and institutional investors are innovating on the blockchain, doesn't that make blockchain networks, and by implication, blockchain network assets (e.g ETH) valuable?" Bernstein's Gautam Chhugani asked in a note last month. "Any company that uses stablecoin tech pays transaction fees to the Ethereum network."

To be sure, not all companies see the same value in ethereum as they do in bitcoin.

When asked directly whether Strategy would add ETH to its holdings, executive chairman Michael Saylor said in an interview with The Street, "MicroStrategy wouldn't because MicroStrategy is 150% Bitcoin. We do Bitcoin, we're 150% Bitcoin. We're going to be Bitcoin. And the only thing I like more than Bitcoin is more Bitcoin."

Indeed, ethereum is by no means replacing bitcoin as the investment of choice for companies, Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, told Yahoo Finance. Consider it an adjacent strategy.

"I don't want people to misconstrue this movement from treasury companies to be viewed [as] ETH is replacing bitcoin. It's just blockchain technology applied in a different way for a different use case," Farrell said. "These companies are just capitalizing on the real world asset [tokenization] trends."

Ethereum has just marked 10 years since its launch. It rolled out a symbolic NFT called “The Ethereum Torch” to honor its community.

The token will travel from one wallet to another day by day. Then it will be burned to make way for a fresh celebratory NFT that anyone can mint for free.

According to the Ethereum Foundation's X account, Joseph Lubin, a co‑founder of Ethereum and founder of ConsenSys, will kick off the torch as its first holder on July 21.

After 24 hours in his wallet, the torch moves on. It will spend 10 days hopping across a selected list of community members. Based on reports, each handover is chosen to show off the network's global reach.

0/ The Ethereum Torch is now lit.

The torch will wrap up its journey on July 30, when the Foundation plans to burn the NFT. That burn is meant to close out one era of the network and launch the next.

After the burn, a brand new torch will be freely claimable through the official Ether website, giving more people a piece of the celebration.

On‑chain data shows a sharp rebound in NFT trading. Total weekly sales across all blockchains topped $110 million last week.

Ethereum projects accounted for about $75 million of that sum. That represents a 300% jump from figures two weeks earlier.

The spike arrived alongside a 50% rise in ETH price since July 6. Collectors and traders are turning back to digital art and collectibles in growing numbers.

Based on reports, this uptick could signal renewed confidence after a weak 2024, when NFT trading fell 18% compared to 2023.

Other blockchains posted mixed results. Bitcoin‑based collectibles hit almost $26 million in weekly volume. That's nearly double the $11 million registered in early July.

Polygon trading made a slight retreat during the same period. These shifts suggest interest is spreading but still centers on major players.

Meanwhile, Cboe BZX has filed an application for a new ETF with Canary Capital. The move would hold PENGU tokens tied to the Pudgy Penguins collection.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Ancient Egyptians sure knew how to stage a burial, including canopic jars to hold organs and scrolls from the “Book of the Dead” to help the deceased navigate the afterlife.

In central Egypt, archaeologists uncovered one of these elaborate scenes: a 3,500-year-old New Kingdom cemetery filled with mummies, amulets, statues, canopic jars, and a 43-foot-long papyrus scroll containing part of the Book of the Dead.

This scroll is the first complete papyrus found in the Al-Ghuraifa area, and is “characterized by being in good condition,” Mustafa Waziri, secretary general of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in a translated Arabic statement from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

While the cemetery—dating to sometime between 1550 BC to 1070 BC—was significant for the hundreds of archaeological finds and tombs carved into the rock located within its boundaries, the discovery of what could be a copy of the “Book of the Dead” captured the attention of experts as a truly rare find. But with few details released to the public about the contents of the scroll—believed to be 43 to 49 feet in length—there's plenty of questions remaining about this particular copy of the traditional Egyptian cultural book.

These texts—which can differ depending on the writer—first appeared at the start of the New Kingdom around 1550 BC. As a result, locating one in “good condition” from the era isn't a common occurrence.  

“If it's that long and well-preserved [then it's] certainly a great and interesting find,” Lara Weiss, CEO of the Roemer and Pelizaeus Museum in Germany, told Live Science. 

Foy Scalf, an Egyptologist at The University of Chicago told Live Science that it's “very rare” to find a copy in the grave it was originally buried in—although, without photographs and an official publication describing the text, it's hard to verify the details of the find. 

The book, which is more properly translated as “The Chapters/Book of Going Forth By Day,” played a key role in ancient Egyptian culture. Any examples of the text give researchers insight into ancient Egyptian religion and beliefs about an afterlife, according to the American Research Center in Egypt. 

“The ‘Book of the Dead' reveals central aspects of the ancient Egyptians' belief system,” the center writes, “and, like many topics in Egyptology, our theories are constantly changing, growing, and adapting with every new translation of this text.” 

While the “Book of the Dead” may continue to interest researchers—the Egyptian ministry says they expect the scroll to be displayed in the Grand Egyptian Museum—the text wasn't the only item found in the burial chambers. 

The team located stone and wood coffins containing mummies, more than 25,000 ushabti statues, an untold number of utensils, thousands of stone and wooden amulets, and canopic jars. The engraved and colored wooden coffins—including that of Ta-de-Isa, daughter of Eret Haru, the high priest of Djehuti in Al-Ashmunin—were highlights of the collection. Next to her coffin were two wooden boxes with her canopic vessels, in addition to a complete set of ushabti statues and a statue of the ostrich-like deity, Ptah Sokar.

New research by the University of Sydney offers important insights into how and when new coronavirus variants arise in bats.

Bats are beneficial to our ecosystems and economy but, as habitat destruction and environmental stressors put them in closer proximity to humans, disease risks can emerge. The research, published in Nature Communications on July 17, offers an approach to anticipating the emergence of coronaviruses. It found young bats are infected more frequently and could be a key source of viral spillover into other species. The study also reveals the dynamics of coronaviruses circulating in Australian bats, which pose no known risk to humans.

Endemic in bat populations, most coronaviruses never infect humans. When they do, as with the SARS, COVID-19 and MERS outbreaks, they typically spill over from bats via a bridging animal host.

"Coronaviruses tend not to be of major concern to bats," said Dr Alison Peel from the University's School of Veterinary Science, who led the study. "But they can behave differently if they spill over to new species."

In one of the most comprehensive single studies of its type, the researchers collected more than 2,500 faecal samples, via which bats shed coronaviruses, over three years. Samples were taken from black flying foxes and grey-headed flying foxes at five roost sites across Australia's eastern seaboard.

Viral testing of the samples showed coronaviruses were most prevalent in young bats between March and July, when they were weaning and approaching maturity. This was consistent across the three-year study. Particularly notable was the high proportion of bats infected with multiple coronaviruses at once.

"We were surprised by that high rate of co-infection among juveniles and subadults," Dr Peel said. "Co-infection presents the opportunity for a single cell to become infected with multiple viruses, an important natural precursor to the generation of new strains."

The six coronaviruses detected in the study were nobecoviruses, a subclass which does not jump to humans. Three of these were new. They were useful to analyse because they pose minimal risk to people but are the evolutionary cousins of sarbecoviruses, so-called SARS-like viruses which are more prone to spill across to other species. Understanding the evolution of nobecoviruses offers parallel insights into the evolution of more dangerous coronaviruses.

"We safely tracked how and when coronaviruses circulated naturally in bat populations. Using genomics to track infections to individual animals," Dr John-Sebastian Eden, a study co-author from the Westmead Insitute for Medical Research and the University's Faculty of Medicine and Health.

"The results offer a model for scientists looking to understand coronavirus emergence and future risks in bat populations around the world. By focusing on co-infections in young bats during certain periods, researchers might better predict the natural evolution and emergence of riskier coronaviruses before they pose a risk to human health."

Dr Peel said more research is needed to understand why young bats are more susceptible to infection and co-infection.

"It could be the result of newly weaned animals whose immune systems are still developing or the stress faced by teenage bats looking for a mate for the first time," she said.

The changing environment could also be a factor.

"We know from previous research on other viruses that habitat loss caused by encroaching human populations and food shortages can create stress in bats that weakens immunity and makes them susceptible to infections. It will be important to find out if that's also the case for coronaviruses."

Dr Peel and Dr Eden's research began in 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. It built on earlier research into the spread of Hendra virus, which also originates in bats.

"It's rare to see this scale and depth of data in virological research, even among human viruses," said Dr Peel. "The gathering of samples from both individual bats and beneath roosts, and the tracking of individual strains across multiple sites and years, provides a strong foundation for ongoing research into the role of environmental stress on coronavirus emergence."

Beneath the scales of Australia's iconic monitor lizards (commonly known as goannas), scientists have discovered an unexpected secret: a hidden layer of bony skin structures known as osteoderms. These structures, which have been long overlooked, may hold the key to understanding how these ancient reptiles not only survived but thrived in one of the world's harshest environments.

The findings, published on July 21 in the prestigious Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, mark the first large-scale global study of osteoderms in lizards and snakes. The international collaboration brought together researchers from Australia, Europe and the United States, who used cutting-edge micro-CT scanning to examine nearly 2,000 reptile specimens from major museum collections including those held at Museums Victoria's Research Institute.

'We were astonished to find osteoderms in 29 Australo-Papuan monitor lizard species that had never been documented before,' said Roy Ebel, lead author and researcher at Museums Victoria Research Institute and the Australian National University. 'It's a fivefold increase in known cases among goannas.'

Osteoderms are most commonly known from crocodiles, armadillos, and even some dinosaurs like Stegosaurus. But their function has remained something of an evolutionary mystery. While they may provide protection, scientists now suspect they may also support heat regulation, mobility and calcium storage during reproduction.

This new research reveals that osteoderms are far more widespread in lizards than previously thought, occurring in nearly half of all lizard species worldwide - an 85% increase on earlier estimates.

At the heart of this discovery lies the power of museum collections. Scientific institutions like Museums Victoria Research Institute play a critical role in preserving biodiversity through time, enabling researchers to study species long after they were collected. Many of the specimens used in this study were decades, and in some cases over 120 years old, but advances in imaging technology enabled scientists to uncover new insights without harming the original material. These collections are not just archives, they're active tools for scientific discovery.

'What's so exciting about this finding is that it reshapes what we thought we knew about reptile evolution,' said Dr Jane Melville, Museums Victoria Research Institute Senior Curator of Terrestrial Vertebrates. 'It suggests that these skin bones may have evolved in response to environmental pressures as lizards adapted to Australia's challenging landscapes.'

Until now, the presence of osteoderms in monitor lizards was considered rare and mostly confined to the famed Komodo dragon. But the discovery of their widespread presence across Australo-Papuan goannas opens up new questions about how these lizards adapted, survived and diversified across the continent.

This landmark study not only tells a new chapter in the story of Australia's goannas, it provides a powerful new dataset for exploring how skin, structure, and survival have intertwined across millions of years of evolution.

New University of South Australia research is providing evidence of biological triggers of oil production in oats, a discovery that will help processing and potentially drive further demand for Australian-grown oats.

While Australia is the world's second-largest exporter of oats, high oil content in oat grains creates challenges during milling, reducing processing efficiency and limiting product innovation - particularly in high-demand sectors like oat flour and plant-based proteins.

Researchers from the University of South Australia, the South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI), and the University of Adelaide are collaborating on research designed to better understand the biological processes responsible for oil synthesis in oat grains.

In this study, two contemporary varieties of oats were examined using spatial imaging techniques to track oil build-up during grain development. Researchers then applied 'omics' technologies - lipidomics and proteomics - to analyse lipid and protein expression, which provided key insights into the biological mechanisms involved in the actual formation of the grain, including those relating to oil synthesis.

The UniSA findings have provided further evidence of the mechanisms that underlie the amount of oil in an oat grain. These findings will help to guide future breeding efforts for naturally lower-oil oat varieties, improving milling yields and creating new value-added opportunities across the oat supply chain.

UniSA PhD candidate, Darren Lau, says that current oil removal methods are inefficient and that low-oil breeding programs will aid industry growth.

"While oil can be removed from partially milled oat flakes - using supercritical carbon dioxide prior to further milling - this approach is laborious and expensive," he says.

"Breeding low-oil oat varieties is a cost-effective approach but requires further understanding of oil production in oats. This is where our research is critical.

"Our analysis has identified several key enzymes that are involved in oil synthesis which could be genetically manipulated to lower oil content of oat grains.

"Reducing oil content could also unlock new opportunities in sectors like oat flour and alternative proteins, which could significantly strengthen Australia's position in the market."

The economic potential of these opportunities is reflected in the quantity of oats exported globally. For example, in 2022 twenty-six million metric tonnes of oats were produced worldwide, ranking them seventh among cereals in production quantity.

Lowering oil content in oat grains will enhance processing and product versatility, positioning them alongside traditional cereal staples like barley, maize, wheat, and rice, and further driving industry growth.

The UniSA findings are being used by the Grains Research and Development Corporation (GRDC) oat grain quality consortium to improve suitability for milling and food/beverage ingredient development. Additional research is continuing within the consortium that will build on the study's findings to further inform breeding efforts aimed at reducing oil content in oats.

"The consortia are currently working on a larger and more diverse oat cohort to further investigate molecular markers and nutrient partitioning of oil in oats," Lau says.

"The consortia are also investigating one of the key enzymes validated in this study to determine whether manipulating or removing it can lower oil content, and how that affects the growth of the plant."

SARDI Project Lead Dr Janine Croser, says the study's findings provide further evidence of key pathways involved in oat oil biosynthesis.

"This research provides important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying varietal differences of oil production in developing oat grains," Dr Croser says.

"We expect that the development of low-oil lines will improve efficiencies in the flour milling process and potentially lead to novel uses for oats.

"With demand for plant-based foods on the rise, we anticipate the oat grain quality consortium research will help put Australia at the forefront of oat innovation - supporting growers, processors, and exporters alike."

The full paper, Proteomic and lipidomic analyses reveal novel molecular insights into oat (Avena sativa L.) lipid regulation and crosstalk with starch synthesis during grain development, is available online.

Microglia are implicated in aging, neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Low-plex protein imaging does not capture cellular states and interactions in the human brain, which differs from rodent models. Here we used multiplexed ion beam imaging to spatially map cellular states and niches in cognitively normal human brains, identifying a spectrum of proteomic microglial profiles. Defined by immune activation states that were skewed across brain regions and compartmentalized according to microenvironments, this spectrum enables the identification of proteomic trends across the microglia of ten cognitively normal individuals and orthogonally with single-nuclei epigenetic analysis, revealing associated molecular functions. Notably, AD tissues exhibit regulatory shifts in the immunologically active cells at the end of the proteomic spectrum, including enrichment of CD33 and CD44 and decreases in HLA-DR, P2RY12 and ApoE expression. These findings establish an in situ, single-cell spatial proteomic framework for AD-specific microglial states.

The ruins of a Celtic settlement along the Amber Road trade route were filled with coins, 

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story: 

A Celtic settlement from the second century B.C. discovered in modern-day Czech Republic has yielded an impressive haul of opulence, from hundreds of gold and silver coins to precious amber and luxury ceramics (and even a production facility that was likely churning them out over 2,000 years ago). 

The find came as archaeologists conducted surveys ahead of construction of the D35 motorway, turning a routine construction requirement into what the team from the Museum of East Bohemia in Hradec Kralove dubbed “one of the largest collections of artifacts ever found in Bohemia,” according to a translated statement.

The precious coins and materials weren't simply strewn about. Crews discovered plenty of ancient buildings making up an entire settlement from the La Tene period, likely a Celtic community.

“The entire site is unparalleled in its scale and character in Bohemia,” the statement reads. “The settlement was a supra-regional trade and production center connected to long-distance trade routes, as evidenced by the finds of amber, gold and silver coins, and evidence of the production of luxury ceramics.”

The team found gold and silver Celtic coins, coin dies, fragments of ceramic vessels, dwelling foundations, production facilities, and at least one religious sanctuary. With 22,000 bags loaded with artifacts from the area, it is one of the largest ever collections discovered in Bohemia comprising both everyday objects and an “extraordinarily rich collection of jewelry.”

Tomas Mangel, a professor at the University of Hradec Kralove and the excavation co-leader, told Live Science there could be several hundred coin pieces and that the jewelry features “pieces of bronze and iron brooches, fragments of armlets, metallic components of belts, glass beads, and armlets.” 

One thing the team hasn't yet found were any inscriptions to pinpoint which Celtic group settled the area, although Boii were known to live in the region. “Bohemia is traditionally really connected with [the] Boii,” Mangel told Live Science. “But the research [done recently] shows that we can only say that [the] Boii were settled somewhere in Central Europe.”

The archaeologists said they were surprised by the unusually high density of finds in the topsoil. “The information potential of the original surface of the settlement in the topsoil and subsoil horizons is completely beyond the standard,” they wrote. To their additional, and fortuitous, surprise, the site hadn't been looted. 

The lack of fortification at the 62-acre Iron Age site, which is located near Hradec Kralove in modern-day north-central Czech Republic, shows the settlement from the La Tene period was likely a key trading route and was active in the second century B.C. before the emergence of larger fortified settlements with central functions.

The volume of fine pottery, coin production, and amber only furthers the belief Celtic settlement played a pivotal role along the Amber Road trade route, a connection of settlements from the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea that enabled trade across all of Europe. 

With such a rich history, the museum plans a display in late 2025 to celebrate all things gold, silver, and amber.

Radioactive decay is a fundamental process in nature by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. Studying nuclear decay modes is crucial for understanding properties of atomic nuclei. In particular, exotic decay modes like proton emission provide essential spectroscopic tools for probing the structure of nuclei far from the valley of stability -- the region containing stable nuclei on the nuclear chart.

In a study published in Physical Review Letters on July 10, physicists from the Institute of Modern Physics (IMP) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and their collaborators have reported the first observation and spectroscopy of aluminium-20, a previously unknown and unstable isotope that decays via the rare process of three-proton emission.

"Aluminium-20 is the lightest aluminium isotope that has been discovered so far. Located beyond the proton drip line, it has seven fewer neutrons than the stable aluminum isotope," said Associate Prof. Xiaodong Xu from IMP, first author of the study.

Using an in-flight decay technique at the Fragment Separator of the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany, the researchers measured angular correlations of aluminium-20's decay products and discovered the previously unknown nucleus aluminium-20.

Through detailed analysis of angular correlations, the researchers found that the aluminium-20 ground state first decays by emitting one proton to the intermediate ground state of magnesium-19, followed by subsequent decay of magnesium-19 ground state via simultaneous two-proton emission. Aluminium-20 is the first observed three-proton emitter where its one-proton decay daughter nucleus is a two-proton radioactive nucleus.

The researchers also found that the decay energy of the aluminium-20 ground state is significantly smaller than the predictions inferred from the isospin symmetry, indicating a possible isospin symmetry breaking in aluminium-20 and its mirror partner neon-20.

This finding is supported by state-of-the-art theoretical calculations that predict that the spin-parity of the aluminium-20 ground state differs from the spin-parity of the neon-20 ground state.

"This study advances our understanding of the proton-emission phenomena, and provides insights into the structure and decay of nuclei beyond the proton drip line," said Xu.

To date, scientists have discovered over 3,300 nuclides, yet fewer than 300 are stable and exist naturally. The remainder are unstable nuclides that undergo radioactive decay. Common decay modes, such as α decay, β- decay, β+ decay, electron capture, γ radiation, and fission, were discovered by the mid-20th century.

Over the past several decades, owing to the tremendous development in nuclear physics experimental facilities and detection technologies, scientists discovered several exotic decay modes in the study of nuclei far from the stability, particularly in neutron-deficient nuclei.

In the 1970s, scientists discovered single-proton radioactivity, where nuclei decay by emitting a proton. After entering the 21st century, two-proton radioactivity was found in the decays of some extremely neutron-deficient nuclei. In recent years, even rarer decay phenomena such as three-, four-, and five-proton emission were observed.

This collaborative effort included contributions from IMP, GSI, Fudan University, and more than a dozen other institutions.

This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China, the CAS President's International Fellowship Initiative, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China, among others.

NASA Staff Rebuke White House Cuts in Rare Public Dissent

A declaration of dissent from past and present NASA employees warns that science and safety are at risk and joins similar documents from staff at other federal science agencies

More than 280 NASA employees past and present, including at least 4 astronauts, have signed a declaration of opposition to the many drastic changes that the administration of US President Donald Trump is working to enact. The declaration also urges the acting head of NASA not to make the unprecedented budget cuts Trump has proposed.

“The last six months have seen rapid and wasteful changes which have undermined our mission and caused catastrophic impacts on NASA's workforce,” reads the employees' letter to interim administrator Sean Duffy. It argues that Trump's changes threaten human safety, scientific progress and global leadership at NASA.

The Voyager Declaration joins similar protest documents by employees at other US federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The appeals stem from Trump's sweeping campaign to overhaul the federal government, which has led to mass firings of workers and the proposal of steep cuts to agency budgets.

The declaration is “about getting our dissent out to the public and saying, hey — this is what's happening at NASA, and this is not OK”, says Ella Kaplan, who has signed the document. Kaplan works on a contract basis as a website administrator at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and was speaking on her own behalf and not that of her employer or of NASA.

Kaplan says she does not expect Duffy to read the document or to care much about it if he does. When Duffy ran for a seat in the US Congress more than a decade ago, he released a campaign advertisement that featured him wearing lumberjack clothing and saying he would bring his axe to “topple the big spending in Washington”.

The agency is not interested in sustaining “lower-priority missions”, said NASA spokeswoman Bethany Stevens. “We must revisit what's working and what's not so that we can inspire the American people again and win the space race.”

The Voyager Declaration, named after the twin NASA spacecraft that are exploring interstellar space, protests against staffing cuts at the agency and Trump's proposed cuts to science funding and other NASA budgets. The agency has fired some employees and pressured others to leave, resulting in the loss of more than 2,600 of the 17,000-plus NASA employees, according to news platform Politico. At least US$118 million in NASA grants has been cancelled outright, and the White House has proposed slashing nearly half of the agency's science budget for next year.

Congress, which sets US spending, might reject at least some of those proposed cuts. But the managers of many NASA science projects have been asked to draw up plans for winding down their programmes even though Congress hasn't finalized the budget — drawing dissent from the declaration's signers. “Once operational spacecraft are decommissioned, they cannot be turned back on,” the document says. NASA, like other agencies, is supposed to follow spending priorities laid out by Congress, and Duffy, as interim administrator, could theoretically ignore the White House requests until a budget is finalised.

The declaration asserts that since Trump took office, safety has taken a back seat to politics, marking a “dangerous turn” away from NASA's efforts to make human space flight less risky. Stevens responded that “NASA will never compromise on safety.”

The document's signers also disapprove of the agency's withdrawal from international missions, saying that such actions threaten partnerships with other nations' space agencies. The White House budget proposal, for instance, would cancel NASA participation in European Space Agency missions to Mars and Venus.

Dissent by employees at other federal agencies has met with mixed reactions. At the NIH, where more than 480 employees signed a Bethesda Declaration, director Jay Bhattacharya has said he intends to foster respectful dissent. But EPA administrator Lee Zeldin has placed more than 100 signatories to a dissenting document on administrative leave, saying he will not tolerate employees undercutting the president's agenda. Staff at the US National Science Foundation are also planning a declaration, according to a leaked version of the document.

Of the 287 signatories to the NASA document, 156 are anonymous.

Advances in data-driven design and additive manufacturing have substantially accelerated the development of truss metamaterials—three-dimensional truss networks—offering exceptional mechanical properties at a fraction of the weight of conventional solids. While existing design approaches can generate metamaterials with target linear properties, such as elasticity, they struggle to capture complex nonlinear behaviours and to incorporate geometric and manufacturing constraints—including defects—crucial for engineering applications. Here we present GraphMetaMat, an autoregressive graph-based framework capable of designing three-dimensional truss metamaterials with programmable nonlinear responses, originating from hard-to-capture physics such as buckling, frictional contact and wave propagation, along with arbitrary geometric constraints and defect tolerance. Integrating graph neural networks, physics biases, imitation learning, reinforcement learning and tree search, we show that GraphMetaMat can target stress–strain curves across four orders of magnitude and vibration transmission responses with varying attenuation gaps, unattainable by previous methods. We further demonstrate the use of GraphMetaMat for the inverse design of novel material topologies with tailorable high-energy absorption and vibration damping that outperform existing polymeric foams and phononic crystals, potentially suitable for protective equipment and electric vehicles. This work sets the stage for the automatic design of manufacturable, defect-tolerant materials with on-demand functionalities.

The physics bias for stress predictions is encoded in the ‘Magnitude Decoder' of the forward model, predicting the coefficients C and n of the power-scaling law, \({y}_{max}={C}_{\rho }^{-n}\), with the relative density \(\bar{\rho }\).

Distribution of the relative error (NMAE) for stress-strain inverse design on the (a) 90:5:5 split test set, (b) user-defined target curves, and (c) energy absorbing-oriented target curves. Distribution of the accuracy for wave transmission inverse design on the (d) 90:5:5 split test set, (e) user-defined target sequences, and (f) noise control-oriented target responses. The relative error and accuracy are computed between the predicted responses of the generated metamaterials and the target responses. These results demonstrate how all components, from IL to RL and MCTS, contribute to the performance of our model.

(a) Distribution of the relative error (NMAE) between the target and predicted test stress-strain responses, with and without printability constraint. (b) Distribution of the degree of support, Rsupp of the generated graphs on the test stress-strain target responses, with and without printability constraint. (c) Two examples of generated structures with and without printability constraint along with the corresponding FE-reconstructed stress-strain curves. These results reveal that, for certain target responses, printable structures can outperform non-printable truss networks. Overall, GraphMetaMat demonstrates the new capability of encoding manufacturing constraints, and offers flexibility in balancing performance and manufacturability constraints, as highlighted in (a) and (b).

(a) Target stress-strain curves from the test set. NMAE values are computed between the target and FE-reconstructed curves. Stress is normalized by the constitutive material's Young's modulus Es. (b) Target transmission curves from the test set. Accuracy values are computed between the target and FE-reconstructed curves using a transmission threshold of Tth = −10 dB. In both (a) and (b), predictions are shown as mean curves, with shaded regions denoting the estimated uncertainty from the forward model, defined as the range (minimum to maximum) across five snapshots using the snapshot ensemble technique59 (n = 5).

VAE-based method refers to ref. 51. Tandem-network method refers to ref. 50. Denoising diffusion method refers to ref. 28. GAN-based method refers to ref. 45.

(a) Target and predicted defect-free stress-strain curves of five generated designs. (b) Defect sensitivity of the five designs, defined as \(1-\bar{J}\), where \(\bar{J}\) represents the average curve similarity between pristine and flawed design responses across different defect parameters, such as the fraction of broken struts. Error bars represent the estimated uncertainty from the forward model, defined as the range (minimum to maximum) across five snapshots using the snapshot ensemble technique59 (n = 5). (c) Design 2 identified as the metamaterial with optimal defect tolerance.

The oral cavity is an accessible site for vaccination, but its sublingual and buccal sites have limited vaccine uptake. Here we show that flat tape dental floss can deliver vaccines through the junctional epithelium of the gingival sulcus, exploiting its naturally leaky properties. Floss-based vaccination delivered protein, inactivated virus, peptide-presenting immunogenic nanoparticles and messenger RNA. In mice, gold nanoparticles functionalized with a peptide derived from the ectodomain of the transmembrane matrix 2 protein of human influenza virus stimulated local lymph nodes, increased CD4+T cells in lymph nodes, lungs and spleen, and boosted antibody-secreting cells in the bone marrow. Floss-based immunization induced strong and sustained immune activation across multiple organs, robust systemic and mucosal antibody responses, and durable protection against lethal influenza infection, independent of age, food and liquid consumption. Floss-based vaccination was superior to sublingual and comparable with intranasal vaccination. In human participants, fluorescent dye delivered via floss picks effectively reached gingival sulcus, supporting clinical feasibility. These findings establish floss-based vaccination as a simple, needle-free strategy that enhances vaccine delivery and immune activation compared with existing mucosal immunization methods.

China's fifth Antarctic station, Qinling, opened last year.  Credit: Zhu He/Xinhua/Alamy

China has rapidly increased its interest in Antarctica over the past decade, opening its fifth Antarctic station last year. Scientists are hopeful that this will help ensure research of global significance continues on the continent, despite the US government's proposal to slash spending on polar science. 

China's latest station, Qinling, kicked off its first winter mission in March. Situated on Inexpressible Island in Terra Nova Bay, Qinling is China's first station in southern Antarctica, not far from stations run by Italy and South Korea. In time, the station will run studies on marine and terrestrial ecology, sea ice, geophysics, wildlife and other topics, says Shen Jun, a director at the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration in Beijing. 

Qingling is “well-placed for research into a huge range of contemporary challenges in Antarctic research”, says Christina Hulbe, a geophysicist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand.

One of them is determining how cold, dense waters form on the continental shelf, Hulbe says. These waters are the precursor to Antarctic bottom water, which plays a pivotal role in regulating the ocean's ability to store heat and capture carbon. The region is also important for studying marine biodiversity, including krill, penguins and whales.

China does not reveal how much it spends on Antarctic research each year, but researchers say that there has been growing government funding for overall research and development over the past decade. Since 2018, China has also built two new icebreakers, Xue Long 2 and Ji Di, and is planning a new summer station in southwest Antarctica, which is scheduled to open in 2027.

As China's interest in the region increases, US President Donald Trump has proposed cutting all polar research from $86 million to $25 million, and Antarctic-specific infrastructure renewal from $60 million to $24 million in 2026. US scientists fear that they might not be able to continue some of their research and fieldwork in Antarctica. There are also concerns that the US polar databases will not be maintained or updated. The US is seen by many as the global leader in Antarctic research.

Deniz Bozkurt, a climatologist at the University of Valparaíso in Chile, expects “some shift in the scientific leadership” for Antarctica and climate-change studies owing to the question marks surrounding US commitment.

Kim Yeadong, the chair of the Korean National Committee on Polar Research, based in Incheon, South Korea, says that Antarctic study benefits all of humanity. “If the US walks away, somebody should continue on this very important endeavour,” he adds. Kim says that he will be “very happy” if China increases its activity regardless of what the United States will do.

Bozkurt thinks that the biggest risk from the US government cuts is the potential loss of continuous data, such as those hosted by the US National Snow and Ice Data Center, which are crucial for understanding climate trends and extreme weather.

Qinling's global significance will depend partially on how China shares its data. “Sharing data, sharing findings, sharing issues of critical ecosystems, this is absolutely vital,” says Daniel Kammen, an energy researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. He hopes that the station's data will be shared with scientists in real time to help them to understand and respond to changes.

As scientists, we want solid answers, but we also want to answer questions that matter. Yet, the brain's complexity forces trade-offs between these desiderata, bringing about two distinct research approaches in neuroscience that we describe as ‘top-down' and ‘bottom-up'. Recognizing the validity of both approaches dispels misunderstandings and unnecessary tension and promotes constructive interactions.

As summer arrives in China, the country's 2023 heatwave springs to mind. A period of extreme heat in June and July that year didn't just scorch the land — it exposed a hard truth about China's energy future. Temperatures in Xinjiang province shattered records at 52 °C and nationwide sales of air-conditioning units spiked by about 40% (see go.nature.com/452ckya; in Chinese).

The illusion of a stable, renewables-led grid collapsed: in Jiangsu, solar farms sputtered at low capacity as sunlight was dimmed by weeks of industrial smog. In Inner Mongolia, wind turbines stood still under a rare, suffocating heat dome. Hydropower generation fell to a historic low, whereas national carbon emissions hit a record high, as surging electricity demand and frequent power outages revived calls to expand fossil-fuel power (J. Dinneen New Scientist 3 April 2025).

Faced with the prospect of power-grid failure, China had no choice but to fall back on the dirtiest tool in its energy arsenal: coal. During peak demand, thermal power plants were shouldering more than two-thirds of national electricity needs (see go.nature.com/4gth7zr; in Chinese). The power sector's coal consumption grew in 2023 by 9% relative to 2022, to 2.9 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/3gnfk35; in Chinese).

The heatwave was a stark reminder that, despite its world-beating solar and wind facilities, China is still tethered — almost helplessly — to fossil fuels (see ‘China's fossil-fuel reliance'). From steel mills to semiconductor plants, the engines of China's growth are fuelled by coal, oil and gas. Yet clinging to the status quo risks accelerating both environmental degradation and geopolitical vulnerability.

As the world's largest energy consumer, China cannot simply abandon fossil fuels without jeopardizing the industrial base and social fabric that underpin its economic rise. What's needed is realism. China's energy future is not a binary choice between fossil fuels and renewables — it is a high-stakes balancing act between economic resilience, environmental responsibility and social stability.

At the heart of its energy strategy must be carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). If the world is to meet its climate targets, China must lead not only in building green energy, but in cleaning up the energy it cannot yet replace with renewables.

In 2024, fossil fuels supplied almost 82% of China's total energy consumption (59.6 billion tonnes of coal equivalent). Coal accounted for 53%, oil for 17%, and natural gas for 11% (see go.nature.com/3tjpe7r; in Chinese). To understand their centrality, consider three sectors that contribute 25% of national gross domestic product (GDP): steel, chemicals and construction materials . Power generation and coal-to-chemical industries alone consume around 2 billion tonnes of coal annually (see go.nature.com/4kdx9hm; in Chinese). These processes demand extreme heat: blast furnaces cannot run on solar power, and cement kilns need temperatures of 1,450 °C, which today's renewables cannot yet reliably supply.

To end coal, adapt to regional realities

To end coal, adapt to regional realities

Even high-tech industries depend on fossil fuels. In 2022, data centres across China consumed a total of 270 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, a 25% increase compared with 2021. This accounted for roughly 3% of the country's total electricity consumption, much of it generated from coal (see go.nature.com/4kcz99y; in Chinese). According to a report by climate researchers at Tsinghua University in Beijing, the coal industry directly supported 2.6 million jobs in 2023. In Inner Mongolia, a region with a population of 23.8 million, coal contributes about 16% of its GDP and nearly half of its industrial profits, employing more than 180,000 people (see go.nature.com/3tsrfxs; in Chinese).

Abandoning coal without a strategy would trigger social unrest, as Germany discovered during its phase out of coal mining in the Ruhr Valley, starting in 2018. On losing a sector that once employed about 600,000 people, the region saw mass lay-offs and economic decline, sparking waves of protest and discontent (see go.nature.com/3ufk6wd).

As of 2024, China's capacity in solar and wind energy (887 and 521 gigawatts, respectively; see go.nature.com/3gjfdwf; in Chinese) is world-leading, yet last year these renewable sources met just 18% of the country's total electricity demand. The problem isn't scale — it's intermittency. For instance, during a 2022 winter cold snap, the generation capacity of Inner Mongolia's wind farms dropped to nearly zero for 24 hours because there was so little wind. Grid operators learnt the hard way and now require coal plants in major coal-producing areas to maintain 15-day coal stockpiles — not as a fallback to the past, but as a necessity of the present.

Oil and gas are equally entrenched. China's transportation sector alone consumes 177 million tonnes of petrol annually (see go.nature.com/4keewqm; in Chinese). Petrol and diesel still power almost 80% of China's roughly 450 million vehicles, despite electric vehicles accounting for 41% of new car sales in 2024, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.

Oil is also the feedstock of China's petrochemical empire. Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company — one of Asia's largest integrated refineries, run by the Chinese state firm Sinopec — processes up to 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Its output feeds China's vast plastics and chemical industries, which together employ more than 12 million people nationwide.

Three ways to cool Earth by pulling carbon from the sky

Three ways to cool Earth by pulling carbon from the sky

Natural gas, once peripheral, is now a geopolitical and environmental linchpin. As part of the Blue Sky campaign, tens of millions of rural households have replaced coal stoves with gas boilers — slashing urban smog but driving gas imports up to 43% to cover the increased consumption (see go.nature.com/4nvkkss; in Chinese). China's gas supply map is also a map of its foreign policy. A pipeline from Siberia delivers 38 billion cubic metres per year from Russia. In Guangdong, liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals offload cargo from Qatar to feed factories that help to produce 70% of the world's air conditioners.

This dependency isn't just economic — it's strategic. China still imports 11 million barrels of oil per day, yet 80% of it is transported by sea through the narrow, US-patrolled Strait of Malacca, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation. Gas pipelines snake through restive regions near Afghanistan, and LNG ships from Australia navigate contested waters in the South China Sea.

In response, China is doubling down on domestic exploration. In 2024, Sinopec announced it had discovered 140 million tonnes of shale oil in Shandong province, and PetroChina's Gulong shale-oil field in Daqing is targeting a reserve of 1 billion tonnes (see go.nature.com/4kj3g5r; in Chinese). These projects — in three national shale demonstration zones — should help to cut China's oil import reliance and replicate the US revolution in fracking, or hydraulic fracturing.

The price of fossil-fuel use is paid in carbon dioxide. In 2024, global CO2 emissions were projected to reach a record 41.6 billion tonnes — most of which came from coal burning (see go.nature.com/4rpu6qq). China contributed a staggering 16 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases in 2023, according to the UN Environment Programme's 2024 emissions gap report (see go.nature.com/4gzuyza), with coal alone responsible for more than 60% of CO2 emissions. Without urgent and comprehensive decarbonization, the climate crisis will only accelerate.

China's solution cannot be renewables alone. It must include CCUS, not as an afterthought, but as central infrastructure, similar to roads or railways. Currently, CCUS is the only proven technology with the potential to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and chemicals, if it can be made to work at scale.

China has backed the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter, a global pact launched in 2023 at the COP28 UN climate summit in the United Arab Emirates to cut emissions from the fossil-fuel sector. In July 2024, PetroChina joined the initiative, aligning with more than 50 oil companies responsible for 44% of global oil output. The charter mandates real action: no routine flaring of gas from fossil-fuel operations by 2030 and the adoption of industry best practices for emissions reductions and transparent emissions reporting.

But progress remains slow. China's national carbon market, the China Emissions Allowance, trades at 68–90 yuan (US$9.50–12.50) per tonne — well below carbon prices in the European Union, which exceed €70 (US$82) per tonne. Such low levels in China offer little incentive for companies to invest in deep decarbonization.

China emits more than 10 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, yet current CCUS projects, mostly in the Junggar Basin in northwest China, capture just 4 million tonnes and store 2 million tonnes (see go.nature.com/3tfkpye; in Chinese). The disparity is staggering. Without a sweeping scale-up, CCUS is symbolic at best. Closing the gap will require a huge and concerted effort to make carbon capture count.

First, China must drive down CCUS costs through sustained research and development and standardization. Technical standards should cover the entire CCUS life cycle: capture, transport, injection, monitoring and closure. These must include engineering protocols, environmental risk assessments and leakage detection systems.

As revenues from the anti-aging market -- riddled with hope and thousands of supplements-- surged past $500 million last year, Emory University researchers identified a compound that actively delays aging in cells and organisms.

A newly published study in Nature Partner Journals' Aging demonstrates that psilocin, a byproduct of consuming psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, extended the cellular lifespan of human skin and lung cells by more than 50%.

In parallel, researchers also conducted the first long-term in vivo study evaluating the systemic effects of psilocybin in aged mice of 19 months, or the equivalent of 60-65 human years. Results indicated that the mice that received an initial low dose of psilocybin of 5 mg, followed by a monthly high dose of 15 mg for 10 months, had a 30% increase in survival compared to mice that did not receive any. These mice also displayed healthier physical features, such as improved fur quality, fewer white hairs and hair regrowth.

While traditionally researched for its mental health benefits, this study suggests that psilocybin impacts multiple hallmarks of aging by reducing oxidative stress, improving DNA repair responses, and preserving telomere length. Telomeres are the structured ends of a chromosome, protecting it from damage that could lead to the formation of age-related diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, or cardiovascular disease. These foundational processes influence human aging and the onset of these chronic diseases.

The study concludes that psilocybin may have the potential to revolutionize anti-aging therapies and could be an impactful intervention in an aging population.

"Most cells in the body express serotonin receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life," says Louise Hecker, PhD, senior author on the study, and former associate professor at Emory University, where the research was initiated and funded.

While much of what researchers know about psilocybin relates to the brain, few studies have examined its systemic impacts. Many people associate psilocybin with the hallucinogenic impacts, but the majority of the cells in the body express serotonin receptors.

"Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. Additionally, even when the intervention is initiated late in life in mice, it still leads to improved survival,which is clinically relevant in healthy aging," adds Hecker, currently an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine.

This news comes on the heels of KFF's recent report that U.S. life expectancy is still below that of other countries similar in income and size, with an average lifespan of 78.4 years, compared to 82.5 years elsewhere. Not only was it the lowest, but as the lifespan in similar countries increased by 7.9 years from 1980-2022, whereas the U.S. life expectancy has only increased by 4.7 years.

"This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging -- not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years," says Director of Psychedelic Research at Emory University's Department of Psychiatry Ali John Zarrabi, MD. "As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren't just surviving longer -- they experienced better aging," adds Zarrabi, co-investigator of the study.

Zarrabi emphasized the importance of further research in older adults, as well as the well-documented overlap between physical and mental health.

"Emory is actively involved in Phase II and III clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression, and these results suggest we also need to understand psilocybin's systemic effects in aging populations," says Zarrabi. "My hope is also that if psilocybin-assisted therapy is approved as an intervention for depression by the FDA in 2027, then having a better quality of life would also translate into a longer, healthier life."

The study was initiated at Emory University and funded by several awards, including the Imagine, Innovative, and Impact (I3) Award, Emory University School of Medicine; the Georgia CTSA NIH Award; and a grant from Emory's Woodruff Health Sciences Center for Health in Aging.

The remains of landscapes thought to have formed when ancient rivers flowed across East Antarctica have been discovered - and could help predictions of future loss from the ice sheet.

Researchers led by Durham University, UK, examined radar measurements of ice thickness and found extensive, previously unmapped, flat surfaces buried beneath a 3,500 km stretch of the East Antarctic coastline.

These surfaces were once connected and it is believed were formed by large rivers after East Antarctica and Australia broke apart approximately 80 million years ago, and before ice covered Antarctica about 34 million years ago.

The flat surfaces are now hidden beneath the ice sheet and separated by deep troughs, which fast-flowing glaciers are steered through. The ice above the surfaces is moving much more slowly, the researchers say.

Ice loss from Antarctica is increasing, but the flat surfaces act as barriers to ice flow and may currently be regulating the rate of ice loss.

East Antarctica has the potential to raise global sea levels by 52 meters (170 feet) if it were to melt completely.

Adding the newly discovered surfaces' effects into models of future ice-sheet behavior could help refine projections of how the East Antarctic Ice Sheet might react to climate change and what its impact on global sea levels could be, the researchers add.

The findings are published in the journal Nature Geoscience.

Research lead author Dr Guy Paxman, a Royal Society University Research Fellow in the Department of Geography, Durham University, said: "The landscape hidden beneath the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most mysterious not just on Earth, but on any terrestrial planet in the solar system.

"When we were examining the radar images of the sub-ice topography in this region, these remarkably flat surfaces started to pop out almost everywhere we looked.

"The flat surfaces we have found have managed to survive relatively intact for over 30 million years, indicating that parts of the ice sheet have preserved rather than eroded the landscape.

"Information such as the shape and geology of the newly mapped surfaces will help improve our understanding of how ice flows at the edge of East Antarctica.

"This in turn will help make it easier to predict how the East Antarctic Ice Sheet could affect sea levels under different levels of climate warming in the future."

The extensive flat surfaces were found beneath approximately 40% of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet's 3,500km-long coastline between Princess Elizabeth Land and George V Land.

The preservation of these enigmatic surfaces over tens of millions of years indicates a lack of intense, selective erosion of these areas throughout Antarctica's glacial history.

The research team also included the universities of Newcastle, Edinburgh and Exeter, UK, the British Antarctic Survey, the Alfred Wegener Institute, Germany, the Polar Research Institute of China, and Beijing University of Technology.

Research co-author Professor Neil Ross, Professor of Polar Science and Environmental Geophysics, Newcastle University, said: "We've long been intrigued and puzzled about fragments of evidence for 'flat' landscapes beneath the Antarctic ice sheets.

"This study brings the jigsaw pieces of data together, to reveal the big picture: how these ancient surfaces formed, their role in determining the present-day flow of the ice, and their possible influence on how the East Antarctic Ice Sheet will evolve in a warming world."

The researchers emphasize the need to further explore the influence of these flat surfaces on ice sheet movement during past warmer climates.

This would include drilling through the ice to retrieve rock from the flat surfaces to understand when they were last free from ice cover. This will help improve predictions for how the ice around this large section of the East Antarctic margin will respond as the climate and ocean warms.

The research was funded by the UK's Natural Environment Research Council, a Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship, the European Research Council, the AWI INSPIRES III program and the Natural Science Foundation of China.

Scientists at Rice University and University of Houston have developed an innovative, scalable approach to engineer bacterial cellulose into high-strength, multifunctional materials. The study, published in Nature Communications, introduces a dynamic biosynthesis technique that aligns bacterial cellulose fibers in real-time, resulting in robust biopolymer sheets with exceptional mechanical properties.

Plastic pollution persists because traditional synthetic polymers degrade into microplastics, releasing harmful chemicals like bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates and carcinogens. Seeking sustainable alternatives, the research team led by Muhammad Maksud Rahman, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Houston and adjunct assistant professor of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice, leveraged bacterial cellulose -- one of Earth's most abundant and pure biopolymers -- as a biodegradable alternative.

"Our approach involved developing a rotational bioreactor that directs the movement of cellulose-producing bacteria, aligning their motion during growth," said M.A.S.R. Saadi, the study's first author and a doctoral student in material science and nanoengineering at Rice. "This alignment significantly enhances the mechanical properties of microbial cellulose, creating a material as strong as some metals and glasses yet flexible, foldable, transparent and environment friendly."

Bacterial cellulose fibers usually form randomly, which limits their mechanical strength and functionality. By harnessing controlled fluid dynamics within their novel bioreactor, the researchers achieved in situ alignment of cellulose nanofibrils, creating sheets with tensile strength reaching up to 436 megapascals.

Moreover, incorporating boron nitride nanosheets during synthesis resulted in a hybrid material with even greater strength -- around 553 megapascals -- and improved thermal properties, demonstrating a heat dissipation rate three times faster than control samples.

"This dynamic biosynthesis approach enables the creation of stronger materials with greater functionality," Saadi said. "The method allows for the easy integration of various nanoscale additives directly into the bacterial cellulose, making it possible to customize material properties for specific applications."

Shyam Bhakta, a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of BioSciences at Rice, played an important role in advancing the biological aspects of the study. Other Rice collaborators included Pulickel Ajayan, the Benjamin M. and Mary Greenwood Anderson Professor of Materials Science and NanoEngineering; Matthew Bennett, professor of biosciences; and Matteo Pasquali, the A.J. Hartsook Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.

"The synthesis process is essentially like training a disciplined bacterial cohort," Saadi explained. "Instead of having the bacteria move randomly, we instruct them to move in a specific direction, thus precisely aligning their cellulose production. This disciplined motion and the versatility of the biosynthesis technique allows us to simultaneously engineer both alignment and multifunctionality."

The scalable, single-step process holds significant promise for numerous industrial applications, including structural materials, thermal management solutions, packaging, textiles, green electronics and energy storage systems.

"This work is a great example of interdisciplinary research at the intersection of materials science, biology and nanoengineering," Rahman added. "We envision these strong, multifunctional and eco-friendly bacterial cellulose sheets becoming ubiquitous, replacing plastics in various industries and helping mitigate environmental damage."

"This estimate shows that there is more plastic in the form of nanoparticles floating in the this part of the ocean, than there is in larger micro- or macroplastics floating in the Atlantic or even all the world's oceans!," said Helge Niemann, researcher at NIOZ and professor of geochemistry at Utrecht University. Mid-June, he received a grant of 3.5 million euros to conduct more research into nanoplastics in the sea and their fate.

Ocean expedition For this research, Utrecht master student Sophie ten Hietbrink worked for four weeks aboard the research vessel RV Pelagia. On a trip from the Azores to the continental shelf of Europe, she took water samples at 12 locations where she filtered out anything larger than one micrometer. "By drying and heating the remaining material, we were able to measure the characteristic molecules of different types of plastics in the Utrecht laboratory, using mass spectrometry," Ten Hietbrink says.

First real estimate The research by NIOZ and Utrecht University provides the first estimate of the amount of nanoplastics in the oceans. Niemann: "There were a few publications that showed that there were nanoplastics in the ocean water, but until now no estimate of the amount could ever be made." This first estimate was made possible, according to Niemann, by the joining of forces of ocean scientists and the knowledge of atmospheric scientist Dusân Materic of Utrecht University.

Shocking amount Extrapolating the results from different locations to the whole of the North Atlantic Ocean, the researchers arrived at the immense amount of 27 million tons of nanoplastics. "A shocking amount," Ten Hietbrink believes. "But with this we do have an important answer to the paradox of the missing plastic." Until now, not all the plastic that was ever produced in the world could be recovered. So, it turns out that a large portion is now floating in the water as tiny particles.

Sun, rivers and rain The nanoplastics can reach water by various routes. In part, this happens because larger particles disintegrate under the influence of sunlight. Another part probably flows along with river water. It also appears that nanoplastics reach the oceans through the air, as suspended particles fall down with rainwater or fall from the air onto the water surface as 'dry deposition'.

Consequences The consequences of all those nanoplastics in the water could be fundamental, Niemann emphasizes. "It is already known that nanoplastics can penetrate deep into our bodies. They are even found in brain tissue. Now that we know they are so ubiquitous in the oceans, it's also obvious that they penetrate the entire ecosystem; from bacteria and other microorganisms to fish and top predators like humans. How that pollution affects the ecosystem needs further investigation."

Other oceans In the future, Niemann and colleagues also want to do further research on, for example, the different types of plastics that have not yet been found in the fraction of 1 micrometer or smaller. "For example, we have not found polyethylene or polypropylene among the nanoplastics. It may well be that those were masked by other molecules in the study. We also want to know if nanoplastics are as abundant in the other oceans. It is to be feared that they do, but that remains to be proven.

Not cleaning up but preventing Niemann emphasizes that the amount of nanoplastics in ocean water was an important missing piece of the puzzle, but now there is nothing to do about it. "The nanoplastics that are there, can never be cleaned up. So an important message from this research is that we should at least prevent the further pollution of our environment with plastics."

Stargate, the ambitious joint venture announced at the White House back in January between OpenAI, Oracle, the Japanese holding company Softbank, and others, appears to be struggling to deliver on its bold promises just six months later.

The Wall Street Journal reported today, citing unnamed sources, that the Stargate Project has yet to finalize any deals for new data centers. The report also says the group is scaling back its near-term goals.

When it was announced on Jan. 21, Stargate was pitched as a new company with plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years to build AI infrastructure across the U.S. OpenAI claimed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that $100 billion of that would be deployed “immediately.” The company was named after the 1994 sci-fi film about an interstellar gateway. 

The post promised the new infrastructure would “secure American leadership in AI, create hundreds of thousands of American jobs, and generate massive economic benefit for the entire world.”

Initial backers of the company include OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX, with SoftBank and OpenAI leading the charge. SoftBank was said to be taking on the financial responsibility of the venture, while OpenAI handles operations. SoftBank's CEO, Masayoshi Son, serves as the company's chairman.

Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison joined President Donald Trump at the White House for the first press conference of his new term to promote the venture. At the event, both Altman and Ellison said Stargate's work could lead to cures for diseases like cancer.

Altman even declared that Stargate would be “the most important project of this era.” 

At the time of its announcement, Altman's longtime rival, Elon Musk, immediately cast doubt on the project. Musk responded directly to OpenAI's X statement, writing, “They don't actually have the money,” and added, “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. I have that on good authority.”

The Wall Street Journal reported today that OpenAI and Softbank have not been able to agree on key issues regarding the partnership, including where to build the new sites. The group is now aiming to open a single, smaller data center, likely in Ohio, by the end of the year, according to sources familiar with the matter.

Despite the slow start for Stargate, Altman is pushing ahead with his own broader data center ambitions.

Just today, OpenAI said it's partnering to develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional Stargate-branded data center capacity in the U.S., although the deal does not involve Softbank. 

Altman has been using the “Stargate” name for data center projects that fall outside the official SoftBank partnership, including facilities in Abilene and Denton, Texas, according to the Journal. Those particular sites are reportedly not being funded by SoftBank, even though the Japanese company holds the trademark for Stargate. 

In a press release announcing its new partnership with Oracle, OpenAI said, “With SoftBank, we're moving quickly on site assessments and reimagining how data centers are designed to power advanced AI.”

Among the concerns raised about the Stargate project, which involves partnerships with OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, were scarce details about infrastructure support. Little by little, the companies disclosed their intentions and, on Tuesday, OpenAI and Oracle announced plans to build an additional 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of Stargate data center infrastructure in the U.S., pushing OpenAI's total planned capacity beyond 5 GW. Interestingly, SoftBank is not involved in financing this buildout, despite being part of the Stargate project.

Under the terms of the plan announced in January, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank plan to build 20 data centers each measuring 500,000 square feet (46,450 square meters). However, it was unclear how they intended to power the data centers, as it does not look like the U.S. infrastructure has enough spare capacity to power the additional AI servers, cooling systems, and networking equipment used in AI data centers unless some sort of additional infrastructure is built. 

The announced 4.5 GW of infrastructure indeed refers primarily to electrical power availability, which is among the limiting factors for AI development these days. OpenAI claims that the expanded infrastructure of 5 GW will enable its data centers to power over two million AI processors, though it does not disclose whether the infrastructure is meant to support 1.4 kW Blackwell Ultra processors or 3.6 kW Rubin Ultra processors. If a 5 GW infrastructure were to power only AI GPUs, then it could feed 3.571 million Blackwell Ultra or 1.388 million Rubin Ultra GPUs. However, AI accelerators typically consume only half of the entire data center's power, without taking into account power usage effectiveness (PUE), so the actual number of supported GPUs would be lower. 

The new 4.5 GW-capable facilities may be built in states such as Texas, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, though exact locations are still being finalized. This is in addition to an existing site under construction in Abilene, Texas, which OpenAI considers a proof-of-concept facility to ensure its ability to deploy infrastructure at scale and speed. OpenAI believes that lessons learned from Abilene will help with the execution of subsequent sites. 

Parts of the Abilene facility — Stargate I — are now active as Oracle began installing server racks based on Nvidia's GB200 platform last month. OpenAI has begun utilizing this infrastructure to conduct early-stage AI training and inference tasks as part of its next-generation research initiatives.

TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 is where breakthrough ideas meet the real-world challenges that define the future — and with over 10,000 startup and VC leaders converging, there's no better place to have the hard conversations. One of the most urgent? How artificial intelligence is reshaping national defense, security, and critical infrastructure in real time.

Enter AI Defense, a can't-miss panel discussion taking place on one of the two AI Stages, where leaders from government, venture, and the armed services will explore the high-stakes collision of innovation and national security.

With AI evolving at a blistering pace, the stakes for defense innovation have never been higher. From autonomous systems and decision intelligence to cybersecurity and battlefield readiness, the U.S. defense and intelligence communities are racing to build smarter, more adaptive technologies — without compromising ethics, oversight, or safety.

This panel explores the delicate balance between intelligence and control, the role of startups in defense innovation, and the multibillion-dollar opportunities emerging at the intersection of national security and AI.

If your startup touches defense, government, cybersecurity, or AI infrastructure, this is a conversation you can't afford to miss.

Onstage, you'll hear from Dr. Kathleen Fisher, director of the Information Innovation Office at DARPA, who is leading the charge on tech that gives the U.S. and its allies an edge in the information wars of the 21st century. With a career that spans AT&T Labs and academia at Tufts University, Fisher blends research credibility with strategic vision, and she's shaping the next generation of defense-grade AI.

Joining the panel is Sri Chandrasekar, managing partner at Point72 Ventures, and formerly a leader at In-Q-Tel, the CIA's strategic investment arm. Chandrasekar knows how to spot frontier tech that moves the needle, and he's built investment frameworks to support some of the intelligence community's toughest missions.

Rounding out the panel is Justin Fanelli, chief technology officer for the Department of the Navy. Fanelli lives at the intersection of cybersecurity, innovation, and adoption, driving digital transformation across one of the most complex organizations in government. From his DARPA Service Chiefs Fellowship to his nationally recognized work in defense health and command systems, Fanelli brings the boots-on-the-ground perspective to how defense is done in the age of AI.

This AI Defense panel takes place on the AI Stage. Exact session time coming soon — but don't wait to claim your pass.

TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 runs October 27-29 at Moscone West in San Francisco. Join 10,000+ startup and VC leaders for three days of conversations and connections that define what's next. Grab your pass now before prices increase after July.

Security researchers at Google and Microsoft say they have evidence that hackers backed by China are exploiting a zero-day bug in Microsoft SharePoint, as companies around the world scramble to patch the flaw.

The bug, known officially as CVE-2025-53770 and discovered last weekend, allows hackers to steal sensitive private keys from self-hosted versions of SharePoint, a software server widely used by companies and organizations to store and share internal documents. Once exploited, an attacker can use the bug to remotely plant malware and gain access to the files and data stored within, as well as gain access to other systems on the same network.

In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft said it had observed at least two previously identified China-backed hacking groups it calls “Linen Typhoon” and “Violet Typhoon” exploiting the SharePoint zero-day. Microsoft says Linen Typhoon is focused on stealing intellectual property, while Violet Typhoon steals private information to be used for espionage.

Microsoft also attributed the ongoing hacks to a third China-backed hacking group it named “Storm-2603,” representing a hacking group about which the company has less information. The company noted, however, that the hackers have been linked to ransomware attacks in the past.

According to Microsoft, the three hacking groups were observed exploiting the zero-day vulnerability to break into vulnerable SharePoint servers as far back as July 7.

Charles Carmakal, the chief technology officer at Google's incident response unit Mandiant, told TechCrunch in an email that “at least one of the actors responsible” was a China-nexus hacking group, but noted that “multiple actors are now actively exploiting this vulnerability.”

Dozens of organizations have already been hacked, including across the government sector. The bug is regarded as a zero-day because the vendor — Microsoft, in this case — had no time to issue a patch before it was actively exploited. Microsoft has since rolled out patches for all affected versions of SharePoint, but security researchers have warned that customers running self-hosted versions of SharePoint should assume they have already been compromised.

The Chinese government has long rebuffed allegations that it has carried out cyberattacks, though it has not always explicitly denied its involvement.

When reached for comment, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said in a statement that China “firmly opposes and combats all forms of cyber attacks and cyber crime — a position that is consistent and clear.”

This is the latest hacking campaign linked to China in recent years. Hackers backed by China were accused of targeting self-hosted Microsoft Exchange email servers in 2021 as part of a mass-hacking campaign. According to a recent Justice Department indictment accusing two Chinese hackers of masterminding the breaches, the so-called “Hafnium” hacks compromised contact information and private mailboxes from more than 60,000 affected servers.

The fastest gaming processor in the world is still on sale at Amazon, just $10 shy of its lowest ever price. The absolute cream of the crop when it comes to gaming performance, this usually retails for around $479, but is currently discounted to $451. This deal is available across multiple vendors, including both Newegg and Amazon.

Not only that, Amazon has also discounted a series of requisite AM5 motherboards from Asus, and will let you add both as a bundle to your basket. The cheapest gets you a ROG Strix B850-F Gaming Wi-Fi bundle for $718, although you can buy them separately for roughly the same price if you so choose.

The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D's performance blew us away when we reviewed it last year, quickly rocketing to the top of our list and earning our Editor's Choice award. We ultimately gave it a score of 4.5 out of 5 stars, regarding its performance as "devastating" in the title with good reason. This is hands down one of the best processors you can get your hands on right now, and this discount only sweetens the deal.

The 9800X3D is the fastest gaming CPU in the world. It features eight cores and 16 threads, capable of reaching speeds of up to 5.2 GHz, and comes with a massive 96MB of game-boosting L3 Cache. The chip is PCIe 5.0 compatible and will push any GPU on the market to its fullest. 

The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is $28 off at Amazon right now, just $10 shy of its lowest-ever price. There's also a discount on this ASUS TUF Gaming X870-Plus motherboard, now $266.99 instead of $299.99. Bundle those together and you'll save a total of $60 and get a new mobo to seat that shiny new CPU. There are also more potent packages available. 

The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D gaming CPU is built around the Zen 5 X3D architecture. It features eight cores, providing a total of 16 threads, with a base speed of 4.7 GHz. When boosted, it can reach frequencies as high as 5.2 GHz. Most importantly, it comes with a massive 96MB of game-boosting L3 Cache.

This edition features integrated AMD Radeon Graphics, which includes two graphics cores, eliminating the need for a separate GPU to achieve video output with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It's also PCIe 5.0 compatible and supports up to 192GB of DDR5-5600 via two channels.

The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an absolute gaming beast; there is really no other way to put it, topping our CPU hierarchy list, where we break down our ranking of CPUs, and leading our list of the Best CPUs for gaming. Snag it while you can — this CPU was plagued by shortages for months due to its popularity, and, as expected, the price hasn't budged much as a result. All this is to say, you can be assured this sale will last long.

Los Angeles-based Nevoya came out of stealth last year with the ambitious goal of breaking the EV truck adoption logjam. Nevoya made enough progress on its goal to attract investors — and a $9.3 million seed round — to help it move even faster.

The young company, which buys electric trucks and offers them to shippers, is now carrying goods for 10 different Fortune 500 companies. More importantly, it's offering services as a carrier to those companies in California at cost parity with similar-sized diesel trucks.

It's a noteworthy accomplishment, especially at a time of increasing anti-EV headwinds — fueled by an administration that has publicly criticized green energy.

Founder Sami Khan is unfazed. 

The idea of lowering carbon emissions is still attractive to the Fortune 500s, Khan told TechCrunch. Khan said he also believes Nevoya is just running a much faster, leaner, and better carrier business than legacy operators — in large part by leveraging AI.

Nevoya applies AI to optimize trucking routes, and matching and balancing loads with the right trucks to maximize efficiency while minimizing energy consumption. The company also uses AI to help sort out charging schedules and battery management. 

“When we started running the trucking business,” Khan said, “we looked at what [everybody was] doing, and we meticulously looked at every minute-by-minute of what was going on. We came to the conclusion that 90% of what was going on could be automated or semi-automated.”

Khan said Nevoya's automation has been getting information to drivers faster, with fewer mistakes than humans would make. He also said that leveraging AI is not replacing dispatchers, but rather freeing them up to better communicate with Nevoya's customers. 

Khan expects to keep growing this model thanks to Nevoya's new seed round — a fundraising effort that was initially much more conservative.

Late last year, with a pre-seed round in the rear view mirror, and some early traction building Nevoya's all-electric trucking fleet, Khan found himself weighing options for how to grow his company: Do an inside round with existing investors? Or go bigger?

That's when Khan spoke with Shawn Xu from Lowercarbon Capital. Xu had introduced Khan and co-founder John Verdon (the former business development head of Waymo) and had followed Nevoya closely, but had not yet invested. Xu's message was clear: Go for it.

“[Xu] basically said, like, no, no, no, do a big round now. We're going to lead it, and we're going to run with it,” Khan said. “It was, really validating, frankly, to have an investor that in the first round said ‘we're going to sit on the sidelines,' then come in and preempt the next round.”

Lowercarbon ended up leading Nevoya's $9.3 million seed round, which just closed, Khan told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. Floating Point and LMNT Ventures also joined, along with existing investors Third Sphere, Stepchange, and Never Lift. Qasar Younis, the founder and CEO of buzzy self-driving AI company Applied Intuition, also invested.

That funding will go toward expanding Nevoya beyond California into new states like Texas. The company is already hauling freight in Houston and Dallas. 

That will help Nevoya generate more revenue, though Khan was quick to point out that there is a lot of work to be done in these new markets before they can also reach cost parity with diesel trucks. He also said Nevoya has to be more creative with how it manages its fleets in places like Texas because there is less charging infrastructure. 

That involves workarounds like charging the trucks overnight at stations typically meant for passenger vehicles, or at school bus depots when the chargers aren't in use. 

Khan framed this as a win-win. These locations get extra revenue during off-peak hours, and Nevoya gets to expand quickly with lower up-front cost. He said the plan is to ultimately invest in building out more dedicated charging infrastructure. 

To manage this expansion, Khan said Nevoya is leaning on the same model that companies like Uber used as it entered new locations. Nevoya is hiring general managers that will run their own locations like a startup-within-a-startup.

“That kind of competitive element of pitting these incredibly smart, talented general managers against each other is really, really effective in driving that next level of performance for the business,” he said. 

Xu said he initially held back from investing in Nevoya because he wanted the company to prove it could hit that cost parity with diesel. 

“We want to understand the appetite and validation from the market,” he remembered thinking. But, he said, he also felt that “a business like this must exist.”

As Xu saw Nevoya progressing, he remembered saying to Khan: “What would it look like if you actually raised a lot more than you were expecting to raise?” The two spoke about using more artificial intelligence to optimize their fleet management, while also keeping an eye on an autonomous future (hence the inclusion of Applied Intuition's Younis in the round).

“They're getting lower cost per mile. They're getting lower maintenance costs. The AI orchestration for efficiency on the route optimization is starting to bear fruit,” he said. “So yeah, we ended up raising a much larger round that ended up being even more oversubscribed than we had expected. And now we're off to the races.”

More reasons for the alleged delay have emerged

MediaTek and Nvidia have reportedly pushed back the launch of their much-anticipated N1X AI PC platform to the first quarter of 2026, according to a new DigiTimes report citing supply chain sources. The latest reasons given contrast with an earlier report, which still informed us of the delay, but attributed it to critical hardware defects requiring a silicon respin. While chip revisions at Nvidia are still part of this latest story, the new information points toward a broader set of factors, including Microsoft's slower-than-expected OS roadmap and weakening demand across the notebook market.

The N1X platform, originally believed to be scheduled for Q3 2025 with both consumer and commercial models, never materialized at Computex earlier this year, fueling speculation about its readiness. DigiTimes now reports that MediaTek and Nvidia are prioritizing enterprise-class systems for the initial rollout, banking on stronger commercial adoption before expanding into the volatile consumer segment.

The N1X processor has previously been tipped to deliver 180–200 TOPS of AI compute performance and would mark MediaTek's most ambitious entry into the PC space, backed by Nvidia's AI expertise. Major OEMs and ODMs, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Asus, MSI, and Compal, are reportedly preparing notebook and desktop designs for the platform. This is another area where Intel underestimated the competition way back, and now Nvidia appears to be gunning for this territory, rivaling not only Intel and AMD but also Qualcomm.

Moreover, DigiTimes' report also offers a glimpse into Nvidia and MediaTek's expanding collaboration. Beyond PCs, the two companies are said to be advancing joint efforts in automotive AI via MediaTek's Dimensity Auto platform, as well as edge AI development with Nvidia's TAO toolkit and MediaTek's NeuroPilot SDK. Digitimes says the companies have also co-developed the DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer and are key partners in Nvidia's NVLink Fusion ecosystem for custom AI silicon.

Interestingly, DigiTimes mentions MediaTek's involvement in Google's v7e AI project, now reportedly delayed to mass production in October 2026. This long-term partnership could bring significant revenue—estimated at $4 billion—and signals that MediaTek is building a stronger presence in the AI silicon market, both at the edge and in data centers. For those unaware, v7e is a next-generation TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) Google is co-developing with MediaTek, designed for large-scale AI workloads in Google's data centers.

Anyhow, the new reported Q1 2026 timeline for N1X could suggest that Nvidia and MediaTek are refining both hardware and strategy. While SemiAccurate's earlier claims of hardware defects may still hold some truth, the new report paints a picture of a more calculated delay, aligning with Microsoft's OS updates, fixing remaining chip-level issues, and waiting for commercial demand to stabilize. In the meantime, Nvidia's GB10-based AI workstations, which are still on track for release, may serve as the company's first real-world testbed for consumer-facing AI PC hardware before N1X arrives.

What do mattresses and a box of matches have in common? It's not just that they're both rectangular—both can can be very flammable if you're not careful. Mattresses have historically posed a significant fire hazard, and they still can without careful attention to the materials used.

In the US, an estimated 20,800 residential fires occurred due to mattresses and bedding igniting from flame exposure between 1996 and 1998, according to FEMA. At that time, fires involving mattresses and bedding were causing double the death and injury of all residential structure fires.

Something had to be done, and the solution was the incorporation of fire retardants. While they don't make a bed fully fireproof, they slow the spread of fire and ultimately prevent sleepers from becoming the Human Torch. New federal standards for mattress flammability took effect in July 2007. But some of the new fire retardants used have created concerns about other health affects, especially if the worst comes to pass and it does ignite. What could you potentially be breathing in, or coming into contact with—and are there long-term repercussions from that exposure? To understand what makes a mattress safe from and in fires, we need to understand the different forms of flame retardant and how they perform in various scenarios.

Fiberglass has been the fire barrier of choice for many a mattress for a long time. You can usually find it in one of two places: the mattress cover, or a thin internal sleeve that's usually called a “fire sock.” Fiberglass is very good as a flame retardant since it won't burn and has an extremely high melting point, 2,237 degrees Fahrenheit. It's a cheap material that's easy to integrate into a mattress.

But fiberglass has some serious drawbacks. If it splinters off and is inhaled or touched, it can cause significant damage to your skin or internal organs. Consumers have become increasingly aware of this problem, and pushback against mattresses with a fiberglass layer has become prevalent on social media, like a fairly recent wave of posts on TikTok.

Mattresses that do contain fiberglass have to say so on the attached label. The mattress tag may not, however, show what fire retardant chemicals are being used in the mattress instead. This is where certifications, careful research, and the recommendation of trusted testers are going to be crucial in picking the right product. WIRED, for example, does not recommend beds that contain fiberglass.

We opt to test mattresses that have certifications to behold. While things like CertiPUR-US certification only lends itself to memory foam, it still points to a safer sleep experience. But to bypass fiberglass altogether, there are many alternatives to consider. Here are some of the most common in mattresses we have tested:

Wool contains two major elements that aren't flame-friendly: nitrogen and water. It requires some serious heat to catch fire (around 1,060 to 1,115 degrees Fahrenheit). Even, then it isn't the easiest to burn and may take more time to smolder before ultimately snuffing the fire out itself. Similarly, cashmere and mohair (courtesy of Angora goats) are naturally fire-resistant animal-based materials that prevent the spread of flame. They too contain a lot of moisture and will shrivel up like wool when subjected to flame.

Saatva

Rayon can be derived from the wood pulp from a variety of plant sources—for example, we often see it in bamboo sheets. It's classified as a “semi-synthetic fiber” because it requires pretty serious chemical treatment in order to be transformed from a pulpy goo to the finished material. To make it fire resistant, though, rayon requires the use of silica. When subjected to flame, this mineral creates a char barrier that halts flames from progressing. Silica treatments can serve as a fire barrier in other materials as well.

Leesa

Synthetic fibers, namely nylon and polyester, are both heavily plastic-based. Simply put, they require very high levels of heat to melt. “Melt” is the key word here, as even when subjected to flame exposure, the first reaction isn't to self-ignite.

Aside from fiberglass, there are a few other flame retardants you want to avoid. The good news is that for the most part, you shouldn't encounter many of these, as the majority have been banned over health concerns. But if something feels amiss, it's a go-with-your-gut situation. Are there noxious chemical smells coming from the bed? Is your skin reacting to it? Do you think you're breathing weird after sleeping on it? Double-check the legal tag, and reach out to customer service to confirm what's being used in the bed. But it still might not provide you all the answers you're seeking. Again, this is where material certifications are so important, because they verify the absence of these things in the finished product.

Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are known as “forever chemicals” because once they enter the body, they make themselves permanently at home. While they work as a fire barrier, they can have long-term health ramifications after exposure, resulting in various forms of neurological and hormonal disorders. However, their usage in mattresses has been mostly phased out for these reasons.

Decabromodiphenyl oxide (DecaBdE) is similar to PBDEs in that it doesn't vacate the body. While it's been banned from use since 2013, it was used in mattresses, textiles, and plastic products. Long-term accumulation can lead outcomes similar to those of PBDEs, like reproductive, thyroid, neurological, and liver disorders.

Chlorinated tris (TDCPP) is another chemical flame retardant that can be found in some polyurethane foams, whether that be a mattress, piece of furniture, or clothing. It was banned in California back in 2020 and is listed on the Proposition 65 chemical list that could lead to serious long-term ramifications.

Antimony trioxide can be used in foam and plastic production as a flame-resistant substance, but it has been studied for carcinogenic outcomes. It, too, is on California's Proposition 65 chemical list.

Organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPFRS) were used as an alternative to PBDEs, especially as a flame retardant in foams, furniture, and tech products. Unfortunately, more research is coming to light on the downsides of OPFRs. Exposure can be linked to potential birth defects, can complicate pregnancies (like premature birth), and can cause health issues neurologically and hormonally for children in particular.

Boric acid can be used as a flame retardant. But it's also used as insecticide.

Melamine is common for plastic products, especially for kitchen usage. Where it gets tricky is that as a flame retardant, it can release health-compromising fumes that are dangerous to breathe in—like hydrogen cyanide. Skin exposure can also mean potential serious neurological and kidney damage.

The surest ways to get a safe mattress are to stick with reputable domestic brands and consider an organic mattress. We have an entire guide dedicated to the best organic mattresses, including some of our favorites below.

This mattress really takes the cake when it comes to showing how natural it is. There are numerous organic certifications. While latex by itself isn't fully fireproof, it is pretty impervious to heat—making it just another layer of supportive security.

With many chemical flame retardants being especially harmful for kids, sticking to organic mattresses can bring parents some peace of mind. WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson got this particular bed for his kids, who really enjoyed it for both sleeping and jumping on.

Take precautions when using any flame near your bed—you don't want to have a live demo of its flame barrier if you don't have to. If you light candles in the evening, especially near your bedside, blow them out before you leave the room or fall sleep. Don't smoke or vape in bed, as a spark from ash or even a vape malfunctioning could ignite a mattress fire. Keep an eye on how close your bed is to electrical outlets and where you have things plugged in, like your phone charger. Lastly, make sure fire safety is common knowledge amongst family members and roommates, just to be on the safe side. You could follow every precaution perfectly, but those around you may not know. So let's keep each other safe, Smokey the Bear style. But make it mattresses.

Quaise is taking its technology from the lab to field trials for the first time this year.

A beam of energy hit the slab of rock, which quickly began to glow. Pieces cracked off, sparks ricocheted, and dust whirled around under a blast of air. 

From inside a modified trailer, I peeked through the window as a millimeter-wave drilling rig attached to an unassuming box truck melted a hole into a piece of basalt in less than two minutes. After the test was over, I stepped out of the trailer into the Houston heat. I could see a ring of black, glassy material stamped into the slab fragments, evidence of where the rock had melted.  

This rock-melting drilling technology from the geothermal startup Quaise is certainly unconventional. The company hopes it's the key to unlocking geothermal energy and making it feasible anywhere.

Geothermal power tends to work best in those parts of the world that have the right geology and heat close to the surface. Iceland and the western US, for example, are hot spots for this always-available renewable energy source because they have all the necessary ingredients. But by digging deep enough, companies could theoretically tap into the Earth's heat from anywhere on the globe.

That's a difficult task, though. In some places, accessing temperatures high enough to efficiently generate electricity would require drilling miles and miles beneath the surface. Often, that would mean going through very hard rock, like granite.

Quaise's proposed solution is a new mode of drilling that eschews the traditional technique of scraping into rock with a hard drill bit. Instead, the company plans to use a gyrotron, a device that emits high-frequency electromagnetic radiation. Today, the fusion power industry uses gyrotrons to heat plasma to 100 million °C, but Quaise plans to use them to blast, melt, and vaporize rock. This could, in theory, make drilling faster and more economical, allowing for geothermal energy to be accessed anywhere.  

Since Quaise's founding in 2018, the company has demonstrated that its systems work in the controlled conditions of the laboratory, and it has started trials in a semi-controlled environment, including the backyard of its Houston headquarters. Now these efforts are leaving the lab, and the team is taking gyrotron drilling technology to a quarry to test it in real-world conditions. 

Some experts caution that reinventing drilling won't be as simple, or as fast, as Quaise's leadership hopes. The startup is also attempting to raise a large funding round this year, at a time when economic uncertainty is slowing investment and the US climate technology industry is in a difficult spot politically because of policies like tariffs and a slowdown in government support. Quaise's big idea aims to accelerate an old source of renewable energy. This make-or-break moment might determine how far that idea can go. 

Rough calculations from the geothermal industry suggest that enough energy is stored inside the Earth to meet our energy demands for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, says Matthew Houde, cofounder and chief of staff at Quaise. After that, other sources like fusion should be available, “assuming we continue going on that long, so to speak,” he quips. 

“We want to be able to scale this style of geothermal beyond the locations where we're able to readily access those temperatures today with conventional drilling,” Houde says. The key, he adds, is simply going deep enough: “If we can scale those depths to 10 to 20 kilometers, then we can enable super-hot geothermal to be worldwide accessible.”

Though that's technically possible, there are few examples of humans drilling close to this depth. One research project that began in 1970 in the former Soviet Union reached just over 12 kilometers, but it took nearly 20 years and was incredibly expensive. 

Quaise hopes to speed up drilling and cut its cost, Houde says. The company's goal is to drill through rock at a rate of between three and five meters per hour of steady operation.

One key factor slowing down many operations that drill through hard rocks like granite is nonproductive time. For example, equipment frequently needs to be brought all the way back up to the surface for repairs or to replace drill bits.

Quaise's key to potentially changing that is its gyrotron. The device emits millimeter waves, beams of energy with wavelengths that fall between microwaves and infrared waves. It's a bit like a laser, but the beam is not visible to the human eye. 

Quaise's goal is to heat up the target rock, effectively drilling it away. The gyrotron beams waves at a target rock via a waveguide, a hollow metal tube that directs the energy to the right spot. (One of the company's main technological challenges is to avoid accidentally making plasma, an ionized, superheated state of matter, as it can waste energy and damage key equipment like the waveguide.)

Here's how it works in practice: When Quaise's rig is drilling a hole, the tip of the waveguide is positioned a foot or so away from the rock it's targeting. The gyrotron lets out a burst of millimeter waves for about a minute. They travel down the waveguide and hit the target rock, which heats up and then cracks, melts, or even vaporizes.

Then the beam stops, and the drill bit at the end of the waveguide is lowered to the surface of the rock, rotating and scraping off broken shards and melted bits of rock as it descends. A steady blast of air carries the debris up to the surface, and the process repeats. The energy in the millimeter waves does the hard work, and the scraping and compressed air help remove the fractured or melted material away.

This system is what I saw in action at the company's Houston headquarters. The drilling rig in the yard is a small setup, something like what a construction company might use to drill micro piles for a foundation or what researchers would use to take geological samples. In total, the gyrotron has a power of 100 kilowatts. A cooling system helps the superconducting magnet in the gyrotron reach the necessary temperature (about -200 °C), and a filtration system catches the debris that sloughs off samples. 

Soon after my visit, this backyard setup was packed up and shipped to central Texas to be used for further field testing in a rock quarry. The company announced in July that it had used that rig to drill a 100-meter-deep hole at that field test site. 

Quaise isn't the first to develop nonmechanical drilling, says Roland Horne, head of the geothermal program at Stanford University. “Burning holes in rocks is impressive. However, that's not the whole of what's involved in drilling,” he says. The operation will need to be able to survive the high temperatures and pressures at the bottom of wells as they're drilled, he says.

So far, the company has found success drilling holes into columns of rock inside metal casings, as well as the quarry in its field trials. But there's a long road between drilling into predictable material in a relatively predictable environment and creating a miles-deep geothermal well. 

In April, Quaise fully integrated its second 100-kilowatt gyrotron onto an oil and gas rig owned by the company's investor and technology partner Nabors. This rig is the sort that would typically be used for training or engineering development, and it's set up along with a row of other rigs at the Nabors headquarters, just across town from the Quaise lab. At 182 feet high, the top is visible above the office building from the parking lot.

When I visited in April, the company was still completing initial tests, using special thermal paper and firing short blasts to test the setup. In May the company tested this integrated rig, drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 30 feet deep. Another test in June reached a depth of 40 feet. These holes were drilled into columns of basalt that had been lowered into the ground as a test material.

While the company tests its 100-kilowatt systems at the rig and the quarry, the next step is an even larger system, which features a gyrotron that's 10 times more powerful. This one-megawatt system will drill larger holes, over eight inches across, and represents the commercial-scale version of the company's technology. Drilling tests are set to begin with this larger drill in 2026. 

The one-megawatt system actually needs a little over three megawatts of power overall, including the energy needed to run support equipment like cooling systems and the compressor that blows air into the hole, carrying the rock dust back up to the surface. That power demand is similar to what an oil and gas rig requires today. 

Quaise is in the process of setting up a pilot plant in Oregon, basically on the side of a volcano, says Trenton Cladouhos, the company's vice president of geothermal resource development. This project will use conventional drilling, and its main purpose is to show that Quaise can build and run a geothermal plant, Cladouhos says. 

The company is building an exploration well this year and plans to begin drilling production wells (those that can eventually be used to generate electricity) in 2026. That pilot project will reach about 20 megawatts of power with the first few wells, operating on rock that's around 350 °C. The company plans to have it operational as early as 2028.

Quaise's strategy with the Oregon project is to show that it can use super-hot rocks to produce geothermal power efficiently, says CEO Carlos Araque. After it fires up the plant and begins producing electricity, the company can go back in and deepen the holes with millimeter-wave drilling in the future, he adds.

Araque says the company already has some customers lined up for the energy it'll produce, though he declined to name them, saying only that one was a big tech company, and there's a utility involved as well.

But the startup will need more capital to finish this project and complete its testing with the larger, one-megawatt gyrotron. And uncertainty is floating around in climate tech, given the Trump administration's tariffs and rollback of financial support for climate tech (though geothermal has been relatively unscathed). 

Quaise still has some technical barriers to overcome before it begins building commercial power plants. 

One potential hurdle: drilling in different directions. Right now, millimeter-wave drilling can go in a straight line, straight down. Developing a geothermal plant like the one at the Oregon site will likely require what's called directional drilling, the ability to drill in directions other than vertical.

And the company will likely face challenges as it transitions from lab testing to field trials. One key challenge for geothermal technology companies attempting to operate at this depth will be  keeping wells functional for a long time to keep a power plant operating, says Jefferson Tester, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in geothermal energy.

Quaise's technology is very aspirational, Tester says, and it can be difficult for new ideas in geothermal to compete economically. “It's eventually all about cost,” he says. And companies with ambitious ideas run the risk that their investors will run out of patience before they can develop their technology enough to make it onto the grid.

“There's a lot more to learn—I mean, we're reinventing drilling,” says Steve Jeske, a project manager at Quaise. “It seems like it shouldn't work, but it does.” 

The tech giant just signed a deal to buy fusion power. Meanwhile, company emissions are up 50% since 2019.

Tens of millions of dollars in NSF grants have been slashed, and scientists fear the US is about to lose a generation of climate researchers.

Ah, yes, the American dream. A house with a white picket fence, a dog, and as many products as you can pile into a pickup truck that you paid for in cash, which I'm told is a type of green paper you can exchange for goods and services. Sounds nice; sounds normal; sounds totally and completely out of reach.

The classic American dream may be dead, but at least we have the Internet of Things and the never-ending font of smart home products it's given rise to, right? I say that with my tongue ready to burst through my cheek like a post-gestation alien from Alien, but to be honest, I love my makeshift smart home. It makes me and my multitask-addled brain happy, because who has time for light switches and buttons? Certainly not I—I barely have time for paying my rent. Sorry, landlord, I simply don't have enough bandwidth today!

If you're like me, which is to say a debt-drowning millennial who will probably never own walls and a roof outright, and you still want to have a smart home that feels functional, I'm (at the very least) pleased to inform you that this particular feat is actually doable. In fact, I know it's doable because I've done it, and as one disillusioned American adult to another, I'm going to tell you how to build your own, too.

The first thing you'll need before you start smartening up your rented dwelling is a way to scream at all your gadgets. That means, if you don't already have one, you'll need a smart speaker. I personally use a 2nd-gen Google Nest Mini, and for a couple of reasons. I'm not going to lie, the number one reason is that I got one for free through Spotify, which ran a promotion back in 2019 for subscribers to its premium plan. The promotion has since ended, but the good news is that if you want to grab one yourself, you can scoop one up for as little as $30. Here's the deal with these speakers: they suck for playing music because they're frankly not built for that, but they do exactly what they need to in a smart home, which is to say, they understand commands poorly (all voice assistants suck, sorry).

One advantage that I think Google has over an Amazon Echo speaker with Alexa, for example, is its Google Home app, which feels a lot more streamlined for quick smart home control compared to Amazon's Alexa app. I also think that Google Assistant is slightly better at understanding commands, but to be honest, that's like trying to decide which apple you'd rather pull from the compost and take a bite of.

Either way, you'll need to make a choice here, because if you should want to expand the number of speakers in your apartment ever, you're not going to want to buy another speaker to replace the one you already have or, God forbid, live in a mixed Alexa and Google Assistant household. And once you make that choice, it's time to move on to the next most important facet of any smart apartment.

I have absolutely no chill when it comes to lighting. I mean that both figuratively, in that I am authoritarian about the type of lights I use in my apartment, and also in a more literal sense, in that I hate cool lighting—warm only for me. As a result of that quirk, I have a lot of lamps in my 500-square-foot apartment. I have five, to be exact, but two of those contain three bulbs, and one of them contains two, so that's a grand total of 10 light bulbs in one small apartment, just from lamps.

As you might imagine, the smart lighting situation gets tricky pretty fast, but there are a few things you can do to make things less expensive and a little more manageable from a setup perspective. First, you can start by buying cheaper smart bulbs for the lamps that need them. Smart bulbs aren't necessary all of the time (I'll get into that in a moment), but they do offer some advantages, particularly the ability to dim or brighten them as needed. This is huge if you're as specific as me about lighting in your apartment. Brightness is also a feature that you do not have to shell out for the Philips Hue premium to attain.

My apartment is stocked almost entirely with Wyze smart home lighting, and though they haven't always been the most consistent bulbs (they require quite a few firmware updates throughout the year), but they are mostly solid for doing anything you'd want smart bulbs to do. They change color, they connect to Google Home, and they come in packs of four for $44. If you don't want Wyze bulbs, Govee also makes affordable smart bulbs that will do the trick.

The key here isn't just to have smart lighting, but also to label and assign all of your lamps correctly inside your chosen smart home app. In my case, that's the Google Home app, where you can connect all your devices and pair them with your smart speaker. To add a new device in the Google Home app all you need to do is navigate to the “Device” tab at the bottom of the app and then tap “Add” in the bottom-right corner. The app will ask what kind of device you want to add, where you want to add it, and then it should automatically look for devices on the same Wi-Fi network and prompt you to set it up (make sure your device is in the proper setup mode before you do that).

Loading those bulbs in isn't enough, though. You should also label everything appropriately, so when you want to yell at your speaker to turn something off, you're not just shouting “Light 4.” Consider “bedroom lamp,” or if you have more than one lamp in your bedroom, “nightstand lamp,” and “corner lamp.” Once you have everything labeled appropriately, you should also create groups so that you can turn swaths of lights on and off. I have my lights divided into “bedroom” and “living room,” so when I say, “turn the living room lights on,” my Google speaker knows what I mean.

To create a speaker group:

Once you have your lights and other devices in the Google Home app and have everything labeled, it's time to start thinking about expanding your apartment.

There's a secret to smart homes, and it's not always about buying smart products, per se. You can actually make dumb stuff smart with one very cheap gadget: smart outlets. Smart outlets, as the name suggests, are just plugs that you can connect to the internet and turn on/off at will. They obviously won't give a feature set beyond just on or off, but sometimes that's all you need. I've used smart outlets extensively in my makeshift smart apartment for all kinds of stuff.

If you have a nice lamp, for example, that doesn't take the type of bulb that comes in a smart variety (like a candelabra bulb), but you don't want to screw around turning it off and on manually all the time, try a smart outlet. These are especially great if you're gauche like me and still like to use cheap string lights around Christmas time and don't want to plug them in and take them out constantly. It's a game-changer if you celebrate Christmas with a tree, too, since being able to turn your tree on and off with a voice command is incredibly simple.

It's not just lights, though. You can also apply the same strategy to appliances. Before I got a window AC unit from July (more on that in a bit), I had a regular old dumb AC unit that needed to be turned off and on manually. It's not the biggest labor in the world having to press a button, but being able to use a voice command without getting your lazy, overheated ass up off the couch feels like a big perk when you actually have the ability.

Think of smart outlets as your way of filling in the gaps. The best part is you can get them cheaply on Amazon. This set from Amazon gives you four plugs for just $25. I own several similar smart plugs from a nondescript brand that I assume is based in China, and they work surprisingly well. Just make sure whichever product you pick is compatible with the platform you've chosen—in my case, Google. You may also have to download a separate app for setup purposes when you buy brands like this, so just keep that in mind. With anything you connect to the internet, there is inherently a security risk, so please keep that in mind also. If you're extra cautious about digital privacy and security, smart home life may not be the life for you, since every app, gadget, and online service you plug your information into opens up another avenue to having your data stolen. That's the tradeoff you have to make to be a lazy human in 2025.

There are obviously a lot of gadgets out there in the smart home world that are great for people with houses—thermostats, fridges, ovens, security cameras, and more. But if you live in an apartment like me you may not be able to take advantage of those. Or most of those, I should say. There are some appliances that you should consider, though, like a Wi-Fi-enabled AC unit. I own one from July, a millennial-friendly window unit that doesn't look like total shit, and being able to connect the AC to the Google Home app has been a game-changer.

One perk of having your AC unit connected to the internet is that you can turn if off or on remotely. When it's ridiculously hot out, I like to get my AC pumping before I get home from work so that it's actually cool in my apartment before I arrive. It's also great if you're away on vacation and you have a pet at home that you're worried about. Just pull open the July app and toggle your unit on. You can even select settings in the app like fan speed, temperature, and modes. Naturally, since it's Google-compatible, you can also activate the AC using your smart speaker, which is great in the morning when I want to lazily turn off my AC from bed.

Another worthy category of your smart home experience is entertainment. Most TVs nowadays are smart home-ready, so be sure to check if your particular panel can connect to the platform you've chosen. Using voice commands to turn your TV on or off or change the volume isn't necessary, but it can be handy in a pinch, like when your cat accidentally lies on the remote while you're trying to sleep and you don't feel like getting out of bed to turn it back off (a true story).

I also own a Chromecast streaming stick that I have plugged into a small TV in my bedroom. Since it's a Google product, it's naturally very compatible with the Google Home app and my Google smart speaker, so when I'm ready to go to bed, I can shout at the Google Assistant to “stop casting” instead of whipping out my phone and disconnecting the stream from whatever app I'm using. You can also control volume with voice commands, but that feels maybe a little more annoying than using your phone as a remote.

As a bonus gadget, you can also consider installing smart blinds from companies like Ikea, which are compatible with both Google Assistant and Alexa. These need some minor installation unlike the other things I've recommended, but they're only mildly invasive, which is to say you probably won't have your security deposit withheld for tossing them up. My parents have their entire house set up with smart blinds, and I've been pretty impressed with how convenient it is to use voice controls to raise and lower them.

So those are my tips for giving yourself a smart home without breaking the bank or buying a $3,500 fridge. These gadgets obviously aren't going to give your apartment the highest IQ out there in the world of smart homes, but it's not going to flunk out of summer school, either. As a recap, here are the most important things you can do:

An offline image generator for XDNA 2 NPUs.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


AMD, in collaboration with Stability AI, has unveiled the industry's first Stable Diffusion 3.0 Medium AI model tailored for the company's XDNA 2 NPUs which process data in the BF16 format. The model is designed to run locally on laptops based on AMD's Ryzen AI laptops and is available now via Amuse 3.1.

The model is a text-to-image generator based on Stable Diffusion 3.0 Medium, which is optimized for BF16 precision and designed to run locally on machines with XDNA 2 NPUs. The model is suitable for generating customizable stock-quality visuals, which can be branded or tailored for design and marketing applications. The model interprets written prompts and produces 1024×1024 images, then uses a built-in NPU pipeline to upscale them to 2048×2048 resolution, resulting in 4MP outputs, which AMD claims are suitable for print and professional use.

The model requires a PC equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series or Ryzen AI MAX+ processor, an XDNA 2 NPU capable of at least 50 TOPS, and a minimum of 24GB of system RAM, as the model alone uses 9GB during generation.

The key advantage of the model is, of course, that it runs entirely on-device; the model enables fast, offline image generation without needing Internet access or cloud services. The model is aimed at content creators and designers who need customizable images and supports advanced prompting features for fine control over image composition. AMD even provides examples. A prompt to draw a toucan looks as follows:

"Close up, award-winning wildlife photography, vibrant and exotic face of a toucan against a black background, focusing on the colorful beak, vibrant color, best shot, 8k, photography, high res."

To use the model, users must install the latest AMD Adrenalin Edition drivers and the Amuse 3.1 Beta software from Tensorstack. Once installed, users should open Amuse, switch to EZ Mode, move the slider to HQ, and enable the 'XDNA 2 Stable Diffusion Offload' option.

Usage of the model is subject to the Stability AI Community License. The model is free for individuals and small businesses with less than $1 million in annual revenue, though licensing terms may change eventually. Keep in mind that Amuse is still in beta, so its stability or performance may vary.

A team of astronomers have discovered a curious figure in the universe. It is two distant galaxies colliding with each other to form a larger structure. From Earth's perspective, the junction of the disks resembles the number eight lying down, similar to the infinity symbol (∞).

Because of this resemblance, the researchers—who are based at the universities of Yale and Copenhagen—have nicknamed it the “Infinity Galaxy” and have detailed their discovery in a paper published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. Beyond its evocative shape, the structure intrigues the scientists because of its contents: Within it could be the first direct evidence of a newly formed primordial supermassive black hole.

The images were taken through the James Webb Space Telescope and then enriched with information from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the most powerful X-ray telescope ever created. Light from this galaxy comes from a time when the universe was only 470 million years old—roughly 13.5 billion years ago. In the dual galaxy's structure, at least two consolidated black holes can be observed, each centered in a respective disk (the yellow points in the image below), and a region of compressed gas at the point of intersection suggests the presence of a supermassive object (the green point).

The Infinity Galaxy, with three points marked where there could be black holes.

The scientists think they might have viewed signs of a direct collapse black hole. Typically, black holes are formed when stars run out of fuel and collapse under their own gravity, but there's an alternative formation phenomenon debated in astrophysics—where a black hole forms via the collapse of gigantic gas cloud, without a star having formed. Such a possibility has been theorized, but this type of black hole has yet to be observed.

The largest black holes found in the universe, supermassive black holes, have been identified in galaxies that formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. But what made their formation possible is not yet fully understood. Many supermassive black holes are believed to have come into being as a result of smaller black holes merging. But with very old supermassive black holes, there does not seem to have been enough time for the first stars in the universe to evolve, collapse into stellar-mass black holes, and then merge to colossal, supermassive sizes.

So some astronomers have proposed an alternative origin for the universe's first supermassive black holes. According to this hypothesis, the black holes would not need to form from a star or arise from mergers. Instead, the theory goes, dense clumps of matter that in other instances gave rise to galaxies could have compressed directly into massive black holes. Scientists are currently investigating this scenario, although conclusive evidence of this having happened is still lacking.

It is possible that the Infinity Galaxy offers revealing clues about the possibility of this second formation pathway. “During the collision, the gas within these two galaxies shocks and compresses. This compression might just be enough to form a dense knot, which then collapsed into a black hole,” Pieter van Dokkum, a professor of astronomy and physics at Yale and a coauthor on the paper, said in a post on his university's website. “While such collisions are rare events, similarly extreme gas densities are thought to have been quite common in the earliest cosmic epochs, when galaxies began to form,” Van Dokkum added.

Scientists are also considering other, less spectacular alternatives as to what's going on in the Infinity Galaxy. Rather than being created through a direct collapse of gas, that potential extra black hole—the green spot in the image above—could instead be the signs of a black hole ejected from another galaxy as “Infinity” passes through it. Another possible scenario is that this image actually shows the collision of three galaxies, with the third eclipsed by the other larger ones.

For the moment, the team says the preliminary results are exciting. “We can't say definitively that we have found a direct collapse black hole. But we can say that these new data strengthen the case that we're seeing a newborn black hole, while eliminating some of the competing explanations,” Van Dokkum concluded in a blog for NASA.

Targets AI and hyperscalers.

Kioxia has introduced a solid-state drive with an unprecedented storage capacity of 245.76TB, currently the highest-capacity storage device available. The company positions its LC9 drive for applications that benefit from maximum storage density, such as AI training and hyperscale workloads. Remarkably, the company has managed to cram 8TB of storage capacity into a single NAND package —a record that enables the construction of such a hefty SSD using multiple ultra-high-capacity packages. To give some perspective on the sheer amount of storage, assuming a heavily compressed 20GB size for a 4K movie, the Kioxia drive could store an astounding 12,500 movies per device.

The Kioxia LC9 is based on an unknown proprietary NVMe 2.0-compliant controller with a PCIe 5.0 x4 interface (with dual-port capability) as well as Kioxia's BiCS8 2Tb 3D QLC NAND memory devices. To enable a 245.76TB capacity in an E3.L form-factor, Kioxia had to package 32 memory devices into a single chip (8TB of storage space) and then attach those chips to the controller. This packaging sets a new record for density and uses the company's proprietary methods for wafer processing and assembly, according to Kioxia.



Performance-wise, the drive delivers sequential read speeds of up to 12 GB/s and write speeds of up to 3 GB/s. This isn't the highest performance for an enterprise PCIe 5.0 SSD, but there's an obvious tradeoff between capacity and performance. At the end of the day, ensuring signal integrity in a 32-Hi 3D NAND package is a big deal, so it is not surprising that it is achieved by sacrificing interface speed.

For random operations, the SSD achieves up to 1.3 million IOPS for reads and 50,000 IOPS for writes, which is again not particularly impressive, but the LC9 is clearly designed for capacity rather than performance.

As for endurance, the Kioxia L9 drives are rated at 0.3 drive writes per day (DWPD), which again reflects a balance between capacity and longevity for data center usage patterns.



The product incorporates multiple features to improve reliability and protect data, including die-level recovery, parity-based error management, and safeguards against sudden power loss. It also includes support for Flexible Data Placement, which reduces internal write amplification and extends the usable lifespan, especially in database-driven applications.

Security options include encryption and firmware signing compliant with CNSA 2.0 standards. The drive supports multiple encryption modes, including AES-256 encryption and algorithms prepared for post-quantum cryptography.

Kioxia plans to offer its L9 drives in multiple form factors, including a 2.5-inch U.2 (up to 122.88TB), E3.S (up to 122.88TB), and E.3L (up to 245.76TB). The company did not disclose pricing of these drives as they will be sold primarily to large hyperscale data center companies, and exact quotes will depend on volumes and other factors.

The LC9 series is currently being sampled to select partners and will be featured at the Future of Memory and Storage conference in August 2025.

Anthropic is planning to seek investment from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, according to a Slack message CEO Dario Amodei sent to staff Sunday morning, which WIRED obtained.

Weighing the pros and cons, Amodei acknowledged in his note that accepting money from Middle East leaders would likely enrich “dictators.” “This is a real downside and I'm not thrilled about it,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, I think ‘No bad person should ever benefit from our success' is a pretty difficult principle to run a business on.”

The message comes as AI companies race to secure the massive amounts of capital required to train and develop frontier AI models. In January, OpenAI announced a $500 billion data center project called Stargate with financial backing from MGX, a state-owned Emirati investment firm. Four months later, the company announced it was planning to build a data center in Abu Dhabi, as part of a push to help foreign governments “build sovereign AI capability in coordination with the US.”

“As an American company at the frontier of AI development, we have always believed the supply chain of frontier AI model development should be on American soil in order to maintain America's lead,” said Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty in a statement. “As Dario has said before, we believe fundamentally in sharing the benefits of AI and serve the Middle East and regions around the world commercially, in line with our Usage Policy.”

In May, President Donald Trump toured the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as part of a four-day trip focused on economic investments. A cabal of tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, joined him for a meeting with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. Anthropic's leadership was notably absent.

In his memo, Amodei acknowledged that the decision to pursue investments from authoritarian regimes would lead to accusations of hypocrisy. In an essay titled “Machines of Loving Grace,” Amodei wrote: “Democracies need to be able to set the terms by which powerful AI is brought into the world, both to avoid being overpowered by authoritarians and to prevent human rights abuses within authoritarian countries.”

In 2024, Anthropic decided not to accept money from Saudi Arabia, citing national security concerns, per CNBC. The news came as FTX, the failed cryptocurrency exchange, went into bankruptcy proceedings, and its nearly 8 percent stake in Anthropic went up for sale. Ultimately, a majority of those shares went to ATIC Third International Investment, a UAE firm. At the time, the stake was worth about $500 million.

Now, it appears Anthropic is poised to accept Gulf State money—though the company hasn't said whether it has changed its stance on Saudi Arabia in particular. “There is a truly giant amount of capital in the Middle East, easily $100B or more,” Amodei wrote in the memo. “If we want to stay on the frontier, we gain a very large benefit from having access to this capital. Without it, it is substantially harder to stay on the frontier.”

By pursuing a “narrowly scoped, purely financial investment from Gulf countries,” the company hopes to avoid the risks associated with allowing outside investors to gain “leverage” over the company, the memo says.

“The basis of our opposition to large training clusters in the Middle East, or to shipping H20's to China, is that the ‘supply chain' of Al is dangerous to hand to authoritarian governments—since Al is likely to be the most powerful technology in the world, these governments can use it to gain military dominance or to gain leverage over democratic countries,” Amodei wrote in the memo, referring to Nvidia chips.

Still, the CEO admitted investors could gain “soft power” through the promise of future funding. “The implicit promise of investing in future rounds can create a situation where they have some soft power, making it a bit harder to resist these things in the future. In fact, I actually am worried that getting the largest possible amounts of investment might be difficult without agreeing to some of these other things,” Amodei writes. “But l think the right response to this is simply to see how much we can get without agreeing to these things (which I think are likely still many billions), and then hold firm if they ask.”

In a section titled “Erosion of Standards,” Amodei notes that the reason Anthropic “vociferously pushed for not allowing big data centers in the Middle East” was because “without a central authority blocking them, there's a race to the bottom where companies gain a lot of advantage by getting deeper and deeper in bed with the Middle East.”

“Unfortunately, having failed to prevent that dynamic at the collective level, we're now stuck with it as an individual company, and the median position across the other companies appears to be ‘outsourcing our largest 5 GW training runs to UAE/Saudi is fine,'” the CEO said, likely referring to the United States' agreement to build a new AI data center in the UAE powered by 5 gigawatts of electricity. “That puts us at a significant disadvantage, and we need to look for ways to make up some of that disadvantage while remaining less objectionable. I really wish we weren't in this position, but we are.”

In a section titled “Comms Headaches,” the CEO acknowledged that taking investment from Gulf States would likely lead to public criticism. The “media / Twitter / the outside world” is “always looking for hypocrisy, while also being very stupid and therefore having a poor understanding of substantive issues,” Amodei wrote. He added: “It's perfectly consistent to advocate for a policy of ‘No one is allowed to do x,' but then if that policy fails and everyone else does X, to reluctantly do x ourselves.”

“We are also interested in serving the region commercially, which is something I think is actually pure positive as long as we don't build data centers there and as long as we enforce our [acceptable use policy],” he added. “In fact, it could have important benefits for the world including improving human health, aiding economic development, etc.”

He concluded: “As with many decisions, this one has downsides, but we believe it's the right one overall.”

Precancerous cells must adapt to and overcome cellular stress and inflammation in order to progress and form malignant tumors. Now, researchers at University of California San Diego School of Medicine have identified a link between stress and inflammation and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most aggressive and lethal types of cancer. The findings could serve as an early warning system for the disease, leading to the detection of PDAC before it becomes life-threatening.

Previous studies have shown that inflammation and cellular stress activate a protein called STAT3 - short for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 - in pancreas cells, promoting tumor initiation, adaptation to stress and resistance to treatment. How STAT3 accomplishes this has not been understood until now.

In the current study, the researchers discovered that in some cancer cells, STAT3 is able to activate specific genes critical for adaptation to stress and inflammation. They found:

The researchers believe the findings can be applied to precision medicine, developing early screening tools that recognize precancerous cells. It could also help clinicians and identify which patients are more likely to develop aggressive cancers and which ones will respond better to traditional pancreatic cancer treatment as the disease progresses to later stages, according to senior author of the study, David Cheresh, Ph.D., distinguished professor and vice chair for research and development in the Department of Pathology at UC San Diego School of Medicine and a member of UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center.

They are also beginning to explore molecules that block inflammation from activating ITGB3 in pancreatic cancer as well as other cancers that affect the surface of tissues, including lung, breast and skin cancers in order to prevent tumors from progressing, spreading and becoming resistant to drug therapies.

Cells called astrocytes are about as abundant in the brain as neurons, but scientists have spent much less time figuring out how they contribute to brain functions. A novel study by MIT researchers at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory shows that one function appears to be maintaining the chemical conditions necessary for groups of neurons to team up to encode information.

Specifically, the neuroscientists showed that when they knocked out the ability of astrocytes in the visual cortex of mice to produce a protein called "GABA transporter 3 (Gat3)," neurons there became less able as a group to represent information about the movies lab mice were seeing. GABA is a common inhibitory neurotransmitter that sharpens neural activity and astrocytes uniquely use Gat3 to regulate the ambient level of GABA in their area. In the study in eLife, knocking out Gat3 in the visual cortex left neurons stewing in a soup of excess GABA that only produced subtle effects on individual neurons, but nevertheless added up to a significant impairment on their efforts as an ensemble responsible for visual function.

Even if the changes at the level of a single neuron representing a visual stimulus do not change significantly, if a hundred neurons have some small changes, that could add up at the population level to a measurable, significant change."

Mriganka Sur, Senior Author, Paul and Lilah Newton Professor in The Picower Institute and MIT's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS)

Notably, the authors wrote in eLife, this is the first study in live mice of Gat3 at scales spanning individual cells and functional ensembles of hundreds of them.

To make the discovery, BCS graduate student Jiho Park used a novel implementation of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to knock out Gat3 combined with statistical and computational analyses of neural activity at the population level, Sur said.

As neuroscientists have studied the brain's visual system over many decades, neurons have claimed most of their attention because they are electrically active and more easily targeted genetically, Sur said. Technology for tracking astrocyte activity and for manipulating their function hasn't developed as quickly. But in 2019, the National Institutes of Health gave Sur a grant to develop better tools for studying astrocytes. That funding helped the lab create the variant of CRISPR/Cas9 they call MRCUTS that enabled the new study. The tool allowed them to use just one viral vector to target the gene that encodes Gat3 for multiple cuts. That multiplexed attack decisively and precisely knocked it out in visual cortex astrocytes.

Once Park knocked out Gat3, she could see the effects of its absence by visually tracking the calcium activity of neurons, a proxy for their electrical activity. The consequences were more subtle than the team expected. Awash in GABA, neurons fired less robustly and less reliably. When the mice were watching only a gray screen, instead of movies, the neurons would spontaneously activate less often, too.

But to the researchers' surprise, when Gat3 was gone the neurons individually still did their jobs. Cells that in the presence of Gat3 were responsive to different features of the images the mice were seeing, such as the orientation of lines, remained responsive even after Gat3 was knocked out. Though ambient levels of GABA were higher, pairs of neurons still shared GABA through their direct connections, or "synapses," as before, meaning their direct dialogue with each other didn't change.

"We were expecting to see changes in orientation tuning among other things, but we didn't see that," Park said. "That's why we looked into deeper levels of analysis to see if there's any difference."

That deeper analysis occurred at the level of broader neural ensembles, where Park used several statistical and computational methods to analyze how the collective information encoding by hundreds of neurons changed when Gat3 was knocked out.

Using a statistical method called a "Generalized Linear Model" to analyze patterns of activity across the ensemble, Park discovered that when Gat3 was knocked out, the activity of neurons became less predictive of the activity of others in the group compared to when Gat3 was present. This indicated that while individual neurons might still be doing what they were supposed to, their coordination was impaired. Meanwhile using a "Support Vector Machine"-based decoder to discern the information that ensembles were representing, she found that when Gat3 was present the decoder could improve its assessment as more neurons were added to its sample. But when Gat3 was knocked out, the decoder could no longer ascertain the represented information even as its sample size increased.

"The decoding deficits following Gat3 ablation provide evidence that astrocytic regulation of ambient GABA is essential for organizing the coordinated neuronal activity patterns necessary for efficient information encoding in visual cortical networks," the authors wrote in eLife.

The finding that a lack of Gat3 disrupts neural coordination at the population level might help explain clinical observations that Gat3 reduction in the thalamus increases seizure risk, Gat3 increase in the striatum contribute to repetitive behaviors, and Gat3 reduction in the globus pallidus impairs motor coordination, Park said.

"Because our study is the first to look at Gat3 effects on a population level, it might help tie that back to some of the behavioral phenotypes people have been seeing," Park said. But more research is needed, Sur noted, because there are other Gat proteins, such as Gat1, that the brain might use to compensate.

In addition to Park and Sur, the paper's other authors are Grayson Sipe, Xin Tang, Prachi Ojha, Giselle Fernandes, Yi Ning Leow, Caroline Zhang, Yuma Osako, Arundhati Natesan, Gabrielle Drummond and Rudolf Jaenisch.

The National Institutes of Health, a MURI Grant, The Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, the Freedom Together Foundation and The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory provided funding for the study.

A new study by NYU Langone Health researchers found that the shutdown of a significant fossil fuel pollution source near Pittsburgh, PA, resulted in immediate improvements in respiratory health. The study is available online starting July 22 in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, a journal of the American Thoracic Society.

Assessing data from nearby local and federal air quality monitors, the researchers tracked the air pollution health effects on residents near the Shenango plant before and after its closure in 2016.

Results showed that within the first few weeks after the plant's closure in January 2016, respiratory related emergency visits decreased by about 20 percent. In the first month of the closure, pediatric asthma visits declined by 41 percent, and continued to fall by 4 percent each month through the end of the study period.

These findings indicate that reductions in fossil-fuel related air pollution are linked to both short and long-term lung health benefits, the researchers say.

The adverse reductions in respiratory health effects were much greater than expected, based on past studies of general air pollution in the U.S., indicating that emissions from such fossil fuel related sources are especially toxic."

George Thurston, ScD., study senior author 

Dr. Thurston is a professor in the Departments of Medicine and Population Health at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a member of the American Thoracic Society.

"This study provides rare, in-the-field evidence that the closure of a major industrial pollution source can lead to immediate and lasting improvements in the lung health of the those who live nearby," added the article's first author, Wuyue Yu, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. "By tracking health outcomes before and after the coke plant closure, we were able to isolate the effects of reduced air pollution and observe that cleaner air translates into fewer respiratory emergency visits and hospitalizations."

In a comprehensive Genomic Press interview published in Brain Medicine today, Dr. Hamilton Se-Hwee Oh reveals groundbreaking insights into the complex dialogue between our brains and bodies that fundamentally shapes aging, depression, and neurodegenerative disease. Working at Mount Sinai's prestigious Brain-Body Institute and Ronald M. Loeb Center for Alzheimer's Disease in New York City, Dr. Oh bridges multiple scientific disciplines to decode mechanisms that could transform treatment approaches for millions suffering from neuropsychiatric disorders.

The concept of "sonder" first sparked Dr. Oh's fascination with biology during high school. This profound realization that every person experiences life as vividly and complexly as our own led him to marvel at how trillions of cells coordinate to create rich emotional and subjective experiences. His scientific path gained urgency through personal experience when diagnosed with a rare chronic kidney disease and witnessing his best friend develop persistent, unexplained abdominal pain.

"I hoped that by studying the intricate inner workings of life, I might one day contribute to curing the kinds of conditions that cause such deep and often invisible suffering," Dr. Oh explains in the interview. This personal motivation drives his current research examining how immune cells and metabolic organs amplify or dampen mood symptoms.

During his Stanford PhD under Dr. Tony Wyss-Coray, Dr. Oh achieved remarkable breakthroughs that reshaped scientific understanding of human aging. His research demonstrated that human organs age at dramatically different rates, with profound implications for disease susceptibility. These findings, published in three first-authored papers in Nature and Nature Medicine, reveal why some individuals develop heart disease while others face neurodegeneration despite similar chronological ages.

Perhaps most significantly, Dr. Oh identified cerebrospinal fluid synaptic biomarkers capable of predicting Alzheimer's dementia onset years before clinical symptoms manifest. This discovery opens possibilities for early intervention strategies that could alter disease trajectories. How might healthcare systems adapt if we could identify Alzheimer's risk decades before symptoms appear?

Dr. Oh's current research at Mount Sinai investigates bidirectional communication between the brain and peripheral organs under the mentorship of Drs. Scott Russo and Alison Goate. His work reveals that depression involves far more than brain chemistry alone. By integrating large-scale human proteomics, single-cell transcriptomics, and mechanistic animal models, he demonstrates how psychological stress accelerates organ aging while peripheral molecular signals rewire neural circuits affecting mood and cognition.

This multidisciplinary approach positions Dr. Oh at the forefront of precision medicine development. His research examines molecular fingerprints of interventions including exercise and ketamine therapy, seeking to understand why certain treatments work for specific individuals while failing for others. Could peripheral blood markers eventually guide personalized depression treatment selection?

Dr. Oh's scientific evolution reflects broader shifts in biomedical research. Initially drawn to stem cell research at UCLA for its regenerative potential, he noticed inflammation appearing across diverse diseases from cancer to heart disease. This observation led him to study hematopoietic stem cells in Dr. Hanna Mikkola's laboratory, investigating how transcription factors regulate immune system development.

His transition to studying brain-immune interactions emerged from recognizing that external environmental cues profoundly influence cellular identity and function. This systems-level perspective now guides his investigation of how metabolic organs and immune cells shape emotional states and cognitive function. What other unexpected organ systems might influence brain health in ways science has yet to discover?

The implications of Dr. Oh's research extend beyond academic discovery. By revealing how specific proteins and metabolites track with depressive behavior, his work identifies novel therapeutic targets. Understanding differential organ aging patterns could enable interventions targeting root causes rather than symptoms alone. His research on exercise and ketamine's molecular mechanisms provides frameworks for developing next-generation treatments.

Major depressive disorder affects multiple body systems, yet current treatments primarily target brain neurotransmitters. Dr. Oh's findings suggest that effective therapies might need to address peripheral inflammation, metabolic dysfunction, and organ-specific aging processes. How might psychiatric care transform if clinicians routinely assessed organ aging profiles alongside traditional mental health evaluations?

Beyond his research contributions, Dr. Oh advocates for transforming scientific funding priorities. He notes that while scientists celebrate unconventional thinking and groundbreaking discoveries, funding agencies often favor incremental research with substantial preliminary data. This disconnect may limit transformative discoveries that require high-risk exploration.

Dr. Oh particularly values academic freedom to pursue unexpected leads and develop new skills, even when this temporarily reduces productivity. His career trajectory from stem cell biology to computational aging biology exemplifies how interdisciplinary exploration can yield unexpected breakthroughs. What revolutionary discoveries might emerge if funding structures better supported exploratory research?

Dr. Hamilton Se-Hwee Oh's Genomic Press interview is part of a larger series called Innovators & Ideas that highlights the people behind today's most influential scientific breakthroughs. Each interview in the series offers a blend of cutting-edge research and personal reflections, providing readers with a comprehensive view of the scientists shaping the future. By combining a focus on professional achievements with personal insights, this interview style invites a richer narrative that both engages and educates readers. This format provides an ideal starting point for profiles that explore the scientist's impact on the field, while also touching on broader human themes.

Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is a severe haemorrhagic fever virus transmitted by tick to animal and humans. Discovered in 2009, the virus is found in South-East Asian countries and has a fatality rate of up to 40%. By studying the virus in tick cells, scientist from the University of Surrey have identified two novel antivirals effectors. This discovery could help scientists prevent diseases from spreading from tick to humans in the future.

The study, published in Nature Communications, analyzed Rhipicephalus microplus tick cells, common carriers of SFTSV, using advanced multi-data analysis to unravel the ticks' cellular responses to the virus.

The researchers pinpointed how two RNA helicases, essential proteins found in all forms of life, were critical in reducing SFTSV's replication within the ticks. The two RNA helicases, UPF1 and DHX9, were in fact found to interfere with the virus' ability to copy itself, essentially putting a wrench in its reproductive cycle.

Understanding how ticks tolerate these viruses is key for developing vector control strategies and to block tick-to-human transmission. By identifying UPF1 and DHX9 as key antiviral players, we start to unravel the complexity and uniqueness of the ticks' antiviral response. This is extremely valuable for future prevention and control strategies."

The research expands knowledge of tick biology, improving understanding of their immune systems and how they interact with pathogens.

An antibody treatment developed at Stanford Medicine successfully prepared patients for stem cell transplants without toxic busulfan chemotherapy or radiation, a phase 1 clinical trial has shown.

While the researchers tested the protocol on patients with Fanconi anemia, a genetic disease that makes standard stem cell transplant extremely risky, they expect it may also work for patients with other genetic diseases that require stem cell transplants.

We were able to treat these really fragile patients with a new, innovative regimen that allowed us to reduce the toxicity of the stem cell transplant protocol. Specifically, we could eliminate the use of radiation and genotoxic chemotherapy called busulfan, with exceptional outcomes."

Agnieszka Czechowicz, MD, PhD, study's co-senior author, assistant professor of pediatrics

In the clinical trial, publishing online July 22 in Nature Medicine, the antibody used in combination with other drugs enabled transplants for three children with Fanconi anemia. All three have completed two years of follow-up and are doing well.

"If they don't get a transplant in time, Fanconi anemia patients' bodies eventually will not make blood, so they die of bleeding or infections," said co-first author Rajni Agarwal, MD, professor of pediatric stem cell transplantation. "The reason I am so excited about this trial is that it is a novel approach to help these patients, who are very vulnerable."

Before undergoing a stem cell transplant - in which diseased bone marrow is replaced by that of a healthy donor - a patients' own stem cells must be eliminated, typically with radiation or chemotherapy. In the trial, patients were instead injected with antibodies against CD117, a protein on the surface of blood-forming stem cells. The antibody, briquilimab, eliminates blood-forming stem cells without toxic side effects.

Other authors of the study included co-first author Alice Bertaina, MD, PhD, the Lorry I. Lokey Professor, and co-senior author Matthew Porteus, MD, PhD, the Sutardja Chuk Professor in Definitive and Curative Medicine.

The team drew upon decades of Stanford Medicine scientific advances to develop a safer technique that also makes stem cell transplants more accessible.

Czechowicz has studied blood-forming stem cells since 2004, when she was an undergraduate student in the lab of Irving Weissman, MD, the Virginia and D.K. Ludwig Professor in Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research who was then the director of Stanford's Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine. Their work focused on CD117, which regulates the cells' growth and development. They found that an antibody against CD117 blocked the stem cells' growth and eliminated the cells from mice without the hazards of radiation and chemo. Together with other Stanford scientists, they subsequently identified the clinical antibody equivalent that was used in this new clinical trial.

This clinical trial also addressed a second challenge in stem cell transplant: In the past, about 35% to 40% of patients who need the transplants for any reason did not receive them because they lacked fully matched donors. But researchers found a way to increase the chance that the transplants would work by modifying the donated bone marrow before giving it to the participants. They enriched for CD34+ cells - the donor's blood-forming stem cells - by specifically removing a subset of problematic immune cells known as alpha/beta T-cells. The innovation, which was developed by Bertaina and her colleagues before she came to Stanford Medicine, reduces the risk of a transplant complication called graft-versus-host disease, in which immune cells in donated bone marrow attack the recipient. It allows patients to receive cells from someone who shares only half of their immune markers, such as a parent.

"We are expanding the donors for stem cell transplantation in a major way, so every patient who needs a transplant can get one," Agarwal said.

The first person with Fanconi anemia to benefit from the new approaches was Ryder Baker, of Seguin, Texas, who is now 11. Ryder received a stem cell transplant at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in early 2022 as part of the clinical trial. Today, Ryder's Fanconi anemia "doesn't slow him down like it used to," said his mom, Andrea Reiley. Before the transplant, she said, "He was so tired, he didn't have stamina. It's completely different now."

Ryder, who recently finished fifth grade, is using some of his newfound energy to play sports. He loves pickleball and received an award - Up and Coming Player - from his school's soccer team.

The researchers hope Ryder will be the first of many kids to benefit from their work.

"Bone marrow or stem cell transplants are most commonly used in blood cancers, in which the bone marrow is full of malignant cells and patients have no other options," Czechowicz said. "But as we're making these transplants better and safer, we can expand them to more patients including those with many different diseases."

Fanconi anemia interferes with DNA repair. One consequence is impaired development of blood cells, including oxygen-carrying red blood cells; white blood cells needed for immune function; and platelets, which help the blood clot. Patients experience fatigue, reduced growth, frequent infections, and more bruising and bleeding than normal. Eventually, their blood cell production is so diminished they have a life-threatening condition known as progressive bone marrow failure, signs of which develop in about 80% of Fanconi anemia patients by age 12.

Children with Fanconi anemia can become stuck in a catch-22: A stem cell transplant can prevent and treat bone marrow failure, but because their DNA-repair machinery works so poorly, patients are extremely vulnerable to side effects - including cancer - from the chemotherapy or radiation used to prepare for these transplants.

"Right now, nearly all of these patients get secondary cancers by the time they're 40," Czechowicz said, adding that her team hopes their new approach will reduce those rates. Fanconi anemia patients are also more vulnerable than other people to complications of graft-versus-host disease.

The three trial participants were all younger than 10 when they received their transplants. They were of different racial/ethnic backgrounds and had different gene mutations underlying their Fanconi anemia.

Each patient received a single intravenous infusion of the antibody 12 days before they were scheduled to receive donated stem cells. Closer to the transplant date, they received immune-suppressing medications typically given before stem cell transplant, but no radiation or busulfan chemotherapy that is typically part of the treatment regimen.

Each patient was then given a stem cell transplant consisting of cells that had been donated by a parent, depleted of alpha/beta T-cells and enriched for blood-forming stem cells. Within two weeks, the donated stem cells quickly took up residence in the patients' bone marrow. No one experienced graft rejection - a transplant complication in which the patient's immune system rejects the donated cells - and by 30 days after transplant, the healthy cells from the donors had almost completely taken over the patients' marrow.

The researchers' initial goal was to help patients reach 1% donor chimerism, meaning 1% of the bone marrow cells would come from the donor. But two years later, all three patients have close to 100% of their cells from their donors - far better than the researchers expected.

"We've been surprised by how well it's worked," Czechowicz said. "We were optimistic that we would get here, but you never know when you're trying a new regimen."

Even with the improved protocol, a stem cell transplant is a big challenge for kids like Ryder, requiring them to spend more than a month in the hospital and endure short-term side effects such as severe exhaustion, nausea and hair loss.

"It was heartbreaking to see him go through things like that - I'd rather go through it than my child," Reiley said, adding that, fortunately, Ryder remembers little of the experience. "I felt the heartbreak for him, and now he doesn't have to."

Since his transplant, Ryder has grown taller, gained weight and become much less susceptible to run-of-the-mill germs, his mom said. "It used to be huge hits when he would get sick at all, and I really don't have to worry about that anymore."

Reiley has conversations with her son about how his experience as a medical pioneer is helping experts take better care of other kids. "I think he takes a lot of pride in that, too," she said.

After more than three decades of administering stem cell transplants with the traditional approach, Agarwal said she loves explaining to patients' families how much better the new options are.

"When I counsel families, their eyes start to shine as they think, 'OK, we can avoid the radiation and chemo toxicity'," she said.

The researchers are now conducting a phase 2 trial of the same protocol in additional children with Fanconi anemia. They also plan studies to test whether the new approach will work for other conditions, including Diamond-Blackfan anemia, another genetic disease that causes bone marrow failure.

Most cancer patients may still require some chemotherapy or radiation to rid them of malignant cells, said the researchers, who noted that another team at Stanford Medicine is testing whether the antibody can help elderly cancer patients who can't tolerate full doses of radiation or chemotherapy because they are fragile or have diseases in addition to cancer.

"That population is often at a disadvantage," Agarwal said. "It may provide us with a way to treat them with less intensity so it's possible for them to get a transplant."

The group is also working on next-generation approaches that may continue to improve the treatment regimen for patients with Fanconi anemia as well as other grievous diseases.

Other researchers who contributed to the study were from the University of California, San Francisco; Kaiser Permanente Bernard J. Tyson School of Medicine; St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; and Jasper Therapeutics Inc.

Study funding came from anonymous philanthropic support and the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine. The antibody, briquilimab, was supplied by Jasper Therapeutics Inc. The Fanconi Cancer Foundation and the Stanford Clinical Trial program also provided clinical trial support and assisted with the execution of the study.

When Lawrence and Penny Higgins of Fairfield, Maine, first learned in 2020 that high levels of toxic chemicals called PFAS taint their home's well water, they wondered how their health might suffer. They had consumed the water for decades, given it to their pets and farm animals, and used it to irrigate their vegetable garden and fruit trees.

"We wanted to find out just what it's going to do to us," Penny Higgins said. They contacted a couple of doctors, but "we were met with a brick wall. Nobody knew anything."

Worse still, she added, they "really didn't want to hear about it."

Many clinicians remain unaware of the health risks linked to PFAS, short for perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, despite rising medical and public awareness of the chemicals and their toxicity. PFAS can affect nearly every organ system and linger in bodies for decades, raising risks of cancer, immune deficiencies, and pregnancy complications.

These "forever chemicals" have been widely used since the 1950s in products including cosmetics, cookware, clothing, carpeting, food packaging, and firefighting foam. Researchers say they permeate water systems and soils nationwide, with a federal study estimating that at least 45% of U.S. tap water is contaminated. PFAS can be detected in the blood of nearly all Americans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Maine was among the first states to begin extensive water and soil testing and to try to limit further public exposure to PFAS through policy action, after discovering that farms and residences — like the Higgins' property — had been contaminated by land-spreading of wastewater sludge containing PFAS. Exposure can also be high for people living near military bases, fire training areas, landfills, or manufacturing facilities.

In regions where testing reveals PFAS hot spots, medical providers can be caught flat-footed and patients left adrift.

Rachel Criswell, a family practice doctor and environmental health researcher, is working to change that. She was completing her residency in Central Maine around the time that the Higginses and others there began discovering the extent of the contamination. Her medical training at Columbia University included more than a year in Norway researching the effects of PFAS and other chemicals on maternal and infant health.

When patients began asking about PFAS, Criswell and the state toxicologist offered primary care providers lunchtime presentations on how to respond. Since then, she has fielded frequent PFAS questions from doctors and patients throughout the state.

Even knowledgeable providers can find it challenging to stay current given rapidly evolving scientific information and few established protocols. "The work I do is exhausting and time-consuming and sometimes frustrating," Criswell said, "but it's exactly what I should be doing."

Phil Brown, a Northeastern University sociology professor and a co-director of the PFAS Project Lab, said the medical community "doesn't know a lot about occupational and environmental health," adding that "it's a very minimal part of the medical school curriculum" and continuing education.

Courtney Carignan, an environmental epidemiologist at Michigan State University, said learning of PFAS exposure, whether from their drinking water or occupational sources, "is a sensitive and upsetting situation for people" and "it's helpful if their doctors can take it seriously."

Clinical guidance concerning PFAS improved after the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a report on PFAS in 2022. It found strong evidence associating PFAS with kidney cancer, high cholesterol, reduced birth weights, and lower antibody responses to vaccines, and some evidence linking PFAS to breast and testicular cancer, ulcerative colitis, thyroid and liver dysfunction, and pregnancy-induced hypertension.

That guidance "revolutionized my practice," Criswell said. "Instead of being this hand-wavey thing where we don't know how to apply the research, it brought a degree of concreteness to PFAS exposure that was kind of missing before."

The national academies affirmed what Criswell had already been recommending: Doctors should order blood tests for patients with known PFAS exposures.

Testing for PFAS in blood — and for related medical conditions if needed — can help ease patients' anxiety.

"There isn't a day that goes by," Lawrence Higgins said, "that we don't think and wonder when our bodies are going to shut down on us."

After finding out in 2021 that his family was exposed to PFAS through sludge spread on their Unity, Maine, farm decades earlier, Adam Nordell discovered that "it was exceedingly difficult" to get tested. "Our family doctor had not heard of PFAS and didn't know what the test was," he said. A lab technician needed coaching from an outside expert to source the test. The lab analyzing the samples had a backlog that left the family waiting three months.

"The results were devastating but incredibly helpful," Nordell said. Their blood serum levels for PFAS were at roughly the 99th percentile nationally, far higher than their well-water levels would have predicted — indicating that additional exposure was probably coming from other sources such as soil contact, dust, and food.

Blood levels of PFAS between 2 and 20 nanograms per milliliter may be problematic, the national academies reported. In highly contaminated settings, blood levels can run upward of 150 times the 20-ng/mL risk threshold.

Nordell and his family had been planning to remain on the farm and grow crops less affected by PFAS, but the test results persuaded them to leave. "Knowledge is power," Nordell said, and having the blood data "gave us agency." 

The national academies' guidance paved the way for more clinicians to order PFAS blood tests. The cost, typically $400 to $600, can be prohibitive if not picked up by insurance, and not all insurers cover the testing. Deductibles and copays can also limit patients' capacity to get tested. Less costly finger-prick tests, administered at home, appear to capture some of the more commonly found PFAS as accurately as blood serum tests, Carignan and colleagues found.

Maine legislators recently passed, with overwhelming support, a bill — modeled after one in New Hampshire — that would require insurers to consider PFAS blood testing part of preventive care, but it was carried over to the next legislative session.

"In my mind, it's a no-brainer that the PFAS blood serum test should be universally offered — at no cost to the patient," said Nordell, who now works as a campaign manager for the nonprofit Defend Our Health. Early screening for the diseases associated with PFAS, he said, is "a humane policy that's in the best interests of everyone involved" — patients, providers, and insurance companies.

Criswell tells colleagues in family practice that they can view elevated PFAS blood levels as a risk factor, akin to smoking. "What's challenging as a primary care doctor is the nitty-gritty" of the testing and screening logistics, she said.

In trainings, she shares a handout summarizing the national academies' guidance — including associated heath conditions, blood testing, clinical follow-up, and exposure reduction — to which she has added details about lab test order codes, insurance costs and coverage, and water filtration.

Criswell served on an advisory committee tasked with allocating $60 million in state funds to address PFAS contamination from past sludge-spreading in Maine. The group recommended that labs analyzing PFAS blood tests should report the results to state public health authorities.

That change, slated to take effect this summer, will allow Maine health officials to follow up with people who have high PFAS blood levels to better determine potential sources and to share information on health risks and medical screening. As with many earlier PFAS policies, Maine is among the first states to adopt this measure.

Screening for PFAS is falling short in many places nationwide, said Kyle Horton, an internist in Wilmington, North Carolina, and founder of the nonprofit On Your Side Health. She estimates that only about 1 in 100 people facing high PFAS exposure are getting adequate medical guidance.

Even in her highly contaminated community, "I'm not aware of anyone who is routinely screening or discussing PFAS mitigation with their patients," Horton said. Knowledge of local PFAS threats, she added, "hasn't translated over to folks managing patients differently or trying to get through to that next phase of medical monitoring."

In heavily affected communities — including in Michigan, Maine, and Massachusetts — patients are pushing the medical field to better understand PFAS.

More doctors are speaking out as well. Testifying before a Maine legislative committee this year in support of a bill that would limit occupational PFAS exposure, Criswell said, "We, as physicians, who are sworn to protect the health of our patients, must pay attention to the underlying causes of the illnesses we treat and stand up for policy solutions that reduce these causes."

Even where policy changes are instituted, the physical and psychological toll of "forever chemicals" will extend far into the future. Criswell and other Maine doctors have observed chronic stress among patients.

Nordell, the former farmer, described his family's contamination as "deeply, deeply jarring," an ordeal that has at times left him "unmoored from a sense of security."

To assess the mental health consequences of PFAS exposure in rural residents, Criswell and Abby Fleisch, a pediatric endocrinologist at the MaineHealth Institute for Research, teamed up on a study. In its first phase, winding up this summer, they collected blood samples and detailed lifestyle information from 147 people.

Nordell, the Higginses, and other Central Maine residents sit on an advisory board for the study, a step Criswell said was critical to ensuring that their research helps those most affected by PFAS.

"The urgency from the community is really needed," she said. "I don't think I would be as fired up if my patients weren't such good advocates."

Criswell has faced what she calls "cognitive dissonance," caught between the deliberate pace of peer-reviewed medical research and the immediate needs of patients eager to lower their PFAS body burden. Initially she considered inviting residents to participate in a clinical trial to test therapies that are considered safe and may help reduce PFAS levels in the body, such as high-fiber diets and a drug designed to reduce cholesterol called cholestyramine. But the clinical trial process could take years.

Criswell and Fleisch are instead planning to produce a case series on PFAS blood-level changes in patients taking cholestyramine. "We can validate the research results and share those," Criswell said, potentially helping other patients.

Alan Ducatman, an internist and occupational physician who helped design the largest PFAS cohort study to date, said providers should convey that "there is no risk-benefit analysis" for any of the current treatments, although they're generally well known and low-risk.

"Some people want to be treated, and they should be allowed to be treated," he said, because knowing they have high PFAS levels in their bodies "preys on them."

PhoreMost Ltd., a next-generation targeted protein degradation (TPD) company progressing a pipeline of degrader therapeutics within oncology and inflammation, today announced the publication of a study demonstrating the capabilities of its high-throughput GlueSEEKER platform to accelerate the design and development of novel molecular glue degraders.

The paper, titled "Systematic molecular glue drug discovery with a high-throughput effector protein remodeling platform", was published in BioRxiv and describes PhoreMost's unique approach to molecular glue discovery, wherein effector proteins, such as E3 ligases, can be engineered at scale to expand protein surface landscapes and trigger induced degradation of target proteins. GlueSEEKER is used to develop a high-resolution understanding of the physical and chemical requirements for molecular glue development, and provides the blueprints to enable small molecule drug discovery. The approach synthesises quantitative high-throughput biological data with the most recent advances in computational small molecule drug discovery.

The study describes PhoreMost's GlueSEEKER in detail and documents an end-to-end case study for small molecule molecular glue discovery with the technology. The potential of the platform to accelerate programs is validated by the published data and methodology, which can also be applied to novel E3 ligases and other effector proteins across broad therapeutic areas.

Molecular glues have now been established as an effective therapeutic modality, but these small molecule drugs have still largely only been found through serendipity. Our GlueSEEKER platform overcomes the challenges associated with monovalent glue discovery, enabling their rational and systematic design from almost any E3 ligase or target. This paper marks a significant milestone by showcasing one of our case-studies and validating our deep mutational scanning approach for prospective drug discovery."

Dr Benedict Cross, CTO, PhoreMost

Dr Neil Torbett, CEO, PhoreMost, commented: "FDA-approved molecular glues have treated millions of patients and generated billions of dollars in revenue. The advances disclosed within this manuscript demonstrate how GlueSEEKER can radically enable the discovery of new molecular glue therapies, directing this modality towards specific targets across a broad array of E3 ligases."

Neil added: "GlueSEEKER builds on PhoreMost's long-standing expertise in mini-protein engineering and high-throughput phenotypic screening to provide rich biological data which is deeply enabling for the advancement of first-in-class drugs using AI-based molecule design tools. We are excited to build upon our leading position to progress the next generation of molecular glue degrader assets for both our internal pipeline and though alliances and partnerships."

The rapid advancement of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sc/snRNA-seq) has opened unprecedented windows into cellular diversity, yet existing methods for multiplexing samples struggle with scalability and accuracy. Traditional techniques relying on antibodies or lipid-based barcodes often fail to uniformly label cells across different types or species, particularly in complex clinical samples. These limitations—cell-type bias, cross-contamination risks, and loss of rare cell populations—hinder large-scale studies and clinical translation. To overcome these challenges, a team led by Professor Yiwei Li at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) has pioneered Toti-N-Seq, a groundbreaking technology that harnesses the universal presence of N-glycans on cell and nuclear surfaces. Published as a cover story in Research (2025, DOI: 10.34133/research.0678), this innovation redefines how researchers approach high-throughput cellular profiling.

At the heart of Toti-N-Seq lies an engineered protein, Stv-Fg, derived from modifying the natural glycan-binding protein Fbs1. This fusion protein binds non-selectively to all N-glycan types, enabling universal tagging of cells and nuclei. By attaching DNA barcodes to Stv-Fg, the team achieved precise sample multiplexing without cell-type or species restrictions. Experimental validations underscored its robustness: flow cytometry revealed labeling efficiencies as low as 37.5 pM for cell membranes and 75.0 pM for nuclei, with cross-contamination below 2% even after prolonged sample mixing.

In practical applications, Toti-N-Seq demonstrated exceptional accuracy. When applied to single-nucleus sequencing, it achieved an overall classification accuracy (OCA) of 0.987, outperforming conventional antibody- or lipid-based methods. Notably, the technology preserved rare cell populations, such as the 0.5% plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in human peripheral blood samples, while reducing doublet rates to 0.04% for single cells and 0.02% for nuclei. These capabilities were further validated in 12-plex experiments, where sample ratio deviations remained under 4%, proving its reliability for large-scale studies.

Looking ahead, the Toti-N-Seq platform is set to transform both basic and applied research. The team plans to expand its multiplexing capacity to 24-plex or higher, facilitating ambitious projects like cross-organ cell atlases and high-throughput drug screening. Integration with epigenetic and proteomic tools will enable multi-dimensional single-cell analyses, shedding light on complex regulatory networks.

Clinically, Toti-N-Seq's ability to retain rare cell subsets positions it as a powerful tool for dissecting tumor microenvironments and predicting immunotherapy responses. Upcoming multi-center studies will explore its diagnostic potential in cancer patient cohorts. Beyond academia, the technology's compatibility with platforms like MobiNova microfluidics promises to streamline industrial workflows, accelerating drug development and toxicity testing through standardized, reproducible protocols.

Toti-N-Seq represents a leap forward in single-cell genomics, addressing long-standing bottlenecks in multiplexing accuracy and scalability. By leveraging the ubiquity of N-glycans, Professor Li's team has created a versatile tool that bridges species and cell types while preserving biological nuance. As the technology moves toward clinical and industrial adoption, it holds the potential to democratize high-resolution cellular profiling, empowering discoveries from developmental biology to personalized medicine.

A new study from McMaster University researchers has found that many people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who believe they are sensitive to gluten or wheat may not actually react to these ingredients.

IBS is an intestinal disorder that affects an estimated 10 per cent of Canadians – one of the highest prevalence rates globally, according to the Canadian Digestive Health Foundation. It can be disruptive and debilitating, and its underlying cause is unclear.

The study, published in The Lancet Gastroenetrology and Hepatology on July 21, 2025, included participants with clinically diagnosed IBS who reported feeling better on a gluten-free diet. These individuals were given cereal bars to eat containing either gluten, whole wheat, or neither -- without knowing, which was which, in a random order.

Researchers found the number of people who experienced worse symptoms was similar across all three groups, including the gluten-free placebo, suggesting that expectations and beliefs, rather than the ingredients themselves, may be driving symptoms in many cases.

Not every patient who believes they are reacting to gluten actually does. Some truly have a sensitivity to this food protein, but for many others, it's the belief itself that's driving their symptoms and subsequent choices to avoid gluten-containing foods."

Premysl Bercik, senior author, professor with McMaster's Department of Medicine

When participants were later told which bars caused gastrointestinal symptoms, most did not change their beliefs or their diets. Bercik says the findings suggest that some patients with IBS may benefit, apart from dietary guidance also from psychological support and personalized care.

"What we need to improve in our clinical management of these patients is to work with them further, not just tell them that gluten is not the trigger and move on. Many of them may benefit from psychological support and guidance to help destigmatize gluten and wheat and reintroduce them safely in their diet."

The study thus sheds light on why many people with IBS continue to avoid gluten, even when it may not be the true cause of their symptoms. According to researchers, the psychological phenomenon known as the nocebo effect, where negative expectations alone can trigger real symptoms, could partly be the reason. Bercik says the powerful role of social media and online communities can also fuel ideas that gluten is harmful.

"There is strong influence from the internet. Many patients post how bad they feel about gluten. Of course, it influences others," says Bercik, adding that for some people living with IBS, avoiding gluten is a way of taking control of their situation.

"Continuing the gluten-free diet might provided patients with an actionable method to try to control their symptoms, although it meant to follow unnecessary diet restrictions."

To conduct the study, researchers designed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled crossover trial. This means neither the 29 participants nor the researchers knew which bar was being consumed at any time. After each challenge, participants reported their symptoms, and stool samples were analyzed to objectively measure gluten intake.

Even though most participants said they ate the gluten or wheat bars, lab tests showed many didn't. According to the study, only about a third actually followed the diet as instructed, suggesting some may have skipped the bars to avoid symptoms.

Funding for the study was provided by Canadian Digestive Health Foundation and the Society for the Study of Celiac Disease.

A new study by researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health identified that uranium's isotopic composition can be used as a biomarker to noninvasively measure accumulation of uranium in the kidneys. Uranium from drinking water can accumulate in the kidneys-even at low levels of exposure-and this newly identified biomarker may serve as an early warning sign of kidney damage. The findings, published in Environmental Science & Technology, suggest a potential breakthrough in detecting and preventing chronic kidney disease caused by uranium toxicity. This discovery offers critical insights into a largely overlooked environmental health threat.

Uranium that enters the body through drinking water is filtered by the kidneys, where some of it is retained and can cause harm over time. Our study suggests that uranium isotopes in urine may provide a sensitive, noninvasive biomarker for detecting kidney accumulation and the risk of damage."

Anirban Basu, PhD, senior author, geochemist and research scientist at Columbia Mailman School

According to federal data, nearly two-thirds of U.S. community water systems-serving approximately 320 million people-have detectable uranium levels. About 2% of these systems exceed the EPA's maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 30 micrograms per liter (μg/L). Among private wells, which supply water to roughly 15% of the population, about 4% exceed the MCL.

While uranium is best known as a radioactive element, its chemical toxicity-particularly to the kidneys-is the more pressing concern at environmental exposure levels. Studies show that even low concentrations of uranium (below the 30 μg/L MCL) may impair kidney function.

"Our findings raise particular concern for communities in the Great Plains and the Colorado Plateau, including many Native American populations, where natural uranium deposits and legacy mining activity have led to high groundwater contamination," added Basu.

Roughly 80% of ingested uranium is excreted in urine within days, but the remainder can accumulate in the kidneys-especially in the outer layer, where it binds to cells, causes injury, and interferes with vital functions. Over time, this damage can contribute to chronic kidney disease.

"Current tools to measure uranium in the body don't tell us how much is accumulating in the kidneys specifically – this is a big roadblock to understanding and preventing long-term kidney damage from uranium exposure," said first author Catherine Lucey, a doctoral student in environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman School.

In experiments with mice, researchers found uranium accumulation in both the kidneys and bones with distinct isotopic signatures after just 7 to 14 days of exposure to contaminated water. This is the first in vivo evidence that molecular uranium uptake alters the proportions of its isotopes detectable in organs and in urine.

Because uranium's isotopic signature is detectable in urine, this biomarker could enable cost-effective and noninvasive monitoring of kidney uranium levels-especially useful in communities at higher risk of exposure.

"Our results support the development of new models to predict how uranium travels through the body-from ingestion to accumulation and excretion," said Lucey. "This work lays the foundation for precision biomarkers that could lead to earlier intervention-before irreversible kidney damage occurs."

The study is part of a broader effort to improve environmental health surveillance and develop tools for monitoring metal exposures in vulnerable populations. The researchers plan future studies with longer exposure periods and lower uranium doses to better understand long-term effects.

Other co-authors include Brandon L. Pearson, Kathryn DeSantis, Ana Navas-Acien, Kathrin Schilling, and Jeff Goldsmith of Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, and Alex N. Halliday of the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia Climate School.

The study was supported by the Columbia University Northern Plains Superfund Research Program (Grant P42ES033719); the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (Grants P30ES009089 and T32 ES007322); and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, NIH (Grant TL1TR001875).

A University of Oklahoma researcher is the first to discover that the sequence of the genetic defect in the neuromuscular disease Friedreich's ataxia isn't always as uniform as previously thought, a breakthrough finding that could spark changes in how the condition is diagnosed and studied.

To further the research, Sanjay Bidichandani, MBBS, Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine, has received a $2.8 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense.

Friedreich's ataxia appears in the teenage years with balance and walking problems and can lead to heart issues, vision and hearing loss, and other symptoms. The disorder is inherited, caused by a defect in a gene called FXN, and it is recessive, meaning a person needs a copy of the gene defect from both parents to be affected.

Since the FXN gene was discovered in 1996, a finding in which Bidichandani played a role, the sequence of the genetic defect was thought to be standard. The disease is indicated by an expansion of the letters GAA in the gene sequence. A person without Friedreich's ataxia typically has fewer than 30 of the triplet letters GAA in a row. However, people with the condition have 100 to 1,500 GAAs, an expansion of the naturally occurring sequence.

The test to discover this expansion is straightforward, but Bidichandani's team wondered if there was more to the story than a greater length of GAA letters. When they used a new technology called long-read sequencing, they discovered something that no one had found before: "spelling errors" in the long string of GAA letters in some people with the condition.

Instead of GAA expanded 1,500 times, we found different combinations of G's and A's that the original test could not detect. It is a whole new level of genetic variability that was not being taken into account in the diagnosis and prognosis of Friedreich's ataxia."

Sanjay Bidichandani, MBBS, Ph.D., professor of pediatrics, University of Oklahoma College of Medicine

The discovery is significant for several reasons. Bidichandani's preliminary research using long-read sequencing shows that people with GAA letter irregularities seem to have a milder version of the disease in which they experience slower progression. His data thus far also shows that about 30% of people with the condition have this irregular spelling.

"But they have been told they have the classic type of Friedreich's ataxia," he said. "Our first goal with this new grant is to determine the real diversity of genotypes in people with Friedreich's ataxia, and then to determine whether their condition is actually less severe."

The research has major implications for clinical trials, Bidichandani said. People in ongoing trials have been enrolled based on the assumption that there is one presentation of Friedreich's ataxia with a straightforward expansion of GAA letters. If trial participants appear to be responding to a drug, they actually could have a milder version of the condition instead, Bidichandani said.

Understanding the different genotypes is also essential for people who want to undergo testing before deciding to have children. "Because the standard test performed by many clinical diagnostic labs does not detect the spelling errors, people may receive a false negative result for carrier testing," he said. "We have already discovered several families who've been told they're not carriers, but when we do our specialized test, it turns out that they are carriers."

Bidichandani's grant was one of only 19 Impact Awards funded nationally through the fiscal year 2024 Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program within the Department of Defense. It is called an Impact Award because grant recipients are expected to make discoveries that have an immediate effect on patient care.

Friedreich's ataxia is rare; about 5,000 people in the United States have the condition, and there is currently only one drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment. To expand his research on patients with Friedreich's ataxia, Bidichandani is collaborating with David R. Lynch, M.D., Ph.D., of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who shares a portion of the grant.

They have also been supported by the Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, the largest patient advocacy group in the world for the condition. The organization provided initial funding that allowed Bidichandani and Lynch to gather the data needed to apply for the Department of Defense grant.

"This is an exciting time for our research program," Bidichandani said. "We believe our findings will have a beneficial impact on people with Friedreich's ataxia and their families."

A breakthrough AI model can spot silent structural heart disease from a simple ECG, promising to catch dangerous conditions earlier, streamline patient care, and close the diagnostic gap missed by traditional screening.

Study: Detecting structural heart disease from electrocardiograms using AI. Image Credit: DC Studio / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Nature, a group of researchers investigated whether an artificial intelligence (AI) electrocardiogram (ECG) model can reliably detect diverse structural heart diseases (SHDs) across various hospitals and care settings, outperforming standard physician review. The model, called EchoNext, was developed as a multitask classifier to address collinearity among different SHD component labels.

Every minute, another United States (US) patient enters the hospital with symptoms that may mask underlying SHD. Treating SHD already drains the nation of more than 100 billion dollars each year. Yet, an estimated 6.4% of older adults carry clinically significant valvular heart disease (VHD) that has never been diagnosed, in addition to 4.9% already diagnosed, making the total prevalence over 11%.

Early echocardiography saves lives, but ultrasound labs, trained readers, and patient travel costs remain barriers, leaving busy clinicians guessing whom to scan.

Large-scale digital ECG archives and modern AI offer a low-cost alternative: if one ten-second ECG could reliably uncover silent disease, scarce imaging resources could be directed to those who need them most.

Further research is needed to determine whether algorithm-guided screening improves survival and equity. Additionally, the paper discusses potential deployment strategies for such models, including both “gatekeeper” and “safety net” applications, each with unique benefits and trade-offs for clinical practice.

Investigators assembled 1,245,273 paired ECG-echocardiogram records from 230,318 adults treated between 2008 and 2022 at eight NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) hospitals, reserving patient-level splits for training, validation, and testing.

SHD was labeled when any guideline defined abnormality was present with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 45%, left ventricular wall thickness ≥ 1.3 cm, moderate or worse right ventricular dysfunction, pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) ≥ 45 mm Hg, or tricuspid regurgitation jet velocity ≥ 3.2 m/s as an alternative pulmonary hypertension definition, moderate or worse regurgitation/stenosis of any valve, or a moderate/large pericardial effusion.

The authors note these thresholds are somewhat arbitrary, as different studies and guidelines may use varying cutoffs.

A convolutional neural network named EchoNext ingested the raw 12-lead waveform, along with seven routine ECG parameters and age/sex data. Performance was first measured on a held-out NYP test set, and then on external cohorts from Cedars-Sinai, the Montreal Heart Institute, and the University of California, San Francisco.

Generalization across age, sex, race, ethnicity, and clinical context was assessed. Silent “shadow” deployment ran EchoNext on 84,875 consecutive ECGs from patients without previous echocardiography, storing scores but not influencing care.

Finally, a single-site pilot, Detecting Structural Heart Disease Using Deep Learning on an Electrocardiographic Waveform Array (DISCOVERY), prospectively invited adults with no recent imaging to undergo echocardiography stratified by a predecessor model's risk score; EchoNext was analyzed post hoc.

EchoNext, an AI-powered ECG model, excelled in retrospective analysis. Within the eight-hospital NYP test set, it detected composite SHD with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 85.2% and an area under the precision–recall curve (AUPRC) of 78.5%. Accuracy remained consistent across academic and community campuses and did not falter when training and test sites were exchanged, demonstrating generalization.

External validation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI), and the University of California, San Francisco, yielded AUROC values of 78 to 80%, despite higher disease prevalence.

Disease-specific performance: LVEF ≤ 45% achieved AUROC 90.4%, while PASP ≥ 45 millimeters of mercury reached 82.7%. The authors emphasize that AUPRC values for component diseases are highly dependent on the underlying disease prevalence and should not be directly compared across conditions or use cases.

A 150-trace reader study compared EchoNext with thirteen cardiologists. Reviewing wide age, sex, waveform, and ECG intervals, physicians identified SHD correctly in 64% of cases. The AI alone achieved 77% accuracy, and when clinicians were shown the algorithmic risk score, their accuracy increased modestly to 69%, underscoring that the model captured prognostic patterns that were hidden from expert eyes. It is important to note that cardiologists in this assessment had access only to de-identified ECGs and routine parameters, without any clinical context, which is not typical of standard clinical care.

To estimate clinical opportunity at scale, the team silently ran EchoNext on 124,027 ECGs recorded in 2023 from 84,875 adults who had never undergone echocardiography. The model flagged nine percent of traces as high risk. Usual care, nevertheless, left 45% of these individuals without follow-up imaging, suggesting that an estimated 1,998 cases of silent SHD might have been intercepted had the alert been live, based on modelled prevalence and sensitivity scenarios provided in the paper.

Among the 15,094 patients who eventually received echocardiography, EchoNext preserved accuracy (AUROC 83%; AUPRC 81%) and delivered a positive predictive value of 74%, reinforcing its reliability in a contemporary workflow. The paper also provides modelled performance estimates at different prevalence scenarios and sensitivity thresholds, underscoring the practical implications for population-wide screening.

Prospective evidence came from the DISCOVERY pilot, which recruited 100 imaging-naive adults. Post hoc EchoNext scoring revealed clear tiers, with previously unrecognized SHD present in 73% of high-risk participants, 28% of moderate-risk participants, and 6% of low-risk participants; moderate to severe left-sided VHD followed a similar gradient.

These results illustrate the model's capacity to triage scarce echocardiography resources toward those most likely to benefit, while sparing low-risk individuals unnecessary testing. The original trial used a predecessor model (ValveNet) to stratify risk and recruit participants, and the EchoNext model was applied retrospectively to these participants for further analysis.

To summarize, EchoNext demonstrates that an AI-enhanced ECG can detect SHD associated with LVEF reduction, elevated PASP, and significant VHD, with AUROC and AUPRC metrics superior to those of cardiologists. By flagging high-risk patients for timely echocardiography, the algorithm promises to shrink diagnostic delay and the billion-dollar burden of SHD while maintaining equity across sites and demographics. However, the authors caution that AI-based screening may also carry potential risks, including patient anxiety from false positives or bias in clinical adoption, and highlight the need for further study of these aspects.

The public release of code and data encourages independent validation; however, large pragmatic trials must verify that AI-guided ECG screening truly improves survival, quality of life, and healthcare value. Notably, the authors have released a large de-identified dataset and a benchmark AI model (the Columbia mini-model) to support further research and enable transparent comparison of future algorithms.

INGLEWOOD, Calif. — After Thursday's stunning loss to Panama, the U.S. men's national team promised a response. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino assured fuming fans that a sleepy CONCACAF Nations League semifinal “didn't describe, or doesn't describe, how we are.” Players said they'd “look in the mirror” and “raise the bar.” And yet, in Sunday's third-place match against Canada, they did none of that.

They lost 2-1 to their northern neighbors, and deserved every last ounce of the defeat.

They managed one solitary shot on goal over the game's first 84 minutes.

In the face of criticism and doubts, they talked about how, “if we want to be praised, we have to give people something to praise us about,” as midfielder Tyler Adams said Saturday. Instead, they regressed, and further disillusioned their supporters, and inflamed doubts about their readiness for a World Cup on home soil next summer.

All involved promised that, after the 1-0 loss to Panama, Sunday's performance would be better. This Nations League consolation match would “be an important game to see how we react,” Pochettino said Saturday.

“Mentality obviously needs to change,” Adams said hours later.

“We're gonna come out with that fighting spirit,” Tim Weah added.

In the interim, they had one-on-one talks and a “beautiful meeting,” Weah said, in which Pochettino pleaded for “killer mentality” and more. The message, Weah said: “We have to want it. We have to want to be here 100%. We have to fight.”

But on Sunday, they floundered. For most of the first half, they didn't take the risks nor show the “aggression” they said they would. In a stadium that was once again nine-tenths empty at kickoff, they played dull soccer, and conceded a 27th-minute goal before they'd even taken a shot of their own.

Soon thereafter, Diego Luna tried to inject life into the USMNT, and into another snoozefest. Playing in his first competitive match for the national team, he started an attacking move from the right side of midfield, and, with a driving off-ball run, propelled it into the penalty box. It was the exact type of initiative that the U.S. lacked Thursday — and has often lacked under multiple managers.

"The desire and the hunger that he showed is what we want," Pochettino said postgame.

At the end of his run, Luna received a pass in stride. He poked a clever square ball to Patrick Agyemang, who equalized with a firm finish.

The two Major League Soccer attackers, two of five changes to the U.S. starting lineup, seemed to lift a lagging team back into the game.

Neither, though, could erase the mediocrity around them. Christian Pulisic and Weston McKennie, the team's two Italy-based stars, were quiet. Adams and Weah looked nothing like their typically active selves. The USMNT was once against stagnant. Why?

"I think we need to have every single person buy into exactly what we're doing and what we're trying to do," Adams said postgame. "It's just the little things ... duels, tackles, leaving your mark on the field, not being naive in certain moments, being a little bit more clever — all the details of the game that, I feel like, when I watch people play with their clubs, we do. And then when we come here, sometimes I think we forget a little bit what the games are gonna give us."

Not long after halftime, they receded again. They nearly conceded two penalties. (Canada head coach Jesse Marsch was red carded for protesting one of the no-calls.) Then, in the 59th minute, they conceded again. Jonathan David put Canada up 2-1.

And that's how it ended, just as a friendly between these two teams ended in September, with the U.S. beaten — and with all sorts of questions swirling about the talent, passion, ceiling and capabilities of these U.S. players.

It ended with Pochettino "disappointed," again, and reaching for reasons that the medium-term future, in 2026, could still be bright.

"I want to send the message to the fans: Don't be pessimistic," Pochettino said.

But he couldn't offer clear rationale for why they shouldn't be, other than: "In football, anything can happen."

And as he rose to depart his postgame press conference, he apologized to everyone present, saying that he felt "shame" after the two losses, and promising, again, that "next time" would be different.

Later, as Pochettino slumped in his shotgun seat on the team bus, Adams was asked whether he, like fans, is concerned one year out from the World Cup.

"I'm never concerned, man. It's football," he said. "You gotta show up in big moments, when the moments matter. We didn't show up in this window here. We've showed up in the past, in moments when we needed to."

U.S. Men's National Team legend Alexi Lalas has given his two cents on a newly published clip showing head coach Mauricio Pochettino in tears speaking to his players after their 2-1 CONCACAF Gold Cup final loss to Mexico.

The footage was released by U.S. Soccer as a part of their Behind the Crest YouTube series, giving fans a sneak peek into what life was like behind the scenes throughout the recent competition.

After the USMNT's loss in Houston, a clearly emotional Pochettino told his players he felt they “deserved more,” adding, “In the way that you worked, the staff, everyone, I think today we deserved more, to lift the trophy, because I think the performance was there, I think you fought with too many adversities and too many factors against you.

“That is not going to kill us. It's going to make us stronger. And I want you to never give up. I think we still have time to be better. Keep improving, but please don't change. For me, I feel so proud of you, but don't change. That is in the way that we build for the next, and the next, and the next, until we get to the World Cup.”

Pochettino's emotional response to the loss seemingly left Lalas divided, sympathising with and appreciating his clear passion, whilst also admitting part of him found his response “strange.”

“You can see that this hurt him that they had lost. And I'll be honest with you, it was, for me at least, a little strange, a little jarring, not crying, or a coach or a player crying is necessarily that,” Lalas said on his State of the Union podcast. He also noted that he disagreed with Pochettino's belief that the team “deserved more” fron a final in which the former defender believes the USMNT was “thoroughly beaten.”

“There is the part of me that is the cynic and says, ‘What is this? Why are you bawling and in tears?'” Lalas went on to admit. “And then there's the part of me that is a romantic and says, ‘I love the fact that my national team coach is brought to tears because the pain that he feels of failure and not getting it across the line,' in a Gold Cup that everyone else seemed to think, well not everybody, but a lot of people seemed to think was inconsequential anyway.

“And that it meant that much to him, so much that when he's talking to these players, the emotion is just pouring out of him in the form of tears, yeah, I think that that to some will endear him.

“And to some, who question how much he actually cares…how much Mauricio Pochettino actually cares about this team and more importantly about the job that he has to do relative to next summer.”

While Pochettino's tears may have left Lalas divided, the 55-year-old said that at the end of the day, he would prefer to “have someone who is emotional, I would rather have somebody that is passionate, and in that moment isn't afraid to show it.”

Now on a break from national team duty, Pochettino's side will reconvene in September when they host South Korea and Japan, before Ecuador and Australia travel Stateside a month later.

In this story:

Chelsea have already decided on which three players will join RC Strasbourg on loan for the 2025/26 season.

Every football club is only able to loan a maximum of three players from one club at any given time, and with Chelsea's ties to Ligue 1 outfit Strasbourg, who are also owned by BlueCo, the two sides are maximising the relationship.

Last season, Djordje Petrovic and Andrey Santos excelled for the French club and helped them qualify for the Conference League. However, Petrovic has since returned and departed on a permanent transfer to AFC Bournemouth, while Santos has been earmarked for a big role under head coach Enzo Maresca.

Chelsea have already confirmed one permanent sale to Strasbourg this summer, with Mathis Amougou making the switch to France, despite only joining the Blues back in January from Saint-Etienne.

Meanwhile, Chelsea completed the permanent signing of defender Mamadou Sarr from Strasbourg in a deal worth around £12m last month.

Along with Sarr, the decision has been taken for highly-rated goalkeeper Mike Penders to join Strasbourg next season, with moves in the final stages of being finalised. Kendry Paez will be the third Chelsea player to move to France on loan next season to play under Liam Rosenior.

With Strasbourg back for pre-season training, the view may have been for Penders and Sarr, in particular, to have joined up with their new teammates as soon as possible to settle into their new surroundings. 

However, The Athletic have now revealed the reason for the delay and why they stayed with the Chelsea squad for longer before completing their respective loan moves to Strasbourg.

Chelsea wanted Penders, who is expected to be Strasbourg's number one, and Sarr to be with the Blues for the duration of their Club World Cup campaign in the United States to get some experience and be part of Maresca's set-up, before allowing them to depart on loan.

As quoted by ESPN, Sarr has big hopes for his career, which Chelsea will hope he can fulfil, after revealing which defender he hopes to follow in the footsteps of.

"I want to be like Virgil van Dijk," said Sarr last month. "I love Van Dijk. But some people tell me I play like (Liverpool's) Ibrahima Konaté. It's very similar. He's a leader. For a defender, it's very important to be a leader. Off and on the pitch, I talk a lot. It's an important job.

"I think I anticipate well. With the ball, I can pick a good pass. When I was a kid, I had a dream. It was to be the best centre back in the world."

Chelsea have cherry-picked which talent will move to Strasbourg and all parties will hope it will boost the French side to an even higher league finish next season. All that's left is for the clubs to confirm the loan deals.

by Martina Alcheva July 22, 2025

In the wake of a financially successful Club World Cup, Real Madrid and several other elite clubs across Europe and South America are pushing for a radical change. These soccer giants have made an unusual request: they want FIFA's new Club World Cup to be held every two years. While the financial incentive behind the proposal is evident, FIFA's response has now been revealed, and it's not the answer these clubs were hoping for.

The revamped Club World Cup, held in the United States, was widely considered a success both on and off the pitch. With 32 teams participating, the competition saw fierce action and record-breaking earnings.

FIFA distributed an astonishing $1 billion among participating clubs. Chelsea, the tournament's winner, earned a whopping $114.6 million, while Real Madrid, which reached the semi-finals, walked away with $82.5 million. These figures are unprecedented in the world of club competitions and have sparked interest from several stakeholders to make the tournament a more regular affair.

According to ESPN, “Several club executives discussed the idea of a biennial Club World Cup with FIFA representatives during the last tournament in the United States.” Although no official proposal has been submitted, the intent from clubs is clear: more tournaments, more money.

Despite the enthusiasm from clubs, FIFA has pushed back strongly against the idea. According to sources cited by ESPN, the governing body is “pleased with the outcome of the new format, but currently considers it impossible to hold another Club World Cup in two years.”

FIFA is instead planning for the next edition in 2029, with Qatar emerging as a frontrunner to host. While the Gulf nation boasts the infrastructure and financing from the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the tournament would need to be scheduled for December to avoid the extreme summer heat – a complication in an already packed global calendar.

“FIFA considers it logistically difficult and financially unsustainable to organize such a massive event every two years,” sources told ESPN.

The primary obstacles are not just financial, but also structural. FIFA believes that organizing a biennial Club World Cup would clash with existing commitments, particularly with UEFA's competitions, such as the Champions League and the European Championship.

“FIFA believes that holding the tournament every two years would create a conflict with UEFA, which is not in its interest,” the report adds.

In addition, the global soccer calendar is already bursting at the seams, with national leagues, continental tournaments, and international fixtures jostling for space. Cramming in another Club World Cup could compromise player health, club schedules, and the competitive integrity of domestic leagues.

Next year's FIFA World Cup will bring the world's biggest sporting event to 11 cities across the U.S. In 2028, Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympics.

Under normal circumstances, these events would draw millions of visitors, generate billions of dollars in tourism and showcase America on the world stage. But unless the U.S. changes course, we are likely to squander the opportunity, damaging both our economy and our global reputation.

Over 1 million fans traveled to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. The 2024 Paris Olympics attracted about 1.7 million international visitors. The U.S. should be preparing for similar crowds, but it is instead throwing up barriers.

On his first day back in office, President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to apply “maximum” vetting to all visa applicants. In practice, that has meant more arrests, more detentions, more deportations and more horror stories of travelers turned away at the border.

The damage isn't limited to the border. The State Department has imposed invasive social media vetting on certain visa applicants. Consular officers are vetting applicants for “any indications of hostility towards the citizens, culture, government, institutions or founding principles of the United States.” Applicants who refuse to make their online activity visible may be viewed as trying to hide something, which could result in a denial.

Then came Trump's sweeping travel ban on 12 countries and restrictions on seven more on June 4. Leaked plans suggest the administration may soon target an additional 36 countries. That would affect hundreds of thousands of travelers. And earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order requiring noncitizens to pay more to visit our national parks than U.S. citizens.

The travel industry is already feeling the effect. In May, the World Travel and Tourism Council projected that international travel spending in the U.S. will plunge by 22 percent this year — a $12.5 billion loss. Among 184 countries studied, the U.S. is the only one expected to see a decline in spending by foreign visitors.

And don't assume you're safe if you're not from a banned country. Visa applicants from all over the world now face expanded surveillance and ballooning backlogs. For example, the average wait time for a tourist visa at the American embassy in Bogota, Colombia is now 15 months.

Even under former President Joe Biden, more than 66,000 visa applicants were stuck in “administrative processing.” That number has almost certainly grown during Trump's second term. Even travelers from closely allied countries now face uncertainty, long wait times and unexplained delays.

The message is being received overseas: Visit America at your own risk.

Meanwhile, the 11 U.S. cities hosting World Cup games are preparing for a wave of foreign visitors and media. But they also house large immigrant communities facing increased enforcement and surveillance. The administration has not clarified whether there will be any safeguards for undocumented or mixed-status fans, workers or residents near these events. 

On the contrary, Trump has ordered immigration agents to intensify arrests and deportations in Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles and New York — both key sites for World Cup matches. Immigrants are staying home, afraid that they could be picked up on their way to or from work.

This is a self-inflicted wound. Without a reliable workforce and a welcoming environment for international travelers, the U.S. could turn two marquee events into cautionary tales. Even if the administration relaxes certain policies temporarily to facilitate the World Cup and Olympics, the damage to America's image and economy may already be done.

Hosting global events is more than a point of pride — it's a test of openness, security and competence. A successful World Cup and Olympics would show the world that the U.S. remains dynamic, open and capable. But if fear and red tape define the visitor experience, we would send another message entirely: America isn't worth the trouble.

That wouldn't just be a lost opportunity but an unforced economic and diplomatic error.

Even though Chelsea's form was up and down in the 2024/25 season, it turned out to be a memorable one.

The Blues wrapped up a long campaign by finishing fourth in the Premier League to seal Champions League qualification. On top of that, they also won both the Conference League and the Club World Cup to collect two pieces of silverware.

It turned out to be a very successful debut year for Enzo Maresca, 45, as the head coach at Stamford Bridge.

Maresca's main target at Chelsea next season is to secure Champions League qualification again. We would expect it to be hard to silence the expectation and excitement around the talented young squad of players, though.

Chelsea have become a footballing powerhouse in the 21st century, signing some of the world's best stars over and over again. However, they may have just had a renewed boost from what they achieved last season.

According to The Telegraph, the fact that Chelsea won the Club World Cup and qualified for next year's Champions League has elevated them in the eyes of players based outside England.

Chelsea were always taking the Club World Cup seriously because of the financial benefits of the summer tournament. It's turned out that it could be huge for new signings, too, because players overseas are more attracted to the project in West London.

RB Leipzig's Xavi Simons really wants to join Chelsea, where the 22-year-old attacker would get to play for the club side who call themselves world champions.

If Chelsea are popular globally right now, perhaps now is the time to strike while the iron is hot in the transfer market.

In fairness, the Blues squad is finally coming together as it gels into something with major potential. It may need some tweaks to get competing against the very best teams on a consistent basis next term.

Chelsea have discussed two more signings, one offensive and one defensive, to improve Maresca's squad.

Our urgent message to the club's sporting directors, Laurence Stewart and Paul Winstanley, is to ensure they don't miss out on signing a new left-back to provide some much-needed support for Marc Cucurella.

The Athletic's Deal Sheet this week has an interesting – and frustrating – paragraph about one Chelsea fan favourite.

The Blues have made some good progress on sales in the last week – Noni Madueke and Djordje Petrovic have both left permanently, while a trickle of loans out is also beginning, with Caleb Wiley the latest to go.

Then there's the host of returning loan players and unwanted Blues of various shapes and sizes – Axel Disasi, Lesley Ugochukwu, Joao Felix and so on.

But as well as the spare parts, it seems that a first team regular is still up for sale. Trevoh Chalobah has proved his quality time and again, and we really thought that a lack of rumours about a departure this summer meant that he had finally convinced those in charge he was good enough to keep around.

Starting the Club World Cup final seemed like evidence he had sold Enzo Maresca on his quality. But it seems not.

This piece claims that despite the fact that Chalobah has “established himself as a first team regular since returning from loan at Crystal Palace in January”, the club are “open to offers.”

Somehow Wesley Fofana is “considered to be ahead of him in the pecking order”, despite his chronic injury issues.

We wouldn't be surprised if these continued slaps in the face convince Chalobah he should move on anyway. As the article says “Chalobah may also decide his future is better served elsewhere.”

With Mamadou Sarr having rejoined Strasbourg on loan, selling Chalobah while Fofana is still so unreliable surely couldn't happen without another defender coming in. Levi Colwill is liked but Benoit Badiashile has failed to work his way into the team ahead of Chalobah.

Chelsea star Marc Cucurella has admitted he was 'scared s***less' by Donald Trump when the US president gatecrashed their Club World Cup lift. 

Trump became an unexpected participant in Chelsea's celebrations after they beat PSG 3-0 as he lingered on the stage while Reece James held the trophy aloft. 

As the players danced around at the MetLife Stadium, Trump continued to stand among them clapping and smiling, much to the confusion of just about everybody - especially Cole Palmer. 

Cucurella told Spanish journalist Gerard Romero: 'We had been told that, as a rule, Donald Trump would come to present us with the trophy and that we couldn't lift it until he left.

'And of course, we were all there waiting for him to leave, but the guy didn't want to leave, and on top of that, we looked at him and he said, "Get him up, I'll stay here, and so on."

'And I wondered who would say anything to him, you know... I was scared s***less!'

Marc Cucurella say she was 'scared s***less' when Donald Trump gatecrashed Chelsea

The US president bizarrely stood by as Chelsea lifted the Club World Cup earlier this month

The team knew he would be part of the ceremony but not the celebrations, says Cucurella

The US President had arrived to a chorus of cheers at MetLife Stadium and watched on as Chelsea secured a surprise 3-0 win against PSG, with Palmer scoring a brace while Joao Pedro was also on target.

Roughly 35 minutes before kickoff, Trump and wife Melania arrived at the nearby Teterboro Airport on the presidential Marine One helicopter from his local golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. 

The 79-year-old was given VIP treatment as he soaked up the action alongside First Lady Melania, who cut a chic figure in a white dress and black blazer, and FIFA President Gianni Infantino.

But Trump's crowning moment came after the final whistle when he took centre stage as the trophy was given to Chelsea.

It was anticipated that the Commander-in-Chief would step aside after giving the trophy to Chelsea captain James - as is customary. 

However, to the bewilderment of many Chelsea players, Trump remained on stage for the entire trophy lift.

Palmer, who really was the star of the show on the day, was astonished. An expression of disgust washed over his face. 'What's he doing?' he asked his team-mates. 

Speaking afterwards, the England star was honest but slightly more measured than his facial contortions had suggested. 

Cole Palmer looked baffled as Commander-in-Chief Trump joined their trophy celebrations

Trump had played a key role in presenting tournament awards following the final

'I knew he was going to be here but I didn't know he was going to be on the stand when we lifted the trophy so I was a bit confused, yeah,' he said.

Trump had earlier presented Palmer with the golden ball award with the 23-year-old midfielder looking as equally baffled during that presentation.

After presenting medals to both the victors and losers, the Trmup was front and center as the Blues hoisted the trophy.

Following his presentation of the trophy to Chelsea, he was asked to leave the stage by Infantino but bizarrely chose to stay put.

Marc Cucurella, fresh off winning the FIFA Club World Cup with Chelsea, has weighed in on Marcus Rashford's loan move to Barcelona, sharing his thoughts on how the England international might adapt to Spanish football. 

Rashford joined Barça on loan from Manchester United until the end of the season, a transfer that has sparked plenty of debate and excitement across Europe.

Speaking in an interview with Jijantes, Cucurella expressed his belief that Rashford has what it takes to succeed at Barcelona, but he also pointed out that the winger will soon realise the differences between the Premier League and La Liga.

“He's very fast and I think he'll notice the difference in pace between the leagues,” Cucurella explained.  

“The Premier League is quicker, more physical, but in La Liga you have to adapt to a different style of play. 

“I believe Marcus can do quite a lot of work in Spain because of his speed and quality, but he will have to adjust.”

In addition to his views on Rashford, Cucurella also spoke about Barcelona's recent progress under Hansi Flick. The Chelsea defender admitted he was impressed by Barça's performances last season.  

“I was very surprised; I didn't expect it,” he said, acknowledging the improvements the Catalan giants have made since Flick took over.

Rashford's move to Barça is seen as one of the safest transfers of the summer. After a mixed season at Manchester United and Aston Villa, the England international now faces the challenge of proving himself in a new league and under a new system. 

As such, a lot of former players, including Rio Ferdinand and Gary Lineker, have voiced their opinion about the transfer and considering their takes, it is safe to say that he is likely to leave a strong impression.

Chelsea have officially updated their honours board to reflect their status as the 'first ever' Club World Cup champions.

The Blues beat Champions League winners, and favourites for the Club World Cup, Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the final of the tournament just over a week ago.

It was a shock result, but an emphatic win on the night, with Chelsea taking home the all-new trophy, as well as a hefty cash prize in the first iteration of the tournament in its 32-team format. It had previously been fought between just six or eight teams.

After the Blues' victory, it was announced that previous winners of the Club World Cup would now be known as 'FIFA Intercontinental Champions', with FIFA themselves dubbing Enzo Maresca's side as 'the first ever FIFA CWC Champions' on social media.

This means that the the likes of Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona are effectively no longer world champions, while Chelsea also previously won the trophy in 2021.

And the Blues have been quick to reflect the change in direction when updating their club honours board.

The Blues' website has updated their triumph in the previous iteration of the competition

Alongside Chelsea, Liverpool (above), Man United and Man City also won the tournament

On Chelsea's website under the 'Men's trophy cabinet' section, a new addition was noticed by eagle-eyed fans.

Listing their triumphs below a section of text that read: 'Chelsea have won it all! Here we detail each and every one of our major trophy triumphs...,' the club added the FIFA Club World Cup from 2025.

This was followed by a change to their triumph in the tournament's previous iteration, with this listed as the 'FIFA Intercontinental Cup (formerly FIFA Club World Cup)' from 2021.

Back then, Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 after extra time in the final thanks to a late Kai Havertz penalty.  

City won the original competition in 2023, Liverpool lifted it in 2019 and United in 2008.

However, as of Tuesday morning, the three other English sides were yet to follow Chelsea's example in changing their honours roll.

All of City, Liverpool and United were still listed as previous FIFA Club World Cup champions on their websites.

Meanwhile, the competition had first been played in 2000 as the Club World Championship.

It returned in 2005, and was played annually until 2023, before adopting its current form as the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in light of the Club World Cup this summer.

Real Madrid won it the most times with five - most recently in 2022 - while Barcelona won it four times, and Corinthians and Bayern Munich twice. 

Real won the FIFA Intercontinental Cup in 2024, and it will return in 2025 where PSG will be representing Europe by virtue of winning Champions League.

After a first round loss at Wimbledon last month the world No. 6 has announced that she will be sitting out the US Open next month.

Chinese tennis star Zheng Qinwen has announced her decision to withdraw from the US Open next month, citing fitness concerns as the reason. 

Zheng, who won Olympic gold in the singles competition at the Paris Olympic Games, has been struggling with an elbow injury in recent months and has undergone surgery. She underwent arthroscopic surgery earlier this month, after a disappointing first round exit at Wimbledon. 

“Over the past months, I've been dealing with persistent pain in my right elbow during training and matches,” she explained. “Despite trying various treatments to manage it, the discomfort never fully went away.”

The recovery is expected to take months so it was no major surprise that she will not be fit to compete at the US Open from August 24. Nevertheless, the absence of one of the world's best young players will be a disappointment for fans in attendance in New York. 

Still only 22 years old, Zheng was ranked as high as No. 4 in the WTA world rankings last month. She has won five career singles titles, including that triumph at the Paris Olympics. 

She is still awaiting her first Grand Slam win but she made the final of the Australian Open last year. She has also made the quarter-finals on three separate occasions, twice at the US Open and once at the French Open. 

Zheng will not get the chance to improve on that record at Flushing Meadows next month. However her withdrawal does give an opportunity to Leolia Jeanjean, the 29-year-old from France currently ranked No. 99 in the world. Jeanjean has never made it past the first round at the US Open.

An Open Era record of eight Czech players have reached the Livesport Prague Open last 16, including top seed Linda Noskova, Katerina Siniakova and Tereza Valentova.

The Livesport Prague Open has often functioned as a showcase of the remarkable Czech talent conveyor belt, with five of its 10 editions since 2015 ending in a home champion being crowned.

Prague: Scores | Draws | Order of play

This year, that's even more the case than ever. Eleven Czech players -- five direct entrants, two qualifiers and four wild cards -- started in the 32-strong main draw. The only tour-level event in the Open Era with more was Roland Garros 2023, a 128-player draw featuring 12 Czechs.

Even more impressively, eight of those 11 won their openers, meaning that half of the last 16 is comprised of Czech players -- an Open Era record. (The previous record of seven Czechs in a tour-level Round of 16 was also set at Prague, unsurprisingly, in both 2015 and 2016.)

Indeed, of the three Czech first-round losses, two came in matchups between home players -- meaning that only one Czech fell to a foreign opponent (qualifier Jesika Maleckova to Slovakian No. 2 seed Rebecca Sramkova).

While only two of the Czechs in the draw are seeded - No. 1 Linda Noskova, the 2023 finalist, and No. 5 Marie Bouzkova, the 2022 champion -- six are aged 21 or under, emphasizing the country's plethora of up-and-coming talent. They include Noskova, currently at a career high of No. 23 after making the Wimbledon fourth round; 2024 Roland Garros junior champion Tereza Valentova, 18, who has won her first two WTA 125 titles in the past seven weeks and is now ranked No. 106; and former junior No. 1 Lucie Havlickova, 20, on the comeback trail after being sidelined for 15 months.

Dominika Salkova, 21, reached the second round of Prague for the third time; Barbora Palicova, also 21, notched her first career WTA main-draw victory; and Sara Bejlek, 19, made a victorious return from a month-long injury layoff that forced her to miss Wimbledon. Meanwhile, 29-year-old Katerina Siniakova successfully held it down for the older Czech generation.

Moreover, the youngest Czech player in the draw, 17-year-old Alena Kovackova, also put together a career-best tournament by qualifying for her first WTA main draw with wins over Arina Rodionova and Lucrezia Stefanini. Kovackova's 15-year-old sister Jana, the junior No. 9, also received a qualifying wild card, where she stretched Nina Stojanovic to three sets in the first round.

Looking ahead, there could be more records still to be set. The current record number of Czechs in a tour-level quarterfinal lineup is six, and the record number in a tour-level semifinal lineup is three, both set -- surprise! -- at Prague 2015. This week, seven Czechs could potentially make the last eight, and there is at least one home player in each quarter -- meaning there could be an all-Czech semifinal slate on Friday.

There have been eight all-Czech WTA finals since the country's independence in 1993, of which the latest was Siniakova's defeat of Bouzkova at Nanchang 2023.

Swiss star Stan Wawrinka has continued to defy the odds following his latest ATP Tour victory

Wawrinka, a three-time major winner, is most certainly in the twilight of his career. However, despite his status as a 40-year-old man, Wawrinka has shown no signs of slowing down, competing in various ATP Tour and Challenger events throughout 2025.

On Monday, Wawrinka secured a first round win at the Umag Open in Croatia, defeating Alvaro Guillen Meza 6-4 6-1.

Meza, 18 years Wawrinka's junior, struggled to cope on his second serve, winning only 17 per cent of those points.

By defeating the young Ecuadorian, Wawrinka matched an achievement also completed by five-time US Open champion, Jimmy Connors.

Wawrinka, who has achieved Grand Slam final wins over Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic during his illustrious career, recorded his second ATP Tour victory of the season against Alvaro Guillen Meza.

As per OptaAce, since 1990 when Stan Wawrinka is the fourth player aged over 40 years old to win multiple matches at ATP-level events after Jimmy Connors, Feliciano Lopez and Ivo Karlovic.

Wawrinka only had one ATP Tour win in 2025 before defeating Meza. This came at the Bucharest Open in  April, where he beat Timofey Skatov 6-4 6-7 7-6.

Many may have expected Wawrinka to slow down once he reached 40. However, he has demonstrated his innate resilience, much like Venus Williams at the Washington Open.

Wawrinka has slipped down the rankings since the heights of Grand Slam triumph and is now sitting at 156 in the world. He is currently projected to rise seven places to 149, as per the ATP live rankings.

The Swiss player could rise even further if he beats his second round opponent in Umag on Wednesday.

Like Stan Wawrinka, Damir Dzumhur is also entering the twilight of his career.

The 33-year-old Bosnian player has enjoyed a storied career on the ATP Tour, reaching a career-high of 23 in 2018.

Remarkably, perhaps the biggest win of Dzumhur's career came against Wawrinka. Back in 2017, Wawrinka was ranked number three in the world and was the US Open defending champion. However, he could not match Dzumhur at the Dubai Tennis Championships, the Bosnian winning 7-6 6-3.

Incredibly, Dzumhur beat Wawrinka again in 2019, this time at the Geneva Open. Dzumhur won by a scoreline of 3-6 6-3 6-4.

Wawrinka won another two encounters at the 2018 St Petersburg Open and 2020 Australian Open, leaving their head-to-head record at two wins apiece.

Wawrinka and Dzumhur's meeting in Umag could end up being the decider in careers that have spanned a combined 37 years.

If you ever wondered what happens to the thousands of tennis balls used during Wimbledon after the championships are over, you can rest assured that they're going to a good cause.

In a heartwarming twist to the iconic tennis championships, organizers have donated many of the tennis balls to serve as shelters for field mice in the UK.

While many of the balls make their way to England's field mice, Wimbledon also sells some of its used tennis balls on-site at the tournament. The proceeds typically benefit the Wimbledon Foundation.

The eco-friendly mice initiative, which many fans don't know about, has supported British wildlife for years.

Tiny Harvest mice across the pond, which are about the size of a thumb, typically lived in tall grass in the countryside for protection against predators. However, they've faced habitat loss over the years due to industrial farming methods and changes in weather patterns making a it a concern for conservationists.

In the early 2000s, Wimbledon organizers entered into a partnership with the All England Lawn Tennis Club and Wildlife Trust to help get the balls repurposed into homes for the tiny critters.

The tennis balls are attached to poles with a small hole cut into them, making it a perfectly ready-made shelter for the mammals, especially for nesting females.

It's not just a win for wildlife, but also a small gesture that can have a big impact.

The sight of a harvest mouse peeking its head out of a bright ball has become a charming symbol of how major sporting events can make a big serve, not just on the scoreboard.

Wimbledon may be known for fierce competition on the court, however, the fuzzy yellow tennis balls turned into mouse mansions have social media abuzz.

After several photos of the repurposed mouse homes went viral on X, fans started raving about the eco-conscious initiative calling it the "cutest sustainability story of the summer."

One user wrote on X, "This is the sweetest idea! Look how happy they are!"

"This is so cool," another person wrote.

"From Centre Court to mouse resort Wimbledon's real champions might be the harvest mice," a third person said.

"Turning tennis balls into mouse shelters—ingenious! Who would've thought tennis balls could serve as 'real estate' for mice? That's creativity in action," another person commented.

"My day is happier now that I learned this," someone else wrote.

Harvest mice are Britain's tiniest rodent. They're not considered pests themselves, and in fact are actually seen as pest control; they prey on agricultural pests, saving farmers on pesticides. They also take their place in the food chain, supporting predators like hawks and owls, which supports overall biodiversity.

The mice's habitats are increasingly being infringed upon by human development. In order to provide them a safe place to live, British conservation consortium The Wildlife Trusts provides readymade nests for them—by cutting holes in tennis balls donated by Wimbledon:

 

The balls are attached to poles that are placed in field. The mice, talented climbers, readily populate them.





Wimbledon goes through some 55,000 tennis balls with each competition, so unlike Britain's human denizens, the harvest mice will suffer no housing crisis.

The 22-year-old US Open finalist talked in DC about opening up her DMs in the hopes of meeting someone special in Montréal.ByDavid KanePublished Jul 22, 2025 copy_link

WASHINGTON, DC—Have you ever dreamed of dating a professional tennis player? Leylah Fernandez's DMs are open.The 2021 US Open finalist surprised social media over the weekend with a charmingly earnest appeal to the men of Montréal, hoping to go on her very first date during the National Bank Open next week.“There've been a lot of responses,” she exclaimed after winning her first round at the Mubadala Citi DC Open on Monday. “I think the first day, there were maybe over 100 messages. I've got a lot of options.”Fresh off an emphatic D.C. victory over Maya Joint, Fernandez told me the clarion call came out of a conversation with father and coach Jorge earlier this summer.

“My dad point blank asked me if I'd gone on a date yet, and I told him I hadn't,” she recalled, adding with a laugh, “I've never really had the time, and no one's really asked me, which, I don't know why!“He suggested I post a video on Instagram and have a date in Montréal where you feel at home and you feel comfortable.”There was only one caveat.“Of course, he was like, ‘But, he has to meet me first!'

At this age, we're all either studying or going to sports competitions, so reading those messages not only makes me feel better and like I'm not the odd one out, but it's also pretty cool that we're able to have those conversations together.”

The move is reminiscent of one made by fellow Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who took fan John Goehrke to a Brooklyn Nets game after a back and forth on Twitter. The 2014 Wimbledon finalist is in the midst of winding down her tennis career, planning to play her final tournament in Montréal, and was supportive of Fernandez in her quest for love (or something like it).“I personally love interacting with fans and I think they appreciate that I do that,” she told me after her doubles match against Venus Williams on Monday. “I believe it creates a fun atmosphere and community.“I hope she vets the person beforehand; that's what I did before my Twitter date. I did a background check on my guy, so as long as she does that, we're all good. I hope she has a great time, and she'd better thank me for that idea.”Fernandez, who listed Ryan Gosling among her celebrity crushes and his 2024 film The Fall Guy as her favorite rom-com, sketched out her ideal first date—envisioning the standard trip to a coffee shop and a walk around the park—and hopes to take the classic “one match at a time” approach to her dating pool debut.

“I've never been on one date before, so I just want to experience how it goes from there. We're not going to think too much ahead.“It's also about getting to know each other, what his hobbies are and what he likes. He can ask me the same because, yeah, I'm a tennis player but that's not all I am. It's just about having a little conversation and seeing if there's a mutual interest.”Though love can blossom on tour, Bouchard noted the pitfalls of long-distance relationships and cautioned against players mixing personal and professional lives.

“With our lifestyle, it has to be long distance, and long distance is just so hard. I've had some relationships like that and they've been great, but it's been hard to build a foundation and have stability—unless you want to date someone on the tour, which I highly recommend you don't do.“My DMs are always open until there's a ring!” she joked.Fernandez promised to keep fans in the loop once the date is set, but don't expect a Bachelor-style production.“I want to keep that part private and I want to keep it fair for the person with me,” she said, adding with a hopeful smile, “We'll see!”

While it may have been a surprise for attendees, according to the ATP tour, Federer has dropped in before: Federer was on hand when the academy opened in 2016, and again to tour its 2024 expansion.Later, the two traded tennis courts for the putting greens of the famed Pula Golf Resort, where they played a round of golf together.But Federer wasn't the only famous face on campus in the days after Wimbledon. Alexander Zverev tuned up for the upcoming summer hard-court season by practicing at the academy under the watchful eye of Toni Nadal.

Jessica Pegula says that she has ‘processed' her Wimbledon upset ‘pretty fast', revealing that she recognised a crucial improvement in Iga Swiatek's game during their recent grass-court clash.

The American's most recent match was a first-round Wimbledon clash against former world No 29 Elisabetta Cocciaretto, being shocked 6-2, 6-3 in just 58 minutes.

Pegula is now due to face off with former US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez in the second round of the WTA 500 event in Washington.

“Yeah, I mean, it's (the Wimbledon loss) disappointing, but it was almost like I got killed, like, so bad that you're kind of just like, okay, just flush that one and move on,” said Pegula.

“There's not much to really say or do. It was a bad match for me, but at the same time, she played great and it was a great moment for her.

“So I feel like I always try to look at things with a good perspective that sometimes it's not always your moment. Sometimes it's the other person's moment.

“I mean, I have had it be my moment quite a bit, so I think I tried to look at that with that perspective that it wasn't the week for me, and I just want to take as much as I can and what I have learned from that match and kind of incorporate that into the couple of weeks. But again, it's not like rewriting the wheel and having to change a bunch of things just because of one match.

“You know, so I think I processed it pretty fast. The good thing is I was able to be home and get two really solid weeks at home before coming on the hard-court swing. It was really nice being home and spending time with my family and getting in a good training block.”

The loss at the grass-court Grand Slam was even more surprising given that Pegula had lifted the trophy at the WTA 500 tournament in Bad Homburg just a few days prior, defeating Iga Swiatek 6-4, 7-5 to cap off an excellent week of tennis.

Ultimately, it was the Pole who lifted the Venus Rosewater Dish at Wimbledon to claim her sixth Grand Slam – her first title since the French Open in 2024.

The world No 4 was particularly impressed by Swiatek's serving during their Bad Homburg meeting, something which translated well at SW19.

“I thought she was serving a lot bigger [at Bad Homburg],” analysed Pegula.

“I didn't really watch her much during Wimbledon. I'm not sure if that was better. But she was serving really big in Bad Homburg and playing good tennis and beat good grass-court players. I thought our final was a really high level. It was super close.

“You know, she is always kind of down on herself about grass, and I was, like, Hey, you're playing really good on grass. I'm not really sure why you think you're bad on grass or what it is.

“So it was kind of funny that she ended up winning Wimbledon. I was, like, of course I said that, and we had that moment and we played in the final, and then she wins Wimbledon, but that's just tennis for you. You kind of never know. She's a great player anyway, so she's going to be good on any surface.

“But yeah, it is interesting for — tennis is weird. You have a lot of weird things that happen over the course of two weeks.”

The Citi DC Open undoubtedly holds a special place in Pegula's heart, being the site of her first singles title.

In 2019, whilst ranked as the world No 79, dominated Camila Giorgi 6-2, 6-2 in the showpiece match – launching her closer to the WTA's top 50.

“It was a huge breakthrough for me as a player,” Pegula reminisced.

“It was the first professional title I had ever won. I never even won a challenger singles title.

“So for me, getting that monkey off my back, being able to do it at a tour level for the first time was great, and to think that was such a big mountain for me to climb at the time and now I'm sitting here and I have won, I don't know, eight or nine or whatever it is, and doubles titles, as well, it's kind of funny how things can seem far away, but once you do them it becomes easier, it's less of a mountain to get over.

“But it definitely was a really fun week for me here, and I still feel like I have those memories every time I come back. I know so many of the volunteers and the people that work this tournament, from the security to the transport that have seen me and helped me over all the last four or five, whatever I'm on, six years ago? Over the last six years.

“So it's been really cool, and I still have that same kind of feeling every time I come back here, and that's why I always feel like I can play good tennis here and have some good results. So, yeah, I love coming back here.”

The American will be hoping to build her hard-court form ahead of the US Open, with her highlights at the Grand Slam being a quarter-final appearance in 2022 and a final showing in 2024.


                Most of the WTA's biggest stars are set to be in WTA 1000 action in Montreal.            


                Iga Swiatek has been branded "the best player this century."            


                Iga Swiatek and Jannik Sinner may want the story around their failed drug tests to be forgotten, but it has been revived after their Wimbledon wins.            


                The Brit will have a prime opportunity to avenge her loss from two months ago.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa have withdrawn from the star-studded doubles event at the US Open next month.

An updated entry list has been unveiled, with Tsitsipas and Badosa one of two pairs to have quietly pulled out.

British No.1 Jack Draper and Qinwen Zheng are also no longer on the list, with both players suffering from recent injuries. 

But the popular duo, often nicknamed 'Tsitsidosa', are the main ones to stand out after deciding to no longer feature.

Their withdrawal will only increase rumours of the couple splitting up, following reports during Wimbledon. 

Fans spotted that they had unfollowed each other on Instagram and posts of them together had been deleted.

Tsitipas and Badosa had been considered a tennis 'power couple' and first started dating in 2023. 

However, only a day after both of them were beaten in the opening round at Wimbledon, reports of a break-up swirled. 

HOLA.com said that sources have confirmed their split, with one saying: "The break-up just happened. They both lost in the first round in London and everything has come together for them."

The women's World No.10 and men's World No.29 will now not be taking part in the revamped US Open doubles event. 

Badosa is also said to be carrying an ongoing injury issue, which could potentially be a reason for their withdrawal.

There has been no official confirmation of why they pulled out, but both players remain on the singles entry list.

Tsitsipas has a poor record at major tournaments this year heading into the US Open, only winning once in 2025.

The Greek star was openly criticised by his coach at SW19 and he will want a major improvement at Flushing Meadows.

Meanwhile, alongside a quick exit at Wimbledon, Badosa failed to make it past the round of 32 at Roland Garros after reaching the semi-finals at the Australian Open.

It will be all eyes on the singles for both stars now, following their withdrawal from the doubles competition.

The US Open Mixed Doubles Championship will be staged across two days in New York City, beginning on August 19. 

A total of 16 teams will compete for a $1million prize.

Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu are the standout pairing, with Wimbledon champion Jannik Sinner playing with Emma Navarro.

Novak Djokovic is teaming up with Olga Danilovic, Iga Swiatek joins Casper Ruud and Taylor Fritz plays with Elena Rybakina.

Women's World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka will feature with Grigor Dimitrov and Jessica Pegula combines with Tommy Paul.

Nick Kyrgios is planning to return to action too, pairing up with Naomi Osaka for the event in New York.

After two teams pulled out, there have also been some new names added to the entry list. 

Amanda Anisimova and Holger Rune will pair up, while couple Katie Boulter and Alex de Minaur will play together too.

Holger Rune has appointed renowned fitness trainer Marco Panichi, who has previously worked with both Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner.

Panichi worked with Djokovic from 2017 until April 2024, before he joined Sinner's team in September 2024 alongside Djokovic's former physiotherapist Ulises Badio.

Sinner fired both Panichi and Badio on the eve of the 2025 Wimbledon Championships, where he went on to claim his fourth Grand Slam title.

Rune‘s mother and manager Aneke Rune has revealed to Danish outlet BT that Panichi will join the world No 9's team.

“We will welcome Marco Panichi to the team,” Aneke Rune said. “He brings enormous experience – not just in the physical aspect, but everything related to building a Grand Slam winner. That takes the idea up another notch.

“We know Marco very well and have always had a really good relationship with him. And he has always liked Holger. He is in a special class, so it is a huge capacity to have in the team.

“The way he works, and the way he worked with Novak Djokovic, is very much the way we see a fitness coach in a team where he will also be active in training.”

According to BT, Panichi will start working with Rune at the Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati, which will begin on August 7.

Carlos Alcaraz apologises to fans as he reveals reason for key schedule decision

Addressing his decision to part ways with Panichi and Badio before Wimbledon, Sinner said: “No, nothing major happened. Nothing big happened. I parted ways not long ago, but it's not affecting me.

“We've reached incredible results in the past with them, so obviously huge thanks to them. We made some great job, but I decided to do something different.”

Rune, who will compete at the ATP 500 tournament in Washington this week, recently revealed he has sought advice from tennis legend Andre Agassi.

“I reached out to him (Agassi) some months ago,” the 22-year-old said in Washington.

“He's an amazing man, first of all, and he's very wise, as well. He sees the game in a unique way that I've never experienced before.

“I thought now was a good moment to reach out to Agassi because my base is back and I'm playing well again. When you're changing coaches a lot, you don't play as well because you're not following one opinion or a single structure.

“I thought this was the right time to get some extra input. It's not anything magic, but he obviously had some very wise words I can use.”

The controversial US Open mixed doubles event continues to be changed after the full entry list has been announced.

This year has seen the US Open completely overhaul the mixed doubles event, giving priority to singles players instead of doubles specialists.

Singles players getting priority is not the only change that they have made, with the US Open being heavily criticised for what they have done.

Despite the backlash, the US Open initially announced a blockbuster lineup of mixed doubles teams, but two of those have now withdrawn after the full entry list has been announced.

Some of the standout pairings in the initial announcement of mixed doubles teams were Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, Jannik Sinner and Emma Navarro, as well as Jack Draper and Qinwen Zheng.

However, one of those teams has now been removed from the entry list after withdrawing.

After undergoing surgery, Olympic champion Zheng has officially withdrawn from the US Open, consequently calling an end to any hopes of her playing alongside Draper in New York.

Both members of that team are currently struggling due to injury, with Draper also withdrawing from two upcoming tournaments due to an arm problem.

They are not the only team to have withdrawn from the event, with Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa also pulling out.

Although Badosa has recently struggled with injury issues, it appears that there may be another reason for this withdrawal.

Tsitsipas and Badosa were in a romantic relationship for nearly two years, but it has recently been reported that they have now parted ways and this seems to be the more likely reason for them pulling out of the US Open.

While these two teams have exited the US Open mixed doubles draw, there have also been 11 additions to the entry list.

These new teams include Wimbledon finalist Amanda Anisimova and Holger Rune, Venus Williams and Reilly Opelka, as well as a remaining tennis couple in Alex de Minaur and Katie Boulter.

There are now 25 teams in the lineup for the US Open mixed doubles event next month, but only 16 of them will actually be able to play.

The 16 teams for the US Open mixed doubles event this year are decided in two ways, eight through their combined singles ranking and the other eight will be through wildcards given by the tournament.

Currently the top ranked doubles team is Sinner and Navarro, with a combined ranking of just 12.

Although the ATP world number one should safely be into the US Open mixed doubles draw, Aryna Sabalenka currently sits in ninth place alongside her currently injured partner Grigor Dimitrov.

There is still a month to go until the US Open mixed doubles event takes place, with rankings still expected to change in that time.

The US Open mixed doubles event will take place on August 19-20.

Holger Rune has reportedly hired Marco Panichi, the fitness trainer who left Jannik Sinner's team days before Wimbledon started. Panichi and physiotherapist Ulises Badio, who previously worked with Novak Djokovic, joined the world No. 1's team last year. But Sinner confirmed that he'd parted ways with both men before turning up to SW19.

Sinner still went on to lift his fourth Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, overcoming an elbow injury without the help of his own personal fitness coach. And Panichi has also moved on, as he is set to start working with world No. 9 Rune next month.

According to Danish outlet BT, Rune's mum and manager, Aneke, confirmed that Panichi will join the camp at next month's Cincinnati Open.

“We will welcome Marco Panichi to the team. He brings enormous experience - not just in the physical aspect, but everything related to building a Grand Slam winner. That takes the idea up another notch,” Aneke said.

“We know Marco very well and have always had a really good relationship with him. And he has always liked Holger. He is in a special class, so it is a huge capacity to have in the team.

“The way he works, and the way he worked with Novak Djokovic, is very much the way we see a fitness coach in a team where he will also be active in training.”



Rune has worked with plenty of high-profile coaches in his time, including Boris Becker and Patrick Mouratoglou. But the 22-year-old went back to basics and has spent this season with Lars Christensen.

The five-time title winner also enjoyed a three-day training block with Andre Agassi ahead of this week's ATP 500 event in Washington. Rune reached out to the retired tennis icon months ago and sees Agassi as more of a mentor.

After their brief stint on the practice courts, Rune told the ATP: “It was a really short period but definitely he gave me an insight of where he sees me in the future, where he sees me now and obviously there's a lot of things to improve.

“He helped me to get my focus and my eyes on the right things, together with my coach Lars. It was really cool to spend some days with him.”

Sinner has yet to announce who his replacement fitness trainer and physiotherapist will be after parting ways with Panichi and Badio. Ahead of Wimbledon, the Italian confirmed they had split after the ATP 500 in Halle, where he suffered a shock loss in the round of 16.

“No, nothing major happened. Nothing big happened. I parted ways not long ago, but it's not affecting me. I feel ready to compete. I feel free. I feel me and my team, we are ready to do the best we can,” he said.

“As I said, there's not one specific thing. Nothing crazy happened. That's for sure not. As I said, we made some great work. For me, the final in Roland Garros was an amazing achievement. That's it. Look, in this sport, things can happen. There is nothing incredible, no, because sometimes a player feels something different, and that's my case.”

Carlos Alcaraz has confirmed his withdrawal from the 2025 Canadian Open and outlined the reason for his decision.

The ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Toronto will begin on July 27 — just two weeks after Alcaraz‘s four-set loss to world No 1 Jannik Sinner in the Wimbledon final.

In a post on X, Alcaraz wrote: “After many consecutive weeks of competition without rest, I will not be able to play in Toronto this year.

“I have small muscles issues and I need to recover physically and mentally for what comes next. To the tournament and to my fans in Canada I am very sorry, I will see you next year!”

The world No 2 also missed the 2024 Canadian Open in Montreal, which was played directly after the Paris Olympics.

This year's Canadian Open will be the first edition of the event held over the two-week (12 day), 96-player format that the ATP Tour has implemented at seven of the nine Masters tournaments.

Prior to the changes, seven of the nine Masters tournaments were played over a single week and featured 56-player singles draws.

Carlos Alcaraz makes key schedule decision as big tournament rocked by another major blow

Will Jannik Sinner & Carlos Alcaraz's Canadian Open withdrawals affect world No 1 battle?

Alcaraz is one of several high-profile players who has criticised the expanded Masters 1000 format.

In April, the Spaniard said: “The one week ones are better. Some will think that in two weeks there are days of rest, but that is not the case.

“You train, you have to mentally prepare for the game, prepare for it… you're not resting, really. It's two full weeks. That's why I prefer the one-week Masters 1000. For me, it's better for tennis.”

Alcaraz's withdrawal means four of the top six players in the world will be absent from the event after Sinner, Novak Djokovic and Jack Draper also pulled out.

In a statement, Sinner said: “I'm really disappointed to be missing the National Bank Open in Toronto, especially as I have such fond memories of playing in Canada.

“Winning that title in Toronto two years ago was the start of a really special moment for me, but after speaking with my team, I have to prioritise my health.

“I would like to thank Karl Hale, the Tournament Director, for everything he does and I'm looking forward to returning to Canada and Toronto in the future to play in front of the great fans.”

The ATP Tour in recent days has been rocked with some big news involving Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner. 

After the Mubadala Citi DC Open in Washington, the attention will turn towards a Canadian swing and, in particular, the Toronto Open, which is a big tournament before the US Open. 

However, the two best players in world tennis have now pulled the plug on their participation, along with others such as Jack Draper and Novak Djokovic, as they bid to prepare properly for the US Open instead. 

This situation merely serves to highlight just how tough the ATP Tour is right now and once again, the players have been having discussions about the demands of the schedule in its current form. 

The withdrawals of a number of top players means that Fritz will start the tournament as the number one seed as the highest-ranked player. 

The Wimbledon semi-finalist could see this as a good opportunity to get another title under his belt, but it would appear that he also has some concerns over the schedule in its current format. 

He said in a press conference: “Yeah, I think, I mean, probably pretty much all the players for a long time have been asking for the season to be shorter, but all we are doing is just lengthening it, adding more stuff, we're adding more, like, longer tournaments. 

“The Hopman Cup was after Wimbledon. I didn't even know this was going on. They had an event with Felix and Cobolli playing a tournament right after Wimbledon and one of them is coming and playing here. It's insane, we are just adding stuff to the calendar over and over again.

“I think they shortened parts to obviously give themselves an extra week to do this, to make it the three weeks between the two tournaments, but we should just be – you know, I think it's funny how we can shorten, we find ways to shorten the schedule to make room for other tournaments, but we can't find room to shorten the schedule just for there to be nothing. I'd love to see it go back to just two weeks and maybe we can have an extra, can shorten the season a week, I don't know. But it's a lot of tennis. It's a lot of tennis upcoming.”

The American number one is making a lot of sense with these comments, but he certainly doesn't appear to be showing the signs of a player in need of a rest. 

Fritz is playing extremely well at the moment and was brilliant as he enjoyed a solid run to the last four at Wimbledon earlier this month. 

At 27, Fritz will be desperate to end his wait to win a Grand Slam title and at last year's US Open, he reached the final before going down to Sinner in the final. 

The Toronto Open will now be a tournament that Fritz is eagerly anticipating and given the current field, it would be hard to imagine the player not enjoying a deep run. 

The ATP Tour find themselves in a tricky situation when it comes to the schedule because on one hand, they want to promote the game in lots of countries. 

However, there is no point in having so many tournaments if the players are simply going to withdraw and produce tournaments without their very best players. 

Fritz has made some valid points and now it will be intriguing to see if the schedule is shortened somewhat when next year's dates are finalised.

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

The ATP Washington Open is back in action today for the second round. The second round features numerous high-quality matchups, including the headliner of this article: Lorenzo Musetti vs. Cameron Norrie. Here are my best bets for the second round of action at ATP Washington. Let me know whether you agree in the comment section.    

H2H: 0-1

The first time that Fabian Marozsan played Gabriel Diallo was earlier this year at the Davis Cup. Diallo took that match in straight sets, barely breaking a sweat, as he lost only four total games that day. The match was only, and I bring that up because Marozsan lost. Not only is Marozsan a career clay player, but Diallo is only 17-15 lifetime on clay. Perhaps Marozsan can return the favor now that he gets Diallo on Diallo's preferred surface. Marozsan is 56-32 on hardcourt, which isn't too bad when you compare it to Diallo's 80-44 overall record on hardcourt.

Best Bet to Make

Diallo is right on the line of usability at 1.5 straight on Bet365. While you can find outlets like Betfair that have Marozsan at 1.19, he remains the underdog, as Diallo is priced at 1.11 on the same site. That's the only time that Marozsan comes close to Diallo with the line. Most other sites have him at least a full point behind, if not more. This makes sense because Diallo already has one tournament victory this year, and a very quick victory over Marozsan on his opponent's preferred surface. Diallo's tournament victory was June 15th, and he's been in a quarterfinal and round of 16 since. He's also coming off taking Taylor Fritz to the limit at Wimbledon, so momentum is really riding with Diallo.

That being said, Diallo winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Diallo winning @1.5 @Bet365

H2H: 0-0

This will be the first match between Matteo Arnaldi and Lorenzo Sonego. There are several superficial comparisons between the two men, as well. Both men have had similar overall years. Arnaldi is 16-15 overall and Sonego is 14-17 overall. Both men are 7-6 overall on hardcourt in 2025. Hell, you can even get both men for 1.90 on 1xBet, but that's beside the point. Neither Arnaldi nor Sonego has ever played at Washington before. Of the two of them, Sonego is having the more consistently positive year. Sonego has thrived at two of three majors thus far in 2025, making one quarterfinal and one round of 16.



Best Bet to Make

Sonego is the slight favorite for a fairly solid reason, and that is his recent play. Coming off a quality showing at Wimbledon, Sonego has built himself confidence after a poor showing at Roland-Garros, which had to hurt his pride as a primarily clay player. Many sites see this as a push, and I get why they think that. Even in his wins, Arnaldi has struggled. Furthermore, he hasn't been outstanding on hardcourt since 2020 when he was 16-5. Arnaldi might be having the better year, but Sonego wins the match in three.

That being said, Sonego winning is a value bet for sure.

Value bet/ the best odds: Sonego winning @1.90 @1xBet

H2H: 0-2

Cameron Norrie hasn't had much luck against Lorenzo Musetti. While the two have only met on clay, Musetti took both matches in three sets, and both of them were in 2023. The last time Norrie played in Washington was 2021, and he finished in the round of 16. Both men are playing fantastic tennis right now, but Musetti is having a slightly better go of it right now. Setting Wimbledon aside, Musetti had been in the semifinals of the four previous tournaments, including one finals loss at Monte Carlo. Had it not been for Carlos Alcaraz, Musetti may have won three of those tournaments.

Best Bet to Make

Norrie last made a semifinal in May, and that was at Geneva. Outside of that, Norrie hasn't advanced beyond the quarterfinals this year. Sure, most of Musetti's success has come on clay, but it's not like he's dogwater on a hardcourt. I will say that Norrie is by far the more accomplished player on the hardcourt, as he's 235-118 overall. But before you get any bright ideas about betting on him because of that, he's 7-8 this year, 14-12 in the last two years, and 28-24 in the last three years. He just isn't the same hardcourt player he was in 2022. 

That being said, Musetti winning is a value bet for sure.

Musetti.   Has no form right now, Norrie has a decent chance of winning especially with a win today over the Brit Billy Harris and it looks like Italian is just trying to find some matches and form coming of the loss at Wimbledon and the lack of match wins since the French open where he retired vs Alcaraz,    There is no way I could bet Musetti.   He is exactly the kind of guy I don't bet on right now(based on health and is he dealing with an injury Musetti? Maybe not
Norrie with a win under his belt could definitely win this match.  , I bet tons of tennis it's very difficult and when trying to interpret form and health can be very difficult      I'm also ignoring they 2-0 record on clay that Musetti has vs Norrie       Unfortunately I bet Norrie recently and he got his ass kicked by Billy Harris (Eastborne). Probably should have bet him back vs Harris today.      But I'm trying to bet on people that I have won with opposed to betting on people I've lost with , I do appreciate your write ups and I do bet on some of picks you make . Best James

Rafael Nadal won the 2020 French Open without dropping a set, the fourth time in his legendary career that he has accomplished this feat of sporting dominance. His toughest test that year — in addition to the vacant stands due to COVID-19 — was a quarterfinal matchup against future Wimbledon champion Jannick Sinner.

Their quarterfinal matchup got off to a late start. Even though the Spaniard made light work of a then-teenage Sinner in straight sets (7-6, 6-4, 6-1), the match ran until 1:30 AM. Nadal labeled playing at that time of night as "dangerous."

“No, the problem is the weather. Having two days in the middle is not a big deal. Of course, it is not ideal to finish a match at 1:30 in the morning. But the problem is the weather," the French Open legend said post-match. "It is too cold to play. Honestly, it is very, very cold to play tennis, no?

“I know football players play under these conditions, but is a little bit different. They are all the time moving. We stop, we come back, we stop on the changeovers.

It is a sport that you are stopped in a lot of moments, no? I think is a little bit dangerous for the body to play with these very heavy conditions. But that's what happened today."



Nadal boasts a perfect 3-0 head-to-head record against Sinner, although the pair would face off at distinctively different arcs in their careers. The veteran Spaniard would also beat the young Italian at the 2021 French Open.

Nadal was effusive in his praise of his opponent after the match. “Sinner is a very, very young talent with a lot of power, great shots,” he said.

“The conditions here were a little bit difficult because he was hitting every ball very hard, for me it was difficult. The ball, with this court, the spin is not there. For me, it was difficult to pull him out of the position."

Sinner beat No. 11 David Goffin in the first round before upsetting No. 6 Alexander Zverev in the Round of 16 to reach his first major quarterfinal in just his second-ever main draw at a grand slam.

DON'T MISS: 

After topping Sinner, Nadal ousted Diego Schwarzmann in the semifinals and longtime rival Novak Djokovic in the finals to capture a fourth-straight French Open title.

The music world is reacting to the news that Ozzy Osbourne has died. Osbourne's surviving bandmates in Black Sabbath led the way with a simple message: “Ozzy Forever.”

“He was a dear friend and a huge trailblazer who secured his place in the pantheon of rock gods - a true legend,” wrote Elton John, who featured on the title song of Osbourne's Ordinary Man. “He was also one of the funniest people I've ever met. I will miss him dearly. To Sharon and the family, I send my condolences and love.”

Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, a collaborator on Osbourne's final album, Patient Number 9, shared: “Sad to hear Ozzy died today. When I was in high school I discovered Sabbath. ‘War Pigs' was terrifying and mesmerizing at the same time. It was Ozzy's voice that took me away to a dark universe. A great escape. Then when The ‘Blizzard of Ozz' record came out I was instantly a fan. Randy Rhoads was an influence on me to play lead guitar. Luckily I got to play on the song ‘Immortal' on the last record. Thanks for the music, Ozzy it makes our journey in life better.”

Further notes have been shared by Public Enemy's Flavor Flav, Metallica, Nirvana, John Maus, Yungblud, Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, the Roots' Questlove, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, the Rolling Stones' Ronnie Wood, Disturbed's David Draiman, Twisted Sister's Dee Snider, the Smashing Pumpkins, Sean Ono Lennon, Julian Lennon, Pantera, Sammy Hagar, and Jack White.

	The devastating news that Ozzy Osbourne has died landed Tuesday afternoon, and the rock world remains in a state of absolute shock. The metal pioneer had been in failing health for years, but he performed just 17 days ago at Black Sabbath‘s Back to the Beginning all-star tribute and was in great spirits that night.


	As of now, there's no word on how Osbourne died. “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning,” his family said in a statement. “He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”


	The tiny silver lining to this tragedy is that the heavy-metal and hard-rock community was given a chance to show Osbourne just how much they loved him earlier in the month at the Back to the Beginning concert in Birmingham, England. The incredible lineup included Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Pantera, Slayer, Tool, Lamb of God, Billy Corgan, Steven Tyler, Tom Morello, Sammy Hagar, Anthrax, Alice in Chains, Zakk Wylde, and many others. Each played a handful of their own tunes along with Black Sabbath classics.

	











	Near the end of the night, Osbourne appeared onstage in a leather chair and sang “I Don't Know,” “Mr. Crowley,” “Suicide Solution,” “Mama, I'm Coming Home,” and “Crazy Train” with veteran members of his solo band. There were concerns beforehand about the state of his voice in light of his health issues, but he worked hard to prep for the night, and sounded incredible.

	The concert wrapped up with Osbourne and the original Black Sabbath lineup taking the stage together for the first time in 20 years. This was a moment many metalheads thought they'd never see, considering the past bad blood with drummer Bill Ward, and the fact that Sabbath already played a farewell concert in 2017 at the end of their last tour. But ending the Sabbath legacy without the four original members was never going to be satisfying.

	Sabbath played “War Pigs,” “N.I.B.,” “Iron Man,” and “Paranoid,” while all the performers from throughout the evening watched from the wings. It would be impossible to script a better farewell performance for Ozzy.


	The concert was live-streamed around the world and will come to movie theaters in early 2026. It's The Last Waltz of heavy metal, and we're all very lucky it took place.

Power franchise fans officially have something new to look forward to.


Starz has picked up Power: Origins to series, becoming the Universe's fifth installment and the second prequel following Power Book III: Raising Kanan. It will consist of 18 episodes, with Raising Kanan boss Sascha Penn to serve as showrunner, writer, and executive producer.


Power: Origins follows Ghost and Tommy as ambitious young entrepreneurs on the rise, determined to make their mark on the streets of New York City. The show's logline says the new installment is a “fun, rambunctious exploration of a new time in the Power franchise, which will highlight the unbridled audacity of young men on the rise, determined to become legends in the game.”

	











	Deadline understands the lead roles of Tommy and Ghost have yet to be cast. MeKai Curtis will reprise the role of early adult Kanan Stark in the new series, which he has portrayed across all four seasons of Power Book III: Raising Kanan. Franchise executive producer Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson played Kanan in the mothership series. Raising Kanan is set to conclude with its fifth season, which is expected to premiere in 2026.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The franchise's first prequel introduced the character Branford “Breeze” Frady (Shameik Moore), the nephew of street legends Snaps (Wendell Pierce) and Pop (Erika Woods), in the Season 4 finale. According to show legend, Breeze plays a significant role in Ghost's budding career as part of New York's criminal underworld. Depending on what happens in the final season of Raising Kanan, Moore could return for Power: Origins.


	“I'm excited to continue to explore the origin stories of the Power Universe's founding fathers,” Penn shared in a statement. “Ghost and Tommy's backstories have fueled years of constant fascination and speculation among fans, and I'm thrilled to be able to answer some long-held questions and share new layers of the story that viewers won't see coming.”


	The original Power series ran for six seasons from 2014-2020, starring Omari Hardwick as James St. Patrick aka Ghost, and Joseph Sikora in the role of Tommy Egan. Power Book II: Ghost followed Ghost's son (and his killer), Tariq St. James (Michael Rainey Jr.), as he worked to build his empire. The series ran for four seasons from 2020-202, and also starred Mary J. Blige, Clifford “Method Man” Smith Jr., Woody McClain, Daniel Bellomy, Lovell Adams-Gray, Gianni Paolo and LaToya Tonodeo among others.

	











Power and Power Book II: Ghost is created by Courtney A. Kemp; Penn created Power Book III: Raising Kanan; Robert Munic created Power Book IV: Force.


	As Deadline previously revealed exclusively, Power: Legacy (working title) is in the works from franchise vets Gary Lennon (Power Book IV: Force) and Kendra Chapman (Power Book IV: Force). The sixth installment is expected to be set in the present timeline, following the events of Power Book IV: Force, set to air its third and final season later this year.


	“Our fans have been asking for Ghost and Tommy's origins story since we first met them in Power — and with the launch of this series, we're delivering in a big way,” said Kathryn Busby, President of Original Programming for Starz. “This marks an electrifying new chapter in the franchise's evolution as we dive deep into the legacy of these iconic characters and the explosive moments that shaped their path.”

Ozzy Ozbourne is dead at the age of 76. The English rocker died July 22 after a long battle with Parkinson's. He had just performed his final concert, a farewell appearance featuring the original Black Sabbath lineup, earlier this month.

In a statement to the BBC, his family said, “It is with more sadness than mere words can convey that we have to report that our beloved Ozzy Osbourne has passed away this morning. He was with his family and surrounded by love. We ask everyone to respect our family privacy at this time.”

It's fitting that his family was able to release the news of Osbourne's passing to the world. For as much as he styled himself the Prince of Darkness, a heavy metal rocker devoted on stage to all things performatively evil, for the last nearly quarter century of his life, he was best known as a family man, the patriarch of a clan that shaped much of the media landscape we've lived in ever since.

With the premiere of “The Osbournes” on MTV on March 5, 2002, the true idea of reality TV as we've known it ever since was born. Yes, there was “The Real World” on MTV for years before it — but that was always an artificial setup, a show that was cast and brought people together from different walks of life for an ostensible examination of “the way youth culture is now.” It was more social experiment than “this is the way these people actually live.” 

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






Critically, “The Real World” also had a different cast every season and was set in a different city.

With “The Osbournes,” the idea was that audiences got an unfiltered glimpse of one real celebrity family — how the other half lives — who they followed continuously for seasons on end. It's still a constructed reality, as artificial in its own way as “The Real World,” but “The Osbournes” peddled a fantasy that what you were seeing was the unvarnished truth. Even if Ozzy yelling “Sharrrrrrron!!!” in his mansion as if he was howling “Mr. Crowley” on stage was as much a catchphrase as anything on any sitcom ever.

Without “The Osbournes,” you wouldn't have the Kardashians, and their ever-expanding galaxy of TV properties. Still, “The Osbournes” had a kind of purity to it that “Keeping up with the Kardashians” never had. That show was all about the Kardashians branding themselves and creating a media empire, whereas “The Osbournes” was kind of an end unto itself — even if Ozzy's children Jack and Kelly Osbourne ended up competing on “Dancing with the Stars” and his wife Sharon had a long-running panelist gig on “The Talk.”

There was a slightly less craven dimension to “The Osbournes,” which came from the fact that the bonds of familial affection there were real. Ozzy Osbourne was a family man. And as much as he was associated with onstage evil, like a kind of male Elvira who also had an extraordinary screech of a voice — one of the most distinctive in rock — he was a lovable softie. One who just happened to bite the head off a bat onstage in 1982, which he claims to have thought was a rubber one.

 










Doom metal begins with Osbourne's band Black Sabbath, whose self-titled album in 1970, followed by “Paranoid” and “Master of Reality” over the year after made wearing heavy eyeliner, large crosses, and singing lyrics with ostensibly satanic themes a mainstay in rock. Would there have been a Goth movement without Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath? 

A lot of Black Sabbath's work was intentionally provocative, designed to ruffle conventional sensibilities. But when Osbourne became a solo artist, look at how often the theme of family runs through his work: And never more so than in his 1991 masterpiece “Mama, I'm Coming Home.”

That made his brood the perfect clan to launch the era of family-centric reality TV: They seem really, really different — but they're just like us! He's been accused of literally encouraging suicide with his song “Suicide Solution,” but he's actually a pillar for his wife and kids. Delivering something that you totally expect, and that is nothing like what you expect: Isn't that exactly what this kind of fly-on-the-wall reality TV has been aiming for ever since?

For what it's worth, Jack Black, when giving Osbourne's induction speech at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony, did not see anything thematically opposed to his onstage Prince of Darkness antics and his contribution to a genre that's defined so much of 21st century TV.

 










“He teamed up with his family to create another genre, reality TV,” Black said. “Maybe the most evil thing he ever did.”

NBC has added another new comedy series for the 2025-26 season, handing a series order to Jeff Astrof and Liz Astrof's single-camera cheerleading pilot Stumble, headlined by Jenn Lyon. The decision comes days before the options on the cast were set to expire at the end of this week.


	This is the second of three comedy pilots NBC has ordered so far in 2025 to score a series pickup, joining The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins, starring Tracy Morgan and Daniel Radcliffe and executive produced by Tina Fey, which was ordered to series in May. There is no decision yet on the third pilot, an untitled community center comedy from the Rutherford Falls trio of Sierra Teller Ornelas, Jackie Kaliiaa and Bobby Wilson, which was the last of the three to get a pilot order and the last to be delivered.

	It has been hard to get a good read on the community center pilot, which has been flying largely under the radar unlike Stumble, which, as Deadline reported, sailed through internal screenings and testing with high marks, setting up a series pickup. 




			Watch on Deadline		







	NBC is yet to announce scheduling for its new comedy series with two half-hour holes remaining on the fall schedule come November, one behind St. Denis Medical on Monday and one behind Happy's Place on Friday.


	With its mockumentary style, Stumble would fit right in behind the similarly shot medical comedy St. Denis Medical through, as Deadline reported last month, NBCUnivetrsal also had been considering a run on NBC og Peacock's The Paper, a successor to mocumentary-style comedy staple The Office. Also waiting in the wings is The Fall and Rise of Reggie Dinkins.












	Written by veteran comedy showrunners Liz and Jeff Astrof in the sibling duo's first team-up to create a series together, Stumble centers on Courteney Potter (Jenn Lyon) who is determined to rally her newly recruited junior college cheer squad to win her record-breaking 15th championship and improve their lives along the way.


	In addition to Lyon, who won the role in a competitive situation with several big-name actresses vying for it, the main cast includes Taran Killam, Ryan Pinkston, Jarrett Austin Brown, Anissa Borrego, Arianna Davis, Taylor Dunbar and Georgie Murphy. Kristin Chenoweth, who guest starred in the pilot, will be recurring. 


	Liz Astrof and Jeff Astrof executive produce alongside cheerleading coach Monica Aldama, known for her appearance on the Netflix docuseries Cheer, and producer Dana Honor through her Defining Eve Productions. Jeff Blitz directs and executive produces the pilot only. Universal Television, a division of Universal Studio Group, is the studio.

	Almost a year to the day since his father dropped out of the 2024 presidential primary, Hunter Biden has embarked on a no-holds-barred interview tour that is loaded with criticism of the Democratic Party.  


	In a more than three-hour-long interview with independent journalist and social media personality Andrew Callaghan of Channel 5, Biden dove into his anger over Democrats' treatment of his father during the 2024 primary; his struggles with addiction, trauma, and grief; and his views on the first months of the Trump administration. 


	The former president has remained out of the spotlight since President Donald Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in November, as Democrats and the media continue a convoluted post-mortem on the election loss that ushered Trump into a second term. 


	Where the former president is maintaining a strategic silence, his colorful son is speaking out on everything from George Clooney to the chemical nuances of crack cocaine. Here are 5 stand out moments from Hunter Biden's Channel 5 interview on Monday.

	President Biden didn't bother pretending that he was anything less than resentful over his involuntarily voluntary exit from the 2024 Democratic primary, and it seems the sentiment is shared by his son. 


	Hunter dedicated several extended monologues during the interview to bashing longtime Democratic party strategists, officials, and celebrities over the public efforts to pressure his father out of the race. 

	











	“The intelligentsia of the Democratic Party with 2020 hindsight, believes that Joe Biden should have considered not running again because of their perception that he was too old,” Biden said. “Speaker Emeritus Pelosi did not give a full-throated endorsement, which allowed everybody else to kind of go OK. Except who came out [in support of Biden]? Full-throated progressives. AOC, Bernie, the entire progressive ring. Ro Khanna. The entirety of the progressive side of the Democratic Party, said, ‘Joe Biden has got more of our agenda accomplished in four years than any president in history.'”

	Biden also criticized George Clooney over a New York Times op-ed in which the actor called on President Biden to drop out of the Democratic primary. “Fuck him and everybody around him,” Biden said. “George Clooney is not a fucking an actor — I don't know what he is, he's a brand.”


	“What right do you have to step on a man who's given 52 years of his fucking life to the service of this country and decide that you, George Clooney, are going to take out, basically, a full-page ad in the fucking New York Times to undermine the president?”


	Biden torched Clooney's association with former President Barack Obama, and the role other prominent Obama-era politicos had in the public debate around his father's age. He called former Obama Campaign Strategist David Axelrod a one-hit wonder who “had one success in his political life and that was Barack Obama and that was because of Barack Obama,” and referred to the hosts of Pod Save America — a political podcast founded by former Obama staffers Jon Favreau, Tommy Vietor,  Jon Lovett, and Dan Pfeiffer — as “junior fucking speech writers on Barack Obama's Senate staff who have been dining out on the relationship with him” for over a decade.  


Explaining the difference between crack and cocaine 


	Biden has been very open about his past addiction to drugs and alcohol, and in his conversation with Callaghan denied conspiracy theories that a bag of cocaine found in a White House cubby last year belonged to him.

	“I have been clean and sober since June 2019. I have not touched a drop of alcohol or a drug, and I'm incredibly proud of that,” he said, going on to discuss the Republican obsession with his addiction and the actual differences between cocaine and crack cocaine. 


	Biden said that he felt his addiction to crack was “an added bonus for [the media] that they could, they could say ‘crack addict,' and everybody would go, ‘Oh, my God, he's a monster.'” 

	











	“The only difference between crack cocaine, and cocaine is sodium hydrocarbonate, water, and heat,” he said. “I don't want to tell people how to make crack cocaine, but it literally is a mayonnaise  jar, cocaine, and baking soda.” 


	“Alcohol is the most destructive drug not just to your body, but it puts you in more danger than any other drug I've ever experienced,” Biden said. “And then you add on top of that the amount of crack I was using at the time, and crack cocaine in terms of your physical health is not as dangerous as the situation you put yourself in to be able to obtain it.”


	Biden added that if any good has come from the media's treatment of him was that it forced him to confront the darkest and most “embarrassing” episodes of his addiction. “The favor that they did for me is that I don't have any more secrets,” he said. “Now, not everything they say about me is true, but the things that people would be very embarrassed about, I've been very open about.”


	Biden's disastrous debate against President Donald Trump marked a point of no return for many Democrats and voters skeptical of Biden's ability to handle a second term. In the aftermath, the White House said Biden had been suffering from a cold, but the younger Biden claimed in this week's interview that the president had been affected by the prescription sleep aid Ambien. 


	“I know exactly what happened in that debate. He flew around the world, basically the mileage that he could have flown around the world three times,” Biden said of his father's travel schedule ahead of the debate. “He's 81 years old. He's tired as shit. You give him Ambien to be able to sleep. He gets up on the stage, and he looks like he's a deer in the headlights, and it feeds into every fucking story that anybody wants to tell?” 


	Biden laid into the deportation policies of the Trump administration, and the Gestapo tactics being implemented by masked ICE agents rounding up undocumented migrants.  


	“If you think the prison in El Salvador [that migrants are being sent to] is not a fucking concentration camp, you're out of your fucking mind,” Biden said of the Terrorism Confinement Cednter (CEDCOT), the maximum security propaganda prison where the United States has  dissappeared over 200 Venezuelan migrant men.

	











	“I'll tell you what, if I became president in two years from now —  or four years from now, or three years from now — I would pick up the phone and call the fucking president in El Salvador and say, ‘You either fucking send them back or I'm gonna fucking invade.' It's a fucking crime what they're doing. He's a fucking dictator thug,” Biden said.


	“Bukele or Trump?” Callaghan asked. 


	“Both,” he replied. 


	Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele responded with a dig at Biden's past addiction on social media. “Is Hunter Biden sniffing powdered milk?” He wrote. 


	For years now, the former president's son has been the target of conspiracies and conjecture promoted by Republicans: from unproven allegations of corrupt business dealings with Ukraine, to the obsession over his laptop. 


	Biden finds it a bit ironic — but not surprising — that given the Republican fixation on his every financial transaction, the party is perfectly comfortable watching the Trump family openly profiteer off of the presidency.

	“These motherfuckers, they're selling gold telephones and sneakers and $2 billion investments in golf courses, and selling tickets to the White House for investment into their meme coin,” Biden said, adding that “if you believe the worst possible thing that they've ever said about,” him, it doesn't hold a candle to what the Trumps “are openly doing, and nobody's batting an eye.” 


	“I don't get why people don't understand that. It is the biggest grift that there is,” he continued.  “Just look over here. Look at Hunter Biden, the crack addict, look at him. Laptop, laptop.”

Shia LaBeouf and FKA Twigs are no longer in a legal battle after five years. Twigs, whose real name is Tahliah Debrett Barnett, filed a lawsuit against her “Honey Boy” co-star LaBeouf in December 2020, alleging the “Disturbia” actor inflicted emotional distress and assaulted her. Twigs also accused LaBeouf of sexual battery. The trial was set for 2023.

Now, representatives for Twigs have filed to end the lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend; the claims will be dismissed with prejudice, which means that Twigs cannot refile the claims in the future. “Committed to forging a constructive path forward, we have agreed to settle our case out of court,” Twigs's lawyer Bryan Freedman and LaBeouf's lawyer Shawn Holley said in a joint statement. “While the details of the settlement will remain private, we wish each other personal happiness, professional success and peace in the future.”

Twigs and LaBeouf dated for less than a year after meeting on set on the set of “Honey Boy” in 2018. The feature, which was billed as being semi-autobiographical for LaBeouf who later rescinded the familial claims, was released in 2019.

Twigs previously told The New York Times after filing the lawsuit that she hopes to “raise awareness on the tactics that abusers use to control you and take away your agency.”

LaBeouf denied the claims at the time and issued his own statement.

“I'm not in any position to tell anyone how my behavior made them feel,” LaBeouf told NYT. “I have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalizations. I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. I'm ashamed of that history and am sorry to those I hurt. There is nothing else I can really say.”

In a separate email to the outlet, LaBeouf stated that “many of these allegations are not true” but that Twigs and fellow accusers should have “the opportunity to air their statements publicly and accept accountability for those things I have done.” LaBeouf also noted at the time that he was “not cured of [his] PTSD and alcoholism.”

	President Donald Trump appears to be growing increasingly desperate to turn the national conversation away from his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He spent the weekend suggesting prominent Democrats should be prosecuted over bogus right-wing conspiracy theories, and on Tuesday he said it outright.


	“Whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.


	Trump was asked which Democratic figures the Justice Department should target specifically in light of Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard's recent call for Obama administration officials to be “prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law” over claims that they “manufactured” intelligence to allege Russia worked to get Trump elected in 2016.


	“It would be President Obama, he started it,” Trump replied. “The leader of the gang was President Obama. Barack Hussein Obama, have you heard of him?” he continued. “He's guilty, it's not a question. This was treason. This was every word you could think of. They tried to steal the election.”

	











	“This is like proof, irrefutable proof that Obama was seditious, that Obama was trying to lead a coup,” Trump said later. “It was with Hillary Clinton, with all of these other people, but Obama headed it up. … This is the biggest scandal in the history of our country.”


	Several investigations and review  — including a bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee review in 2020 — have concluded that Russia worked to elect Trump over Clinton in 2016. Trump has repeatedly called the idea a “hoax,” and has similarly been calling the Epstein scandal a “hoax” in the face of backlash to the Justice Department announcing it would not be releasing any more material on the sex offender and longtime friend of the president — despite Trump and top Justice Department officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, promising supporters they would release the government's files on Epstein and the elites potentially in league with the disgraced financier.

	Trump's history with Epstein has been under the microscope as his administration has tried to bury the story. The Wall Street Journal reported last week on a salacious birthday note Trump wrote for Epstein in the early 2000s, and in which he allegedly wrote about how the two “have certain things in common.” Rolling Stone reported on the lengths the administration went to kill the story, which Trump has denied. The president sued the Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, for publishing the piece last week.


	Trump is now going on the offensive against his political enemies over long-disproven conspiracy theories, ostensibly to distract from his ties to a sex offender. “We caught Hillary Clinton, we caught Barack Hussein Obama,” Trump said, adding: “It's the most unbelievable thing I think I've ever read. You ought to take a look at that and stop talking about nonsense.”

	Since CBS announced its decision to unceremoniously end The Late Show next May, an array of celebrities, politicians, and fellow late-night legends have thrown their support behind the institution's current host, Stephen Colbert.


Adam Sandler called Colbert a “strong man,” and added, “he's gonna do great,” when asked about the cancellation at the premiere of Happy Gilmore 2. “I feel terrible that he doesn't have what he's had for so many years … and my heart goes out to him,” Sandler continued. “But I know the guy is as smart as it gets. He'll figure something out immediately.” 


	David Letterman, the famed first host of The Late Show, reacted to the news of the cancellation by sharing a whopping 20-minute montage of different moments he criticized CBS during his tenure on the show. He pointedly captioned the clip, “You can't spell CBS without BS.” 


	And Julia Louis-Dreyfus wrote on Instagram, “I stand with my friend @StephenAtHome,” before quoting journalist David A. Graham, “Institutions that are willing to sacrifice their values for the government's favor are likely to end up with neither.”

	











The Late Show has been on the air for more than 30 years, debuting in 1993 with Letterman as host, with Colbert taking over in 2015. CBS and its parent company, Paramount, said cancelling the late-night institution was a “purely financial decision,” and anonymous reports later claimed that the show reportedly cost the network between $40 and $50 million a year. 

	











	But others have suggested political pressure was a factor: Paramount is currently trying to merge with Skydance Media, with both companies still awaiting approval from the FCC. Earlier this month, Paramount settled a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump, who claimed CBS' flagship show, 60 Minutes, engaged in election interference by editing an interview with Kamala Harris. While most legal experts backed 60 Minutes to prevail in the suit, reporting suggested that some Paramount executives — including controlling shareholder Shari Redstone — favored a settlement with Trump, with others believing the lawsuit was a hindrance to securing the Trump admin's approval on the merger.

	That thinking has extended to The Late Show cancellation. Trump is, of course, a frequent target of Colbert, and the decision to cancel The Late Show came not long after Colbert criticized Paramount's decision to settle the 60 Minutes lawsuit with Trump for $16 million. 


Jon Stewart, Colbert's longtime friend and old boss at The Daily Show, called out Paramount on Monday, arguing the $8 billion valuation Paramount enjoys comes in large part from shows like The Late Show: “That's what made you that money,” he said. “Shows that say something, shows that take a stand, shows that are unafraid.”


	Meanwhile, over on NBC, Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon quipped during his monologue, “Stephen has done years of incredibly smart and hilarious television, and he's won 10 Emmys. Trump heard and was like, ‘Big deal, last week I just won a FIFA World Cup trophy.'” 


	When the news broke last week, Jimmy Kimmel shared Colbert's announcement video and wrote, “Love you Stephen. Fuck you and all your Sheldons CBS.” 


	And Andy Richter, another late-night veteran thanks to his work with Conan O'Brien, wrote, “Stephen Colbert is a profoundly good and deeply talented man with a great staff and an excellent show. They all deserve better.”


	Amy Sedaris, who met Colbert at Second City and co-created the cult favorite series Strangers With Candy with him, wrote on Instagram that she was “gutted” by the news. “This should not of happened,” Sedaris wrote. “Unnecessary. Stupid. No one works harder than Colbert. He is a leader. Makes everyone around him better. Most honest person I have ever met… Something beautiful will blossom from all of this bullshit. Stephen will rise. Please run for President Colbert.”

	On Anderson Cooper 360, host Anderson Cooper said he was “shocked and truly saddened” by the news, adding, “Stephen Colbert is smart and he is funny and he has actual conversations with people on his program.”


	Jamie Lee Curtis told The Associated Press, “It's bad. [Colbert's] a great, great guy. They just cut NPR and, you know, public broadcasting. Yes, they're trying to silence people, but that won't work. It won't work. We will just get louder.”


	And Ben Stiller tweeted, “Sorry to hear @CBS is canceling one of the best shows they have. Wishing all the people who work so hard on that show all the best.”


	The video Colbert shared on social media last week announcing the decision was flooded with comments from friends and supporters. Adam Scott called the decision “absolute bullshit.” Judd Apatow said his “admiration and appreciation” for Colbert was “bottomless.” Andy Cohen wrote, “I'm so pissed off.” Rachel Zegler said, “I am extremely sad.” And Kathryn Hahn commented, “I'm sick to my stomach.”


	Colbert's first Late Show bandleader, the Grammy-winning musician Jon Batiste, wrote simply, “The greatest to ever do it.” 


	Several politicians chimed in, as well, including Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both of whom noted the timing between CBS' settlement and The Late Show's cancellation. “America deserves to know if his show was canceled for political reasons,” Warren said, while Sanders added: “CBS's billionaire owners pay Trump $16 million to settle a bogus lawsuit while trying to sell the network to Skydance. Stephen Colbert, an extraordinary talent and the most popular late night host, slams the deal. Days later, he's fired. Do I think this is a coincidence? NO.”


	And representative Adam Schiff wrote, “If Paramount and CBS ended the Late Show for political reasons, the public deserves to know. And deserves better.”


	Many of Colbert's backers were at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York City on Monday, July 22, for Colbert's first full show since the news broke. Among them were Lin-Manuel Miranda and “Weird Al” Yankovic, who tried to cheer up Colbert's audience with a cover of Coldplay's “Viva La Vida” and a spoof of the Coldplay kiss cam cheating scandal.

	The bit featured cameos from “exposed couples” comprised of Sandler and his Happy Gilmore co-star Christopher McDonald; Cooper and Cohen; Stewart and John Oliver; Fallon and Seth Meyers; and then a cartoon Trump, who swiftly dropped a Paramount logo and ducked out of frame after being caught on camera.

	











	“Uh oh, either they're having an affair or they're just very shy,” Yankovic quipped. Colbert then interrupted the proceedings in: “I just got this note from corporate. Your song has been cancelled. It says here this a purely financial decision. It says here that since you started playing that song the network has lost — and I don't know how this is possible — $40 to $50 million.”

FKA twigs has agreed to drop her long-running lawsuit against her former boyfriend Shia LaBeouf. According to documents obtained by Pitchfork, the musician and her lawyers filed a request to dismiss the complaint with prejudice, meaning that FKA twigs cannot refile the case.

In a joint statement shared with Pitchfork, attorneys Bryan J. Freedman and Shawn Holley said, on behalf of their respective clients, FKA twigs and Shia LaBeouf: “Committed to forging a constructive path forward, we have agreed to settle our case out of court. While the details of the settlement will remain private, we wish each other personal happiness, professional success, and peace in the future.”

FKA twigs originally sued Shia LaBeouf in December 2020, claiming that the actor subjected her to “relentless abuse,” sexual battery, assault, and emotional distress. She had been seeking $10 million in damages.

Speaking with The New York Times, FKA twigs further described the alleged abuse she endured during her relationship with LaBeouf. “What I went through with Shia was the worst thing I've ever been through in the whole of my life,” she said. “I don't think people would ever think that it would happen to me. But I think that's the thing. It can happen to anybody.”

LaBeouf has long denied many of FKA twigs' claims of abuse.

Whoopi Goldberg paid tribute to her old friend Malcolm-Jamal Warner during a solemn moment on The View today. 


	Initially reading a prepared statement, Goldberg paused and sighed before moving into a more personal tribute.


	“We were devastated to hear that Malcolm-Jamal Warner drowned while vacationing in Costa Rica,” Goldberg began. “He was just 54 years old. He first became a pop culture icon as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show. And generations of Americans are feeling this loss because he was like everybody's brother.”

	Here, an emotional Goldberg took a deep breath. “He was really a great kid. I knew him well, I mean, it just…You know, the person who [broke the news to her] sent me a note that said, this is why what you did on Friday matters, and that is something that I will impart to you all. Because our lives move so quickly and we can disappear at any second, do not let much time pass before you say to your loved ones, hey, I'm thinking of you or hey, how you doing? Make sure you contact somebody today and reach out.”

	Goldberg's co-host Sunny Hostin also paid tribute. “I knew him also – I dated his friend – and he was always so nice to me. He didn't behave the way I thought movie stars or television stars would behave. He was very welcoming to this kind of outsider.”


	Hostin, a lawyer, also praised The Cosby Show. “I think [Warner's death] was so shocking because of the place that he had in pop culture for African Americans. I remember growing up and watching this family as a kid from the South Bronx projects, watching a Black doctor and Black lawyer married to each other living in a beautiful Brooklyn townhouse. And for me, it became something that was a possibility. That depiction, I think, was an overdue corrective against these harmful stereotypes of the Black community that existed for so very long, and he was just such a crucial part of it, especially I think for young Black men.”

Whoops!

	Abracadabra! For her latest trick, Lady Gaga demonstrated for fans how to recover like a pro after a stumble, jumping right back up after slipping and falling in the middle of a Mayhem Ball concert in Las Vegas over the weekend.


	As captured in videos from the performance, Gaga temporarily lost her balance while walking in the alleyway between her stage and the fans gathered on the floor of T-Mobile Arena. Just seconds prior, a cameraman filming her appeared to trip as well, and the Grammy winner helped him adjust the aim of his lens before continuing to walk.

	











	Moments later, however, Gaga — wearing a hooded cloak while performing “Vanish Into You” — also dropped to the floor of the venue. But before you could blink, she jumped right back up to her feet and continued moving toward the Little Monsters waiting for her at the pit barricade.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Aside from the singer's small slip, the Mayhem Ball tour has kicked off without a hitch. Gaga opened the trek July 16 in Vegas, playing a total of three shows at T-Mobile Arena. She'll next make stops in San Fransisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and New York City.


	The tour comes in support of Gaga's critically acclaimed 2024 album, Mayhem, which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The project was her seventh to reach the chart's summit over the course of her career.

	











	And though mid-show snafus are hardly ideal, Gaga is in good company when it comes to people who have taken a tumble in concert. Last year, Olivia Rodrigo kept plugging away after falling through a hole in her stage, while Madonna laughed it off after one of her dancers dropped her during a show. More recently, Beyoncé played it cool when her flying car prop stopped working during a Cowboy Carter stop in Houston, and Katy Perry persevered when her own levitating set piece malfunctioned in the middle of a number.

	The Caribbean Guard, a volunteer lifeguard association, issued a statement in the wake of Malcolm-Jamal Warner‘s drowning in Costa Rica. The actor, who was 54 years old, died of asphyxia after being caught by a high current while swimming on Sunday. No lifeguards were on duty, as their limited services had been allocated to other locations in the area, the association said. 


	“It was all very fast and even though there were people on the beach who came in to rescue him, they didn't arrive in time,” the Caribbean Guard said in a statement on Facebook. The association noted that Playa Grande, where the drowning occurred, is one of its “most challenging beaches.” It has patrolled the beach for “the last few years,” and notes that “it's a beach known by local surfers and there are signs (in English and Spanish) that warn of the danger of death by drowning.”


	While there would have normally been guards on duty at Playa Grande, they were redirected to patrol Playa Black and Chiquita, two other local beaches with prominent dangerous currents that recently experienced “water incidents.” The Caribbean Guard shared that it “deeply regrets” the actor's death, lamenting that “despite having been provided with CPR maneuvers on the beach” by locals, “his resuscitation was unsuccessful.”

	While unfortunate, the Caribbean Guard sees the incident as being indicative of a larger problem across Costa Rica and other countries in the Caribbean that will persist without direct intervention. “We appeal to the President of the Nation, the national government, the Municipality of Talamanca and the entire Caribbean community,” the association wrote, “to continue joining efforts to minimize this problem, which is sadly rising all over the country.”

	











	The volunteer group noted that “we do everything in our power,” and they have saved “numerous lives in recent years.” Without them, the statement continues, “drownings would could by the dozens.” Still, without the proper resources, their reach is limited, they wrote. “We do our part to minimize risks but if we don't have government help, clear public policies and strong support from local entrepreneurs,” they concluded, “this will keep happening.”

A summer without superhero movies may still be years or decades away, but at least Hollywood seems willing to achieve Origin Story Zero. Despite a title that tips a cap to the characters' Marvel Cinematic Universe debut, The Fantastic Four: First Steps joins this season's Superman and Thunderbolts as superhero stories that plop audiences in medias res, at least compared to the Fantastic Four retellings of decades' past. A title card lets the nerds know that this is all taking place on Earth-828, explaining the 1960s-ish retro-futuristic style and lack of any other visible MCU superheroes. Then off we go into an Easter eggy (but not off-puttingly so) newsreel-style montage chronicling the many adventures of stretchy scientist Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), his sometimes-invisible wife Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), her fiery brother Johnny (Joseph Quinn), and their rock-monster family friend Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), less charitably known as The Thing.

Generally, their superhero monikers don't get much play in this story, which is so family-focused that it becomes almost weirdly insular, with few other characters to speak of—and even fewer that aren't computer-generated. Besides The Thing, a wondrously seamless visual-effects creation, and the similarly well-rendered robot assistant H.E.R.B.I.E. (Matthew Wood), the heroes encounter a shiny alien being known as the Silver Surfer (Julia Garner), who arrives on Earth to herald the arrival of Galactus (Ralph Ineson), a vast, godlike, world-devouring creature. Though the Surfer  evinces some oblique cosmic decency beneath her shiny metallic exterior, Galactus appears to be an unstoppable, unknowable force, and brainiac Reed must figure out how to protect his family and the rest of the Earth from this unimaginably massive threat. It must be said that some of the plans he comes up with do not sound like the work of a bona fide genius.

They seem, in fact, like remnants of smaller, dumber movies that preceded this one, heralding oblivion. Specifically, despite a trip to space and through some time-dilating portals, on paper First Steps more or less remakes 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer. That low-rent sequel expends no small amount of its 87 minutes sans credits on a ghastly Mister Fantastic dance sequence and a scene where the world's most famous superheroes irritate passengers on a commercial airline. No such antics animate First Steps, and while the new movie is better than the two-and-done Tim Story-directed sorta-series by a factor that may reach the triple digits, perhaps a smidge more whimsy might have done some good. An odd moroseness takes over the movie in its back half, mostly due to a stakes-raising moral dilemma. Given, surprisingly, how much the advertising materials draw footage from the first half-hour, this turn probably qualifies as a spoiler. Suffice to say that there's a thoughtful, almost Star Trek-like moral question that the movie ultimately feels unequipped to take seriously—though that doesn't stop director Matt Shakman and four credited screenwriters from trying, exacerbating Marvel's ongoing tension between their grown-up aspirations and their four-quadrant instincts (or possibly vice versa).

Any break from the lightweight Marvel punch-up style is a welcome one, yet The Fantastic Four: First Steps still finds room for plenty of bad dialogue. The freedom once afforded actors as eclectic as the entire cast of Iron Man 2 is long gone, leaving this central quartet to play things respectably, honorably, and more than a little muted, with occasional outbreaks of Downey Lite yammering where certain words get repeated (“plan” is one here) like the characters are vamping on a third-tier single-camera sitcom. The endless possibilities of a retro-futuristic alternate universe are utilized, in part, to imagine that the laziness of writing in fist-bumps or dully contemporary phrasings and affectations can escape anachronism status on a technicality. The early scene where Sue announces her pregnancy is a deadly object lesson in forced multiple-draft chumminess, inspiring wistful thoughts of how Pascal was apparently warned off of doing a Mid-Atlantic accent. Stylish costumes are one thing; stylized acting is apparently quite another. For much of the film, the whole cast politely avoids stepping on each other's toes.

Granted, past Fantastic Four movies, Incredibles movies, and any number of Avengers and X-Men variations have taken up a lot of bickering-super-family real estate, which may explain why First Steps doesn't bother depicting much familial discord. The last thing the superhero subgenre needs is a bunch of people learning to, get this, use their powers and work together. But this movie's family dynamics feel especially frictionless; in depicting actual (not de facto or metaphorical) parenthood, siblinghood, and especially marriage, Marvel is as wobbly and tentative as first-time parents, only without ever admitting how tired they are.

It's particularly demoralizing to see an actor as striking and memorable as Vanessa Kirby reduced to nobly girlbossing her way through by-the-book protective-mom routines. Those piercing eyes, so consistently drained of personality, desire, or sexuality! Johnny Storm has a glimmer of those latter stirrings when he beholds the Silver Surfer—a naked woman astride a surfboard, he points out when protesting too much, though Reed performs a quick “actually” about any implied nudity as if quoting Pope Kevin Feige himself. But it amounts to little. These movies have become so piously devoid of romance, nevermind sex, that one half-expects to see the happily pregnant married couple inhabiting separate beds, as in an early sitcom-spoofing episode of WandaVision, which Shakman also worked on. Like that show, The Fantastic Four: First Steps offers some delightful visual pastiche, including impressively imagined art direction, costumes, and visual effects, alongside a pervasive sense that there's less to the characters than meets (and fills) the eye. The Thing's adorable sweater-vests have more distinction than Moss-Bachrach's mo-capped performance, or even how his computer-generated character actually moves through the frame.

It's probably not easy to make a good Fantastic Four movie. The characters have power sets so difficult to depict in live-action that the grumpy rock monster consistently looks the best of the bunch, while various forcefields, flamed-on human torches, and stretchy limbs have been consistently shown up by an animated movie from two decades ago. The newest version has enough actor-based charm to distract from its jankiest effects, plus a damn cool Silver Surfer, a lot of bright blue in the color scheme, one hilarious Mole Man, and a zippy pace. Occasionally it even conjures images of sci-fi majesty, like Sue in zero-gravity labor or the Surfer riding molten waves. For a lot of Marvel fans, it will be more than enough. For the more superhero skeptical, it offers a helpful example of how simply skipping the origin stuff on the fourth try doesn't automatically confer a sense of dramatic urgency or comic-book wonder. Sometimes it's just a franchise in a hurry to get to the next step.

As might be inferred from its still-awkward subtitle, Matt Shakman's “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” is a story about the mortal terror — and the profound thrill — of walking into the unknown. Here, in a movie that promises to push the Marvel Cinematic Universe out of its comfort zone before quickly retreating into a tired version of the same old schtick, only the terror shines through.  

It's the terror of a Hollywood film executive who's desperate to rejuvenate his sprawling mega-franchise, but deeply afraid of messing with the formula. It's also — for the best part of Shakman's film — the terror of a brilliant scientist who's dying to have a child with his wife, but petrified at the premise of an experiment that he doesn't have the power to control.

While Fantastic Four leader Reed Richards can extend his limbs into any shape imaginable (a radiation-induced talent that “First Steps” appears to forget about for appropriately long stretches of time), his sideburns turn grayer at the thought of living with his heart outside of his body. How do you rattle an invincible genius who can wiggle out of any problem with just a blackboard and some chalk? Give him a problem that no formula can solve. 

 










And that's exactly what “First Steps” does with its opening act. The Fantastic Four have already established themselves as the most beloved family on Earth (well, their Earth) by the time we meet them — a shortcut that Josh Friedman, Jeff Kaplan, Eric Pearson, and Ian Springer's script will pay for down the road. Winsomely portrayed by Pedro Pascal as a worried egghead who's shelled inside his own thoughts, Reed may not be the most outspoken member of the superteam (that distinction belongs to Joseph Quinn's Johnny Storm, even if his flame is dulled to death in this film), but the fact that he's basically Tony Stark, Albert Einstein, and Bill Nye all rolled into one is still enough to make him the de facto frontman. 

Things are a bit shakier behind closed doors. When his wife reveals that she's pregnant after several years of trying and giving up, it's Reed who struggles to wrap his head around the known unknowns of what becoming a parent might entail. (Sue Storm is played by Vanessa Kirby, who finds any number of invisible nuances in a one-note part that largely reduces her to “baby” in the same way that Ken's entire identity was “beach.”) Reed fights to make the retro-futuristic dimension of Earth-828 a place where it's safe for people to raise a child, but he understands his world too well to account for all of its variables; he can invent a teleportation device without breaking a sweat, but delegates the task of building a crib to his helper robot H.E.R.B.I.E. (whose “Star Wars”-worthy design is somewhat wasted on beep-boop comic relief). 

 










In other words, Mister Fantastic is scared. As scared to have his first kid as Joel Miller was to lose his second one. And Pascal's performance is so raw and refreshing because the actor isn't afraid to lead with that fear. And for a while, the film around him isn't either. Indeed, the initial chapters of “First Steps” are attuned to Reed's all too relatable neurosis in a way that makes it seem like the MCU is about to grow by leaps and bounds. Creating life in the face of an existential crisis requires a greater degree of magical thinking than Reed's brain was built to process, and when a naked metal Julia Garner surfs into Times Square and heralds the imminent arrival of the world-devouring space giant Galactus (Ralph Ineson), the news is like comeuppance for having the gall to bring something beautiful into a multiverse of gods and monsters.

“First Steps” might take place in a bizarro 1960s that's suspended between RKO and “The Jetsons,” but its parental anxieties are ripped straight from our 21st century; Galactus' threat to “Eat Reed's planet slowly while his son watches” is no different or more personal than what I hear every time a fascist opens their mouth on TV. Finally, it would seem, we're in for a Marvel movie with relatable human stakes. A Marvel movie in which a sequel doesn't feel like the only thing that's at risk. A Marvel movie in which saving the universe will require its characters to confront — and overcome — their mega-franchise's stultifying fear of change. 

 










Spoiler alert: We're not. 

“First Steps” may have the good sense to sidestep — or at least speed through — the characters' hyper-familiar origin story, but it still feels like a movie we've seen 1,000 times before. In fairness, that movie has seldom looked this good. Superhero films thrive on a vivid sense of time and place, and Shakman's crew has an absolute field day with the mid-century modernism of Earth-828, every design choice of which radiates the modular optimism of a world that believes in itself. 

Imagine Don Draper trying to sell you a five-cent comic book: This New York City is the kind of place where anything's possible and life moves forward at the speed of a buoyant montage. Flying cars and nifty monorails zip between Bertrand Goldberg-inspired towers above ground, while Paul Walter Hauser's scene-stealing Mole Man rules over a subterranean paradise below. The skies are Pan-Am blue instead of CGI gray, and each living room comes with its own Lloyd fireplace. From its delightful props (e.g. a baby monitor shaped like an old tube TV) to its turtleneck costumes, “First Steps” is the only MCU entry this side of “Wakanda Forever” that feels like it actually wants to be looked at — not just watched. 

 










Alas, “First Steps” loses its footing when it launches into space, loses the benefit of its scenery, and forces our attention on the plug-and-play jizz whizz at its core. The sky's the limit until the Fantastic Four leave Earth's atmosphere, at which point they immediately bump into the same low ceiling that makes all of the biggest Marvel movies feel like they have nowhere to grow. 

Galactus is quite a large boy, but the spectacle of his size — which Shakman can hardly contain in a single frame — isn't the only thing that makes the characters feel small. On the contrary, they shrink a bit more with every weightless action sequence and recycled joke, as the friction between Reed and Sue is subsumed into the stuff of garden variety special effects and “that's all we get?” lore (Galactus wants to eat the Earth because he's very hungry, and the Silver Surfer is somehow even less nuanced). 

Absent the visual dynamism of Earth-828, we can't help but notice that Johnny was barely a character to begin with. Pivoting away from his legacy as a red-hot womanizer, the film tries to paint the Human Torch as a dilettante with something to prove, but it never really settles on what that something should be. (Making it appear as if Johnny is burning himself alive is just another one of the many things this movie is afraid of, and so it settles for a cartoonish fire effect that feels just a few degrees shy of the characters from “Elemental.”) 

 










His cool uncle schtick is shared with flaky rock creature Ben Grimm (Eben Moss-Bachrach), who looks great, and brings a faint trace of upper-crust sophistication to a hero known for clobberin' anything that gets in his way, but leans way too hard on the vague loneliness that he sees in his own reflection. Ben is the strongest of the Fantastic Four, and yet even he struggles to carry the sort of smirking banter that hasn't been fresh since the first “Avengers” (nothing suffocates the MCU like its sense of humor, which makes it all the more refreshing to see Hauser tunnel a new path towards the Mole Man's punchlines). Instead of an emotional arc, Ben has a crush on a Hebrew school teacher played by Natasha Lyonne; if only the sight of The Thing wearing a tallit were the strangest thing I've had to process as a Jew over the last few years. 

The Fantastic Four do eventually return to Earth-828 for the second half of the story, but at that point this film is so consumed by the usual song-and-dance — big stuff coming from above, the heroes have to zip around to stop it — that the fear of the unknown starts to feel less like a theme for “First Steps” to to explore than an explanation for why it completely fails to do that. It doesn't help that Galactus is every bit as laughable as he is large (he was so much scarier and more compelling as a giant cloud in 2007's “Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer”), or that Shakman is too afraid of how silly his characters' superpowers look in live-action to have any fun with them, which is a problem “The Incredibles” solved too well, and with too much comic ingenuity, for this movie to simply try and ignore. 

 










“Family is about fighting for something bigger than yourself,” Sue insists. But as “First Steps” limps to its total nothing of a conclusion, it feels less like a victory than it does a total surrender. You have to walk before you can run, but at this point the MCU is back to crawling on its knees, and at this point it seems like it might be too afraid to ever stand back up again. 

Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures will release “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” in theaters on Friday, July 25.

	Before Peter Parker slung webs, before Hulk smashed, before there was Deadpool and Wolverine and Wakanda and mutants and infinity stones and cinematic universes — there was the core Four. You can separate the history of superhero comics into Before and After eras regarding Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's creation of the Fantastic Four, and the November 1961 publication of the quartet's first issue represents the Marvel Age's big bang. The story was simple: Four astronauts travel to space. They return with respective superpowers. Given that they share a solid moral center, they fight evil together. Given that they're a family, they bicker and snipe and apologize and have dinner together in a way that most supergroups didn't. A revolution was born.


	Despite being the company's cornerstone, however, Marvel's first family has a history of being a third-tier property in the movies. And because of a rights-issue saga so complicated it makes the MCU's confusing multiverse narrative feel like a comic strip, the Fantastic Four have seen their adventures become the basis for several failed and/or stillborn franchise attempts. There have been three (technically four) previous screen iterations of the FF, and none of them truly delivered.

	











	To say that the version we get in Fantastic Four: First Steps is the best screen adaptation to date of the group — roll call: Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing — means that a low bar has been cleared, though the world-building around them is truly an achievement. Whether or not you're a die-hard, you'll walk away wowed by the ring-a-ding NYC they live in, the Kirby-esque cosmic environments they travel, and the way that director Matt Shakman and his collaborators channel the title's first five years' worth of issues with such uncanny fidelity. Yes, we finally have a Four deserving of the blockbuster-spectacle treatment. No, this semi-induction of the team into the Marvel Cinematic Universe has not fully shaken the curse that's dogged them when it comes to the moving pictures.

	For starters, the decision to set this inaugural FF romp in a 1960s straight outta the panels of the original Kirby-Lee run is inspired for a variety of reasons. Longtime readers will thrill to recreations of the game changing first issue's cover and the overall Silver Age vibe of the visuals. TCM subscribers will dig the fact that the space-age-bachelor-pad production design would make Juan Esquivel weep with joy. Viewers who increasingly feel a nagging sense of MCU déjà vu will simply appreciate the fact that First Steps looks and feels different from the jump. Shakman was responsible for WandaVision, the Disney+ series that remains the high point of Marvel Studios' TV output, and his ability to replicate any number of past sitcom eras in that show makes him the perfect choice for bringing this retro-deco take to life.


	It also helps that, though we know Reed Richards (Pedro Pascal), Sue Storm (Vanessa Kirby), Johnny Storm (Joseph Quinn), and Ben Grimm (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) will eventually meet up with whomever is still currently active in Kevin Feige‘s overall soap opera, First Steps takes place in an alternate world where the Fantastic Four are the only superheroes on the block. After dispensing with their origin story via clips designed to resemble the Apollo 11 prelaunch, all of which are set to the sounds of the quartet suffering through the radioactive storm that will transform them, we are whisked through a talk-show intro that doubles as a capsule history of their greatest hits. There they are, stopping the Mole Man (Paul Walker Hauser) from taking over the surface world! And watch them beat back the mutated ape minions of the Red Ghost, conspicuous in his absence (sorry, John Malkovich)! These and other quick callbacks to some of the very first bad guys the team took on may be strictly for the heads, but the scenes of ecstatic, Kennedy-era crowds whooping their gratitude establish that the Four are already beloved public figures. They are all that stand between salvation and destruction. Pin that thought.

	The group is already four years into a good run saving the world when it gets hit with a double whammy. First, Reed and Sue are going to have a baby. That's the good news. Then, a mysterious figure appears out of the sky. She is Shalla-Bal (Julia Garner). You probably know her better as the Silver Surfer. In the comics, the character was a soulful alien with a totally rad interstellar surfboard and a lot of existential ennui. Here, the Surfer comes off more like the galaxy's hottest hood ornament, but the gig remains the same. She's a herald who's come to inform Earth that it will soon be gone. Specifically, it's on course to be the main course for her boss, Galactus (Ralph Ineson), a massive celestial being who consumes planets for sustenance. That's the bad news.

	











	Reed and Co. would prefer that they, along with the rest of the occupants that call our big blue marble home, not be reduced to collateral damage just because some huge being with an amazing, multipronged helmet is hungry. They manage to get some face time with the big guy. He makes them an offer: He will spare Earth if he can have Reed and Sue's unborn baby, who he declares is “a being of infinite power.” Longtime Fantastic Four readers know what he's talking about; the rest of us will simply need to take his word. This is not a deal that the team cares to accept. Suffice to say, the Four's decision to prize the one over the many does not make them particularly popular back home.


	Kicking things off with a beloved narrative arc known as “the Galactus Trilogy” is a smart move, given that it highlights what the FF comics did best — combine cosmic and epic scope with emotional and humanistic storytelling — as well as allowing for the movie to indulge in some of Kirby's more fanciful, out-there visual flourishes. It also helps introduce not one but two fan favorites into the mix, both of whom play a large part in both the Four's history and the overall Marvel universe. The decision to combine it with a separate tale involving the Richards-Storm son, who'll eventually be named Franklin and also become an oversized presence, is a curious one, and feels a little bit like the creators are trying to get a lot of housekeeping out of the way at once. It does turn the end of the world into something personal, of course, and ups the already cataclysmic stakes. Yet it weighs down a First Steps that already feels plot-heavy by the movie's midpoint, and will only get more dense as the six credited writers try to honor a rich legacy, establish a future franchise pillar, and bring the bang-pow-zap.


	None of which matters when you've got such fantastic characters on which to build a foundation, right? And here's where the main problem comes into play. You could not ask for a better cast to play this legendary group of familial, occasionally dysfunctional heroes, even if the dramatic distribution of weight is off; Vanessa Kirby gets the lion's share of big moments as the resident peacekeeper who goes full Momma Grizzly when her baby is in danger, and thankfully she's more than up to the task. That familiar swirl of irony (the stretchy brainiac Reed is the most inflexible member in all other respects, the rocky Ben is really a softy at heart) and on-the-nose caricaturing (the invisible Sue is a powerhouse hiding in plain sight, the hotheaded Johnny is a literal hothead) is all there up on screen.

	What's largely MIA is the dynamic between these four that's so prevalent in the books, and the sense of who they are as individuals, which comes perilously close to being a deal-breaker in First Steps. Part of this is the fact that the 1960s aesthetic takes up a lot of oxygen even as it helps distinguish the movie from its peers; so much focus is put on the extraordinary worldbuilding that the heroes running around in it become just another part of the retro-a-go-go scenery at best, and are totally eclipsed by it at worst. You won't remember what everyone does in the action sequences, but you will remember how nifty and cool the decor and vintage Gotham streets looked. And part of it is that everything feels so breathless and rushed that there's little time for actually developing the Four themselves. They're too busy saving the world and protecting their offspring, and barely have time to talk to one another outside of plot exposition and planning. Even their interactions at home are constantly interrupted by a cute robot named Herbie.


	Once again, you're left with the sense that you're watching a Fantastic Four movie, albeit one of much higher quality than usual, that mistakes their powers for the sum of their personalities, and emphasizes the former accordingly. Once again, you're left feeling like the FF have somehow been reduced to playing supporting characters in their own story; despite the star power, they're the least interesting part of the movie. And once again, you get the sinking sensation that so much of this is merely a setup for the next big chapter of the next big interconnected team-up. You can probably guess what the more serious and substantial of the two post-credits scenes are up to, and who's in them. There's undoubtedly better adventures on the way for the Four in future endeavors, and this should truly be viewed as a first step to making them a major deal in the MCU. But to say their introduction is fantastic would be pushing it.

The beloved 1987 live film was the follow-up 1986's romantic comedy "Under the Cherry Moon."

Prince‘s 1987 live film Sign O' the Times is returning to the big screen. The biggest screen. IMAX, Mercury Studios and FilmRise announced on Monday morning (July 22) that the late rock icon's beloved companion movie to the album of the same name will be released in IMAX theaters globally for one week only beginning on Aug. 29.

	











	The movie, directed, scored by and starring Prince features the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer surrounded by what was then his new backing band after he'd fired his longtime group the Revolution before the release of his ninth studio album. In addition to Prince and his close musical confidants Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, as well as percussionist Sheila E., Revolution keyboardist Dr. Fink and drummer Bobby Z. appear in the movie, along with singer and Prince collaborator Sheena Easton.


	The movie is a mix of live footage and scripted scenes that has been spruced up for its IMAX run, with a release promising that, “enhanced with IMAX's precision surround sound audio, customized theatre geometry, and crystal-clear images, Prince's virtuoso performance is set to mesmerize fans old and new in the most epic format available.”




			Trending on Billboard		







	The film features runs through some of Prince's beloved singles from the album — which was critically acclaimed but, compared to his previous three classic LPs, a relative sales disappointment —  including the Hot 100-charting title track (#3), the Easton collab “U Got the Look” (#2), “I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man” (#10) and “If I Was Your Girlfriend” (#67).

	











	Those songs all appear in the film, along with a mash-up of “Little Red Corvette” and the LP's “Housequake,” as well as “Play in the Sunshine,” “Slow Love,” “Hot Thing,” “Forever in My Life,” “It's Gonna Be a Beautiful Night” and “The Cross,” and a band cover of Charlie Parker's “Now's the Time.”


	IMAX will distribute the movie in the U.S., with Pathé handling distribution in other territories worldwide. Click here for a complete list of where the PG-13 film will be playing near you. There will also be information forthcoming on private screenings and other invite-only events in New York, Los Angeles and Minneapolis in August.

Awards watch is in full swing. The Hollywood Reporter was right in characterizing this year's Venice lineup as featuring “a frankly absurd number of must-see movies.” While it's been an up and down year for cinema thus far, the auteurs are bringing their A-game for festival season. Venice will see the premieres of multiple highly anticipated films, including Guillermo del Toro's Frankenstein, which stars Oscar Isaac and Jacob Elordi, Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, which follows the story of two-time UFC heavyweight champion Mark Kerr (played by Dwayne Johnson), and Luca Guadagnino's dark academic thriller After The Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, which will premiere out of competition.

Del Toro, Safdie, and Guadagnino are far from the only filmmakers who will be walking the carpet. Frequent collaborators Yorgos Lanthimos and Emma Stone are back with Bugonia, an adaptation of Jang Joon-Hwan's Save The Green Planet!. The two had a pretty good fest back in 2023, when they took home the Golden Lion for four-time Oscar winner Poor Things. Speaking of Oscars, Mona Fastvold, who co-wrote The Brutalist with Brady Corbet, has her own “historical drama musical” in competition titled The Testament Of Ann Lee. Other major directors like Noah Baumbach (Jay Kelly) Kathryn Bigelow (A House Of Dynamite), Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan) are also in competition. 

Alexander Payne will be in attendance although he isn't screening a film. The Holdovers director and two-time Oscar winner is heading the jury, which also includes actor Fernanda Torres, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, French director Stéphane Brizé, Italian director Maura Delpero, actor Zhao Tao, and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu.

Before his tragic passing at age 54, Malcolm-Jamal Warner quietly built the life he never thought he wanted. “The Cosby Show” star, who drowned off the coast of Costa Rica on July 20, kept his family out of the spotlight. However, in recent podcast appearances, he has given rare insight into how becoming a husband and father has changed him.

“I talk about my wife and daughter, but obviously I don't post them,” Warner said on his ‘Not All Hood podcast'. “I talk about them because they are the hugest parts of my life, the best parts of my life, the best decisions I've ever made.”

On the ‘Hot & Bothered podcast‘ earlier this year, Warner reflected on meeting his wife later in life and how his mindset had evolved. “I met my wife through a mutual friend,” he shared. “Because I was on this hiatus, I was like, I'm not really dating.” 

Their connection surprised him—especially after telling her on their first date that he didn't plan to have kids. “She said, ‘I'm definitely going to have kids,'” he recalled.

But something shifted: “At some point, I was like, if I'm going to have a kid, this is the person I would want to have it with,” he said. “I also realized that if something happened and we weren't together romantically, she would still be the person I would want to raise a child with, co-parent with.”

Their daughter, now 7, became the heart of Warner's world. “It's so funny because my daughter will say she already knew. She was just waiting for us to decide,” Warner said on ‘Not All Hood'.

He credited meeting his wife at 45 and fatherhood soon after as timing that felt spiritually aligned. “There was a moment I realized, when people say, ‘when you know, you know,' that's what that feeling is,” he told host Melyssa Ford. “I had that experiential knowledge of when you know, you know. This is it.”

Warner admitted he was often misunderstood by the public when it came to settling down. “For so long, people were like, he's a womanizer. He's never going to settle down,” he said. “No, I did it when it was right. I did it the right way.”

He also shared why he chose to keep his family off social media and away from red carpets. “I like to keep them and their identity private,” he said, “but I love talking about them because I want people to know that it's possible to be happy and to have love, and love really be enriching.”

May Malcolm-Jamal Warner's legacy live on through the love he shared with his wife and daughter, and the impact he left behind.

Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch in 'The Fantastic Four: First Steps,' joined Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby and Ebon Moss-Bachrach at their film's L.A. premiere. 


							By

Events Editor


The Fantastic Four: First Steps stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach continued their world tour in promotion of the film on Monday, bringing Marvel's First Family to Los Angeles.


The film — set against a backdrop of a 1960s-inspired, retro-futuristic world — follows Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and The Thing as they defend Earth from Galactus and Silver Surfer.




	On the blue carpet, Quinn, who plays Johnny Storm/Human Torch but previously auditioned for the role of Spider-Man, spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the possibility of working with Tom Holland within the MCU, as Spider-Man and Johnny Storm are close friends in the comics.

	“That pairing makes sense to me and I think he's brilliant and I'm up for it,” the actor said. “I think we'd have a laugh. I've never met Tom and I think he's brilliant; his Peter Parker is the best one ever, I think he's our best-ever Spider-Man, so why not? Let's do it, get it moving.”

	Kirby, starring as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, also commented about her journey with the film, as she's currently pregnant with her first child while her character also becomes a mother on screen. 


	“It's a very surreal timing for me. I think the most moving thing for me was that in a big movie like this, Sue spends half the time pregnant, she gives birth and then she has a newborn while facing some huge intergalactic, existential threat to humanity,” Kirby explained. “She's never sidelined and she's absolutely part of it; the fact that she's a mother makes her stronger I think and it taught me so much about how powerful that experience is. As she does in the comics, I really hope that translates.”

	Julia Garner, who plays the much buzzed-about Silver Surfer, joked that the team “made me look a lot cooler than I actually am” with special effects. She continued, “I've never done this kind of acting before and I think it's really important as an actor to try different things and see what works and what doesn't work. I had so much fun making this so it was really exciting and I would definitely do it again.”


The Fantastic Four: First Steps hits theaters on Friday. See the first reactions here.

EXCLUSIVE: The Jussie Smollett hoax hate crime attack saga is set to be explored in a new documentary.


Netflix has ordered The Truth About Jussie Smollett?, a 90-minute feature doc about the case that, despite occurring in 2019, was just wrapped up, legally speaking, a couple of months ago.


	It will feature an interview with former Empire star Smollett himself.




			Watch on Deadline		







	The project comes from All3Media-owned production company Raw, which is behind two of Netflix's weirder true-crime tales in The Tinder Swindler and Don't F**k with Cats.


	The Netflix logline says the Smollett doc is a “shocking true story of an allegedly fake story that some now say might just be a true story. Featuring interviews with police, lawyers, journalists, investigators who claim to have uncovered new evidence about the case, and with Jussie himself, this compelling documentary invites the audience to decide for themselves who is telling The Truth About Jussie Smollett?”

	











	Gagan Rehill, who helmed Netflix's Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal, is directing. Raw's Tom Sheahan and Tim Wardle are exec producers on the doc, which will launch August 22.


	In January 2019, the Empire star claimed to have been a victim of a hate crime that stunned Hollywood but later was accused of staging the attack. He was arrested and charged with filing a false police report, but the charges were dropped. In 2020, he was re-indicted and eventually convicted on five felony counts, including lying to police, and sentenced to jail in March 2022, though he only served six days.

	











	Last November, the Illinois Supreme Court overturned the legal consequences Smollett suffered due to the high-profile incident, with the court finding that special prosecutor Dan Webb's decision to retry Smollett had violated the performer's rights.


	In May, officials announced they had reached a settlement with Smollett and the actor said he was giving $60,000 to charity.


	“I'm very excited to be sharing this film with Netflix viewers,” Rehill said. “This story is a thrilling ride, and we were lucky enough to have access to the key players. I wanted this documentary to balance their competing narratives and to also use their compelling, colorful testimonies to thread the light and shade of the story through the film. But much more than that, I wanted this film to speak to the particular moment of rapid cultural change when this takes place in 2019; when, as a society, we were becoming more combative, more polarized, more divergent over our shared reality – when we began to lack a common singular Truth.”

The tributes continue to pour in for Malcolm-Jamal Warner following his tragic death on July 20 at age 54. Yvette Nicole Brown, who played Shirley Bennett on “Community,” reflects on the loss of her beloved friend and co-star. Warner played Shirley's husband Andre on the sitcom.

A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown)

On July 21, Brown took to Instagram to share a touching tribute to Warner, including a video of the actor talking about finding “a reason to smile.” 

“This loss has devastated me. 💔 I don't have the words right now so I am repurposing these beautiful ones from my dear friend, who I adored,” the actress wrote.

She continued, “This video is a glimpse of the love he would share just randomly. To have him as a friend was a blessing from God. He was one of one. I love you @malcolmjamalwar. I always have. I always will. Thank you for being a real one. Until we meet again, friend. 💔🕊️”

Brown added, “Heartfelt condolences to his wife and daughter whom he CHERISHED and his dear mom and his dad.❤️”

A post shared by Yvette Nicole Brown (@yvettenicolebrown)

Later in the day, Brown took to Instagram Live to remember Warner. “Holding space for @malcolmjamalwar ❤️🕊️,” she noted in the caption.

During the recording, the actress shared, “I was a huge fan from the time I was 13 years old. I was blessed to work with him and most importantly, I was blessed to call him friend. Dear friend.”

Brown continued, “I am not someone who takes friendship lightly. I cherish being allowed to walk through life with someone. I just talked to Malcolm maybe a week ago.”

“This is devastating,” she shared through tears. “He was such a real one, you guys … he was so real.”

“He deserves a personal moment from me,” Brown said. “Such a good friend. He was such a good man. He was such a good husband. He was such a good dad … Please know that he was an amazing husband and an amazing father and he loved his family and his family loved him.”

The actress touched on how Warner was “intentional” about contacting friends when he thought of them. “He never missed my birthday and I never missed his,” she said, reflecting on the ways he would make the day special for her every year.

“When I did ‘Community' and knew Shirley had been married … I was so happy that [creator] Dan Harmon let me have Malcolm,” she recalled.

Brown shared how she asked, during the first season, “If we go the distance, if we ever see Shirley's husband, can it please let it be Malcolm-Jamal Warner?”

She continued, “And then I jokingly said, ‘But only if they reconcile,' because I was like, if they reconcile, I'll get to kiss my childhood crush. If they don't reconcile, I don't want it to be Malcolm-Jamal Warner.”

“And Dan Harmon, to his credit, thought it was a brilliant idea and that's how I got to really meet Malcolm and work with Malcolm, Brown explained. “Shirley got her Andre, and then we got to be, we became really great friends.”

“I just wanted to work with him forever because he's such a good guy,” she added.

'Smashing Machine' star Dwayne Johnson will make his Lido debut, as will Julia Roberts, appearing on the Venice red carpet for Luca Guadagnino's out-of-competition title 'After the Hunt.' 


							By 

	Scott Roxborough


Europe Bureau Chief


	Oscar season starts here. 


	With its 2025 line-up, announced Tuesday, the Venice Film Festival has (again) taken the award season pole position, with a program packed with a frankly absurd number of must-see movies. 




	Among the hot awards titles heading to the Lido are Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, from A24, featuring Dwayne Johnson as two‑time UFC heavyweight champion Mark Kerr and Emily Blunt as his wife Dawn; Luca Guadagnino's #MeToo–inspired thriller After the Hunt, for Amazon MGM Studios, starring Julia Roberts, Andrew Garfield and Ayo Edebiri, will premiere out of competition; and Guillermo del Toro's dark reimagining of Frankenstein, featuring Jacob Elordi, Oscar Isaac and Mia Goth, a Netflix production.

					Busan Film Festival to Honor Jafar Panahi as Asian Filmmaker of the Year		
			









	This will mark the Venice festival debut for both Roberts and Johnson. 


	Netflix, which sat out Vence last year, is back in force for 2025. Alongside Frankenstein, the streamer has  Noah Baumbach's comedy‑drama Jay Kelly, co-written with Emily Mortimer, and headlined by George Clooney, premiering in competition, and Kathryn Bigelow's ticking bomb geopolitical thriller A House of Dynamite, starring Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Greta Lee, Gabriel Basso, and Jared Harris.


	The Venice line-up is an embarrassment of riches, for award-watchers and regular film fans alike, with the competition selection including the latest from A-list auteurs Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), François Ozon (L'Etranger), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan). A year after Brady Corbet's The Brutalist launched in Venice, en route to three Oscar wins, the film's co-writer (and producer) Mona Fastvold arrives in competition with The Testament of Ann Lee, a historical drama musical film starring Lewis Pullman, Amanda Seyfried, and Tim Blake Nelson, that she co-wrote with Corbet. 

	











The Voice of Hind Rajab, the new film from Four Daughters director Kaouther Ben Hania, is certain to be one of the most talked-about films in Venice this year. The film tells the true story of Hind Rajab, a 6-year-old girl who, on January 29, 2024, was trapped in a car on fire in Gaza. She called Red Crescent emergency workers, who kept her on the line while they tried to get an ambulance to her. The Party Film Sales is handling worldwide sales on the film and co-representing North American rights with CAA Media Finance. 


	Another politically-charged title in competition is Olivier Assayas' The Wizard of the Kremlin, starring Jude Law as Vladimir Putin and Paul Dano as the fictional Kremlin insider Vadim Baranov. 


	Yorgos Lanthimos, a Venice Golden Lion winner for Poor Things, returns in competition with Bugonia, an adaptation of Jang Joon-Hwan's 2003 South Korean sci-fi film Save the Green Planet!, featuring his frequent collaborator Emma Stone. Focus Features will release the film stateside, with Universal Pictures handling internationally outside of Korea, where CJ ENM will release.


	And iconic indie director Jim Jarmusch, a Cannes regular, will bring his latest to the Lido this year, premiering Mubi's Father Mother Sister Brother, a triptych with an all-star ensemble cast including Cate Blanchett, Adam Driver, Indya Moore, Vicky Krieps, Tom Waits, Luka Sabbat, and Charlotte Rampling.


	The 82nd Venice competition line-up also includes the latest from A-list auteurs Park Chan-wook (No Other Choice), François Ozon (L'Etranger), and Laszlo Nemes (Orphan)

	











	Italian Oscar-winning Paolo Sorrentino (The Great Beauty) will open this year's festival with La Grazia (Grace), a love story starring his long-time collaborator Toni Servillo. La Grazia, co-starring Diamonds actor Anna Ferzetti, will premiere in competition on Aug. 27. Mubi picked up the film ahead of its Venice bow.


Dog 51, a new action-packed French sci-fi thriller from Bac Nord director Cedric Jimenez will close the festival, out of competition. 


	Gus Van Sant's return to feature films, Dead Man's Wire, starring Bill Skarsgard, will also screen out of competition. Other out-of-competition highlights include Anders Thomas Jensen's Danish dark comedy The Last Viking starring Mads Mikkelsen, Julian Schnabel's long-awaited The Hand of Dante, and Scarlet, the first anime feature in four years from Japanese master Mamoru Hosoda. 


	Venice has selected four TV series for its small-screen sidebar: Etty, a limited series from Israeli showrunner Hagai Levi (In Treatment, The Affair), loosely based on the diary of Dutch Jewish writer Etty Hillesum, starring Julia Windischbauer and Sebastian Koch, which Studio TF1 is selling worldwide; Portobello, the first Italian original production for HBO Max in which Italian director Marco Bellocchio (The Traitor), follows the true story of the downfall of one of Italy's most beloved TV hosts; Studiocanal's A Prophet – The Series, a TV reboot of Jacques Audiard's classic French prison drama from 2009, directed by Enrico Maria Artale; and Il Mostro (The Monster), a true-life serial-killer drama from Gomorrah series director, Stefano Sollima, made for Netflix.

	











	This year's Golden Lion career achievement honorees are legendary German director Werner Herzog (Fitzcarraldo, Grizzly Man) and Vertigo star Kim Novak. 


	Venice's Classic sidebar, which includes a selection on documentaries about cinema, this year includes Mike Figgis' Megadoc, a behind-the-scenes look at Francis Ford Coppola's decades-in-the-making Megalopolis.


	Two-time Oscar-winner Alexander Payne heads up this year's competition jury as president, and together with international film talents including Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof, French director Stéphane Brizé, Italian director Maura Delpero, Chinese actress Zhao Tao, and Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, will pick the 2025 Golden Lion winner.


	The 2025 Venice film festival runs Aug. 27 to Sept. 9.

Even an otherworldly demonic hero can get embarrassed by his mom. Ne Zha is super powerful, both within his animated universe and at the box office. Ne Zha 2 is already the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Now, the Chinese film is getting a bit of extra star power with an English dub featuring Michelle Yeoh as the titular character's doting mother. A24 is handling the English-language release, which hits theaters on August 22.

“A rebellious young boy, Ne Zha, is feared by the gods and born to mortal parents with wild, uncontrolled powers,” a synopsis for the film reads. “Now he's faced with an ancient force intent on destroying humanity, he must grow up to become the hero the world needs.”

﻿

Given that an Oscar winner like Yeoh is involved, the English dub trailer features a bit more of Ne Zha's mom, Lady Yin, than the version released by production company CMC Pictures earlier this year. “Immortal or demon, you are my son,” she tells him. “You must be brave and walk your own path.” The trailer ends with a laugh line when Lady Yin says, “Wait! Before you leave, will you give your mama one last big hug?” As a nearby crowd awws, Ne Zha walks away grumbling, “Come on, they're all watching!”

The voice cast of Ne Zha 2 is slightly different from the English-language cast for the first Ne Zha film. While Vincent Rodriguez III (Crazy Ex-Girlfriend) and Aleks Le (Dandadan, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man) will both reprise their roles (as Li Jing and Ao Bing, respectively), Yeoh replaces Stephanie Sheh as Lady Yin. In a previous statement, Yeoh said she was honored to be a part of the film and “can't wait for everyone to experience the wonder, heart, spectacular artistry, and magic of this film on the big screen.” The cast also includes Crystal Lee (Genshin Impact, DC Heroes United).

Shakira and The Weeknd will headline the 2025 Global Citizen Festival on the Great Lawn in New York's Central Park on Sept. 27. The show hosted by Global Citizen ambassador Hugh Jackman will also feature performances from Tyla, Ayra Starr and Mariah the Scientist, with more participants to be announced soon.

	











	This year's Global Citizen festival campaign is focused on providing energy access to one million people across Africa, according to a release, an effort that aims to provide access to quality education and football — in partnership with FIFA — for 30,000 children around the world. In addition, the campaign will look to “mobilize $200 million to protect 30 million hectares of the Amazon rainforest, and registering 40,000 New Yorkers to volunteer across the city.”


	Tickets for the Global Citizen Festival are free and can be earned by taking action on these issues on the Global Citizen app or here.

	“I'm honored to headline the incredible Global Citizen Festival in Central Park this September,” said Shakira in a statement. “Music has always been my way of connecting with people and leaving a mark on the world. I can't wait to perform, unite, and inspire action.” 


	Jackman added, “The 2025 Global Citizen Festival marks my eleventh year as host, and I'm thrilled by the progress we've made over the years. The growing impact of the Global Citizen movement touches every corner of the world, and I'm eager to advocate alongside my fellow ambassadors, performers, world leaders, and private sector executives to leave the world better than we found it.”

	











	Global Citizen was one of the co-producers behind the first-ever FIFA Club World Cup halftime show on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey featuring Doja Cat, J Balvin, Tems and Coldplay with Emmanuel Kelly.

Amanda Seyfried is back on the musical theater kick, and this time, she's putting the Shake(r) in her dance routine for the big screen. The actress leads Mona Fastvold‘s “The Testament of Ann Lee,” portraying the titular religious leader who founded the Shaker Movement in the late 1770s.

“The Testament of Ann Lee” is co-written by Fastvold and her “The Brutalist” collaborator and real-life partner Brady Corbet. “Ann Lee” was announced in December 2024. It will premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival, and later will screen at TIFF 50.

 










Christopher Abbott, Thomasin McKenzie, Lewis Pullman, Tim Blake Nelson, Stacy Martin, Matthew Beard, Scott Handy, Viola Prettejohn, David Cale, and Jamie Bogyo co-star alongside Seyfried. Ann Lee's followers deemed her the female Jesus Christ, and her worshippers prayed through song and dance, hence the music-centric genre for the historical feature. “The Testament of Ann Lee” is shot in 70mm, as was “The Brutalist.”

The logline reads: “An epic fable about religious leader Ann Lee (Seyfried), who was proclaimed by her followers as the female Christ and went on to build one of the largest utopian societies.” 

“Ann Lee” features original songs by Oscar winner “The Brutalist” composer Daniel Blumberg. Choreography comes from Celia Rowlson Hall, the dancer who played the adult Sophie in “Aftersun.”

“The Testament of Ann Lee” is Seyfried's first music-centric film since 2018's “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.” She also sang in the first “Mamma Mia!” film in 2008 and “Les Miserables” in 2012. Seyfried has publicly lamented on missing out on playing Glinda in Jon M. Chu's “Wicked” before Ariana Grande was cast.

Seyfried told Vanity Fair that shooting Fastvold and Corbet's secret indie film after wrapping the upcoming Peacock limited series “Long Bright River,” was tough. “I went to hell and back,” Seyfried said of the demanding back-to-back projects, with “The Testament of Ann Lee” being shot on location in Budapest, Hungary. 

“Ann Lee” helmer Fastvold previously directed 2021 period queer romance “The World to Come,” starring Katherine Waterson and Vanessa Kirby. Fastvold and Corbet both produce “Ann Lee.”

 










“The Testament of Ann Lee” is one of the many buzzy titles in competition at Venice. “The Wizard of the Kremlin,” directed by Olivier Assayas, Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” Kathryn Bigelow's “A House of Dynamite,” Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” Yorgos Lanthimos' “Bugonia,” Benny Safdie's “The Smashing Machine,” Park Chan-wook's “No Other Choice,” and Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother” are also among the features in competition.

Jim Jarmusch is keeping it all in the family. The auteur reunites with a slew of his frequent collaborators for “Father Mother Sister Brother,” set to be released by MUBI. The film will first premiere at the 2025 Venice Film Festival in competition, Jarmusch's first time in that section. The Cannes perennial premiered “Coffee and Cigarettes” out of competition in Venice in 2003. 

“Father Mother Sister Brother” is designed as a triptych, with the trio of stories all concerning the relationships between adult children, “their somewhat distant parent (or parents),” per the film's synopsis, and each other. Each of the three chapters takes place in the present, and each in a different country: “Father” is set in the Northeast U.S., “Mother” is in Dublin, Ireland, and “Sister Brother” is in Paris, France. Per any Jarmusch film, it's a character study that blends melancholy and comedy.

Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Mayim Bialik, Charlotte Rampling, Cate Blanchett, Vicky Krieps, Sarah Greene, Indya Moore, Luka Sabbat, and Françoise Lebrun star in the film, written and directed by Jarmusch.

 










“‘Father Mother Sister Brother' is a kind of anti-action film, its subtle and quiet style carefully constructed to allow small details to accumulate – almost like flowers being carefully placed in three delicate arrangements,” Jarmusch said in a press statement. “Collaborations with the masterful cinematographers Frederick Elmes and Yorick Le Saux, the brilliant editor Affonso Gonçalves, and other frequent collaborators elevate what started as words on a page into a form of pure cinema.” 

The project was announced in 2024; this is Jarmusch's first feature film since 2019's “The Dead Don't Die,” which also starred his “Paterson” alum Driver. Blanchett previously led Jarmusch's “Coffee and Cigarettes,” too.

Jarmusch previously told The Guardian that he wrote “Father Mother Sister Brother” with a specific cast in mind, saying he had to “wrangle” the collaborators together for the production itself. “Actors are like wild animals that I have to somehow corral because they have so much going on. So, I'm trying to corral some incredible wild animals – I hope I can capture them,” Jarmusch said in 2023. “I'm a control freak in that I have to do it my own way. I have to choose all my own collaborators. I have to have final cut. I have to produce it through my own company. And as for the people financing the films, I allow them to give me notes on a rough cut but I always, contractually, have absolutely no obligation to use them.”

 










Elmes (“The Dead Don't Die,” “Paterson”) and Le Saux (“Only Lovers Left Alive,” “Personal Shopper”) are the directors of photography. Production designers are Mark Friedberg (“Joker,” “Paterson”) and Marco Bittner-Rosser (“Only Lovers Left Alive,” “Tár”). Editing was led by Gonçalves (“I'm Still Here,” “Paterson”), with music by Jarmusch and Anika. 

Jarmusch explained during the 2023 Overlook Film Festival (via The Playlist) that “Father Mother Sister Brother” almost had no music at all. “It's a very subtle film; it's very quiet,” Jarmusch said. “And I think music could move it too much one way — it's a funny and sad film, right? It sort of has both woven in. I don't know if I want to have music to add some other thing over it. It doesn't really want it so far.”

“Father Mother Sister Brother” is produced by Charles Gillibert, Joshua Astrachan, Carter Logan, and Atilla Salih Yücer. The film is produced and presented by Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello, MUBI, and Fremantle company The Apartment, with Jarmusch's Badjetlag and Gillibert's CG Cinema. In Ireland, Richard Bolger and Conor Barry at Hail Mary Pictures co-produced with financing provided by Fís Éireann and Screen Ireland. Cinema Inutile brought equity finance.

 










Cinéart will release the film in Benelux in collaboration with MUBI. The Match Factory is handling international sales. Gersh represented the North American rights. Jarmusch is represented by Bart Walker of The Gersh Agency and Victoria Cook and Hayden Goldblatt at Frankfurt, Kurnit, Klein & Selz.

The Venice Film Festival is back on the Lido for its 82nd edition, kicking off August 27-September 6. The packed lineup of auteur premieres heading to Italy include new films from Olivier Assayas, Guillermo del Toro, Mona Fastvold, Kathryn Bigelow, Noah Baumbach, Yorgos Lanthimos, Benny Safdie, Jim Jarmusch, Park Chan-wook, László Nemes, François Ozon, Pietro Marcello, and many more in competition.

Out of competition, we'll see new films from Luca Guadagnino (“After the Hunt”), Werner Herzog (“Ghost Elephants”), Sofia Coppola (Marc Jacobs documentary “Marc by Sofia”), Charlie Kaufman (the short “How to Shoot a Ghost”), Julian Schnabel (“In the Hand of Dante”), Gus Van Sant (“Dead Man's Wire”), Laura Poitras (“Cover-Up”), Lucrecia Martel (“Nuestra Tierra”), and Tsai Ming-liang (“Back Home”)

Artistic director Alberto Barbera's programmers had already unveiled a wave of announcements before Tuesday's lineup: Alexander Payne heads up the jury, Paolo Sorrentino's “La Grazia” opens the festival Italian-style, and Werner Herzog and Kim Novak will receive honorary Golden Lions at the opening ceremony to celebrate lifetime achievement. Novak is the subject of Alexandre Philippe's latest Hitchcock close-read, “Kim Novak's Vertigo,” made with the star's participation.

 










A no-show on Venice's list that was expected to premiere here? Chloé Zhao's “Hamnet” with Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley. That will play Telluride before heading to Toronto, as TIFF on Monday announced the drama as a Canadian premiere. As expected, Netflix will have a strong showing with multiple titles including Kathryn Bigelow's “A House of Dynamite,” Noah Baumbach's “Jay Kelly,” Guillermo del Toro's “Frankenstein,” and the out-of-competition Italian true-crime series “Il Mostro,” about a notorious cold-case serial killer known as the Monster of Florence. Netflix's latest collaboration with “All Quiet on the Western Front” Oscar winner Edward Berger, “Ballad of a Small Player,” skips Venice for Telluride and TIFF only.

As previously known, indie film distributor MUBI brings at least two titles so far to Venice: Paolo Sorrentino's Venice opener “La Grazia” as well as Jim Jarmusch's “Father Mother Sister Brother,” the beat poet filmmaker's first time in Venice competition. (“Coffee and Cigarettes” played out of competition in 2003.)

A few highlights from Alberto Barbera's nearly two-hour press conference, which included the announcement of a Venice-record-making 15 documentaries out of competition, below.

The decision to premiere Venice perennial Luca Guadagnino's cancel-culture thriller “After the Hunt” (October 10, Amazon/MGM Studios) out of competition was a mutual one between Guadagnino and the studio. Guadagnino premiered “Queer” last year in competition, with “Challengers” originally set to open Venice 2023 before Guadagnino and Amazon/MGM Studios agreed to shuffle it out of the festival due to the strikes.

 










Mona Fastvold's latest collaboration with her husband Brady Corbet, “The Testament of Ann Lee,” which she directs and he co-writes with her, was also shot in 70mm in Hungary like “The Brutalist.” It's a “sort of musical,” per Barbera, starring Amanda Seyfried as the founder of the religious Shaker sect.

Julian Schnabel's out-of-competition, 150-minute epic “In the Hand of Dante,” starring Oscar Isaac (also at the festival with “Frankenstein”), arrives uncut after a battle, Barbera described, between Schnabel and his financiers to pare down the running time. “Most movies [at the festival] last from 2 hours and 15 minutes up to 2 hrs and 30 minutes,” Barbera said. “This is the new international standard, which is quite concerning for those who have to program the movies because packing all of them in our agenda is quite a problem.”

On the documentary side, Argentine filmmaker Lucrecia Martel's “Nuestra Tierra” is in fact the previously titled “Chocobar.” The non-fiction feature, long tipped for festivals like Cannes over the years, examines colonialism in her home country and the assassination of indigenous leader Javier Chocobar.

Laura Poitras, who won the Golden Lion in 2022 for “All the Beauty and the Bloodshed,” delivers another made-in-secret documentary, co-directed with longtime “Frontline” producer Mark Obenhaus. It's about the legacy of investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who exposed the cover-up of the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam, and covered the Watergate scandal and other U.S. misdeeds throughout his career, including the torture of Abu Ghraib prisoners for The New Yorker.

 










Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth's Marianne Faithfull documentary “Broken English” (named for her 1979 studio album) features interpretive reenactments from “The End” co-stars George MacKay and Tilda Swinton.

Gus Van Sant's first feature since 2018's “Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot” is the out-of-competition thriller “Dead Man's Wire,” starring Bill Skarsgård in the true story of 1977 mortgage company hostage situation. Barbera also singled out co-star Al Pacino's performance as a special one.

Oliver Assayas' competition premiere “The Wizard of Kremlin” (based on Giuliano da Empoli's 2022 Moscow-set novel) imagines the rise of Putin through the fictional character of his spin doctor, played by Paul Dano in a performance Barbera also highlighted. 

The 21-film competition includes five features directed by women: Kaouther Ben Hania's “The Voice of Hind Rajab,” Taiwanese actress Shu Qi's directorial debut “Girl,” Valérie Donzelli's “À Pied d'Oeuvre,” Bigelow's “A House of Dynamite,” and Fastvold's film.

As a refresher, last year, Pedro Almodóvar's “The Room Next Door” won the Golden Lion under the jury led by Isabelle Huppert. Venice is the next major stop on the fall awards season after Cannes' initial launch, though Venice doesn't program any Croisette repeats, opting for world premieres that then head to Telluride, TIFF, NYFF, and beyond. Brady Corbet won best director at Venice last year for “The Brutalist,” setting up the film's Oscar run.

 










Under jury leader Payne, the rest of the panel of filmmakers and talent (yet to be announced) will decide the Golden Lion winner for the best film, among other awards such as the Silver Lions for Grand Jury Prize and best director, Volpi Cup for best actress and best actor, the screenplay award, the Special Jury Prize, and the Marcello Mastroianni Award for best new young actor or actress.

Scale, collaborations and specialism are key ingredients that she and her team are betting on, Kate Ward, managing director, Unscripted Productions at BBC Studios Productions, tells THR.


							By 

	Georg Szalai


Global Business Editor


The Americas, narrated by Tom Hanks, on NBC. [Stanley] Tucci in Italy on National Geographic. Walking With Dinosaurs, narrated by Bertie Carvel (The Crown, HBO's upcoming Harry Potter series), on PBS. These series are just the latest star-studded factual offerings from BBC Studios Productions, one of the British and global media industry's most respected production outfits that is part of BBC Studios, the main commercial arm of U.K. public broadcaster BBC, that have taken the U.S. by storm.


	Of course, there has also been Prehistoric Planet, executive produced by Jon Favreau, and OceanXplorers with James Cameron. And there is more to come involving big names, as Disney has unveiled that National Geographic has greenlit a new documentary series under the working title Meet the Planets, that is being developed by Ryan Reynolds' Maximum Effort and BBC Studios.

	Bottom line: Shows from BBC Studios Productions, which includes the world-renowned Natural History Unit, the Documentary Unit, the Science Unit, wholly owned label Voltage, and third-party distribution relationships, regularly feature Hollywood creatives and do well on U.S. screens, as well as worldwide.


	And they have just received six Primetime Emmy nominations and 11 Daytime Emmy nominations. Secrets of the Neanderthals and The Secret Lives of Animals are nominated for the latter. In terms of Primetime Emmy nominees, The Americas are in the running for the Outstanding Narrator Award for Hanks and the Outstanding Music Composition for a Documentary Series or Special Emmy for Hans Zimmer. Tucci in Italy is up for the honors for outstanding hosted non-fiction series or special and outstanding cinematography. And Planet Earth – Asia was nominated in the Outstanding Music Composition for a Documentary Series or Special category and Outstanding Narrator for Attenborough.

	











	But what is the recipe for factual success at BBC Studios Productions? Key ingredients are scale and breadth, collaborations and partnerships, and specialism, or craft, Kate Ward, managing director, Unscripted Productions at BBC Studios Productions, tells THR.


	“I think that factual programming is really having a moment, and we're really seeing that moment,” she argues. “Big dramas have incredible power and zeitgeist and are, obviously, a huge part of the ecosystem. But what factual does as a genre is that we really passionately believe it's there to change perspectives and start conversations. And because it hasn't always been at the front of the schedule in the U.S., when it does, it feels really special.”


	Take The Americas, for example. “We hope it's giving Americans a shared view of the natural world of life on their doorstep, sometimes at the end of their street, which in a world that can feel fragmented and challenging is something that brings people together,” Ward argues. “Bringing people together is something that is core to our values and our mission at the BBC.”


	So, how is her unscripted team at BBC Studios trying to succeed in a crowded marketplace? First, “we're excited about the scale and the variety of work we're doing for the U.S. market,” Ward shares. “Our shows represent a range of different styles of factual programming for a range of different broadcasters with a range of different models.”

	











	In terms of the scale of productions, she lauds BBC Studios' “unmatched ambition” and ability to pull off “epic” shows. “If you look at The Americas, for example, it took five years to make 180 filming expeditions,” she explains. “So, we are working at epic proportions in terms of production. How many protein bars did the team have to eat over five years to make this show? As a result, you get that infectious curiosity that just draws you in as a viewer.”


	The second ingredient of success is expertise. “We can bring the specialism, the craft we are known for,” to ensure high-quality programming, Ward explains. “Walking With Dinosaurs can bring real value and an education for children and adults. It's rooted in real science. So it is entertainment and education together, and I think that means it can reach a really, really large audience.”


	Finally, Ward says it's about collaborations with creatives, producers and distribution partners rather than going it alone. “Creators bring their own way of storytelling, ambition, passion, and together, we can do extraordinary things. We also have deep partnerships producers, with platforms and broadcasters, from our long-standing, unbelievably special relationship with PBS that we value so deeply to NBC and Universal Television Alternative Studio (UTAS), which was a great experience for us. We also have a whole range of programming for National Geographic and Disney, and we have done great work with the likes of Apple and Netflix.” 

	











	Strong relationships not only give existing shows a good audience platform but can, of course, also lead to the development of further shows, and shows that stand out, she argues. “These deep collaborative relationships help us shape and do new things for the U.S. market that's really distinctive,” concludes Ward.


	Now, how about those Hollywood stars collaborating with the BBC. “We're working with a range of amazing Hollywood talent – actors, directors, auteurs,” she tells THR. “Why have these people, often known for their fictional work, been drawn to the factual genre? I believe it's because it allows them to explore the subjects about which they're genuinely passionate and to innovate in a different way of storytelling than they do in their other work, which may predominantly be in scripted. We're super excited about that melding of worlds and that sharing of experience.”


	How does BBC Studios attract such big names in the always-fierce battle for talent? “It's about storytellers, trust and mutual respect,” Ward tells THR. “I believe that they are coming to the BBC, because we have the trust, the legacy, the consistent quality, and the specialism that we have built over the years. “That is really, really important and critical when we're working with other storytellers.”


	For BBC Studios Productions, working with famous personalities with a shared passion, along with fan appeal and bases, is key too, not least to give series the desired broad reach. But importantly, the creative collaborators must make real sense – or viewers will smell a rat. “We're looking for those meaningful connections and that creativity,” Ward explains. “But it is important to approach this through the lens of two storytellers coming together in true partnership, and it always has to be authentic.”

	











	Take Tucci, for example. “Stanley is an incredible storyteller, and to be part of that storyteller's journey through Italy, which he is passionate about, is so exciting, and we're so proud of what we were able to create together,” Ward says. “Or when you think about Tom Hanks' role on The Americas: Tom's passion for the subject really shines through. If that wasn't the case, the audience would know the difference.” 


	In other words: you couldn't just take a random famous face and attach it to a BBC Studios Productions documentary or other factual series without a real interest or connection. “This is factual programming. So, there have got to be real, authentic, passionate connections to the subjects, storytellers who immerse you and take you on that journey,” Ward explains. “These storytellers can start those conversations, change perceptions, take you to worlds and times that you didn't know about. So, we will always be looking for that authenticity and that connection between us and storytellers in a creative partnership.” 


	Thanks to BBC Studios, U.S. audiences, along with British and global viewers, have also fallen in love with such British voices as the legendary naturalist David Attenborough and historian Lucy Worsley (Lucy Worsley's Holmes vs. Doyle). “She also brings that authentic connection,” highlights Ward. “Lucy is so popular in America, and she does it so brilliantly.”


	Ward vows to continue on the path of bringing factual hits to the U.S. and the world. “Scale, specialism, and collaboration are part of the secret sauce of how we're approaching the business,” she tells THR. “And we feel super privileged to be able to bring those together and provide a melding of creativity and what that does for people who love factual storytelling or find it. That is a really, really powerful and exciting proposition.”

Nicks and Buckingham shared matching Instagram posts last week featuring lyrics from Buckingham Nicks cut "Frozen Love."

	Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham are sparking reunion buzz after a cryptic billboard appeared on Los Angeles' Sunset Boulevard this week, seemingly teasing a long-awaited reissue of their 1973 album Buckingham Nicks.

	The billboard was shared on , showing the album's original cover art—featuring a topless Nicks and Buckingham—alongside their names and the date Sept. 19. The location, near Sound City Studios where the record was initially tracked, feels like a deliberate nod to the album's origins.

	The billboard, spotted near Los Angeles' Sound City Studios where the album was originally recorded, features the iconic cover art of a topless Nicks and Buckingham alongside their names and the date Sept. 19 — a likely nod to the record's roots.

	Adding to the speculation, Nicks and Buckingham shared matching Instagram posts last week featuring lyrics from Buckingham Nicks cut “Frozen Love.” Nicks posted, “And if you go forward…” while Buckingham followed with, “I'll meet you there,” completing a line from the song's chorus.

	










A post shared by Stevie Nicks (@stevienicks)


	Though neither artist has officially confirmed the reissue, a now-removed page for Buckingham Nicks briefly appeared on Rhino Records' website over the weekend, further suggesting an announcement is imminent. Parade reported the URL still exists, even though the cover art was taken down.


	The original Buckingham Nicks album was the duo's only release as a pair before joining Fleetwood Mac in 1975. It's been out of print for decades and has never received a digital or vinyl reissue. Bootleg versions have circulated among fans for years, and there's now hope the new release could include bonus material like alternate takes or live recordings—including a famed early version of “Rhiannon.”


	While some fans are holding out hope for a joint tour, others speculate about a full Fleetwood Mac reunion—though Nicks previously revealed that the band wouldn't continue without Christine McVie, who died in 2022. 


	Nicks previously said that the last time she spoke to her former bandmate and boyfriend was at McVie's memorial. “The only time I've spoken to Lindsey was there, for about three minutes,” she previously told Rolling Stone. “I dealt with Lindsey for as long as I could. You could not say that I did not give him more than 300 million chances.”


	The tease also comes on the heels of Fleetwood Mac's 50th anniversary celebrations earlier this month, where Mick Fleetwood wrote on Instagram: “It's magic then, it's magic now. What a thrill, what a thrill.”


	As of now, representatives for Rhino Records have declined to comment. Fans will have to wait until Sept. 19 to see whether Buckingham Nicks finally gets its long-overdue re-release.

	Following the tragic death of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, tributes have poured in from all over Hollywood and beyond, as his loved ones and those he touched with one of his performances remember the man. 


	Warner's breakout role was playing Theo Huxtable on NBC's The Cosby Show, which ran for 8 seasons from 1984 to 1992. The series followed the upper-middle-class Huxtable family, with Warner starring as the only son of a doctor, Heathcliffe (Bill Cosby), and lawyer Claire (Phylicia Rashad), who also had four daughters: Sondra (Sabrina Le Beauf), Denise (Lisa Bonet), Vanessa (Tempestt Bledsoe), and the youngest, Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam).

	











	In the show's second season, Geoffrey Owens joined the cast as Elvin Tibideaux, love interest of the eldest Huxtable daughter, Sondra, whom he would later marry.

	Following Warner's death in a drowning accident on July 20, Owens remembers his friend and longtime co-star.


	“This tragedy has almost left me speechless,” Owens shared in a statement to Deadline. “Malcolm was a lovely man; a sweet and sensitive soul. I respected him for many reasons, including the fact that he genuinely loved the act of creation. He had the mind of an actor and the heart of a musician. He was generous, too. I did a theater project long ago and asked him to participate; and he was there for me. My heart goes out to his family,” he added.

Adam Sandler, Anderson Cooper, Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, Seth Meyers, John Oliver and Andy Cohen were among those who made surprise appearances on Monday's episode after CBS announced that the late-night show would be ending in May 2026.

Stephen Colbert was feeling all the love and support from some of his late-night allies and famous friends on Monday night after it was announced that The Late Show had been canceled.


	“Some people see this show going away as a sign of something truly dire, and while I am a big fan of me, I don't necessarily agree with that statement because we here at The Late Show never saw our job as changing anything other than how you felt at the end of the day, which I think is a worthy goal,” Colbert told his live studio audience during Monday's show, before quipping, “Or rather, changing how you felt the next morning when you watched on your phone, which is why broadcast TV is dying. You're part of the problem. Look in the mirror, OK?”

	The host continued, “Point is I don't want this show to be associated with making you sad or anxious, but since I'm the guy who's going away next year, I'm thinking maybe I'm not the guy to cheer you up. So I thought music, OK, that makes people happy, right?”


	That's when Lin-Manuel Miranda and “Weird Al” Yankovic came out to cheer up the crowd in the Ed Sullivan Theatre in New York by singing Coldplay's “Viva la Vida” (the song seemed timely, huh?). The camera then panned to the audience for a Coldplay kiss cam parody, except it featured several more famous faces showing their solidarity to Colbert, including Andy Cohen, Anderson Cooper, Adam Sandler, Christopher McDonald, Last Week Tonight‘s John Oliver, The Tonight Show‘s Jimmy Fallon, Late Night‘s Seth Meyers and The Daily Show‘s Jon Stewart. [Stewart also railed against the cancellation on The Daily Show; while Fallon decried the decision.]

	











	Last week, Colbert and CBS announced that The Late Show would conclude at the end of the 2025-26 season in May next year. The network cited a “financial decision” amid a declining linear TV landscape for the cancellation.


	At the taping of Thursday's show last week, the host told the live audience that he was informed of the decision to end The Late Show the night before, drawing boos from the audience.


	Earlier on Monday night, during his monologue, Colbert also addressed people who “have been speculating about the timing of this decision from Paramount.”


	“They're pointing out that last Monday, just two days before my cancellation, I delivered a blistering monologue in which I showed the courage to have a mustache,” he joked (as he actually slammed Paramount in the monologue in question over their 16 million settlement with President Donald Trump). “I mean, obviously, CBS saw my upper lip and boom, canceled. Coincidence? Oh, I think not. This is worse than fascism. This is stache-ism.”


	The show's cancellation announcement comes as David Ellison's Skydance Media is currently in the process of acquiring Paramount Global, which is the parent company of CBS. However, the deal is still pending FCC approval, more than a year after the proposed merger was announced. Earlier this month, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from Trump, who sued over former Vice President Kamala Harris' 60 Minutes interview. Sources previously told The Hollywood Reporter that Paramount believes the lawsuit posed a threat to Skydance's deal to acquire the company, as it seeks approval by the FCC under the Trump administration.

	











	While Colbert has previously criticized the settlement on The Late Show, CBS said in a statement that it wasn't a factor in the decision to end the show. 


	“Over the weekend, somebody at CBS followed up their gracious press release with a gracious anonymous leak saying they pulled the plug on our show because of losses pegged between $40 million and $50 million a year,” Colbert later said during his monologue. “Forty million is a big number. I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million? Oh yeah.”


	Following the news last week, Trump also took to his Truth Social platform to positively gloat about the series being canceled, writing, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! [Fox News late night host] Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”


	On Monday's show, Colbert clapped back at Trump, saying, “How dare you, sir? Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism? Go fuck yourself,” drawing cheers from his live audience. They also broke out in a chant, yelling, “Stephen! Stephen! Stephen!”


	As for Trump's claim that Colbert's ABC counterpart “is next,” Colbert said, “Nope, absolutely not, Kimmel. I am the martyr. There's only room for one on this cross, and I've gotta tell you, the view is fantastic from up here. I can see your house!”

	











	Trump went after Colbert and the late-night brethren again on Tuesday morning, posting to Truth Social, “The word is, and it's a strong word at that, Jimmy Kimmel is NEXT to go in the untalented Late Night Sweepstakes and, shortly thereafter, Fallon will be gone. These are people with absolutely NO TALENT, who were paid Millions of Dollars for, in all cases, destroying what used to be GREAT Television.”


	Colbert has hosted The Late Show since 2015, after taking it over from David Letterman, who launched The Late Show in 1993.

As celebrity friends and stunned fans mourn the tragic passing of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, a new development emerged late on July 21, 2025. According to an update first reported by Us Weekly, “The Cosby Show” alum was not alone when he died in an accidental drowning at a beach in Costa Rica. 

A spokesperson for the Red Cross there told Us Weekly that on July 20, emergency personnel “attended to two adult male patients,” one of whom survived the incident.  

CPR was performed on a 54-year-old man who matched Warner's identity, the spokesperson said, but he was declared deceased at the scene. A second victim, an unidentified 35-year-old man, was “transported in critical condition to the local clinic,” Us Weekly was told. The Red Cross spokesperson confirmed to the outlet that Warner and the second person were “involved in the same incident.”

On July 21, Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Agency (OIJ) issued an incident report, translated from Spanish to English, that stated its agents “carried out the removal of the body of a male who died as a result of asphyxia by submersion,” per Today.com. 

The report said that Warner, who was vacationing with family at Playa Cocles in Costa Rica's Limon province, went for a swim in the ocean between 2 p.m. and 2:30 p.m. local time, per Today.com. According to the report, he was “dragged by a current offshore.”

Today.com reported that other people on the beach were able to pull Warner back to shore, but by the time the Costa Rican Red Cross arrived, he was “without vital signs.” His body was then sent to the Judicial Morgue in San Joaquin de Flores for an autopsy, the outlet reported. 

Roger Sanz, President of the Chamber of Tourism and Commerce of the Southern Caribbean, said in a statement, “Despite the rescue efforts made by Caribbean Guard volunteers at Playa Grande, the actor — who was vacationing in the area with his family — tragically lost his life. We want to make it clear that we are organized, that most of us do inform our clients and visitors. But like in every part of the world, accidents can happen — and this time, it happened to us.”

A post shared by TMZ (@tmz_tv)

At the time of his death, Warner had been in Costa Rica for a week, according to TMZ, which published video of the actor arriving at the airport there on July 13. The outlet reported that he had flown there from Atlanta.

A source confirmed to People that Warner was on a family vacation when he drowned. It is not clear if his wife and daughter were with him at the airport or if additional family members were on the trip. 

Although Warner is best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on eight seasons of “The Cosby Show” in the 80s, the actor's most recent roles included five seasons on FOX's medical drama “The Residents” and, his final role, as Chief Inspector Bill Houston on “Alert: Missing Persons Unit.”

When beloved actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner died on July 20, 2025, in an accidental drowning, he was vacationing with his family in Costa Rica, a source confirmed to People. 

Authorities said Warner, who was 54, drowned while swimming at a beach in Playa Cocles, located on the Caribbean coast, when a strong current, or rip tide, swept him offshore, according to the Associated Press.

The beach town of Playa Cocles, located in Limon Province, is a popular destination for surfers because of its abundant waves and laid-back vibes, per multiple tourist sites. But the strong, unpredictable rip tides there have also been cited by travel experts and researchers who have deemed it one of the most dangerous beaches in Costa Rica. 

A post shared by Costa Rica Top Tours (@costaricatoptours)

In 2009, researchers at the National University of Costa Rica developed a comprehensive risk assessment study to measure and build awareness around potential dangers at more than 100 beaches along the country's Pacific and Caribbean coasts, according to The Costa Rica Star. 

Playa Cocles, where Warner died, was named “the most dangerous beach in the Atlantic Coast,” according to the outlet, because of its rip currents and “irregular conditions of the beach.”

In November 2016, researchers at the University of Windsor in Ontario, Canada, worked with officials in Costa Rica on a study aimed at preventing drowning deaths due to dangerous rip currents, which a summary of the study defined as “powerful, narrow channels of fast-moving water that can swiftly transport swimmers a significant distance off-shore.” 

Professor Chris Houser, an expert in earth and environmental sciences, worked with the National University of Costa Rica, the United States embassy in Costa Rica, and the Red Cross to measure rip tides there and establish new laws, including training for lifeguards to spot rip tides and alerts for beachgoers, the summary said. 

A lifeguard program was specifically set up at Playa Cocles beach because, Houser reported, it was where they measured “the worst rips in Costa Rica.” The rip tides there were so strong, he said, that “even an Olympic swimmer could get swept up and drown trying to fight the current.”

A 2022 video about Playa Cocles from travel vlog “The World at Your Feet” said the white sand beach is best for surfers from January to March, when waves are highest.

Located near Puerto Viejo, the beach stretches nearly a mile, according to travel blogger James Kaiser, who recommended two luxury hotels — Le Cameleon and Geckoes Lodge. He also wrote that there are multiple “laid-back restaurants” located just across from the beach. 

It's not clear where Warner and his family, including his wife and daughter, were staying on their vacation. However, a statement from the Costa Rica Red Cross said it responded to the “water-related” incident at the Playa Grande resort in Cahuita, Limón at around 2:10 p.m. on July 20, per People.

TMZ published a photo and video of the actor arriving at the Costa Rica airport on July 13, one week before his tragic death.

Warner was best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on 80s sitcom “The Cosby Show,” but his most recent work has included five seasons on FOX's “The Residents” and, in April, appearing in his final TV role as Chief Inspector Bill Houston on “Alert: Missing Persons Unit.”

This isn't the first time the former Fox News host has taken issue with J.Lo.


													By
												

	Katie Atkinson


Executive Digital Director, West Coast


	Apparently Megyn Kelly isn't planning to go to a Jennifer Lopez concert anytime soon.


	On Monday (July 21), the SiriusXM host shared a clip from a recent J.Lo concert — as the pop star makes her way across Europe for the Up All Night: Live in 2025 tour — that shows Lopez dancing suggestively with three male backup dancers to her 2011 Lil Wayne-assisted hit “I'm Into You.”


	“So she's a soft porn star now,” Kelly wrote on X alongside the video, whose original poster had captioned it “55 year old Jennifer Lopez ‘performing.'” Kelly added: “Great choices!”


	Anyone who's seen Lopez perform recently — like when she returned to host the American Music Awards in May and kicked off the show with a choreography-heavy opening number soundtracked by the biggest hits of 2024-25 — knows this performance is nothing new for the singer/actress, long known for her dancing chops and her uninhibited onstage persona. (This is the woman behind the 2014 Billboard Hot 100 top 20 hit “Booty,” after all.)

	











	But it doesn't seem like Kelly has ever counted herself among Lopez's J.Lovers fan base. During her speech at a President Trump victory rally in January, The Megyn Kelly Show host invoked J.Lo's name, saying: “The good news just keeps on coming. I woke up this morning, I was 2 inches taller, a pound thinner and I had skin like Jennifer Lopez. Speaking of J. Lo, how happy are you her candidate lost? It's so delightful.” In June, Kelly dedicated a segment of her show (and a full online essay) to calling out the “desperate” bodysuit Lopez wore to her 2025 World Pride Festival set in Washington, D.C.

	










			Trending on Billboard		







	And last year, Lopez caught a stray when the former Fox News host took issue with a different musician, Usher, and his 2024 Super Bowl halftime show. “Not into Usher or this halftime show,” Kelly wrote on X in February 2024, following the R&B superstar's headlining stint at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium. “However I do appreciate that my kids haven't had anyone's vag exposed to them on screen as they innocently wait for the football to start. (Hi J-Lo, Shakira.)” (While there was no nudity during Lopez's co-headlining halftime show with Shakira at the 2020 Super Bowl, Kelly seems to remember a much more explicit production.)


	Once Lopez wraps her string of European dates next month, she'll return to Las Vegas for a new residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace starting Dec. 30, with dates through March 2026. Her Up All Night Live in Las Vegas residency follows her Jennifer Lopez: All I Have stint from 2016 to 2018 at Zappos Theater in Planet Hollywood.

So she's a soft porn star now. Great choices! https://t.co/kNO1FgC6GM

The 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's "Press 3" option was shut down on July 17.


							By 

	Carly Thomas


Associate Editor


Jim Parsons is blasting President Donald Trump‘s administration for shutting down one of the nation's crisis hotlines, which offered tailored support for LGBTQ youth and young adults.


The Big Bang Theory star made a recent appearance on MSNBC's The Weekend, where he criticized the decision to end the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline's LGBTQ service on July 17.




	“I think it's quite literally criminal,” Parsons said. “It's one of the kinds of decisions that you're like, ‘There's no good reason for it.' It doesn't matter what reason you ever put towards it or say it's the reason it's happening, it's never going to be justified.”

	The openly gay actor, who is married to Todd Spiewak, continued, “It is only hurtful and it feels like it's only being done in order to make a point, we're getting rid of this because we want to make sure certain people understand they're not welcome here.”


	According to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the LGBTQ youth program served more than 1.4 million callers since it launched in September 2022. Callers now don't have the option to “Press 3” for specialized LGBTQ support.


	SAMHSA wrote in a statement after it was announced that the Trump administration would be shutting down the specialized service, “Everyone who contacts the 988 Lifeline will continue to receive access to skilled, caring, culturally competent crisis counselors who can help with suicidal, substance misuse, or mental health crises, or any other kind of emotional distress. Anyone who calls the Lifeline will continue to receive compassion and help.”

      Stargate SG-1 is sci-fi series about a secret government program in possession of alien technology that enables humans to instantly travel to other inhabitable planets. It's only second to the X-Files in my book when it comes to reflecting the reality of government/alien coverups.
    


      This episode Covenant (available on Amazon Prime Video for free!) is soooo on-the-nose it's like the producers are well aware of what's going on...and more.
    


      Here's the parallels I noticed to reality:
    


      - Alec Colson, billionaire aerospace entrepreneur intent on disclosure -> Robert Bigelow
    


      - The Trust: Shady secret org of powerful people intent on keeping the secret of the Stargate -> the Gatekeepers
    


      - The Vice President being part of the the Trust -> Dick Cheney as gatekeeper
    


      - Govt gives alien tech / dna to contractors to reverse engineer -> black budget programs
    


      - The Asgard: classic greys some of whom conduct experiments on humans on Earth -> abductions
    


      - Colson announces evidence of ET life and then the Trust tries to kill him in mysterious ways -> whistleblower attacks
    


      - The media working directly with the government -> the coverup
    


      - the alpha site -> offworld bases a la gary mckinnon
    


      - images of ships in space held / shown by Colson -> similar to what gary mckinnon found
    


      - the stock market crashing due to attempts at disclosure -> fears of the powerful against disclosure
    


      I could totally go on. Anyone else watch this episode / the series in general and see the similarities to reality? Anything I missed that might point to a reality hitherto undiscovered re: disclosure? Would love to reverse engineer topics of investigation from sci-fi  ^_^

A controversial new paper questions whether the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is a potentially dangerous alien probe, similar to claims made about 'Oumuamua. But experts have called it "nonsense".

The newly discovered interstellar object 3I/ATLAS could be a piece of "possibly hostile" extraterrestrial technology in disguise, according to controversial research from a small group of scientists, including a renowned alien-hunting astronomer.

Their paper, which has not been peer-reviewed, echoes similar claims previously made about 'Oumuamua, the first-ever cosmic interloper that was discovered in 2017.

But experts have told Live Science that the new claims are "nonsense" and "insulting," and insist that the available evidence points toward the object being completely natural.

3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1 barreling toward the sun at more than 130,000 mph (210,000 km/h), and was confirmed to be an interstellar object less than 24 hours later. Initial observations strongly suggest it is a large comet surrounded by a cloud of ice, gas and dust called a coma, stretching up to 15 miles (24 kilometers) across. A computer model simulating where it originated from hinted that it could be up to 3 billion years older than our solar system, potentially making it the oldest comet ever seen.

But in a new paper, uploaded July 16 to the preprint server arXiv, a trio of researchers have questioned whether the comet is actually some form of covert alien tech sent here by an advanced, potentially aggressive extraterrestrial civilization.

The researchers described the new paper as a "pedagogical exercise," or thought experiment, and offer no clear evidence of alien involvement. Instead, they point at the comet's "anomalous characteristics" and provide alternative theories to explain them.

The study's most notable author is Avi Loeb, an astronomer at Harvard University who is renowned for linking extraterrestrial objects to intelligent aliens. He is the head of the Galileo Project, which is attempting to detect evidence of technosignatures and UFOs. In 2023, he led a controversial expedition that claimed to have collected pieces of possible alien tech left behind by an unconfirmed interstellar meteorite in the Pacific Ocean. (These claims have since been largely debunked by outside researchers).

Loeb was also the primary researcher who claimed that the unusual shape and non-gravitational acceleration of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua were signs that it was an alien probe.

Today, the general consensus is that 'Oumuamua was an asteroid that was leaking gas into space, similar to a comet. However, Loeb and his colleagues have continued to advocate its potential alien origin and have proposed missions to track down the wandering space rock.



Loeb's co-authors for the new study are both associated with the Initiative for Interstellar Studies (i4is), a U.K. institute dedicated to planning future missions to alien star systems.

In a blog post explaining the new paper, Loeb wrote that if 3I/ATLAS is a "technological artifact" it could be evidence of the dark forest hypothesis, which argues that the reason we have not found evidence of extraterrestrial life is that they are staying silent to remain invisible to potential predators or prey.

"The consequences, should the hypothesis turn out to be correct, could potentially be dire for humanity, and would possibly require defensive measures to be undertaken," he wrote.

Most of the points laid out in the new paper relate to the unusual trajectory of 3I/ATLAS. The object is moving significantly faster than the only other known interstellar objects — 'Oumuamua and Comet Borisov, which was spotted in 2019 — and has entered the solar system at a different angle from its predecessors, approaching the sun side-on relative to our star's orbit through the Milky Way.

Loeb wrote that the object's trajectory "offers various benefits to an extraterrestrial intelligence" that may be using it to subtly spy on Earth. One such benefit is that 3I/ATLAS will make relatively close approaches to three planets: Jupiter, Mars and Venus. And the minimum distances between the object and these worlds could enable aliens to discretely deploy "gadgets" there, Loeb wrote.

3I/ATLAS will also be hidden on the opposite side of the sun to Earth when it reaches its closest point to our home star in late October. "This could be intentional to avoid detailed observations from Earth-based telescopes when the object is brightest or when gadgets are sent to Earth from that hidden vantage point," Loeb wrote.



The unusually high speed of 3I/ATLAS also makes it very hard to launch a spacecraft to intercept it before it exits the solar system, which could be another potential sign of clandestine alien activity, the researchers argued.

Based on its current speed, Loeb also noted that 3I/ATLAS would have entered the outer boundaries of the solar system around 8,000 years ago, which is "roughly when human-made technologies became advanced enough to start documenting history on Earth." Although, it is unclear what he is trying to imply by saying this.

The researchers also argued that there is insufficient evidence to show conclusively that 3I/ATLAS is a comet, especially as researchers are yet to identify any "volatiles," or specific chemicals associated with comets, within its coma.

Since 3I/ATLAS was discovered, researchers have been trying to identify it, and so far, the overwhelming consensus is that it is a comet.

"There have been numerous telescopic observations of 3I/ATLAS demonstrating that it's displaying classical signatures of cometary activity," Darryl Seligman, an astronomer at Michigan State University who led the first study quantifying 3I/ATLAS, told Live Science in an email.

"All evidence points to this being an ordinary comet that was ejected from another solar system, just as countless billions of comets have been ejected from our own solar system," added Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina in Canada who specializes in solar system dynamics.



Any assumptions about the object's lack of volatiles is also premature at this time. "The object is still pretty far away from the sun, so no, we wouldn't typically expect to find direct evidence of volatiles necessarily," Seligman said. Instead, these compounds will likely become apparent in the coming weeks and months, he added.

Loeb admits that the alien technology scenario is a long shot: "By far, the most likely outcome will be that 3I/ATLAS is a completely natural interstellar object, probably a comet," he wrote in the blog post.

Given the available evidence, many of the researchers who spoke to Live Science are disappointed with the new paper and pointed out that it distracts from the work of other scientists.



"Astronomers all around the world have been thrilled at the arrival of 3I/ATLAS, collaborating to use advanced telescopes to learn about this visitor," Chris Lintott, an astronomer at the University of Oxford who was part of the team that simulated 3I/ATLAS's galactic origins, told Live Science in an email. "Any suggestion that it's artificial is nonsense on stilts, and is an insult to the exciting work going on to understand this object."

—1 million 'interstellar objects' — each larger than the Statue of Liberty — may lurk in the outer solar system

—An interstellar visitor may have changed the course of 4 solar system planets, study suggests

Loeb is no stranger to this type of criticism and has defended his position, writing that "the hypothesis is an interesting exercise in its own right, and is fun to explore, irrespective of its likely validity."

However, while it is important to remain open-minded about any "testable prediction," the new paper pushes this sentiment to the limit, Lawler told Live Science in an email. "In my experience, the vast majority of scientists subscribe to the idea that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and the evidence presented is absolutely not extraordinary."

HBO's True Blood, which originally ended its run in 2014, is experiencing a major resurgence across Central and Eastern Europe. According to this week's HBO Top 10 rankings, the vampire fantasy drama is currently charting in 13 countries, including Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Hungary, among others.

The show hit the Top 10 in all 13 territories on July 18, peaking in viewership momentum mid-week. This sudden spike underscores a renewed interest in long-finished genre series. At the same time, it's interesting to note that neither The Originals (TVD's spinoff) or The Vampire Diaries itself has seen a recent uptrend. Therefore, the recent rising viewership for True Blood appears to be a synergy of algorithmic suggestions and fan love for Charlaine Harris's The Southern Vampire Mysteries, especially considering that True Blood concluded its story in 2014.

What makes True Blood's revival remarkable is its cross-country consistency. The series ranked in the Top 5 across 12 of 13 countries on July 18 and has held steady in the Top 10 every day since. Its average weekly ranking sits at 5.4, with strong showings in smaller markets like Moldova (#8), Slovakia (#6), and Slovenia (#10). Critics and audiences are interestingly also nearly in sync on True Blood, with Rotten Tomatoes scores of 68% and 73%, respectively.

While The Vampire Diaries and its spinoff The Originals remain iconic CW staples with massive fanbases, True Blood has carved a darker, more mature lane that now probably feels fresher in today's streaming landscape for a niche fanbase. Unlike TVD's teen-focused romance and high school intrigue, True Blood leans heavily into Southern Gothic themes, political allegory, and adult content and that offers viewers a grittier, more provocative take on vampire mythology.

In terms of longevity, TVD ran for eight seasons compared to True Blood's seven, but it's HBO's bolder creative freedom and risk-taking that is probably giving True Blood the required traction at this point. TVD holds a 86% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes but lacks strong critic scores across seasons. The CW franchise thrived on cliffhangers, spinoffs, and growing teen-interest in riding the supernatural bandwagon back then but that's not as relevant now, likely because people are more inclined toward procedural dramas that are simultaneously branched out and more realistic. True Blood, on the other hand, is a self-contained series with no spinoffs.

True Blood is available to stream on HBO. Stay tuned to Collider for more updates.

According to one idea, ball lightning occurs after a cloud to ground strike.

A video filmed in Canada appears to show a strange glowing blue-white orb oscillating as it slowly moved across a field.

Ed and Melinda Pardy, weather enthusiasts from Alberta, Canada, were attempting to look for funnel clouds after a recent storm when they spotted the highly unusual orb in a field behind their property. According to Ed, the sphere appeared to hover above the ground at a height of around 7 meters (23 feet).

“Once the lightning bolt kind of disappeared, the ball of light kind of got bigger, intensified, like, really bright,” he told Canadian outlet CTV News. “Then I was like, ‘Oh, that'll go away really soon,' and it didn't.”

After traveling across the field for around 20 seconds, the orb suddenly disappeared from view.

                        

Ed, who had read about the phenomenon as a child, wondered whether it might be the elusive "ball lightning", potentially described back as far as the 12th century CE. Back then, an account from one abbot describes how "a sort-of fiery globe threw itself down into the river". The next account came nearly 450 years later, highlighting how rare and elusive the phenomenon is.

"For a long time ball lightning was regarded with scepticism. Although it is now generally accepted as a genuine phenomenon with thousands of reported sightings, there is still no accepted scientific explanation of its origin," Giles Gasper and Brian Tanner, who highlighted the 12th century account, explain in a piece for The Conversation.

"Highly complicated theories include the burning of silicon from vaporised soil. More recently, a suggestion has been made for light trapped inside a sphere of thin air. It is one of the oldest scientific puzzles that remains unsolved."

While we know very little of the phenomenon – given its rarity – in recent years, scientists have been less dismissive of it. In 2012, researchers at the Northwest Normal University in Lanzhou, China set up cameras and a spectrometer in the Qinghai Plateau, known for its frequent lightning, and recorded until they saw an apparent ball of lightning. 

                      

Analyzing the chemical composition the team found it contained silicon, iron, and calcium.

"It is known that silicon, iron, and calcium are the main components of soil. Consequently, there are reasons to believe that our observed [ball lightning] is generated by the [cloud to ground] lightning striking to the soil on the ground," the team explained in their paper, adding that "the radiation from soil elements is present for the entire lifetime of the ball lightning."

According to that team, though the ball lightning observed may not be representative of all ball lightning, the evidence here pointed to lightning vaporizing the soil, followed by silicon interacting with oxygen in the air creating the distinctive glow.

So, is this new video ball lightning? Given what we know of it, and that's not a whole lot, it remains unclear. For a start, this object appears larger than previous reports of ball lightning.

“The brightness of ball lightning is typically given by witnesses as comparable to that of a 100 W lamp," Mark Stenhoff, the author of Ball Lighting (1999), previously told IFLScience. "In daylight conditions, it would be difficult to view it from much of a distance. It is often reported fairly close to the ground, so obstructions would also limit the distance over which it could be observed”.

As well as this, the ball appears to be quite blue in color.

"There's actually maybe one thing that tends to produce this color, especially when it comes to lightning," astronomy YouTuber Anton Petrov explains in a video.

"This blue white coloration is very likely the result of aluminum, and a lot of aluminum. And where do we find aluminum? Well, very often inside transmission lines."

           

Though ball lightning would be awesome, something far less rare called "electric power line arcs" could be the culprit here.

“Sometimes an arc can be formed that travels across those lines, flashing with an orange and blue light, and then at the very end, it typically vanishes in a puff of sparks. And that's exactly what we're seeing here,” storm chaser George Kourounis told CTV News, though he added that he couldn't be completely sure without witnessing it first-hand.

"If it is ball lightning," he added, "then this is one of the best ball lightning videos I've ever seen."

China is working super hard to contend for the position of the frontier of research and development, as its CNSA (China's National Space Administration) recently announced a discovery of an extraterrestrial ocean that could shift the race in its favor. This silent race to become the next frontier of research and development has been happening quietly in the shadows. This race is happening between China, Japan, and the West. 

The twist behind all of this is that even though the CSNA has made this discovery, they expressly stipulated that this extraterrestrial phenomenon does not contain water. This discovery was brought into the limelight during a press briefing that was televised and broadcast all over the world.

This extraterrestrial body was said to be more of a liquid layer covering up an entire world, made up of a substance we don't even know about yet as humans.

It was described much more clearly as a fluid, resting, and floating mass of water drifting across the galaxy. Now, after making these substantial claims, the inevitable reality of questions slipping into the minds of many becomes an obvious reality. One such question is, “What is this extraterrestrial ocean made up of if it's not water?” Another interesting question most enthusiasts seem to be asking is, “Could this new water form support planetary life as we know it?

CSNA scientists have stipulated that the extraterrestrial ocean has more similarity with the properties of a superfluid than with the properties of any liquid we can find on Earth. A superfluid is a specific type of fluid that has zero viscosity and inherently flows without any loss in kinetic energy. In other words, the discovery stipulated that this extraterrestrial form does not behave like any liquid we know on planet Earth. Instead, it moves in waves and reacts to gravitational forces. 

Just like many other nations that have developed hyper-sophisticated spacecraft to study our cosmos from the lenses of astronomy, China has also developed its Tianwen-X probe. This equipment was able to pick up thermal signatures that were being emitted by this strange, dark, and icy planet. 

Shortly after this discovery was made, closer attention was paid to expand the details of it, and upon clearer observation, it was found that the thermal and erratic heat signatures that were being emitted from the planet were a liquid-like layer wrapping around the planet, disguising itself as some form of energy system.

One of the many reasons the discovery itself is groundbreaking is that, it should be noted, even though this phenomenon is not outrightly a liquid, it still flows. After a series of highly advanced tests that specialized in complex systems like spectrography and magnetic field analysis were carried out, it was eventually universally agreed that this ocean is composed of high-energy particles that are bound in a fluidic quantum state. 

In recent times, making such substantial discoveries is necessary to deeply understand our planet and the universe alike. This new concept challenges everything we know about physics. 

The Newtonian laws we have on Earth do not apply to extraterrestrial phenomena, which in this case is the extraterrestrial ocean covering the dark, icy planet. This is just a glimpse of the possibilities in our universe. It is now time for us to rethink and imagine water and its characteristics. Consequently, what we consider normal and straight on Earth doesn't seem to follow through once in the deepest parts of space and beyond.

There is no shortage of speculation surrounding From, but one Julie Matthews theory could actually help explain a strange moment from season 2. Like any good mystery show, From's complex nature means that with each new episode, more questions are introduced, while their answers are slowly revealed over time.

By From season 3's ending, there are more questions than ever. This includes Tabitha Matthews and Jade Herrera's reincarnation reveal and Boyd Stevens' discovery of the reborn Smiley monster. Julie's story walking and how it connects to other events is still unclear, though one new theory suggests it's more important than we currently know.

From season 3 introduced Julie Matthews' ability to story walk, a variation of time travel that allows her to revisit various moments from the stories of other characters. This first occurs in season 3, episode 8, when Julie and Ethan return to the ruins where Julie, Marielle, and Randall were tortured, and she is transported away from her brother.

Between Julie Matthews' time travel and the introduction of the Man in Yellow, there are many theories about what will happen in From season 4. 

During this brief time, Julie interacts with several of From's other characters, though not in scenes that she was originally in. When she eventually returns to her own time and confides in Ethan what happened to her, he explains the ability, also sharing that she cannot change the past, she can only visit it.

It is this detail in Julie's story that the new From theory stems from. It argues that it was actually Julie, in one of her story walking adventures, who knocks on the RV during the scene in which Jim, Randall, Donna, and Boyd are trapped in the crashed vehicle overnight (via Reddit).

When Julie appears at the end of From season 3, she has a large scratch on her face, which could have happened while trying to escape from the monsters in the cave.

This moment came at a crucial point in season 2 when Randall was getting ever closer to breaking down, just before the trio lapses into their comas. The knocking was scary to those inside the RV, but the theory posits that it was actually an accident on Julie's part after attempting to escape from Fromville's tunnels.

From is following in Lost's footsteps as the MGM+ science-fiction horror series repeats a cleverly teased plot twist that Lost used 17 years ago.

This could make sense, given that the previous time that she saw the cave system, she was utterly horrified and got lost trying to follow her mother and Victor. What's more, when Julie appears at the end of From season 3, she has a large scratch on her face, which could have happened while trying to escape from the monsters in the cave.

 Beyond Julie potentially being the source of the knocking on the RV in season 2, it seems probable that she could have also been responsible for other unexplained events in From as well. In fact, season 3 confirmed it was Julie who threw the rope to Boyd in season 2, solving one big mystery.

Likewise, several other theories similarly highlight Julie's newfound ability as the answer to longstanding mysteries. These theories range from Julie being recognized by a monster despite just arriving in the town, to Julie being the real creator of the talismans, proving just how broad an application the skill could have.

All of From's seasons have been generally well-received and made the show popular, but which of the three seasons has been the strongest so far? 


Audiences also know from season 3's ending that Julie with short hair appears just before Jim's death, trying to change his story to help him survive. This moment both reaffirms Ethan's words of advice to his sister and implies, due to her changed appearance, that Julie remains in Fromville for a long time beyond season 3's ending.

Even without being able to change the past, Julie does not yet know how other versions of herself impacted it.

Importantly, Ethan's reveal that Julie will not be able to change the past with her story walking seems to come true sadly quickly, but there could be numerous events that she doesn't necessarily know she is involved in yet. Even without being able to change the past, Julie does not yet know how other versions of herself impacted it.

The Man in Yellow's identity is still a mystery after From season 3, but one fan theory claims he's the older version of an existing character.

In general, From would be better off using Julie's story walking ability sparingly in season 4, as it could become repetitive if the series solved too many mysteries that way. With that being said, though, if the series does use Julie's new talent in the right moments, it could create perfect big reveals.

Julie's ability to story walk was a huge addition to From season 3 and should return in From season 4 to help further explain the show's mysteries. While I do think the new From theory is correct about Julie's involvement in several unexplained events in the show, it seems possible that the banging noise in season 2 could have actually been the Man in Yellow instead.

There has been a new exciting update surrounding the upcoming season 4 of one of the best horror shows on TV, which further raises its anticipation.

The knocking and how afraid Randall is what forces him out into the woods at night, leading to him ending up in a coma. This event and its unfortunate outcome make it feel more likely that the Man in Yellow made the noise, or at least ordered one of From's monsters to do it for him.

Every helpful discovery is countered by a worse foe, leading to the theory that the Man in Yellow is behind it all.

Especially given how much the noise was meant to scare the RV's inhabitants, it seems like something he could have done. Though it is possible that Julie could have accidentally scared them by knocking, the Man in Yellow is known for creating chaos and fear, so it seems more likely that it was an insidious and intentional move by him.

After the Man in Yellow's chilling introduction in the From season 3 finale, a season 4 theory makes the villain even more terrifying. 

Interestingly, From introduced the Man in Yellow in the season 3 finale, when he appears to kill Jim, linking him to Julie and her story walking. Nothing in From's universe is by chance. Every helpful discovery is countered by a worse foe, leading to the theory that the Man in Yellow is behind it all.

Given how often the seemingly unrelated stories in From are connected, it is possible that Julie's story walking is somehow either connected or in opposition to the Man in Yellow's powers.

Given how often the seemingly unrelated stories in From are connected, it is possible that Julie's story walking is somehow either connected or in opposition to the Man in Yellow's powers. Whether this means that one or both of them played a role in the knocking, it's possible that the moment unknowingly led Fromville's residents to where they are now.

These 10 HBO miniseries are absolute masterpieces, showing what makes great miniseries, and number 1 may even be one of the best shows of all time.

Mastering such a wide and varied genre like sci-fi isn't easy, and keeping that quality up is even harder - which makes masterpieces stand even more.

A fresh perspective on the genre, this crime drama series with a perfect Rotten Tomatoes score promises to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

The ‘best ever UFO footage' has just had its authenticity verified by a ‘ufologist'.

This footage was captured by pilot Jorge A. Arteaga as he was flying over Colombia.

In it, a dark object can be seen emerging from the clouds and flying past the cockpit of Arteaga's plane.

A UFO expert has since come out to endorse the video, branding it ‘one of the greatest' pieces of evidence.

Arteaga and his co-pilot, Daniel, were in the skies above Colombia when they noticed the strange object moving in their direction.

At that point, Arteaga started filming and began to follow the UFO with the aircraft.

The pilot expressed fear when the object started moving towards him.

The aircraft was flying at a speed of 300KMH (186mph), with temperatures falling to five degrees Celsius.

We've seen a lot of UFO footage over the years, but this still stood out from the rest.

And a Ufologist agreed.

Jaime Maussan is a Mexican journalist with a very keen interest in alien activity.

Maussan spoke with Arteaga for an interview, and shared a clip to X.

 “We are facing one of the greatest UAP (UFO) evidences of all time; captured by the Captain Pilot Aviator @JorgeArteagaG,” he wrote in the caption.

Whether or not the word of a ufologist will be enough to sway skeptics remains to be seen.

It's no secret that there's a lot of UFO enthusiasts out there.

But can you blame them for being so fascinated?

A documentary came out earlier this year which claimed the US government had been involved in an '80-year cover-up' on the matter.

Then there were the whistleblowers testifying in Congress about ‘excessive secrecy' surrounding non-human intelligence.

And that's not forgetting all the video footage out there – like this object seen flying over New York City or this UFO spotted during an eclipse in Texas.

Who knows what the truth of the matter really is?

SOUTHWICK — Ronny LeBlanc, author of “Monsterland” and former star of “Expedition Bigfoot” on the Discovery channel, will dive into the Native American history as well as recent and personal sightings of high strangeness that some believe to be paranormal during a program hosted by the Public Library Wednesday.

“When we've had Bigfoot programs in the past, they've been very successful and we thought he'd be good to bring to Southwick,” Library Director Lynn Blair said about the program.

Supernatural heads back to comics.

Marvel teases Ultimate Endgame.

Ice Cream Man to release deck of cards.

This is Comic Book Club News for July 22, 2025.

Dean and Sam will carry on, my wayward sons, as Dynamite Entertainment and Warner Bros. Discovery Global Consumer Products have announced a brand-new Supernatural comic book series is debuting this October.

Written by Greg Pak with art by Eder Messias, the comic will depict previously unseen adventures of the Winchester brothers that take place between the episodes of the insanely long-running CW series. 

Back in 2008, Wildstorm (under DC Comics) published a series of in-continuity miniseries tying into Supernatural: Origins, Rising Son, Beginning's End, and Caledonia. After those early experiments, it seems that was it for Supernatural in comics — until Dynamite came into the picture. In fact, according to  the publisher, “Warner Brothers was not looking to license Supernatural out as there's no event around it… But we politely pushed as we really wanted it, and over the course of the last two years, and some pitches, Warner Brothers felt like we had the right team to move it forward.”

In the new series, “the monster hunters will hear of a series of mysterious fires haunting a decaying rust belt town. When a local factory burns down, followed by several employees going up in flames, and the CEO is suspiciously well-prepared, it's up to Dean and Sam to figure out what's going on and set it straight!”

Supernatural #1 will hit stores in October. 

Back in 2019, Marvel Studios released a little movie called Avengers: Endgame. And now Marvel Comics is hoping to get a bit of that hype for Ultimate Endgame, a new event series that will bring to a head the Ultimate Universe's ongoing plot thanks to the return of the evil Reed Richards, The Maker.

While Marvel is light on details for the December 31, 2025 debuting event — more will be revealed at San Diego Comic-Con — we do have two teaser images that directly call to mind the MCU blockbuster.

The first showed a breaking apart “U” a la the teaser poster for Avengers: Endgame. The second? A straight-up crib of the head pile main poster for Endgame.

That said, we can tell a few things based on this parody teases. The above-the-line characters in the event are Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, King T'Challa, Peter Parker, Logan, Mei Igarashi, Janet Van Dyne, Reed Richards (aka Doom), and Reed Richards (aka The Maker). No huge surprises, these are all characters featured in Marvel's Ultimate Universe line, including Ultimate Spider-Man, Ultimate X-Men, Ultimate Black Panther, Ultimate Wolverine, and The Ultimates.

What's more interesting in the teaser are the bottom credits. Other characters listed are Charli Ramsey, Thor Odinson, Sif, Lejori Joena Zakaria, Luke Cage, Nico Minoru, America Chavez, Illyana Rasputin, Emmanuel Da Costa, and Bruce Banner. But more important are the other credits: the Ultimate Writers are Jonathan Hickman, Bryan Hill, Peach Momoko, Deniz Camp, and Chris Condon. Assistant Editor is Michelle Marchese, Editor is Wil Moss, Editor-in-Chief is C.B. Cebulski, and Executive Producers are Kevin Feige and Dan Buckley.

While none of that is a huge surprise — those are the writers and editors, after all — the inclusion of Feige on there does drive home the increased collaboration between Marvel Comics and Studios. Whether there are any portals in Ultimate Endgame or anyone says “I love you 3000” remains to be seen.

Image Comics‘ Ice Cream Man regularly pushes the comic book form with every issue. But a new one-shot from creators W. Maxwell Prince, Martín Morazzo, and Chris O'Halloran won't be a comic at all: The Mortal Coil Shuffle is being published as a deck of 55 cards.

The custom-designed deck featuring custom backs and a custom box as well are designed by Morazzo, O'Halloran and Good Old Neon. Image teases that “Some cards will tell part of the story; while other cards cast inscrutable spells on unwitting characters; and some must be joined with other cards to form a complete piece of art.”

Added Prince, “When I was nine, I contracted chicken pox. And the only person available to watch me while sick was my German next door neighbor—a lovely woman named Inge, who, over time, would become a sort of surrogate grandmother to me. She taught me how to play Gin rummy that be-pocked week, and if I close my eyes now I can still hear her shuffling the deck, tapping her gigantic press-on nails onto the table between drags of her extra long Kool cigarettes.

“The cards were alive for me back then, and so this little Ice Cream Man experiment is dedicated to Inge: let's see if we can't bring some cards to life one more time!”

The Mortal Coil Shuffle will be a limited one-time-only printing, and Image promises there will never be a second printing, no new runs, and it will never exist in any of the Ice Cream Man trades or collections.

Ice Cream Man: Mortal Coil Shuffle will hit comic book shops on Wednesday, October 1.

Clive Palmer's political parties Trumpets of Patriots and the United Australia Party (UAP) have not reported their privacy breach to her office, despite claiming to have done so, Australia's privacy commissioner says.

The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) also left the door open to the possibility that the UAP will face penalties because an exemption for political parties from the Privacy Act may not apply as the UAP has been de-registered.  

Last week, Palmer's parties announced that they were the victims of a ransomware attack that had exposed “all emails to and from the Political Parties (including their attachments) and documents and records created and or held electronically by the Political Parties at any time”.

As part of a notice put on the parties' websites and sent to their email lists, the parties claimed to “reported the breach to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) and to the Australian Signals Directorate.”

However, a spokesperson for the OAIC says it has no record of a breach being reported to the agency.

Neither a spokesperson for Palmer nor the privacy officer for the parties immediately responded to a request for comment. 

Under Australian privacy law, entities have 30 days to report a breach. Based on Palmer's parties' claim that an intruder was detected on 23 June, a formal report of the breach is due by tomorrow, 23 July. 

Political parties are exempt from the Privacy Act, which includes the obligation to report any breaches. 

Except the UAP may not be exempt. The party was “voluntarily deregistered” after the 2022 election, and was unsuccessful in its High Court bid to register before the last election. The UAP is still not registered according to the AEC.

An OAIC spokesperson said it had not confirmed whether “any or all of them are entitled to claim the political party exemption” given the recency of the event. 

“Any entity not covered by the exemption will need to adhere to the requirements of the Notifiable Data Breach scheme, as well as to the Privacy Act more generally,” they told Crikey.

Failing to report a breach can result in penalties under the Privacy Act. 

Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind questioned why political parties are exempted from Australia's privacy laws.

“The exemption is not only out of step with community expectations, it is not reflective of the nature and scope of risks to Australians' privacy in the digital era,” she said to Crikey.

The OAIC has always opposed the political party exemption, and Kind said that each new data breach was a reminder why Australian organisations should be improving their cybersecurity practices.

“The Australian community wants more, not fewer, protections on their privacy,” Kind said.

Contemporary Ireland is best thought of as a paranormal state. The paranormal is that which is “analogous or parallel to, but separate from or going beyond” known reality. The principle site of paranormal activity in Ireland is not some haunted castle or spooky seance. It is the Government coffers. We have a fiscal policy and a parafiscal one – a ghostly exchequer parallel to the known reality of the Irish economy.

By the end of this year, the State will have taken in roughly €186 billion in corporation taxes over the last decade. In many ways, the story of contemporary Ireland is encapsulated in the astonishing growth in the share of overall tax revenue contributed by corporation tax. In 1984, it was just 4 per cent. By 2014,  it had almost tripled to 11 per cent. It has by now almost tripled again to 29 per cent.

Most of this dizzying increase is what official bodies call “excess”. “In other words,” as the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council puts it, “it cannot be explained by underlying domestic activity.” Or, in the Central Bank's formulation, it is “disconnected from actual economic activity in Ireland”. It is paranormal and, I think, unprecedented. Has any government in the history of the world ever been so dependent on the excessive and the inexplicable? Has any state ever driven such a great distance on the fumes of airy superfluity? 

To get a sense of the scale of this ectoplasmic largesse, we can ask: how much money would the State have taken in last year if the share of its revenues accounted for by corporation tax were the same as 2014?  The answer would be €11.9 billion. And what did the State actually take in corporation tax in 2024? That answer is €28 billion.

So we're looking at €16 billion of last year's revenue that was accounted for simply by the magical growth in the proportional contribution of corporation tax paid by a tiny number of American multinationals. To put that in context, €16 billion is the combined budget of the departments of Education and Transport this year. 

Little Ireland received more tax revenue from American corporations than any other country outside the US

At one level, of course, this windfall is not mysterious. The “excess” of magic money is a byproduct of the machinations of around 10 gigantic US-based corporations. They have transferred their intangible assets – patents, trademarks, brands and software licences – from overly obvious offshore tax havens to the more respectable but still very generous environs of Ireland.

The Irishness of this intellectual property (IP) is a legal fiction. We might call it IPP: Intellectual Plastic Paddy. But IPP allows the corporations to massively inflate the profits they declare here and the State to claim 12.5 per cent (now rising to 15 per cent) of those profits.

It might be reassuring to imagine that all this is the result of a cunning plan of Irish governments. But it isn't. The State was red in tooth and claw in its fight to stop the modest reforms to global tax regimes that resulted in the decisions of the multinationals to onshore their IP out of the tax havens and into Ireland. It went along with those reforms grudgingly and with bad grace when it had no real choice. This is the irony: the State has been enriched against its will, dragged kicking and screaming into Aladdin's cave.

Nonetheless, in 2022-2023, the latest year for which we have figures from the US, little Ireland received more tax revenue from American corporations than any other country outside the US. We got twice as much as China, three times as much as Germany, as much as India and Canada put together.

It is this  magic fountain that waters our parafiscal exchequer. The State essentially runs two budgets. One, based on actual economic activity in Ireland, is consistently in deficit. But the other, inflated by the IPP bonanza, is in flamboyantly extravagant surplus. The first is masked by the second. The paranormal occludes the normal.

So what? If we leave aside the morality – and by God do we ever leave aside the morality – it's free money. The luck of the Irish has turned from a sick joke into a daily reality. Why not just enjoy it?

The problem, though, is that paranormal activity is bewildering. It makes it hard to decide what is and is not real. And this is the paralysing condition that besets the State. It cannot make up its collective mind whether the “excess” is a conjuring trick or hard fact. Is it just the way Ireland is and will be for the foreseeable future? Or is it a little Eden from which, any day now, we will be expelled and thenceforth have to earn our bread by the sweat of our brows?

Unearned wealth – and let's be clear that this is what most of this “excess” corporation tax is – leads to laziness

These dual possibilities are the headlights in which the State is caught and frozen. It can neither believe its luck nor discount it. This is the underlying reason for the almost inexplicable inability of a very rich country to reach European standards of infrastructure and social services.

Because we don't think the bonanza is real and sustainable, we can't plan to spend it sustainably. Yet because we have this embarrassment of riches, we don't have to think about how we raise and spend money in the normal, tangible Irish economy. Hence, successive governments adamantly refuse to broaden the tax base – why bother taking the risk of upsetting any powerful lobby when you can just watch the billions roll into the parafiscal treasury?

Why, indeed, make any real choices at all? Unearned wealth – and let's be clear that this is what most of this “excess” corporation tax is – leads to laziness. The hard work of reform, of innovation, of articulating priorities and then delivering them, can be shirked. 

The State needs to pick a side: either decide that the crock of gold will keep renewing itself and invest accordingly, or conclude that leprechaun economics has had its day. Either trust in the paranormal or make the normal fit for purpose.

DEAR READERS: I was recently interviewed by the Nashville Voyager Magazine. I thought I would share some of the questions they asked me, so you would also get to know a little bit more about me. I have been writing this column for many years, and I am so proud to offer the topic of spirituality in a non-scary, non-woo-woo way, and I never dreamed my column would be as popular or welcomed as it has been, and I am so grateful to each of you who takes the time to read my words each week. I recently moved to Tennessee, and I have had some big challenges and changes, so I hope you enjoy the article

Q: Bonnie, please kick things off for us with an introduction to yourself and your story.

A: I was born into a family of spiritualists. For many generations, my ancestors have had this gift from God running through their veins. I am a fourth-generation psychic medium. I grew up in a small rural town in New England. The house I grew up in was an old historical schoolhouse, and there always seemed to be spirits available for my viewing and engaging with. Since my mother had the gift of mediumship [and] could see what I was seeing and could alleviate any fears that I had with connecting to the spirit world, I grew up thinking everyone saw spirits.

As I grew older, the spirit world would become even stronger in my life. Hearing the voice of God asking me to do this work, I asked, “Why?” when he said, “Little One, the world is becoming darker and darker, and we need more light.” I closed down my Salon I owned and “Messages from Heaven” was born. For over a decade, I have been a full-time demonstrating medium, giving audiences, large and small, a glimpse into Heaven with the intention of providing proof that life goes on and the bond of love can never die. Deciding to follow our son and grandchildren to this area has had its challenges, but it's so worth the chance to be with our family. I am now at the point of opening a private office just fifteen minutes from Nashville in Franklin, Tenn.

My website has so much more info: www.bonniepagemedium.com. I have also written three books found on Amazon and I've been writing a weekly column for the last seven years called “Ask the Psychic” as a freelance columnist for [MediaNews Group], which is seen in many of their papers. My mission is to bring healing to all and to erase the fear of dying while proving that life goes on and Love Never Dies.

Q: I'm sure it wasn't obstacle-free, but would you say the journey has been fairly smooth so far?

A: The challenge has always been in the belief system. I am not going to force a belief on anyone, I am just here to show by giving evidence that life goes on and there is another way to look at death and living.

Q: As you know, we're big fans of Medium Bonnie Page/Messages from Heaven. For our readers who might not be as familiar, what can you tell them about the brand?

A: I specialize in private readings, gallery events, and teaching others to connect with the spirit world. Guidance and Protection are always there for you and reaching beyond what you can see in the physical world. As a Reiki Master and healer, my work is always about the healing aspect of mediumship.

Q: What matters most to you? Why?

A: What matters to me most is the reason why I do this work. My story is within all three of my books as to how I became a full-time professional medium. I am working for God, offering healing and light to others along the way. Sometimes, one person at a time, with the hope of reaching many and leaving a footpath of hope and inspiration.
