                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. It's 100 degrees on a late Tuesday in June, but 79-year-old Elisabeth — she asked that her surname not be used to protect her privacy — is in line at St. Patrick's Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, waiting to get a bag of groceries. “I don't have enough comida (food),” she tells Truthout in a mix of English and Spanish. “You know, leche (milk), pan (bread), pollo (chicken), cereal —everything es muy caro (very expensive).” Like Elisabeth, 74-year-old Lin — she, too, asked not to disclose her surname — has trouble making ends meet, but she goes to a senior center in her New York City neighborhood almost every weekday for a meal. The center, she says, asks for a voluntary contribution of $2 per meal. Lin says that the combination of camaraderie and affordability will keep her coming back to the center for as long as she's physically able. “So many of us seniors live doubled-up or in substandard housing. We deserve better, but the government, and Donald Trump in particular, treat us like garbage.” According to Feeding America, a national network of food banks and pantries, food insecurity is nothing new, and even before Trump's Big Bad Bill championed slashing social welfare spending, 6.9 million people over the age of 65 faced hunger in the U.S. Part of the reason is poverty, but isolation, the inability to shop or cook, trouble chewing and swallowing, cognitive decline, depression, a diminished sense of smell and/or taste, and the side effects of medication can also contribute to malnutrition in American seniors. These factors, in concert with economic precarity, make it difficult for many elders to remain healthy and well-nourished. Millions, however, are ineligible for retirement benefits and instead rely on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a benefit provided to disabled people who did not work for the required 40 quarters needed to collect Social Security. More than 2 million adults over 65 receive SSI, with 39 percent living below the poverty line. “Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP don't just harm individuals. A July 2024 report issued by the National Institute on Aging, a department of the National Institutes of Health, noted that over the past two decades, “food insecurity among families that include adults over the age of 60 had almost doubled, affecting nearly 25 percent of such families.” The report further acknowledged that hunger and lack of access to nutritious food has had a disproportionate impact on Black, Brown and Indigenous households. Joel Berg, CEO of Hunger Free America, told Truthout that since Trump took office in January, $1.5 billion has been cut in assistance to food banks and pantries, including a $130 million administrative cut to the 43-year-old Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency food and shelter program. “Seniors used to be the third rail of American politics, but that rule is no longer sacrosanct. I think that Congressmembers who support these cuts are following their leader off a cliff. Markell Lewis Miller has seen the impact of these cuts directly. “In March of this year, there was an administrative action, and with no warning whatsoever, we experienced a cut, by half, of what we used to get through the [emergency food assistance] program. This amounts to 15 percent of the food we give out annually. Replacing lost items from the Department of Agriculture, she says, will require them to spend an additional $2.5 million, money that will have to be raised through philanthropic and individual donations. “Cuts to Medicaid and SNAP don't just harm individuals. “Grocery stores will see their sales plummet and some will close; people will also see their health decline if they lose access to fresh, affordable, and nutritious food, which can lead to malnutrition.” The cascading impact, she adds, can lead to calcium and vitamin deficiencies, as well as health issues such as depression, cognitive disorders, slower wound healing, loss of muscle mass, and frailty syndrome. “Every dollar matters to people on fixed incomes,” she says. What's more, Miller and her colleagues worry that the imposition of work requirements on older SNAP recipients will further restrict access to healthy meals. “Failure to secure work will mean that people can only receive SNAP for three months in a three-year period,” she told Truthout. People who live in areas, particularly rural areas, where few jobs exist, or who are grandparents doing unpaid (but essential) child care, will not be exempted. Raising the threshold from age 54, which it has been since 1996, does not take these realities into account.” “Right now, 12,000 people a day are turning 65, and we have not created the infrastructure to support them.” Other changes to SNAP will also have a deleterious impact, Plato-Nino says. They also want to exclude the cost of internet service when calculating SNAP eligibility. People with kids in school and folks with disabilities will be particularly harmed by getting rid of this deduction since they have to have the internet in their homes to function.” “For seniors who worked incredibly hard their whole lives, finding a part-time job is often impossible, and if they fail, they'll lose their access to food. We know time limits on eligibility do not increase employment. But they do keep people off the program and scrambling to eat.” Meals on Wheels, a national food delivery service (and congregate meal provider in some locales) has filled nutritional gaps for more than 70 years. “About 90 percent of our programs get federal money, and many get half or more of their funding from federal social service block grants, community development block grants, or other federal funding streams, some of which are now threatened,” he says. We don't know if these specialized programs will survive.” All told, he says, Meals on Wheels provides food to about 2.2 million older adults annually. “There are many older adults we're not reaching,” Protas says. To tell an adult who is unable to leave their home that they have to wait is painful, he adds, “but it's even worse when an opening comes up and we discover that the person died while waiting.” In addition to providing food, Protas reports that Meals on Wheels provides a secondary function: assessing the meal recipient's living situation and providing a few minutes of conversation and social engagement each day. “Right now, 12,000 people a day are turning 65, and we have not created the infrastructure to support them,” he says. Money from the federal government has always helped unlock philanthropic dollars, but the truth is that less than 1 percent of foundation grants go to seniors. People gravitate to causes benefiting kids and animals; older adults get second-tier consideration. Even more concerning, one of the fastest-growing unhoused populations is older people, folks who did what they could to earn a living and who still end up on the streets with nothing.” But seniors, disabled adults, and their advocates are fighting back. Led by the Leadership Council of Aging Organizations and the Coalition on Human Needs, they are making their opposition to SNAP cuts, Medicaid cuts, and Medicare cuts loud and clear, as well as urging for support for national programs like Meals on Wheels and local food banks like Food Gatherers. In addition, an unprecedented coalition of state attorneys general, led by Washington, D.C.'s  Karl A. Racine and New York's Letitia James, have sued the administration to stop the SNAP cuts from taking effect. “Many older Americans rely on Medicaid and if they slash it, people will have less money to pay for food and medicine,” Joel Berg of Hunger Free America predicts. The plant closes and, because of age discrimination, you can't find another job. You will lose your SNAP benefits after three months and won't be eligible again for three years unless you find a 20-hour-a-week job. Seniors are being attacked from land, sea, and air, and these cuts are happening on top of significant cuts that have been imposed over the last few years. The nonprofit sector is a bit shell-shocked, but people are pushing back and coalescing with farmers and the food industry to pressure lawmakers.” Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's firing of 1,300 DOE workers is bad news for all student loan recipients and K-12 students alike. Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Now, while litigation plays out in the courts, the administration is free to move forward with its campaign promise to shut down the DOE — a cause conservatives have championed for more than four decades. The interview below has been lightly edited for clarity and concision. The DOE now stands to be roughly half the size it was in 2024, thanks to a combination of layoffs and resignations. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. Sara Partridge: One area that the workforce reductions were largely concentrated in is the Office of Federal Student Aid, which administers grant, work study, and student loan programs for 9.9 million students each year. Student loan borrowers will in all likelihood face a reduced quality of service and more issues with student loan repayment in the coming months and years as a result of these changes. Can you talk a little more about the issues that current and future student loan borrowers will face? One recent analysis found that as of April, 5.8 million or 31 percent of borrowers with a payment due are in late stage delinquency, or more than 90 days past due on payments. Once payments are 270 days late, the borrower enters default and collections may begin. Already, borrowers who are past due on their payments have seen an average credit score decrease of 60 points, which will stay on their credit report for 7 years and result in less access to credit and higher interest rates. When in default, a borrower's wages, tax returns, and Social Security checks may be garnished. Currently, there is a backlog of at least 1.5 million applications for income-driven repayment plans, which will likely increase as more borrowers seek to switch out of the Saving on Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, due to the fact that the administration is restarting interest accrual for those who are currently in an administrative forbearance as a result of ongoing litigation against the SAVE plan. When student loan borrowers have issues or errors with monthly payments, income-driven repayment plans, Public Service Loan Forgiveness, delays for relief under borrower defense or closed school discharge, or any other number of issues that their servicer fails to resolve, they can contact the Ombudsman Office at the Department of Education. I expect that these workforce reductions will make it even more challenging for borrowers to receive help or relief when they confront errors, challenges, or complex situations relating to their student loans. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) also just phased out a number of federal student loan repayment plans. Sara Partridge: The Department has both ongoing and new duties to carry out that will require significant expertise, resources, and staff that may no longer be available. The Office of Federal Student Aid will have the task of implementing a range of new programs as a result of the OBBBA, including introducing new loan limits for graduate students and parent borrowers, moving borrowers into new repayment plans, and expanding Pell Grant eligibility to short-term workforce programs. Student loan borrowers will see a range of changes starting in July 2026, including higher monthly payments under the new OBBBA plans. The graduate and professional borrowing limits will likely disproportionately impact students pursuing medicine, dentistry, and other health care fields, forcing many to rely on more risky private student loans. Is there anything students should do now to prepare for changes in student aid administration? Sara Partridge: If borrowers are past due on their student loan payments, they should contact their servicer to work with them to prevent going into default. If they are a Parent PLUS borrower, they may want to consider consolidating their loans before July 2026 to access the amended income-based repayment plan (although this can, in some cases, reset progress toward cancellation, so borrowers should speak with their servicer about this choice). If borrowers are facing ongoing challenges with their student loans that they cannot get resolution for with their servicer or the Department of Education, student loan borrowers can open cases with their congressional representatives, which will serve the dual purposes of getting them assistance while also making Congress aware of the myriad challenges borrowers are facing right now, and encourage them to hold the administration accountable for delivering on its statutory duties. Jon Valant: It looks like the staffing cuts are having negative impacts already. For example, the cuts were heavily concentrated in the Institute of Education Sciences, which has been slashed to the point where we're losing access to data that we rely on to evaluate needs and progress. That being said, I think the most significant, direct impacts might actually come from the funding cuts — or the Trump administration's attempts to withhold billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds — that are causing immediate headaches and sacrifices from schools. And now, just a month or two before the school year starts, school and district leaders are scrambling to figure out what cuts they might have to make to programs and staff. Another agency disproportionately targeted by layoffs is the Office for Civil Rights. How do you think the DOE's closing will impact equity and civil rights in schools? Maybe even more than that, though, I'm concerned with the way that this administration is redefining, twisting, and narrowing the Department's priorities with respect to civil rights. Now, the focus seems to be on weaponizing civil rights enforcement to threaten school districts and universities that don't align with its positions on culture-war issues like LGBTQ+ rights. A recent court filing showed that under the Trump administration, the Office for Civil Rights has dismissed civil rights complaints at a rapid-fire pace. Students of all backgrounds, but in particular those with disabilities, may see their rights to equal educational opportunity diminished under this administration, and evidence already suggests that layoffs of civil rights investigators are taking their toll. Jon, you wrote in this Brookings piece that there's a “dangerous gap between education's problems and proposed ‘solutions. '” You note chronic absenteeism and large gaps in student test scores. Can you explain how dismantling the DOE fails to respond to the key problems you're seeing in education — and how it could make these issues worse for students? We've seen years-long declines in academic performance — that started before COVID — especially among the country's lowest-scoring students. We have alarming data on student mental health and have to grapple with challenges related to cell phone use, social media, and other issues that originate outside of classrooms. We have a workforce that's rapidly changing with school systems that aren't equipped to keep up with those changes. This is an era of genuine challenges for U.S. students and schools, and yet many of our leaders seem more focused on winning culture-war battles than actually addressing those challenges. What are some specific policies that you think would more adequately address these issues? Jon Valant: I think what defines great schools, more than anything, is outstanding teachers and instruction. We can use policy more strategically to attract, retain, and develop excellent teachers, especially in schools that most need additional support. I also think we have a lot of work to do in evaluating the quality of curricular materials, encouraging schools and districts to adopt high-quality curricula, and training teachers in those curricula. And, really, I'd like to see policymakers think more seriously about schools' role in sustaining a healthy democracy and cohesive society. School isn't only about preparing students for college and the workforce. Sara Partridge: The nearly $900 million in cuts to federal education research undertaken by the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) are a critical blow to researchers' and policymakers' understanding of education outcomes, trends, and issues. In postsecondary education, these contracts help us understand how student loan dollars are distributed and the outcomes of students who borrow for college. Is it actually feasible for states to take over the DOE's functions? The federal government isn't involved in selecting curriculum or deciding what content students should learn. It doesn't hire teachers and school leaders or even decide what standards should be used for hiring teachers and school leaders. Those responsibilities fall to more local levels of government. Sara Partridge: The federal government conducts research and oversight, ensures students' civil rights are protected, distributes funding to states and schools, administers postsecondary student financial aid, and runs grant programs that help fill gaps or foster innovation. States, on the other hand, are primarily responsible for academic standards, curriculum, and graduation requirements; teacher certification; and a majority of public school funding. Any major changes to these responsibilities would require an act of Congress. Historically, the federal government has played an essential role in prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal opportunity for all students. Certain federal standards and guardrails also ensure that taxpayer dollars are well spent on quality education. Yet, at such a pivotal moment, donations to Truthout have been declining.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia plans to spend around $1.1 trillion on rearmament over the next 11 years in preparation for a potential large-scale war, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said on July 22. Russia is mobilizing all sectors of society to support its military buildup, he added. "Russia seeks to disrupt the current security and economic order," he added. Budanov also warned that Russia is conducting hybrid operations abroad, including cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns, aimed at undermining democracies. His comments follow a growing number of warnings from Western intelligence services about Russia's long-term military buildup. Last year, German intelligence chief Bruno Kahl said that Moscow will have the military capabilities to attack NATO by 2030. Russia's defense spending has already overtaken that of all European countries combined. In 2024, its military budget surged by 42% to $462 billion, surpassing Europe's collective defense expenditure of $457 billion, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on April 30 that Russia is prepared to scale up its war effort to levels last seen in World War II, claiming "millions" of civilians are supporting the military by donating supplies and equipment. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi estimated in April that Russia could call up to 5 million trained reservists, with a broader mobilization potential of 20 million. Tim Zadorozhnyy is a news editor at The Kyiv Independent. Tim began his career at a local television channel in Odesa. After moving to Warsaw, he joined the Belarusian opposition media outlet NEXTA, starting as a news anchor and later advancing to the position of managing editor. Moscow has launched its most ambitious weapons program since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine's military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov said. "I think they need to be called out for their subsidizing this killing that is happening on the battlefields in Ukraine," U.S. The announcement comes as pro-Western President Maia Sandu, who narrowly secured reelection last year, seeks to preserve her parliamentary majority and advance Moldova's bid for EU accession. An SBU officer is suspected of demanding a $300,000 bribe from a person under investigation for allegedly organizing illegal border crossings for military-age men during wartime, NABU said. Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council has imposed a moratorium on business inspections by state authorities, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on July 21, calling the move essential for the country's economic security. The target in Samara was the Novokuybyshevsk Petrochemical Company, a major gas-processing and petrochemical facility that supplies raw materials used in the production of explosives, said Andrii Kovalenko, an official at Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council. At least 26 drones were shot down, and seven more were lost or suppressed by electronic warfare systems, according to the statement.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt answers reporters' questions outside the White House on Tuesday in Washington. A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday declined to lift restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump's administration on White House access by Associated Press journalists after the news organization declined to refer to the body of water long called the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America as he prefers. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Trump in January signed an executive order officially directing federal agencies to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. The AP stylebook states that the Gulf of Mexico has carried that name for more than 400 years. AP said that as a global news agency, it will refer to the body of water by its long-standing name while acknowledging the new name Trump has chosen. Reuters and the AP both issued statements denouncing the access restrictions, which put wire services in a larger rotation with about 30 other newspaper and print outlets. Other media customers, including local news outlets with no presence in Washington, rely on real-time reports by the wire services of presidential statements, as do global financial markets. Trump frequently grants interviews on the spot to journalists who call his personal cell The AP won a key order in the trial court when U.S. District Judge Treevor McFadden, who was appointed by Trump during his first term, decided that if the White House opens its doors to some journalists, it cannot exclude others based on their viewpoints, citing the First Amendment. The two judges in the majority, Neomi Rao and Gregory Katsas, were appointed by Trump during his first term in office. The dissenting judge, Cornelia Pillard, is an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Justice Maria Carroccia will issue her decision on Thursday morning in London, Ont., more than seven years after the alleged sexual assault was first reported to police Five former members of Canada's 2018 world junior hockey team are awaiting the verdict in their high-profile sexual assault trial. She is scheduled to deliver her verdict on Thursday in London, Ont. Michael McLeod, Dillon Dubé, Carter Hart, Cal Foote and Alex Formenton have been charged with sexually assaulting a woman, known publicly as E.M., in a hotel room after a Hockey Canada gala in London, Ont., on June 18, 2018. In E.M.'s interviews with London police detective Stephen Newton, she described how she met Mr. McLeod in a local bar called Jack's and went with him to his hotel room at the Delta Armouries. She said they had consensual sex, but that she was then forced to engage in sex acts with a group of teammates he had invited in without her knowledge as several others in the room watched. Court filing reveals new details about alleged Hockey Canada group sexual assault He believed there was not enough evidence to lay charges. The case only became public knowledge in May, 2022, after TSN reported that Hockey Canada had settled a $3.55-million lawsuit brought by E.M. against the organization, as well as the Canadian Hockey League and eight unnamed players. Timeline: Key events in the Hockey Canada case before it went to trial Hockey Canada and the NHL have also conducted their own independent probes, but the results of those have not been made public.

From 2022: Woman at centre of Hockey Canada scandal breaks silence Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham (left) and Justice Maria Carroccia are pictured in a courtroom sketch during proceedings on May 29.Court illustration by Alexandra Newbould/The Canadian Press Justice Maria Carroccia worked for decades as a leading criminal-defence lawyer in Windsor, Ont., before she was appointed as a judge to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in 2020. In her five years as a judge, Justice Carroccia has overseen high-profile and complex cases, from murder to sexual assault trials. Consent must be given voluntarily and continuously for each sexual act under Canadian law. Opinion: Hockey Canada trial judge faces tough call on the invisible question of consent E.M. testified that after consensual sex with McLeod, she felt “shocked” when other men started showing up to the room. But over seven days of gruelling cross-examination by the five players' lawyers, defence counsel asserted to E.M. that she was the instigator of the sexual activity looking for a “wild night” and pressed her over inconsistencies between her court testimony and statements she had given to police, the amount of alcohol she consumed and her actions inside the hotel room. Court also saw several messages, including one sent around 2 a.m. on the night of the alleged assault from Mr. McLeod's cellphone to a 19-person team group chat: “Who wants to be in 3 way quick. Several witnesses testified during the proceedings, including detectives in both London police probes and four former team members who are not accused of wrongdoing and were present during parts of the night in question: Brett Howden, Tyler Steenbergen, Taylor Raddysh and Boris Katchouk. Howden's recollections became the subject of fraught legal arguments after Crown prosecutors accused him of feigning memory loss on the stand. However, their arguments to enter some of his text messages about that night into evidence were unsuccessful. But Crown prosecutors pressed Hart on why McLeod felt the need to record a consent video and aimed to illustrate that Hart did not ensure E.M. was voluntarily and continuously consenting to each sexual act, as required by law. Just days after the trial began in late April, Hilary Dudding, one of the lawyers representing accused player Alex Formenton, and a member of the first jury bumped into each other at a local food market. Who is Daniel Brown, defence lawyer in the Hockey Canada sex-assault trial? A note handed to Justice Carroccia by juror 11 alleged: “Multiple jury members feel we are being judged and made fun of by lawyers Brown and Hilary Dudding.” In response, Justice Carroccia said she had no choice but to dismiss the jury again. After two juries were dismissed, Crown lawyers reluctantly agreed to proceed before a judge alone rather than starting the trial anew, which would have required E.M. to testify and be cross-examined by all five defence teams all over again. London police reopened their 2018 sexual assault investigation in July, 2022, after determining there were additional investigative avenues to pursue. It is not clear why the case wasn't brought to its attention. Court filing reveals new details about alleged Hockey Canada group sexual assault The trial of five former members of Canada's 2018 world junior hockey team, who are accused of sexually assaulting a woman in a London, Ont., hotel room in 2018, has raised questions about how news organizations cover such cases. Robyn Doolittle answers reader questions with Standards Editor Sandra E. Martin. Justice Maria Carroccia is scheduled to deliver her verdict after 10 a.m. on Thursday in London, Ont. Under Canadian law, a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court. Four of the five players had been playing in the NHL prior to their arrests in 2024, though all took leaves from their teams after the charges were laid and some of their contracts have since expired. But it has never been clear if the players would be permitted to return, even if a team was willing to sign them. NHL commissioner Gary Bettman refused to say if the league would allow it in early June. What happens if the players are found guilty and convicted? If any of the players are found guilty of sexual assault, they could face up to 10 years in prison under Canada's Criminal Code. Justice Carroccia would determine the actual length of any sentences and deliver her decision at a later date. Any players found guilty and convicted would also almost certainly appeal the judge's decision, which could delay sentencing or serving any time behind bars while a potential appeal is heard by a higher court. Alex Formenton passes demonstrators as he arrives at the courthouse in London, Ont. During parliamentary hearings in Ottawa in 2022, former Hockey Canada CEO Bob Nicholson said he regretted that there was not more focus on “the culture of silence that appears to persist to this day.” Former Hockey Canada CEO Scott Smith revealed during the hearings that Hockey Canada has dealt with an average of one to two sexual assault cases a year for the past six years. A Globe and Mail investigation in July, 2022, found that Hockey Canada kept a special multimillion-dollar fund built up by registration fees of players across the country, that it uses to pay out settlements in cases of alleged sexual assault without its insurance company, and with minimal outside scrutiny. In the wake of Hockey Canada's response to the sexual assault allegations in 2022, Tim Hortons suspended its World Juniors sponsorship, and Canadian Tire and Telus withdrew their support. Some major sponsors reinstated their partnerships with Hockey Canada in 2023, ahead of the world junior championship tournament. Opinion: The important moral question Hockey Canada sponsors now face The verdict could set a new legal precedent on the question of what constitutes voluntary consent, particularly in cases of power imbalance. Legal experts and sexual violence advocates have also said the case's handling and trial have highlighted failures of the legal system to address sexual-assault accusations, and some say they fear a not guilty verdict may have a chilling effect and prevent others from bringing forward allegations of sexual assault. Opinion: To really change the culture around sexual violence, consent can't be taught as a technicality Demonstrators raising awareness for sexual assault survivors protest outside the London courthouse during the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial.Geoff Robins/The Canadian Press ‘Honestly, it's gotten a lot worse': Teen girls on the Hockey Canada trial and life after #MeToo The trial has also reignited broader conversations around consent, misogyny and sexual violence in hockey, and how insular cultures within professional sports organizations allow abuse to endure in secrecy. As the trial has played out in the media, front-line staff at women's shelters and crisis centres have seen more victims coming forward to formally report or seek support. At the London Abused Women's Centre, some people have walked in with donations in E.M.'s name, while others have sent money from as far as Alberta.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Donald Trump said he is being subjected to a “witch hunt” over his government's refusal to release the Epstein files. Mr Trump faced his first grilling by the media since a lewd birthday letter he allegedly sent to Jeffrey Epstein was published by the Wall Street Journal. The US president claimed the alleged letter, which is said to have included a drawing of a naked woman, is “fake”. On Tuesday, he described the WSJ as a “terrible paper” and said that he is suing them “for a lot of money”. It came after the Department of Justice announced that administration officials had asked to meet Ghislaine Maxwell to discuss the Epstein case. In a post shared by Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, Mr Blanche said: “President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence. “Therefore, at the direction of Attorney General Bondi, I have communicated with counsel for Ms Maxwell to determine whether she would be willing to speak with prosecutors from the Department. I anticipate meeting with Ms Maxwell in the coming days.” Mr Trump claimed he was unaware of the plans to interview Maxwell. He said: “Yeah, I don't know about it, but I think it's something that would be... sounds appropriate to do.” Mr Trump continued: “I don't really follow that too much.” “I can confirm that we are in discussions with the government and that Ghislaine will always testify truthfully,” David Oscar Markus said. Mr Trump's handling of the information related to the case has angered even some of his most loyal supporters. Conspiracy theorists, including many Trump voters, believe that Epstein was killed to prevent supposed information about high-profile “clients” involved with the financier from being made public. Mr Blanche said that no previous administration had made contact with Maxwell on behalf of the DofJ. She knows everything,” he told Fox News on Monday. He suggested she should be given legal immunity in exchange for talking freely about the case before Congress. “My belief is we need the administration to have the space to do what it is doing, and if further congressional action is necessary or appropriate, then we'll look at that,” Mr Johnson said. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he would shut the House down early for August recess, closing the session after a vote on Wednesday. House Republicans offered a resolution calling for the so-called Epstein files to be made public, although the resolution carries no legal weight. On Friday, Mr Trump ordered the release of grand jury transcripts from Epstein's 2019 sex trafficking case after The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) published a story alleging Mr Trump had written a “bawdy” letter to Epstein for his birthday in 2003. The president denied he wrote the letter, which is said to have included a drawing of a naked woman, and called it “fake”. The potential meeting has raised questions over whether Maxwell will try to leverage information about the case for a reduced prison sentence. An appeal put forward by her lawyers was rejected last year. Maxwell's appeal focused largely on a 2007 non-prosecution agreement made between Epstein and federal prosecutors in southern Florida, which she said barred her from being prosecuted in Manhattan 13 years later. It comes as Republicans moved to force Maxwell to testify in front of the House about the Epstein case. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee advanced a motion filed by Tim Burchett, a Tennessee representative, seeking approval to subpoena Maxwell. Both lawmakers told Axios they had not consulted Mr Trump before introducing the motion to compel the convicted sex offender to testify. “The Committee will seek to subpoena Ms Maxwell as expeditiously as possible,” a committee aide said in a statement to Politico, adding: “Since Ms Maxwell is in federal prison, the Committee will work with the Department of Justice and Bureau of Prisons to identify a date when [the] Committee can depose her.” “This deposition will help the American people understand how Jeffrey Epstein was able to carry out his evil actions for so long without being brought to justice,” Mr Burchett said in a statement. Mr Trump's relationship with Maxwell stretches back decades. He was pictured with Maxwell and her paedophile financier boyfriend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2000. In 2020, while Maxwell was awaiting trial on federal sex crimes for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking crimes, Mr Trump said he wished her “well”. Asked whether he expected her to go public with the names of the men who have been accused in lawsuits of taking part in Epstein's sex-trafficking crimes, Mr Trump said: “I don't know... I haven't really been following it too much. But I wish her well, whatever it is,” Mr Trump added. In an interview with Axios that year, Mr Trump doubled down on his well wishes for Maxwell. I'm not looking bad for anybody,” Mr Trump said, adding: “Her boyfriend died.</p>

MOSCOW, July 22. /TASS/. Russian President Vladimir Putin has extended his condolences to the family of Irina Podnosova, the chair of the Russian Supreme Court, who died on Tuesday at the age of 71.

"I knew her for decades as a person of high principles and a professional of the highest class. She always worked effectively and efficiently and was an example of dedication and responsibility in her chosen line of work. As chairperson of the Russian Supreme Court, she firmly and consistently upheld the rule of law, and served the motherland and our people with integrity," Putin said in a telegram of condolences that was posted on the Kremlin website.

The president emphasized that her memory will forever stay in the hearts of her family, friends, and colleagues.

Podnosova was appointed chairperson of the Russian Supreme Court on April 17, 2024 after the death of her predecessor, Vyacheslav Lebedev. She was the first woman ever to hold the office.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The department said in a statement that Ice never arrested or deported Luis Leon to Guatemala, and that the reports were a ‘hoax' On 18 July, the Morning Call newspaper of Allentown, Pennsylvania, reported that the family of the man, Luis Leon, said he was handcuffed after showing up at to immigration office on 20 June to report a lost green card. The Guatemalan government also denied that Leon had been deported. The AP added that Guatemala agreed in February to receive people deported from the US who are from other Central American countries, but that its agreement does not extend to Chileans. On Monday, Morning Call published a new story reflecting DHS and Guatemala's claims, and noting that it “repeatedly requested information from Ice during its reporting; an Ice spokesperson previously refused to confirm details, including whether or not Leon was even at the Philadelphia office, and said Monday that Ice investigators were not able to contact the family”. It added that Leon's granddaughter, Nataly, who refused to provide her last name, said she had visited Leon in a hospital in Guatemala City, where she claimed he was being treated for pneumonia. But the outlet also reported that a Chilean journalist, Jose Del Pino, said a doctor at the hospital in question had no record of him. Del Pino also reportedly provided a copy of an alleged death certificate to the Morning Call for a man with the same name and date of birth who died in Santiago, Chile, in 2019. It added that Del Pino said Chilean citizens all have national identification numbers, and none matches another person with that name and birthday. Late on Sunday her family issued a statement saying they would no longer speak to media and asked for privacy, and Leon's granddaughter did not respond to the Morning Call's further requests for comment on Monday. An attorney at Campos Firm said multiple immigration attorneys had tried to contact the family asking to represent them, but could not reach them.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Hundreds of students gathered outside the smoldering remains of a school in the Bangladeshi capital on Tuesday to demand answers after a military jet slammed into the campus, killing dozens of children. An ordinary school day turned into terror on Monday when a Bangladesh Air Force jet suffered a mid-air mechanical fault and ploughed into the Milestone School and College in Dhaka, engulfing the two-story building in flames and smoke. Young students were finishing up afternoon classes and parents had gathered outside the gates to greet their children when the aircraft hit, killing at least 31 people - including 25 children - in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory. Some 165 others were left injured, according to the armed forces public relations directorate (ISPR), many with severe burns. As police and air force personnel worked at the scene to retrieve parts of the crashed plane on Tuesday, the gathered crowd began shouting at officials, with some students telling CNN they believe the death toll may be higher than officially released. It added that the identities of those killed are still being verified. “We saw scattered parts of different bodies, of children, guardians,” Mohammad Imran Hussein, a lecturer in the school's English department, told CNN. “I cannot express everything in words,” he said, emotionally distressed and struggling to speak. And I looked around to see what happened, I saw the tail of the plane. I saw a huge flame of fire,” he said. Milestone College has a kindergarten, an elementary school and a high school on its campus. “It's like this building was turned into a death trap. “I saw a lot of children, I tried to save their lives,” he told CNN at the site. The FT-7 jet was on a routine training mission when it crashed soon after take off at around 1:18 p.m. local time on Monday (3:18 a.m. EST) after a mechanical fault, according to BSS News, citing the country's armed forces. The plane's pilot, who has been named as Flight Lieutenant Towkir Islam, made “every effort to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas toward a more sparsely inhabited location,” the military said. The F-7  BGI is the final and most advanced variant in China's Chengdu J-7/F-7 aircraft family, according to Jane's Information Group. Reuters reported that Bangladesh signed a contract for 16 aircraft in 2011 and deliveries were completed by 2013. The hospitals quickly became overwhelmed with frantic relatives desperate for news of their loved ones. Bangladesh's interim government leader Muhammad Yunus said on Monday that, “I have no words. I don't know how to begin.” But we had to suddenly accept this unbelievable reality,” Yunus said in a video message. Yunus said the training aircraft “crashed and fell upon these innocent children” and many were “burned to death in the fire.” “What answer can we give to their parents? What can we possibly say to them? We can't even answer ourselves,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pokrovsk, situated around 67 kilometers (41 miles) northwest of Russian-occupied Donetsk, has emerged as one of the fiercest hotspots in the Kremlin's ongoing offensive in eastern Ukraine. Speaking to the Kyiv Independent on condition of anonymity, a member of a Ukrainian drone team working out of Pokrovsk reported that Russian soldiers had made it into the city limits, though it wasn't clear if they had managed to dig in. According to DeepState, Russian forces managed to penetrate the city from the direction of Zvirove a few days earlier after exploiting weakened Ukrainian infantry positions and inaccurate situational reporting. "Russian units attempted to entrench themselves and gain control over Defenders of Ukraine street," DeepState said. "Some of them have been killed, others are still being hunted. The search and destruction of these groups is still ongoing." The group noted that Ukrainian forces suffered casualties in the ongoing cleanup operation, with incidents of friendly fire reported due to a lack of clear intelligence on the Russian troops' movements and locations. DeepState warned that reports on such infiltration attempts should be approached with caution and confirmed data. He warned that Russian troops are attempting to sever logistics routes from the northern city of Dobropillia and noted that Russian forces had massed over 110,000 troops in the area by early summer. Pokrovsk remains a strategic target for Russia as it seeks to advance further into Donetsk Oblast and potentially threaten neighboring Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The Kyiv Independent reached out to Ukraine's military for additional comment. Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments.</p>

An angry chorus of senior figures, among them the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, and a senior Catholic cleric, expressed on Tuesday a growing sense of global horror over Israel's actions. “I spoke again with [the Israeli foreign minister] Gideon Saar to recall our understanding on aid flow and made clear that IDF [Israel Defense Forces] must stop killing people at distribution points,” the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, wrote on X. “The killing of civilians seeking aid in Gaza is indefensible.” She said “all options were on the table” if Israel does not deliver on aid pledges, but did not say what those options included. According to UN officials on Tuesday, more than 1,000 desperate Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since the end of May trying to reach food distributions run by the controversial US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) amid widening conditions of starvation in the Palestinian territory. The comments came as Israeli forces attacked warehousing and staff accommodation in Deir al-Balah – Gaza's main aid hub – belonging to the World Health Organization. Guterres' comments came hours after a hard-hitting joint statement on Monday by 27 western countries including the UK, France, Australia and Canada harshly criticising Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid and calling for an immediate end to the war. Guterres said he “deplored the growing reports of children and adults suffering from malnutrition” as health officials in Gaza reported a further 33 deaths, including 12 children, in the past 48 hours. “But when you see innocent children holding out their hand for food, and you see them shot and killed in the way that we have seen in the last few days, of course Britain must call it out.” Thameen Al-Kheetan, a UN human rights office spokesperson, said: “Over 1,000 Palestinians have now been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food in Gaza since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operating. Philippe Lazzarini said Unrwa's own staff, as well as doctors and humanitarian workers, were fainting on duty owing to hunger and exhaustion as Israel limited access to life-saving humanitarian aid, and that many were surviving on a single small meal a day. “Caretakers, including Unrwa colleagues in Gaza, are also in need of care now – doctors, nurses, journalists, humanitarians, among them Unrwa staff, are hungry. Many are now fainting due to hunger and exhaustion while performing their duties,” he said in a statement at a media briefing in Geneva. The UN World Food Programme on Monday said its assessments showed a quarter of the population of Gaza was facing “famine-like” conditions and almost 100,000 women and children were suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Deir al-Balah is the only city in the Gaza Strip that has not experienced major ground operations or suffered widespread devastation in 21 months of war, leading to speculation that the Hamas militant group holds large numbers of hostages there.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stephen Colbert gained a little help from his friends and late-night rivals on Monday, his first night back on “The Late Show” since announcing that CBS is ending the legendary show. Are big TV networks going to keep supporting political satire and free speech at a time when President Trump's campaign of retribution is rattling corporate America? “Some people see this show going away as a sign of something truly dire,” Colbert acknowledged Monday night. “And while I am a big fan of me, I don't necessarily agree with that statement,” he said. He also made some jokes about CBS saying the show was ending for “purely financial” reasons. Through humor, he raised an eyebrow at news reports about the show becoming unprofitable, though he didn't directly dispute that. “Folks, I'm going to go ahead and say it: Cancel culture has gone too far,” he quipped. After the “Coldplay cam” spoof, which was led by Lin-Manuel Miranda and “Weird Al” Yankovic, Colbert pretended that CBS had just cancelled the song because it lost money. Fallon and his NBC colleague Seth Meyers were seated together. Bravo late-night host Andy Cohen sat with his best friend, CNN's Anderson Cooper. Beyond the partisan arguments about whether anti-Trump comics are funny is a broader fear about institutions caving to Trump and removing room for dissent. There is a long history of American TV networks giving comics space to poke politicians and even network executives in the eye, despite the potential ramifications. Fans feel that tradition is under threat now. Stewart spoke out about it from his own television perch, “The Daily Show,” on Monday night. Both shows are owned by the same company, Paramount Global, which has been in a perilous political position in recent months. Colbert catapulted to fame on Stewart's show twenty years ago; the two men have remained friends ever since; and Stewart is now an executive producer of Colbert's “Late Show,” so he has some visibility into the situation. “If you're trying to figure out why Stephen's show is ending, I don't think the answer can be found in some smoking gun email or phone call from Trump to CBS executives, or in CBS's QuickBooks spreadsheets on the financial health of late night,” Stewart said on-air. “I think the answer in the fear and pre-compliance that is gripping all of America's institutions at this very moment — institutions that have chosen not to fight the vengeful and vindictive actions of our pubic hair-doodling commander in chief,” he said. Stewart, whose “Daily Show” contract expires at the end of this year, added, “This is not the moment to give in. Top executives at CBS said it was an “agonizing” decision but one that was unrelated to “other matters happening at Paramount.” In other words, the merger. Paramount has been attempting to merge with Skydance Media, which means billions of dollars and some big egos are on the line. Earlier this month, while Colbert and “The Late Show” were on a mid-summer break, Paramount settled Trump's legally dubious lawsuit against CBS News by agreeing to pay $16 million toward his future presidential library. Colbert referred to the settlement again on Monday night's show. He cited the media leaks indicating that the “Late Show” was losing “between $40 million and $50 million a year.” “I could see us losing $24 million, but where would Paramount have possibly spent the other $16 million… oh, yeah.” Meantime, the founding host of “The Late Show,” David Letterman, weighed in on the franchise's retirement on Monday by publishing to his YouTube channel a 20-minute highlight reel of his past jokes about CBS. The video caption read: “You can't spell CBS without BS.” US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>TUNIS, July 22. The tense situation in the Syrian province of Suwayda threatens to plunge the country into a deeper crisis, the Democratic Syria Council, linked to the Kurdish autonomous administration in the country's northeast, said. The Democratic Syria Council claims that what's happening in Suwayda is "a sign of the collapse of the country's political and institutional system," as well as of "the central government's inability to perform its duty to manage a variety of ethnic groups and ensure civil order." The council warned about "the risk of [the country] sliding into domestic conflicts of religious, regional or civic nature," which could have "devastating consequences." The council called for convening "a comprehensive nationwide conference" to chart a new political course for the country "based on transitional justice and a decentralized, pluralistic system." The body also demanded an end to all "forms of incitement to hatred and acts of provocation in the media and politics," which pose a direct threat to civil peace. On July 13, clashes between Arab tribal militias and Druze self-defense units broke out in the Suwayda province. On July 15, the Syrian army entered the region's eponymous capital and launched a mop-up operation in order to restore stability. A while later, Israel began conducting strikes on the Syrian army's military convoys, citing a desire to protect the Druze population; on July 16, Israel attacked several strategic facilities in Damascus. On July 19, Syrian's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa declared a ceasefire in Suwayda based on a settlement plan developed together with international mediators, including the US.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Bangladesh Air Force jet crashed into a college in the capital Dhaka on Monday, killing at least 27 people, mostly children, according to officials, in the country's deadliest air incident in recent memory. Related article Air India crash rekindles debate over cockpit video recorders Students were attending afternoon classes when the BAF F7 jet hit the two-story campus around 1:18 p.m. local time (3:18 a.m. EST) after a mechanical fault, according to state media BSS News, citing the country's armed forces. The plane's pilot made “every effort to divert the aircraft away from densely populated areas toward a more sparsely inhabited location,” the military said. Of those killed, 25 were children and 78 people are receiving treatment at various hospitals in Dhaka, Dr Md Sayedur Rahman, special assistant to the chief adviser for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, told reporters on Tuesday. The government announced a day of mourning and special prayers, BSS News said. “I express my deep grief and sorrow over the tragic incident of casualties caused by the crash,” the country's interim leader Muhammad Yunus wrote in a post on X. “This is a moment of profound pain for the nation. Eyewitnesses, including the parents of students, recalled huge plumes of ash rising over the school – after a banging sound rang out following the deadly crash. “When I was picking (up) my kids and went to the gate, I realized something came from behind,” Masud Tarik, also a teacher at the school, told Reuters. Others watched the chaotic aftermath unfold on TV. “I was terrified watching videos,” Rafiqa Taha, a student at the facility, told The Associated Press. Video from Bangladesh's Channel 24 showed smoke billowing as firefighters sprayed water onto the crash site while onlookers gathered around. Other rescue workers searched the rubble. Video from the hospital shows people being urgently rushed in. A family member is heard saying his injured sister is a grade four student. Another family member told Channel 24 a first batch of victims arrived at the hospital with severe burns. “We literally saw skin being torn off,” she said. A young, injured girl told Channel 24 from her hospital bed: “When we came out, we saw many students who had been charred.” Condolences came in from across the region with Pakistan and India's prime ministers expressing their solidarity with Bangladesh.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Since its founding in 1922, Foreign Affairs has been the leading forum for serious discussion of American foreign policy and global affairs. The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. They are more often subjects of circumstances beyond their control. And Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended the Biden administration's goal of establishing “stable and predictable” relations with Moscow so that it could focus on strategic competition with China. Policymakers could foresee many of the underlying forces and trends driving these agenda-shaping events. Yet for the most part, they failed to plan for the most challenging manifestations of where these forces would lead. Indicators of a coming powerful change are everywhere. There is no way of knowing with certainty the exact trajectory along which AI will develop or precisely how it will transform national security. Some ideas and initiatives that today may seem infeasible or unnecessary will seem urgent and self-evident with the benefit of hindsight. Today's frontier AI models are already increasingly capable of performing a greater number and complexity of cognitive tasks than the most skilled and best resourced humans. Since ChatGPT launched in 2022, the power of AI has increased by leaps and bounds. It is reasonable to assume that these models will become more powerful, autonomous, and diffuse in the coming years. Planners today, by contrast, have less agency and time to adapt. China is already a near peer in technology, a handful of private companies are steering development, and AI is a general-purpose technology that is spreading to nearly every part of the economy and society. In this rapidly changing environment, national security leaders should dedicate scarce planning resources to plausible but acutely challenging events. Leaders must decide how the U.S. government should respond if the company requests to be treated as a “national security asset.” This designation would grant the company public support that could allow it to secure its facilities, access sensitive or proprietary data, acquire more advanced chips, and avoid certain regulations. Alternatively, a Chinese firm may declare that it has achieved AGI before any of its U.S. rivals. National security leaders will also have to consider whether the new technological advance could provide China with a strategic advantage. If they fear AGI could give Beijing the ability to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in U.S. critical infrastructure faster than cyberdefenses can patch them, for example, they may prescribe actions—such as trying to slow or sabotage China's AI development—that could escalate the risk of geopolitical conflict. Enhancing preparedness for AGI scenarios requires better understanding of the AI ecosystem at home and abroad. A scalable, dynamic, and two-way private-public partnership is crucial for a strategic response to the current challenges that AI presents, and this will be even more the case in an AGI world. Mutual suspicion between government and the private sector could cripple any crisis response. Meanwhile, leaders will need to develop policies to share sensitive, proprietary information on developments in frontier AI with partners and allies. Without such policies, it will be challenging to build the international coalition needed to respond to an AI-induced crisis, reduce global risk, and hold countries and companies accountable for irresponsible behavior. Imagine an unprecedented AI-enabled cyberattack that wreaks havoc on financial institutions, private corporations, and government agencies and shuts down physical systems ranging from critical infrastructure to industrial robotics. In a world with increasingly advanced AI, however, the situation would be even more complex. Policymakers would have to contemplate not only the possibility that an operation of this scale might be the prelude to a military campaign but also that it might be the work of an autonomous, self-replicating AI agent. Planning for this scenario requires evaluating how today's capabilities can handle tomorrow's challenges. Governments cannot rely on present-day tools and techniques to quickly and confidently assess a threat, let alone apply relevant countermeasures. Given AI systems' proven capacity to deceive and dissemble, current systems may be unable to determine whether an AI agent is operating on its own or at the behest of an adversary. Preparing for the worst requires reevaluating “attribution agnostic” steps to harden cyberdefenses, isolate potentially compromised data centers, and prevent the incapacitation of drones or connected vehicles. Planners need to assess whether current military and continuity of operations protocols can handle threats from adversarial AI. Public distrust of the government and technology companies will make it even more difficult to reassure a worried populace in the event of artificial intelligence–fueled misinformation. Given that an autonomous AI agent is not likely to respect national boundaries, adequate preparations would involve setting up channels with partners and adversaries alike to coordinate an effective international response. In the event of a cyberattack, policymakers will have to make a real-time decision about whether to pursue targeted shutdowns of vulnerable cyber-physical systems and compromised data centers or—fearing the potential for rapid replication—impose a more comprehensive shutdown, which could prevent escalation but inhibit the functioning of the digital economy and systems on which airports and power plants rely. This loss-of-control scenario highlights the importance of clarifying legal authority and developing incident-response plans. More broadly, it reinforces the urgency of creating policies and technical strategies to address how advanced models are inclined to misbehave. At minimum, planning should involve four types of actions. First, it should establish “no regret” actions that policymakers and private-sector players can take today to respond to events from a position of strength. Second, it should create “break glass” playbooks for future emergencies that can be continually updated as new threats, opportunities, and concepts emerge. Third, it should invest in capabilities that seem crucial across multiple scenarios. Planning for the impacts of AGI on national security needs to start now. Although it is possible that AI will ultimately prove to be a “normal technology”—a technology, like the Internet or electricity, that transforms the world but whose pace of adoption has natural limits that governments and societies can control—it would be foolish to assume that preparing for major disruption would be a mistake. Planning for more difficult challenges can help leaders identify core strategic issues and build response tools that will be equally useful in less severe circumstances. It would also be unwise to presume that such planning will generate policy instincts and pathways that exacerbate risks or slow AI advances. In the nuclear era, for example, planning for potential nuclear terrorism inspired global initiatives to secure the fissile material needed to make nuclear weapons that ultimately made the world safer. It would also be dangerous to treat the possibility of AGI like any “normal scenario” in the national security world. Most scenarios are likely to occur abroad and at home simultaneously. Any response will rely heavily on the choices and decisions of actors outside government, including companies and civil society organizations, that do not have a seat in the White House Situation Room and may not prioritize national security. Preparing for a future with AGI must continuously inform today's strategic debates. In an increasingly multipolar world, emerging players see advanced AI—and how the United States and China diffuse AI technology and its underlying digital architecture—as key to their national aspirations. Early planning, tabletop exercises with allies and partners, and sustained dialogue with countries that want to hedge their diplomatic bets will ensure that strategic choices are mutually beneficial. Any AI strategy that fails to account for a multipolar world and a more distributed global technology ecosystem will fail. And any national security strategy that fails to grapple with the potentially transformative effects of AGI will become irrelevant. National security leaders don't get to choose their crises. Planning for AGI is not an indulgence in science fiction or a distraction from existing problems and opportunities.

HONG KONG/SHANGHAI, July 21 (Reuters) – China's Premier Li Qiang announced construction had begun on what will be the world's largest hydropower dam, on the eastern rim of the Tibetan Plateau, at an estimated cost of at least $170 billion, the official Xinhua news agency said. Commencement of the hydropower project, China's most ambitious since the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze, was seized by Chinese markets as proof of economic stimulus, sending stock prices and bond yields higher on Monday. Power Construction Corporation of China 601669.SS and Arcplus Group PLC 600629.SS surged by their 10% daily limit. “From an investment perspective, mature hydropower projects offer bond-like dividends,” Wang Zhuo, partner of Shanghai Zhuozhu Investment Management said, while cautioning that speculative buying into related stocks would inflate valuations. The project will drive demand for construction and building materials such as cement and civil explosives, Huatai Securities said in a note to clients. So did shares of Geokang Technologies Co Ltd 830879.BJE, which makes intelligent monitoring terminals. Cement maker Xizang Tianlu Co Ltd 600326.SS and Tibet GaoZheng Explosive Co 002827.SZ, producer of civil explosive materials, both jumped their maximum 10%. The Chinese premier described the dam as a “project of the century” and said special emphasis “must be placed on ecological conservation to prevent environmental damage,” Xinhua said on Saturday. Government bond yields rose across the board on Monday, with the most-traded 30-year treasury futures CTLU5 falling to five-week lows, as investors interpreted the news as part of China's economic stimulus. The project, overseen by the newly formed state-owned China Yajiang Group, marks a major boost in public investment to help bolster economic growth as current drivers show signs of faltering. “Assuming 10 years of construction, the investment/GDP boost could reach 120 billion yuan ($16.7 billion) for a single year,” said Citi in a note. “The actual economic benefits could go beyond that.” The Three Gorges, which took almost two decades to complete, generated nearly a million jobs, state media reported, though it displaced at least a similar number of people. Authorities have not indicated how many people would be displaced by the Yarlung Zangbo project. The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra River as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India and finally into Bangladesh. The chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu, said earlier this year that such a colossal dam barely 50km from the border could dry out 80% of the river passing through the Indian state while potentially inundating downstream areas in Arunachal and neighboring Assam state.
