                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Stargate, the ambitious joint venture announced at the White House back in January between OpenAI, Oracle, the Japanese holding company Softbank, and others, appears to be struggling to deliver on its bold promises just six months later. The Wall Street Journal reported today, citing unnamed sources, that the Stargate Project has yet to finalize any deals for new data centers. When it was announced on Jan. 21, Stargate was pitched as a new company with plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years to build AI infrastructure across the U.S. OpenAI claimed in a post on X (formerly Twitter) that $100 billion of that would be deployed “immediately.” The company was named after the 1994 sci-fi film about an interstellar gateway. Initial backers of the company include OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank, and MGX, with SoftBank and OpenAI leading the charge. SoftBank's CEO, Masayoshi Son, serves as the company's chairman. Son, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison joined President Donald Trump at the White House for the first press conference of his new term to promote the venture. At the event, both Altman and Ellison said Stargate's work could lead to cures for diseases like cancer. Altman even declared that Stargate would be “the most important project of this era.” Musk responded directly to OpenAI's X statement, writing, “They don't actually have the money,” and added, “SoftBank has well under $10B secured. Despite the slow start for Stargate, Altman is pushing ahead with his own broader data center ambitions. Just today, OpenAI said it's partnering to develop 4.5 gigawatts of additional Stargate-branded data center capacity in the U.S., although the deal does not involve Softbank. Those particular sites are reportedly not being funded by SoftBank, even though the Japanese company holds the trademark for Stargate. In a press release announcing its new partnership with Oracle, OpenAI said, “With SoftBank, we're moving quickly on site assessments and reimagining how data centers are designed to power advanced AI.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Little by little, the companies disclosed their intentions and, on Tuesday, OpenAI and Oracle announced plans to build an additional 4.5 gigawatts (GW) of Stargate data center infrastructure in the U.S., pushing OpenAI's total planned capacity beyond 5 GW. Interestingly, SoftBank is not involved in financing this buildout, despite being part of the Stargate project. Under the terms of the plan announced in January, OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank plan to build 20 data centers each measuring 500,000 square feet (46,450 square meters). However, it was unclear how they intended to power the data centers, as it does not look like the U.S. infrastructure has enough spare capacity to power the additional AI servers, cooling systems, and networking equipment used in AI data centers unless some sort of additional infrastructure is built. The announced 4.5 GW of infrastructure indeed refers primarily to electrical power availability, which is among the limiting factors for AI development these days. OpenAI claims that the expanded infrastructure of 5 GW will enable its data centers to power over two million AI processors, though it does not disclose whether the infrastructure is meant to support 1.4 kW Blackwell Ultra processors or 3.6 kW Rubin Ultra processors. If a 5 GW infrastructure were to power only AI GPUs, then it could feed 3.571 million Blackwell Ultra or 1.388 million Rubin Ultra GPUs. However, AI accelerators typically consume only half of the entire data center's power, without taking into account power usage effectiveness (PUE), so the actual number of supported GPUs would be lower. The new 4.5 GW-capable facilities may be built in states such as Texas, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, though exact locations are still being finalized. OpenAI believes that lessons learned from Abilene will help with the execution of subsequent sites. Parts of the Abilene facility — Stargate I — are now active as Oracle began installing server racks based on Nvidia's GB200 platform last month. OpenAI has begun utilizing this infrastructure to conduct early-stage AI training and inference tasks as part of its next-generation research initiatives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Security researchers at Google and Microsoft say they have evidence that hackers backed by China are exploiting a zero-day bug in Microsoft SharePoint, as companies around the world scramble to patch the flaw. In a blog post on Tuesday, Microsoft said it had observed at least two previously identified China-backed hacking groups it calls “Linen Typhoon” and “Violet Typhoon” exploiting the SharePoint zero-day. Microsoft also attributed the ongoing hacks to a third China-backed hacking group it named “Storm-2603,” representing a hacking group about which the company has less information. Charles Carmakal, the chief technology officer at Google's incident response unit Mandiant, told TechCrunch in an email that “at least one of the actors responsible” was a China-nexus hacking group, but noted that “multiple actors are now actively exploiting this vulnerability.” Dozens of organizations have already been hacked, including across the government sector. Microsoft has since rolled out patches for all affected versions of SharePoint, but security researchers have warned that customers running self-hosted versions of SharePoint should assume they have already been compromised. This is the latest hacking campaign linked to China in recent years. According to a recent Justice Department indictment accusing two Chinese hackers of masterminding the breaches, the so-called “Hafnium” hacks compromised contact information and private mailboxes from more than 60,000 affected servers.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. The fastest gaming processor in the world is still on sale at Amazon, just $10 shy of its lowest ever price. The absolute cream of the crop when it comes to gaming performance, this usually retails for around $479, but is currently discounted to $451. This deal is available across multiple vendors, including both Newegg and Amazon. Not only that, Amazon has also discounted a series of requisite AM5 motherboards from Asus, and will let you add both as a bundle to your basket. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D's performance blew us away when we reviewed it last year, quickly rocketing to the top of our list and earning our Editor's Choice award. We ultimately gave it a score of 4.5 out of 5 stars, regarding its performance as "devastating" in the title with good reason. This is hands down one of the best processors you can get your hands on right now, and this discount only sweetens the deal. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is $28 off at Amazon right now, just $10 shy of its lowest-ever price. There's also a discount on this ASUS TUF Gaming X870-Plus motherboard, now $266.99 instead of $299.99. Bundle those together and you'll save a total of $60 and get a new mobo to seat that shiny new CPU. Most importantly, it comes with a massive 96MB of game-boosting L3 Cache. This edition features integrated AMD Radeon Graphics, which includes two graphics cores, eliminating the need for a separate GPU to achieve video output with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It's also PCIe 5.0 compatible and supports up to 192GB of DDR5-5600 via two channels. The AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an absolute gaming beast; there is really no other way to put it, topping our CPU hierarchy list, where we break down our ranking of CPUs, and leading our list of the Best CPUs for gaming. Snag it while you can — this CPU was plagued by shortages for months due to its popularity, and, as expected, the price hasn't budged much as a result.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The young company, which buys electric trucks and offers them to shippers, is now carrying goods for 10 different Fortune 500 companies. More importantly, it's offering services as a carrier to those companies in California at cost parity with similar-sized diesel trucks. Khan said he also believes Nevoya is just running a much faster, leaner, and better carrier business than legacy operators — in large part by leveraging AI. Nevoya applies AI to optimize trucking routes, and matching and balancing loads with the right trucks to maximize efficiency while minimizing energy consumption. The company also uses AI to help sort out charging schedules and battery management. We came to the conclusion that 90% of what was going on could be automated or semi-automated.” Khan said Nevoya's automation has been getting information to drivers faster, with fewer mistakes than humans would make. He also said that leveraging AI is not replacing dispatchers, but rather freeing them up to better communicate with Nevoya's customers. Late last year, with a pre-seed round in the rear view mirror, and some early traction building Nevoya's all-electric trucking fleet, Khan found himself weighing options for how to grow his company: Do an inside round with existing investors? That's when Khan spoke with Shawn Xu from Lowercarbon Capital. Lowercarbon ended up leading Nevoya's $9.3 million seed round, which just closed, Khan told TechCrunch in an exclusive interview. Qasar Younis, the founder and CEO of buzzy self-driving AI company Applied Intuition, also invested. That funding will go toward expanding Nevoya beyond California into new states like Texas. The company is already hauling freight in Houston and Dallas. That will help Nevoya generate more revenue, though Khan was quick to point out that there is a lot of work to be done in these new markets before they can also reach cost parity with diesel trucks. He also said Nevoya has to be more creative with how it manages its fleets in places like Texas because there is less charging infrastructure. That involves workarounds like charging the trucks overnight at stations typically meant for passenger vehicles, or at school bus depots when the chargers aren't in use. These locations get extra revenue during off-peak hours, and Nevoya gets to expand quickly with lower up-front cost. He said the plan is to ultimately invest in building out more dedicated charging infrastructure. To manage this expansion, Khan said Nevoya is leaning on the same model that companies like Uber used as it entered new locations. Nevoya is hiring general managers that will run their own locations like a startup-within-a-startup. Xu said he initially held back from investing in Nevoya because he wanted the company to prove it could hit that cost parity with diesel. As Xu saw Nevoya progressing, he remembered saying to Khan: “What would it look like if you actually raised a lot more than you were expecting to raise?” The two spoke about using more artificial intelligence to optimize their fleet management, while also keeping an eye on an autonomous future (hence the inclusion of Applied Intuition's Younis in the round).

MediaTek and Nvidia have reportedly pushed back the launch of their much-anticipated N1X AI PC platform to the first quarter of 2026, according to a new DigiTimes report citing supply chain sources. The latest reasons given contrast with an earlier report, which still informed us of the delay, but attributed it to critical hardware defects requiring a silicon respin. While chip revisions at Nvidia are still part of this latest story, the new information points toward a broader set of factors, including Microsoft's slower-than-expected OS roadmap and weakening demand across the notebook market. The N1X platform, originally believed to be scheduled for Q3 2025 with both consumer and commercial models, never materialized at Computex earlier this year, fueling speculation about its readiness. DigiTimes now reports that MediaTek and Nvidia are prioritizing enterprise-class systems for the initial rollout, banking on stronger commercial adoption before expanding into the volatile consumer segment. The N1X processor has previously been tipped to deliver 180–200 TOPS of AI compute performance and would mark MediaTek's most ambitious entry into the PC space, backed by Nvidia's AI expertise. This is another area where Intel underestimated the competition way back, and now Nvidia appears to be gunning for this territory, rivaling not only Intel and AMD but also Qualcomm. Moreover, DigiTimes' report also offers a glimpse into Nvidia and MediaTek's expanding collaboration. Beyond PCs, the two companies are said to be advancing joint efforts in automotive AI via MediaTek's Dimensity Auto platform, as well as edge AI development with Nvidia's TAO toolkit and MediaTek's NeuroPilot SDK. This long-term partnership could bring significant revenue—estimated at $4 billion—and signals that MediaTek is building a stronger presence in the AI silicon market, both at the edge and in data centers. While SemiAccurate's earlier claims of hardware defects may still hold some truth, the new report paints a picture of a more calculated delay, aligning with Microsoft's OS updates, fixing remaining chip-level issues, and waiting for commercial demand to stabilize. In the meantime, Nvidia's GB10-based AI workstations, which are still on track for release, may serve as the company's first real-world testbed for consumer-facing AI PC hardware before N1X arrives.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>All products featured on WIRED are independently selected by our editors. What do mattresses and a box of matches have in common? Mattresses have historically posed a significant fire hazard, and they still can without careful attention to the materials used. In the US, an estimated 20,800 residential fires occurred due to mattresses and bedding igniting from flame exposure between 1996 and 1998, according to FEMA. While they don't make a bed fully fireproof, they slow the spread of fire and ultimately prevent sleepers from becoming the Human Torch. New federal standards for mattress flammability took effect in July 2007. But some of the new fire retardants used have created concerns about other health affects, especially if the worst comes to pass and it does ignite. What could you potentially be breathing in, or coming into contact with—and are there long-term repercussions from that exposure? To understand what makes a mattress safe from and in fires, we need to understand the different forms of flame retardant and how they perform in various scenarios. You can usually find it in one of two places: the mattress cover, or a thin internal sleeve that's usually called a “fire sock.” Fiberglass is very good as a flame retardant since it won't burn and has an extremely high melting point, 2,237 degrees Fahrenheit. Consumers have become increasingly aware of this problem, and pushback against mattresses with a fiberglass layer has become prevalent on social media, like a fairly recent wave of posts on TikTok. Mattresses that do contain fiberglass have to say so on the attached label. This is where certifications, careful research, and the recommendation of trusted testers are going to be crucial in picking the right product. WIRED, for example, does not recommend beds that contain fiberglass. Here are some of the most common in mattresses we have tested: Wool contains two major elements that aren't flame-friendly: nitrogen and water. Even, then it isn't the easiest to burn and may take more time to smolder before ultimately snuffing the fire out itself. They too contain a lot of moisture and will shrivel up like wool when subjected to flame. It's classified as a “semi-synthetic fiber” because it requires pretty serious chemical treatment in order to be transformed from a pulpy goo to the finished material. To make it fire resistant, though, rayon requires the use of silica. When subjected to flame, this mineral creates a char barrier that halts flames from progressing. Synthetic fibers, namely nylon and polyester, are both heavily plastic-based. Simply put, they require very high levels of heat to melt. “Melt” is the key word here, as even when subjected to flame exposure, the first reaction isn't to self-ignite. Aside from fiberglass, there are a few other flame retardants you want to avoid. But if something feels amiss, it's a go-with-your-gut situation. Are there noxious chemical smells coming from the bed? Again, this is where material certifications are so important, because they verify the absence of these things in the finished product. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are known as “forever chemicals” because once they enter the body, they make themselves permanently at home. While they work as a fire barrier, they can have long-term health ramifications after exposure, resulting in various forms of neurological and hormonal disorders. However, their usage in mattresses has been mostly phased out for these reasons. Decabromodiphenyl oxide (DecaBdE) is similar to PBDEs in that it doesn't vacate the body. Long-term accumulation can lead outcomes similar to those of PBDEs, like reproductive, thyroid, neurological, and liver disorders. Chlorinated tris (TDCPP) is another chemical flame retardant that can be found in some polyurethane foams, whether that be a mattress, piece of furniture, or clothing. It was banned in California back in 2020 and is listed on the Proposition 65 chemical list that could lead to serious long-term ramifications. Antimony trioxide can be used in foam and plastic production as a flame-resistant substance, but it has been studied for carcinogenic outcomes. Organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPFRS) were used as an alternative to PBDEs, especially as a flame retardant in foams, furniture, and tech products. Unfortunately, more research is coming to light on the downsides of OPFRs. Boric acid can be used as a flame retardant. Where it gets tricky is that as a flame retardant, it can release health-compromising fumes that are dangerous to breathe in—like hydrogen cyanide. Skin exposure can also mean potential serious neurological and kidney damage. We have an entire guide dedicated to the best organic mattresses, including some of our favorites below. With many chemical flame retardants being especially harmful for kids, sticking to organic mattresses can bring parents some peace of mind. WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson got this particular bed for his kids, who really enjoyed it for both sleeping and jumping on. Take precautions when using any flame near your bed—you don't want to have a live demo of its flame barrier if you don't have to. If you light candles in the evening, especially near your bedside, blow them out before you leave the room or fall sleep. Keep an eye on how close your bed is to electrical outlets and where you have things plugged in, like your phone charger. Lastly, make sure fire safety is common knowledge amongst family members and roommates, just to be on the safe side. So let's keep each other safe, Smokey the Bear style.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Pieces cracked off, sparks ricocheted, and dust whirled around under a blast of air. I could see a ring of black, glassy material stamped into the slab fragments, evidence of where the rock had melted. This rock-melting drilling technology from the geothermal startup Quaise is certainly unconventional. Iceland and the western US, for example, are hot spots for this always-available renewable energy source because they have all the necessary ingredients. But by digging deep enough, companies could theoretically tap into the Earth's heat from anywhere on the globe. In some places, accessing temperatures high enough to efficiently generate electricity would require drilling miles and miles beneath the surface. Often, that would mean going through very hard rock, like granite. Quaise's proposed solution is a new mode of drilling that eschews the traditional technique of scraping into rock with a hard drill bit. This could, in theory, make drilling faster and more economical, allowing for geothermal energy to be accessed anywhere. Now these efforts are leaving the lab, and the team is taking gyrotron drilling technology to a quarry to test it in real-world conditions. The startup is also attempting to raise a large funding round this year, at a time when economic uncertainty is slowing investment and the US climate technology industry is in a difficult spot politically because of policies like tariffs and a slowdown in government support. Quaise's big idea aims to accelerate an old source of renewable energy. This make-or-break moment might determine how far that idea can go. Rough calculations from the geothermal industry suggest that enough energy is stored inside the Earth to meet our energy demands for tens or even hundreds of thousands of years, says Matthew Houde, cofounder and chief of staff at Quaise. After that, other sources like fusion should be available, “assuming we continue going on that long, so to speak,” he quips. “We want to be able to scale this style of geothermal beyond the locations where we're able to readily access those temperatures today with conventional drilling,” Houde says. The key, he adds, is simply going deep enough: “If we can scale those depths to 10 to 20 kilometers, then we can enable super-hot geothermal to be worldwide accessible.” Though that's technically possible, there are few examples of humans drilling close to this depth. One research project that began in 1970 in the former Soviet Union reached just over 12 kilometers, but it took nearly 20 years and was incredibly expensive. Quaise hopes to speed up drilling and cut its cost, Houde says. The company's goal is to drill through rock at a rate of between three and five meters per hour of steady operation. One key factor slowing down many operations that drill through hard rocks like granite is nonproductive time. Quaise's key to potentially changing that is its gyrotron. Quaise's goal is to heat up the target rock, effectively drilling it away. (One of the company's main technological challenges is to avoid accidentally making plasma, an ionized, superheated state of matter, as it can waste energy and damage key equipment like the waveguide.) Here's how it works in practice: When Quaise's rig is drilling a hole, the tip of the waveguide is positioned a foot or so away from the rock it's targeting. They travel down the waveguide and hit the target rock, which heats up and then cracks, melts, or even vaporizes. This system is what I saw in action at the company's Houston headquarters. The drilling rig in the yard is a small setup, something like what a construction company might use to drill micro piles for a foundation or what researchers would use to take geological samples. In total, the gyrotron has a power of 100 kilowatts. Soon after my visit, this backyard setup was packed up and shipped to central Texas to be used for further field testing in a rock quarry. Quaise isn't the first to develop nonmechanical drilling, says Roland Horne, head of the geothermal program at Stanford University. However, that's not the whole of what's involved in drilling,” he says. So far, the company has found success drilling holes into columns of rock inside metal casings, as well as the quarry in its field trials. In April, Quaise fully integrated its second 100-kilowatt gyrotron onto an oil and gas rig owned by the company's investor and technology partner Nabors. This rig is the sort that would typically be used for training or engineering development, and it's set up along with a row of other rigs at the Nabors headquarters, just across town from the Quaise lab. When I visited in April, the company was still completing initial tests, using special thermal paper and firing short blasts to test the setup. In May the company tested this integrated rig, drilling a hole four inches in diameter and 30 feet deep. Another test in June reached a depth of 40 feet. These holes were drilled into columns of basalt that had been lowered into the ground as a test material. This one-megawatt system will drill larger holes, over eight inches across, and represents the commercial-scale version of the company's technology. Drilling tests are set to begin with this larger drill in 2026. That power demand is similar to what an oil and gas rig requires today. Quaise is in the process of setting up a pilot plant in Oregon, basically on the side of a volcano, says Trenton Cladouhos, the company's vice president of geothermal resource development. This project will use conventional drilling, and its main purpose is to show that Quaise can build and run a geothermal plant, Cladouhos says. The company is building an exploration well this year and plans to begin drilling production wells (those that can eventually be used to generate electricity) in 2026. That pilot project will reach about 20 megawatts of power with the first few wells, operating on rock that's around 350 °C. Quaise's strategy with the Oregon project is to show that it can use super-hot rocks to produce geothermal power efficiently, says CEO Carlos Araque. Araque says the company already has some customers lined up for the energy it'll produce, though he declined to name them, saying only that one was a big tech company, and there's a utility involved as well. But the startup will need more capital to finish this project and complete its testing with the larger, one-megawatt gyrotron. And uncertainty is floating around in climate tech, given the Trump administration's tariffs and rollback of financial support for climate tech (though geothermal has been relatively unscathed). Quaise still has some technical barriers to overcome before it begins building commercial power plants. And the company will likely face challenges as it transitions from lab testing to field trials. One key challenge for geothermal technology companies attempting to operate at this depth will be  keeping wells functional for a long time to keep a power plant operating, says Jefferson Tester, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in geothermal energy. Quaise's technology is very aspirational, Tester says, and it can be difficult for new ideas in geothermal to compete economically. And companies with ambitious ideas run the risk that their investors will run out of patience before they can develop their technology enough to make it onto the grid.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Certainly not I—I barely have time for paying my rent. Sorry, landlord, I simply don't have enough bandwidth today! If you're like me, which is to say a debt-drowning millennial who will probably never own walls and a roof outright, and you still want to have a smart home that feels functional, I'm (at the very least) pleased to inform you that this particular feat is actually doable. The first thing you'll need before you start smartening up your rented dwelling is a way to scream at all your gadgets. I'm not going to lie, the number one reason is that I got one for free through Spotify, which ran a promotion back in 2019 for subscribers to its premium plan. The promotion has since ended, but the good news is that if you want to grab one yourself, you can scoop one up for as little as $30. One advantage that I think Google has over an Amazon Echo speaker with Alexa, for example, is its Google Home app, which feels a lot more streamlined for quick smart home control compared to Amazon's Alexa app. I also think that Google Assistant is slightly better at understanding commands, but to be honest, that's like trying to decide which apple you'd rather pull from the compost and take a bite of. And once you make that choice, it's time to move on to the next most important facet of any smart apartment. I have absolutely no chill when it comes to lighting. I have five, to be exact, but two of those contain three bulbs, and one of them contains two, so that's a grand total of 10 light bulbs in one small apartment, just from lamps. As you might imagine, the smart lighting situation gets tricky pretty fast, but there are a few things you can do to make things less expensive and a little more manageable from a setup perspective. First, you can start by buying cheaper smart bulbs for the lamps that need them. Smart bulbs aren't necessary all of the time (I'll get into that in a moment), but they do offer some advantages, particularly the ability to dim or brighten them as needed. Brightness is also a feature that you do not have to shell out for the Philips Hue premium to attain. My apartment is stocked almost entirely with Wyze smart home lighting, and though they haven't always been the most consistent bulbs (they require quite a few firmware updates throughout the year), but they are mostly solid for doing anything you'd want smart bulbs to do. The key here isn't just to have smart lighting, but also to label and assign all of your lamps correctly inside your chosen smart home app. In my case, that's the Google Home app, where you can connect all your devices and pair them with your smart speaker. The app will ask what kind of device you want to add, where you want to add it, and then it should automatically look for devices on the same Wi-Fi network and prompt you to set it up (make sure your device is in the proper setup mode before you do that). Loading those bulbs in isn't enough, though. Once you have your lights and other devices in the Google Home app and have everything labeled, it's time to start thinking about expanding your apartment. Smart outlets, as the name suggests, are just plugs that you can connect to the internet and turn on/off at will. They obviously won't give a feature set beyond just on or off, but sometimes that's all you need. If you have a nice lamp, for example, that doesn't take the type of bulb that comes in a smart variety (like a candelabra bulb), but you don't want to screw around turning it off and on manually all the time, try a smart outlet. These are especially great if you're gauche like me and still like to use cheap string lights around Christmas time and don't want to plug them in and take them out constantly. You can also apply the same strategy to appliances. Before I got a window AC unit from July (more on that in a bit), I had a regular old dumb AC unit that needed to be turned off and on manually. The best part is you can get them cheaply on Amazon. This set from Amazon gives you four plugs for just $25. I own several similar smart plugs from a nondescript brand that I assume is based in China, and they work surprisingly well. You may also have to download a separate app for setup purposes when you buy brands like this, so just keep that in mind. With anything you connect to the internet, there is inherently a security risk, so please keep that in mind also. If you're extra cautious about digital privacy and security, smart home life may not be the life for you, since every app, gadget, and online service you plug your information into opens up another avenue to having your data stolen. There are obviously a lot of gadgets out there in the smart home world that are great for people with houses—thermostats, fridges, ovens, security cameras, and more. But if you live in an apartment like me you may not be able to take advantage of those. There are some appliances that you should consider, though, like a Wi-Fi-enabled AC unit. I own one from July, a millennial-friendly window unit that doesn't look like total shit, and being able to connect the AC to the Google Home app has been a game-changer. One perk of having your AC unit connected to the internet is that you can turn if off or on remotely. Just pull open the July app and toggle your unit on. You can even select settings in the app like fan speed, temperature, and modes. Naturally, since it's Google-compatible, you can also activate the AC using your smart speaker, which is great in the morning when I want to lazily turn off my AC from bed. Another worthy category of your smart home experience is entertainment. Most TVs nowadays are smart home-ready, so be sure to check if your particular panel can connect to the platform you've chosen. Using voice commands to turn your TV on or off or change the volume isn't necessary, but it can be handy in a pinch, like when your cat accidentally lies on the remote while you're trying to sleep and you don't feel like getting out of bed to turn it back off (a true story). Since it's a Google product, it's naturally very compatible with the Google Home app and my Google smart speaker, so when I'm ready to go to bed, I can shout at the Google Assistant to “stop casting” instead of whipping out my phone and disconnecting the stream from whatever app I'm using. You can also control volume with voice commands, but that feels maybe a little more annoying than using your phone as a remote. As a bonus gadget, you can also consider installing smart blinds from companies like Ikea, which are compatible with both Google Assistant and Alexa. These need some minor installation unlike the other things I've recommended, but they're only mildly invasive, which is to say you probably won't have your security deposit withheld for tossing them up. My parents have their entire house set up with smart blinds, and I've been pretty impressed with how convenient it is to use voice controls to raise and lower them. So those are my tips for giving yourself a smart home without breaking the bank or buying a $3,500 fridge. These gadgets obviously aren't going to give your apartment the highest IQ out there in the world of smart homes, but it's not going to flunk out of summer school, either.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It is two distant galaxies colliding with each other to form a larger structure. Beyond its evocative shape, the structure intrigues the scientists because of its contents: Within it could be the first direct evidence of a newly formed primordial supermassive black hole. Light from this galaxy comes from a time when the universe was only 470 million years old—roughly 13.5 billion years ago. The Infinity Galaxy, with three points marked where there could be black holes. The scientists think they might have viewed signs of a direct collapse black hole. Typically, black holes are formed when stars run out of fuel and collapse under their own gravity, but there's an alternative formation phenomenon debated in astrophysics—where a black hole forms via the collapse of gigantic gas cloud, without a star having formed. The largest black holes found in the universe, supermassive black holes, have been identified in galaxies that formed just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. But what made their formation possible is not yet fully understood. Many supermassive black holes are believed to have come into being as a result of smaller black holes merging. But with very old supermassive black holes, there does not seem to have been enough time for the first stars in the universe to evolve, collapse into stellar-mass black holes, and then merge to colossal, supermassive sizes. So some astronomers have proposed an alternative origin for the universe's first supermassive black holes. According to this hypothesis, the black holes would not need to form from a star or arise from mergers. Instead, the theory goes, dense clumps of matter that in other instances gave rise to galaxies could have compressed directly into massive black holes. It is possible that the Infinity Galaxy offers revealing clues about the possibility of this second formation pathway. “While such collisions are rare events, similarly extreme gas densities are thought to have been quite common in the earliest cosmic epochs, when galaxies began to form,” Van Dokkum added. Scientists are also considering other, less spectacular alternatives as to what's going on in the Infinity Galaxy. Rather than being created through a direct collapse of gas, that potential extra black hole—the green spot in the image above—could instead be the signs of a black hole ejected from another galaxy as “Infinity” passes through it. But we can say that these new data strengthen the case that we're seeing a newborn black hole, while eliminating some of the competing explanations,” Van Dokkum concluded in a blog for NASA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Weighing the pros and cons, Amodei acknowledged in his note that accepting money from Middle East leaders would likely enrich “dictators.” “This is a real downside and I'm not thrilled about it,” he wrote. The message comes as AI companies race to secure the massive amounts of capital required to train and develop frontier AI models. Four months later, the company announced it was planning to build a data center in Abu Dhabi, as part of a push to help foreign governments “build sovereign AI capability in coordination with the US.” “As an American company at the frontier of AI development, we have always believed the supply chain of frontier AI model development should be on American soil in order to maintain America's lead,” said Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty in a statement. In May, President Donald Trump toured the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as part of a four-day trip focused on economic investments. A cabal of tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Nvidia chief Jensen Huang, joined him for a meeting with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. In 2024, Anthropic decided not to accept money from Saudi Arabia, citing national security concerns, per CNBC. The news came as FTX, the failed cryptocurrency exchange, went into bankruptcy proceedings, and its nearly 8 percent stake in Anthropic went up for sale. Now, it appears Anthropic is poised to accept Gulf State money—though the company hasn't said whether it has changed its stance on Saudi Arabia in particular. “The implicit promise of investing in future rounds can create a situation where they have some soft power, making it a bit harder to resist these things in the future. In fact, I actually am worried that getting the largest possible amounts of investment might be difficult without agreeing to some of these other things,” Amodei writes. “But l think the right response to this is simply to see how much we can get without agreeing to these things (which I think are likely still many billions), and then hold firm if they ask.” In a section titled “Erosion of Standards,” Amodei notes that the reason Anthropic “vociferously pushed for not allowing big data centers in the Middle East” was because “without a central authority blocking them, there's a race to the bottom where companies gain a lot of advantage by getting deeper and deeper in bed with the Middle East.” “That puts us at a significant disadvantage, and we need to look for ways to make up some of that disadvantage while remaining less objectionable. In a section titled “Comms Headaches,” the CEO acknowledged that taking investment from Gulf States would likely lead to public criticism. The “media / Twitter / the outside world” is “always looking for hypocrisy, while also being very stupid and therefore having a poor understanding of substantive issues,” Amodei wrote. “In fact, it could have important benefits for the world including improving human health, aiding economic development, etc.” WIRED may earn a portion of sales from products that are purchased through our site as part of our Affiliate Partnerships with retailers.
