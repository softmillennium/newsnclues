                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. My friend of over 20 years is a woman in her 70s who is being manipulated by online psychics in a way that is similar to online romance scams. She has been convinced by these psychics that family and longtime friends are against her. She has been told that her soulmate is looking for her, but she has to follow specific steps in order to be ready for him and that she is about to be very, very wealthy and the only obstacle is that formerly trusted loved ones are stealing the funds just moments before she was supposed to receive them. She has been so vicious to her family and other friends that they have completely closed contact and have no willingness to be involved. Her income is very limited, so whatever financial benefit the scammers are able to get can't be much. But at the same time, every penny she has is very much needed. I do not live nearby, so our contact is by phone. When I ask pointed questions, she drops out of contact for weeks at a time. I am torn between thinking that she is an adult who has the right to make terrible decisions and that being her friend when she is ready for reality is the best I can do and thinking that this is a five-alarm fire that might actually be endangering her life and I need to do something right now. I can tell you're very worried about your friend. But is she actually handing her cash to these psychics other than for regular appointments? If she's giving them access to her funds or transferring a substantial portion of what she has, then your friend is being financially exploited. Call Adult Protective Services in her county immediately. Find her local APS by visiting napsa-now.org/help-in-your-area or calling the Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116 (Monday-Friday, 9am-8pm ET), which can connect you to her local APS office. Case managers will help document the scam and connect you with resources. File an online report with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov. If any family members are still speaking to you, loop them in. Someone needs to check if she's given these scammers bank access, credit cards, or personal information. Be ready: she may cut you off entirely when APS investigates. She's being systematically isolated and financially drained by predators who've convinced her that people who love her are enemies. If she ends up broke, homeless, or worse because no one acted, you'll never forgive yourself. As we approach middle age, my sister and I have spoken frequently about how different our circumstances are compared to our social circles. We know we will not receive any inheritance as our parents have no assets, whereas most of our friends expect to receive significant or even life-changing amounts. Because of this, we live more modest lives compared to our close friends despite our household incomes being very similar, as we are prioritizing saving for retirement and paying off our mortgages before old age. I am single and childless but my sister has been married for over 10 years and has three small children. It is an astronomical sum of money and I had no idea his parents were so wealthy. He clearly thought I was already aware of his circumstances and their plans for this money. My sister has never even hinted at this. Slate relies on advertising to support our journalism.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW YORK, NY – (November 10, 2025) – The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper, a six-time Emmy® Award-winning CNN Original, returns with a new chapter in CNN Senior Correspondent Donie O'Sullivan's Emmy®-nominated series of investigations into the pervasive surge of misinformation and its impact on American politics. “MisinfoNation: White Genocide” premieres Sunday, November 16 at 8pm ET/PT on CNN. In this episode, O'Sullivan investigates why the narrative of an alleged “White genocide” in South Africa has gained traction among some Americans who fear changing demographics that are projected to soon make White people a minority in the U.S. The claim has even reached the White House, where President Trump cited it as justification for granting refugee status to White South Africans. “Claims about purported White persecution in South Africa have played a major role in stoking these fears and have been used as an attempted justification for major changes in the U.S. refugee program. We wanted to separate fact from fiction in what Americans are being told about post-apartheid South Africa and to understand what it means for all of us.” In “MisinfoNation: White Genocide,” O'Sullivan meets a cross-section of South Africans grappling with their nation's legacy of apartheid and the racial inequalities that endure today. Among them is Errol Musk, father of Elon Musk, whose outspoken views mirror themes that have surfaced in American political discourse. O'Sullivan also travels to two communities built exclusively for White residents: one in South Africa's Orania and another in the Ozark Mountains of the United States, uncovering how these parallel movements reflect a shared ideology across continents.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Photo by Fulton County Sheriff's Office via Getty Images Since his 2025 inauguration, President Donald Trump has granted executive clemency to more than 1,600 people, many of whom were serving prison time for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. That number makes the just over 200 signed executive orders seem quaint by comparison. She, along with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, among others, received pardons that are considered largely symbolic at this time, as no one from the new list has been convicted of a federal crime. What these pardons will prevent, however, is rather concrete, as future administrations will be unable to bring these charges against Powell and the others. In a statement provided to the New York Times, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those who were pardoned are “great Americans,” and claimed they had been “put through hell by the Biden administration for challenging an election.” She represented former Army lieutenant general and noted conspiracy theory peddler Michael Flynn in 2020 when he was accused of making false statements to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian government. If the Dallas Observer matters to you, please take action and contribute today, so when news happens, our reporters can be there. Among the many claims Powell has made regarding the 2020 election, the manipulation of voting machines, accusations of foreign interference and allegations that so-called “deep state” forces such as QAnon have worked to stop Trump's progress have made headlines. In 2023, Powell pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor charges of attempting to alter the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. As part of her plea deal, she agreed to six years of probation and to testify against other defendants in the case. Trump's pardon does not apply to the Georgia plea deal. Her actively updated social media is filled with pro-Trump, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and yes, voter fraud-related rhetoric. On Sunday, prior to the news of her pardon breaking, she retweeted an X post stating, “Antonio Gracias found (20M) dead people on Social Security, (2.4M) Illegals were issued SS numbers. Elon ~ there was a massive program to ultimately change the voting map of the U.S. People cannot be rewarded when they come here illegally.” Kelly Dearmore is news editor of the Dallas Observer.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Science and the cosmic needn't be binary forces. When talking with Kelly Robertson, spiritual healer and lifelong experiencer, it becomes clear that they intertwine. “In the simplest of terms, when there's a will, there's a way,” Kelly says when it comes to the topic of harnessing her abduction experience into helping others heal from theirs. It all started in a park in Arkansas when she was seven years old, when she saw a blonde girl named Alanis, whom Kelly describes as “absolute perfection.” Curiously, Alanis had her leg in plaster – but there were no signatures on the cast, which is unusual in that neck of the woods. Kelly was told not to worry, and as she ran home, Alanis called out, “Oh, but you'll see me again.” But that's not where the story ends. On the walls of the craft were bodies, including a blonde girl with dark Mediterranean skin, which Kelly believed was her body in stasis. Kelly maintains the alien race had, by whichever means, tapped into her mind, and that she'd voluntarily come here to Earth to give it a look. “When someone describes an abduction that feels completely real,” says Laura Merritt, a trauma therapist at Golden Path Therapy, “the body is responding to threat at a primitive level. This directly correlates to Kelly's memories of paralysis, which she calls “interface,” and a therapist would call “the freeze response.” Notably, Kelly helps in the community, especially if people feel ostracized and alone during an abduction. She says there's a lack of data to suggest how many humans have been abducted, but that it largely runs in families, claiming her grandpa saw a UFO “dumping out water and frogs” when he was younger. And speaking of blood, as there is a unique and cosmic trope associated with the O-negative blood type, Kelly is a little cynical, stating that it might be a result of genetic engineering, given that, since the 1950s, more subgroups have appeared. In Hinduism, for example, there are fourteen “lokas,” or planes of existence. Aliens, according to Kelly, are more likely to gauge the collective consciousness of a country like the US, especially when opinions are still quite polarized. Religion isn't apart from science in this context: She mentioned that during one of her abductions, there was evidence of a multitude of timelines presented to her on a screen that funnelled to two eventual outcomes – the high road and the low road. If collective consciousness allows us to take the high road, she says, we can avert disaster and circumvent being part of another layer of species that could be wiped out on Earth. “We're a much more advanced version of AI,” Kelly adds. “A collective consciousness with the World Wide Web on steroids. I'm just the conduit.” Though the inventor didn't himself prove quantum entanglement, he often gets mentioned alongside Einstein when it comes to conversations about energy and radio waves. Merritt interprets this kind of connection a little differently, however. “After a trauma, the brain looks for meaning,” she says. “For some, that meaning arrives as images of technology, light, or energy – metaphors that help the mind contain something too big to name.” It appears that sometimes the sheer vicissitude of abduction can be troubling to talk about, even as Kelly experienced later with her future husband at 17. Startled, she claimed her dad was gonna kick their asses. All these years later, Kelly now believes there was a sense of telekinesis going on, especially when she surrendered her will to fight.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shaheen Shah Afridi's second stint as Pakistan captain got off to a good start, as the hosts won the three-match series 2-1 against South Africa. It is worth mentioning that Rizwan was removed as the ODI captain despite Pakistan winning the series in Australia and South Africa under his tenure. Speaking to the media on Monday, Shaheen stated that Rizwan himself had decided to step back as captain, and once this decision was made, he was appointed as the new skipper. He is a good person; he decided to step back himself, and then I took over,” Shaheen told reporters. Shaheen was previously appointed Pakistan's white-ball captain after the 2023 ODI World Cup. However, his tenure ended prematurely after Pakistan lost the T20I series against New Zealand under his leadership. The pacer was then replaced in similar circumstances to Rizwan's sacking. Afridi was then replaced by Babar Azam a week later. Speaking to the media, Shaheen also discussed his previous captaincy stint; however, he remained tight-lipped about the circumstances surrounding his removal from the post. “When I had taken over captaincy earlier, I had spoken to both Babar Azam and Rizwan. But I won't delve much into my removal as the captain,” said Shaheen.</p>

This milestone tells me something important: curiosity about science lives in all of us, regardless of our backgrounds. Today, I'm inviting you, my science-oriented readership, to participate in a real academic research. I am collaborating with Prof. Gershon Tenenbaum and Dr. Omer Eldadi on a study examining how scientifically engaged individuals perceive the question of extraterrestrial intelligence beyond Earth. How do your beliefs compare to what you think others believe — both in your social circle and among scientific experts? Your participation takes just 5 minutes and contributes to academic research that will be published in a peer reviewed journal and shared here on Medium with all of you. This study targets readers like you, people who actively engage with scientific ideas, because understanding how the scientifically literate public thinks about extraterrestrial intelligence is crucial for improving science communication in this field. Science advances through curiosity and evidence, not assumptions. By participating, you're expanding our understanding of how beliefs about one of humanity's most fundamental questions are formed and shared within science-oriented communities. We should maintain the humility to learn rather than presume we know the answers in advance. Your contribution to this research embodies that scientific spirit.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Paranormal Activity” tells the story of a couple that recently moved hoping to escape the past — only to discover their troubles have followed them. The screams of fright recently heard in London and Chicago — as well as those expected to flow through Downtown's Ahmanson Theatre this month — might never have happened if not for an accident decades ago. That's when then three-year-old Chris Fisher fell off a stool, broke his leg and ended up hospitalized for six weeks. His parents bought him a magic set to pass the time. While magic remained part of his life, he began working behind the scenes in theater, unaware that eventually both worlds would merge. Now an acclaimed illusionist for plays, including Broadway's “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” and “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” Fisher has created some of his most advanced and scary effects for “Paranormal Activity.” Writer Levi Holloway and director Felix Barrett are both theatrical horror veterans. After months of preparation to make each creepy and scary moment succeed for its world premiere in London, Fisher was optimistic but not sure it would all work until the first audience reacted. “You always hope that you're going to get those moments, and I think one of the illusions is probably the most satisfying illusion that I think I've ever designed, because the reactions it gets are crazy,” Fisher said. Fisher spent years as a theatrical stage and company manager, performing tricks for the company's amusement, until illusionist Jamie Harrison recruited him for a production of the musical “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” They also joined forces on the “Harry Potter” and “Stranger Things” shows. For “Paranormal Activity,” Fisher, who is working without Harrison this time, has been part of the creation process since near the beginning. It also helped that I had worked in theater for a while, because I understand about sound and lighting. As he does with all writers and directors, Fisher told Holloway and Barrett not to focus on whether an effect could be done but rather focus on their vision — leaving it to him to make it a reality. One of the biggest challenges for each production is making sure the cast knows how to work with his illusions, beginning with explaining why they shouldn't reveal any secrets. “Sometimes when you find out how something's done, it can be quite disappointing,” he said. “So, I talk through that psychology of why we keep the secret. It's hard for actors because they're not magicians and sometimes I need to guide them to make what they're doing feel natural.” There's one moment where, with every audience, it feels as if they're going to give a standing ovation because they're so excited about it.” Still, not every effect always lands the same way each time, and the cast has to go with it. “It's a testimony to the way Levi wrote this that so many people who have been watching say it feels like they're invading, like they shouldn't be there,” Álvarez said. “Paranormal Activity,” which co-stars Cher Álvarez, is inspired by the movie franchise. The intensity of both the story and relying on technical aspects means Álvarez and Heusinger rely heavily on mutual trust, knowing they will be there for each other regardless of what happens — including reactions from the crowds. “I can say that the audience screams, and I mean screams every night, multiple times, and it's not that we're not running out and going ‘Boo' from behind their backs.
