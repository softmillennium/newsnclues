                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists have uncovered a surprising connection between sugar metabolism and alcohol addiction, identifying a potential new therapeutic target for treating alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD). This process, driven by the enzyme ketohexokinase (KHK), appears to play a key role in both reinforcing alcohol consumption habits and accelerating liver damage. Researchers discovered that mice lacking KHK showed markedly lower alcohol inclination and consumption. These mice drank less alcohol across multiple tests, including voluntary drinking and reward-based models, and exhibited reduced activity in brain regions associated with addiction. Importantly, alcohol-induced liver injury appeared to be non-existent when KHK was blocked, either genetically or through medication. Livers displayed reduced fat accumulation, inflammation and scarring, suggesting that interfering with fructose metabolism could halt or even prevent alcohol-related liver disease progression. "Our findings show that alcohol doesn't just damage the liver directly, it hijacks the body's sugar metabolism in a way that enhances drinking behavior and worsens liver injury," said Miguel A. Lanaspa, DVM, PhD, associate research professor at CU Anschutz and senior author. "By targeting fructose metabolism, we may be able to break this cycle and develop new treatments for both alcohol addiction and liver disease." Because both alcohol-associated liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) share fructose-driven mechanisms, the results suggest that therapies designed to inhibit fructose metabolism could benefit a broad range of patients with liver disease linked to diet or alcohol use. This discovery highlights an unexpected intersection between sugar and alcohol metabolism. It opens exciting possibilities for developing treatments that target a common pathway underlying both metabolic and alcohol-related liver diseases."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Routine screening is limited to only a few cancer types. New research indicates that routine liquid biopsy testing (multi-cancer early detection testing) could substantially reduce late-stage cancer diagnoses, allowing patients to receive treatment at earlier cancer stages, which are more likely to respond to interventions. Currently, routine screening is only recommended for four types of cancer, leaving approximately 70% of new cancer cases to be detected only after symptoms appear, often at an advanced stage when survival rates are lower. Multi-cancer early detection tests offer a revolutionary approach by screening for multiple cancer types simultaneously from a single blood draw. To evaluate the impact of one such test, Cancerguard, investigators used epidemiological data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and developed a simulation model of 14 cancer types, which account for nearly 80% of cancer incidence and mortality. The researchers simulated 10-year disease progression for 5 million US adults aged 50–84 years and assessed the effects of incorporating an annual blood-based multi-cancer early detection test into standard care. The model estimated that over 10 years, supplemental multi-cancer early detection testing would lead to a 10% increase in stage I diagnoses, a 20% increase in stage II diagnoses, a 30% increase in stage III diagnoses, and a 45% decrease in stage IV diagnoses, relative to standard care. The largest relative reductions were in cervical, liver, and colorectal cancers. Our analysis shows that multi-cancer blood tests could be a game changer for cancer control. By detecting cancers earlier-before they spread-these tests could potentially improve survival and reduce the personal and economic burden of cancer."

Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism employed by 5-10 % of cancer cells to achieve replicative immortality, and is absent in normal cells. Unlike telomerase (TEL) positive cancers, ALT tumors rely on chronic telomeric replication stress to drive telomere extension. Despite this, no targeted therapies currently exist for ALT cancers. Through collaboration with the Nikon Bioimaging lab, the research team performed a high-throughput arrayed CRISPR screen with an imaging output to identify RNA-interacting factors with potential as targets in ALT cancers.

ALT is associated with poor prognosis in a range of different cancer types. Image Credit: MDPI cancers, Mackenzie Jr et al 2021 To discover and validate therapeutic targets for ALT cancers, the team adapted and implemented two assays from published literature, which can detect unique ALT molecular hallmarks: CCA-qPCR for C-circles and ssTelo native FISH for single-stranded telomeric DNA. By performing CRISPR knockout (KO) of literature-established control genes, they validated these assays by observing the expected increase (FANCM) or decrease (BLM) in ALT hallmarks associated with loss of either gene. C-circles are amplified from genomic DNA by rolling circle amplification, and fold change is detected using telomere-specific primers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study from researchers at Intermountain Health reveals that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular complications - including heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and death - within five years of giving birth. The study found that women who experienced HDP during pregnancy were significantly more likely to develop serious cardiovascular-related issues compared to those without HDP. This risk is present in women with chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy, and it's even more pronounced when compounded by severe forms of HDP, such as eclampsia." In this retrospective study, researchers analyzed 218,141 live births involving 157,606 patients across 22 Intermountain Health hospitals between 2017 and 2024. • 19.7% of patients had a HDP diagnosis, with most cases occurring during the first live birth. • Patients with HDP had significantly more cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, depression, and lower socioeconomic status. • The severity of HDP correlated with higher cardiovascular risk. Women with chronic hypertension and eclampsia had the greatest risk of future cardiovascular events compared to those without HDP. Despite these alarming statistics, many pregnant women remain unaware of the long-term cardiovascular risks associated with HDP. "We need to do a better job identifying women with these risk factors and ensuring they receive appropriate care before, during, and after pregnancy," said Rasmusson. "This is especially critical for those with severe forms of HDP." Rasmusson emphasized the importance of cross-disciplinary care for women at risk. "Traditionally, this has been the domain of OB-GYNs and nurse midwives, but our findings show it's an 'all hands-on deck' situation," she said. This groundbreaking research highlights the urgent need for increased awareness, early intervention, and collaborative care to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality linked to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The current kidney transplant waitlisting criterion is based on a single measurement of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤20 ml/min/1.73m2) and does not consider an individual's risk of progressing to kidney failure. A new study reveals that inclusion of a patient's two-year risk of progression to kidney failure (using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation [KFRE], which incorporates age, sex, urine albumin, and eGFR) as a decision-making tool toward pre-emptive listing for kidney transplantation, has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce racial disparities. The findings were presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025, held November 5–9. In 2022, veterans who only qualified by the eGFR ≤20 criterion were older (71 years) than those who only qualify by KFRE ≥25% (53 years). Also, using the kidney disease progression criteria only, more males, minorities (Hispanic, Black, and Asian), and those with diabetes and/or albuminuria would be waitlisted. Jennifer L.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare but serious adverse effect of the diabetes drug metformin in which the body accumulates too much lactic acid. Their work will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 from November 5–9. The protocol, which included immediate initiation of dialysis using either intermittent hemodialysis, continuous kidney replacement therapy, or peritonealdialysis as treatment, was implemented at Maharat Nakhonratchasima hospital (MNRH), in Thailand. The average door-to-dialysis time—the interval between a patient's hospital admission and the initiation of dialysis—was reduced from 870 minutes to 690 minutes, and MALA awareness increased from 38.5% to 89.9% after implementation. A standardized MALA protocol covering diagnosis, access, and treatment shortened door-to-dialysis time, increased awareness, and reduced care variation. Fast-track dialysis pathways should be adopted for time-sensitive conditions like MALA. Availability of all dialysis modalities ensures flexibility and enables timely treatment initiation."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a new study of more than 40,000 patients, researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City have found that patients who have no evidence of calcium in their coronary arteries are not only significantly less likely to die from heart conditions – including heart attacks and heart failure– but also are at reduced risk of death from non-cardiac medical conditions. It is an excellent measure of coronary plaque burden. When cholesterol-laden plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, blood flow to heart muscle is limited, and plaque rupture with coronary thrombosis can block off blood flow completely, leading to unstable angina or a heart attack. As plaques age, they attract calcium, which can be imaged with computed tomography. If someone has a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero, the chance that their coronary arteries are clear of advanced plaques is very high. If CAC is present, then their risk of a future heart attack is much greater and in proportion to the CAC score. We know that not having any coronary artery calcium is a predictor of being in good coronary health, but we were surprised to find that it may also be a sign you're in good general health." We don't know the mechanism for this extended benefit, but coronary plaque may be correlated with plaque in blood vessels in other parts of the body, and having atherosclerosis may also negatively impact immune surveillance, an important protective mechanism against cancer." In the large, retrospective study, Intermountain researchers reviewed the medical records of 40,018 Intermountain Health patients, whose doctors determined they were at risk of having or developing heart disease, and as part of that care, underwent a PET/CT stress test. Researchers then followed up with patients for five years and reviewed all-cause mortality of people with a CAC score of zero compared to those with a CAC score of greater than zero. Researchers found that people who had any level of coronary artery calcium were 2 to 3 times more likely to have died than those without CAC in those five years. Even more surprising, of those with CAC who died, only about one quarter did so from cardiovascular disease. Researchers say they're not sure why patients' all-cause mortality rates were higher for those with evidence of coronary artery calcium. "This may help uncover the mechanism of why a coronary artery calcium score predicts death due to non-coronary artery problems," said Dr. Anderson. "It's not clear to us right now, and it requires more study, but it's a very interesting observation and suggests that coronary artery calcium has prognostic value beyond just heart attacks and other heart -related causes."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Researchers from Mass General Brigham have found that olezarsen-a drug designed to lower triglyceride levels-can also decrease the risk of acute pancreatitis, a potential complication in patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels. The results, from two randomized, placebo-controlled trials (CORE-TIMI 72a and CORE2-TIMI 72b), were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine. Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a condition in which the level of triglycerides (a type of fat that circulates in the blood) is very high. The trials enrolled 1,063 participants across 33 countries who had fasting triglyceride levels ≥500 mg/dL and were taking lipid-lowering therapy. These findings support olezarsen's potential to become a cornerstone therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly for preventing a serious and potentially life-threating condition. Prevention is key in medicine, and our findings underscore the importance of clinical trials in evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments to improve health outcomes." Nicholas Marston, MD, MPH, lead author, cardiologist with the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute In 590 patients with measurements available at baseline and follow-up, more than 85% of patients taking either 50 mg or 80 mg of olezarsen saw their triglyceride levels drop below 500 mg/dL, compared with 35% in the placebo group. There were 29 acute pancreatitis events reported across the two studies. The incidence of acute pancreatitis was 1.1 per 100 patient years in the pooled olezarsen groups, compared with 6.2 per 100 patient years in the placebo group – translating to an 85% relative risk reduction. The long-term effectiveness and safety of olezarsen for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is being evaluated in an ongoing open-label extension study.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>By analyzing co-abundance networks in 938 healthy adults, scientists discovered how lifestyle factors subtly rewire bacterial relationships in the gut, offering a more powerful way to predict health traits than abundance-based models. In a recent study published in the journal Communications Biology, researchers investigated environmental factors associated with co-abundance in the human gut microbiome. A growing body of research has described features associated with the gut microbiome composition in health and disease. Some of the prominent features include sex, age, host genetics, and diet. However, some aspects of the host-microbiome relationship are difficult to characterize. The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, and its constituents form sub-communities through interactions between taxa. However, there is no gold standard method for screening factors linked to changes in bacterial co-abundance across individuals within a population. In the present study, researchers characterized associations between environmental factors and changes in the gut microbiome co-abundance network. First, Multivariate Analysis of Conditional Covariance Analysis (MANOCCA) was used to investigate the associations between 80 environmental factors (host features) and taxa co-abundance at the family, genus, and species levels using data from 938 healthy participants. This new method addressed key limitations of previous approaches by supporting both continuous and categorical predictors, allowing covariate adjustment, and providing a formal statistical framework for co-abundance at the individual level. MANOCCA is a covariance-based approach that allows formal statistical testing of associations between the covariance of taxa and any predictor, and was developed to address current limitations. Data on host features were collected at baseline and included demographics, medical history, dietary habits, and biomarkers. MANOCCA revealed significant associations with sex, age, and smoking at all three taxonomic levels and body mass index (BMI) at the genus level. Notably, associations with taxa co-abundance were enriched for nutritional features, indicating a modest but systematic impact of diet on the taxa interaction network. Next, the team derived contribution weights for sex, age, BMI, and smoking signals, noting that most taxa had non-zero and substantially heterogeneous contributions to the association. The MANOCCA weights were compared against univariate mean effect p-value associations derived from standard linear regression. This revealed a significant positive correlation between the two results for smoking, BMI, age, and sex, indicating a dual impact on the abundance and co-abundance of many genera. A core of approximately 200 genera was systematically impacted across all four factors, suggesting a central role in the network structure. Among 151 families, 10, 8, 11, and 7 overlapping sets of families covered ≥ 50% of the top contributing genera for age, sex, smoking, and BMI, respectively. The key families included Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Acutalibacteraceae, and Oscillospiraceae, with rare families such as Eggerthellaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Muribaculaceae. Notably, Bacteroidaceae were underrepresented in co-abundance changes, whereas Oscillospiraceae were strongly impacted, particularly in relation to BMI. In (c), we show the distribution of direction of effects per predictor, and for the age – smoking and sex – BMI intersections. We then used the pairs of features to derive a network of the changes in correlation with regard to each predictor. The node size, representing a genus, is proportional to its number of contributions with other genera, and edges link the top contributing pairs. The edge colors indicate the direction of effect with green indicating that an increase of the predictor drives an increase in co-abundance, red shows that an increase of the predictor drives a reduction in co-abundance and black indicates a mixed direction of effect for the overlapping predictors. Panel (d) displays the number of edges included in a single predictor (Age, Sex, BMI, Smoking) and by overlapping predictors (Age and Smoking, Sex and BMI), with in red the edges of reduced co-abundances and in green increased co-abundances. Grey edges indicate a mixed direction of effects for the overlapping predictors. Specifically for the overlap between Sex and BMI, the hashed area represents edges towards increased co-abundance for Sex and decreased co-abundance for BMI. Conversely, the grey part covers a decrease for Sex but an increase for BMI. In total, 4,000 pairs encompassed 476 unique genera. Notably, the researchers observed a substantial overlap in pairs of co-abundant taxa that were impacted by both BMI and sex (658 shared pairs), as well as by smoking and age (306 shared pairs). Increased smoking and age were mainly associated with a decline in co-abundances, whereas higher BMI was associated with an increase. For example, Bacteroides A exhibited reduced co-abundances with many core taxa in smokers, despite no association in relative abundance, illustrating how covariance analysis can detect interaction shifts that are missed by traditional abundance-based methods. Accuracy was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and squared correlation (r²) for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. The covariance-based prediction model was compared with a standard linear model based on relative abundance. The team noted that MANOCCA outperformed and was significantly more accurate than the standard model. The gain in prediction was substantially large for age, with median r²(age) values of 0.18 (family), 0.25 (genus), and 0.27 (species) for MANOCCA models, representing a three-fold improvement over abundance-based models. MANOCCA revealed significant associations between the variability in taxa co-abundance and age, sex, BMI, and smoking. The network of top-contributing genera revealed that interaction variability was limited to a small number of families. Co-abundance variability was concentrated in a limited number of families, with cross-family interactions vastly predominating over within-family links. Moreover, interactions were primarily observed between genera of distinct families, rather than within the same family. The MANOCCA framework can also be utilized to develop predictive models. The predictive power of taxa co-abundance-based models was significantly higher than that of a standard abundance-based model for all features. However, the authors noted that the MANOCCA method requires large sample sizes (typically over 100 participants) and does not explicitly model the compositional nature of microbiome data, which should be refined in future work.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Despite the region's reputation for healthy living, new research reveals that ultra-processed foods are increasingly prevalent in the diets of Mediterranean youth, linking poor eating habits with excessive screen time and modern lifestyle shifts. In a recent study published in the International Journal of Public Health, researchers leveraged an extensive cross-sectional study to investigate the consumption of unhealthy UPF items among youth in the Mediterranean region. The study surveyed 2,011 families across five countries and found that about 95% of children and adolescents consumed at least one unhealthy UPF item daily. This high intake was strongly linked to obesity, older adolescent age, and suboptimal lifestyle factors, including increased screen time and exposure to food advertising, with additional links to frequent eating out of home and snacking. High parental education was associated with high consumption but not with daily consumption, while having an older or female responding parent was inversely associated. Younger parental age was identified as a risk factor for higher UPF consumption. These findings suggest that UPF consumption is part of a complex, modern, and unhealthy lifestyle that has taken root even in this traditionally healthy region. The traditional Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) has historically been considered one of the most optimal extant dietary patterns, famously associated with longevity and health. However, recent decades have witnessed a global "nutrition transition." The primary constituents of these "unhealthy" diets are often ultra-processed foods (UPFs), industrial formulations containing little to no whole foods. A growing body of research links high UPF consumption to numerous health problems, including metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and even mental health issues like depression. Studies specifically focused on children and adolescents have associated UPFs with food addiction in the former cohort, and faster increases in body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage during adolescence. While this trend is globally recognized, data specifically focusing on unhealthy UPFs in Mediterranean youth remain limited. The present study addressed this knowledge gap by using a cross-sectional analysis of the DELICIOUS (UnDErstanding consumer food choices & promotion of healthy and sustainable Mediterranean diet and LIfestyle in Children and adolescents through behavIOUral change actionS) project, an initiative aimed at understanding food choices and promoting a healthy Mediterranean lifestyle in children and adolescents. The study cohort consisted of 2,011 parents of children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 from five Mediterranean countries: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Egypt, and Lebanon. Study data were collected via a parent-completed, detailed electronic survey that covered demographics, eating habits, and lifestyle factors for both parents and their children. The survey included a 13-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) measuring the consumption of soft drinks, fast food, salty snacks, commercial sauces, and sweets. These items operationalized “unhealthy” UPFs; frequency, rather than quantity or total UPF intake, was assessed, and the data were parent-reported. FFQ data were used to categorize participants based on their respective consumption frequencies. Additionally, children's Body Mass Index (BMI) was collected and used to classify participants into normal weight, overweight, or obese (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] criteria). Lifestyle habits were assessed using validated tools, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ) and a lifestyle score derived from the Electronic Kids Dietary Index (E-KINDEX), which allowed for multivariate analysis and the identification of statistical associations between unhealthy UPF consumption and a wide range of demographic and lifestyle variables. Study findings revealed that approximately 95% of included children and adolescents consumed unhealthy UPFs daily, with the median intake across the entire cohort computed to be about 1.8 servings per day. Multivariate analyses revealed key factors strongly associated with higher consumption. Firstly, older children and those with obesity were found to demonstrate the most significant risk. Children with obesity were 1.97 times more likely to have high consumption (p < 0.001) and 2.02 times more likely to be daily consumers (p < 0.05) than their normal-weight peers. Secondly, high parental education was associated with 2.23 times higher odds of high UPF consumption (p < 0.05) but not with daily consumption. Thirdly, lifestyle was highlighted as a significant contributor to poor dietary habits. Specifically, compared to those with less than 2 hours of screen time a day, children with 2–4 hours of screen time were 2.61 times more likely to be daily consumers (p < 0.001), and those with over 4 hours were 2.64 times more likely (p < 0.05). Eating advertised foods was also associated with 5.03 times higher odds of daily consumption. A higher E-KINDEX lifestyle score was inversely associated with both high and daily consumption. The present study highlights the alarming prevalence of daily UPF consumption among Mediterranean youth, finding these unhealthy dietary patterns deeply enmeshed in an overall unhealthy lifestyle characterized by high screen time, sedentary behavior, and specific eating habits, such as snacking and eating out. While the study's cross-sectional design precludes causation, the convenience sampling via a consumer database limits national representativeness, and parent-reported FFQ frequency for selected “unhealthy” UPF items does not quantify total UPF or portion sizes, introducing potential misclassification. The findings underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach involving parents, educators, and healthcare professionals to foster healthier, more active lifestyles for children, even in regions with a rich history of healthy eating habits.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>People tend to use first-person self-talk far more often than distanced self-talk, but when they take a step back and address themselves by name, it can subtly improve how they feel, particularly in moments of preparation or anticipation. Study: The frequency, form, and function of self-talk in everyday life. They investigated how people's self-talk shifted in different situations and looked at its links to narcissism or emotional distress. They found that people were more likely to engage in ‘immersed' self-talk, speaking to themselves in the first person, rather than more distanced self-talk. Distanced self-talk yielded a small but reliable increase in positive affect only in situations that required preparation for action or speech. Interestingly, self-talk was least frequent in these preparatory situations, despite being the only context in which it improved mood. Talking to oneself is a common human behavior that serves various self-regulatory functions. Past lab studies have shown that distanced self-talk, referring to oneself by name or in the third person, helps manage emotions and align behavior with goals by promoting psychological distance. However, little is known about how often people spontaneously use this form of self-talk in everyday life, when they do so, and how it affects emotions outside laboratory settings. Earlier theories viewed self-talk as a developmental tool for self-regulation, and later research confirmed that self-talk often arises in challenging, emotionally charged, or performance-based situations. Yet most studies have not distinguished between distanced and immersed self-talk. Evidence suggests that adopting a distanced perspective may enhance problem-solving, emotional control, and goal pursuit. Individual differences, such as emotional distress and narcissism, may influence how often people use these perspectives. Distressed individuals might rely more on distanced self-talk as a coping mechanism, while narcissists might use it to reinforce self-importance. Researchers explored when and how people naturally use distanced (‘you' or the person's name) and immersed (‘I') patterns in everyday life. They employed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design over a two-week period. The sample was predominantly undergraduate students in the United States, and age data were not recorded due to a survey oversight. During the second phase, participants received five text messages per day for 14 days, each containing a brief survey. In each survey, they reported whether they had recently experienced one or more of four types of situations: feeling self-critical, trying to feel better, preparing for what to say or do, and feeling pleased with themselves. Participants could select more than one option. Primary analyses excluded episodes where participants reported both immersed and distanced self-talk for the same situation; exploratory contrasts versus no self-talk were presented in supplementary analyses. A small proportion of participants (2%) never used immersed self-talk, while two participants reported using neither form of self-talk. In the third phase, participants were debriefed and compensated. The EMA approach allowed researchers to capture real-time, context-dependent use of self-talk and assess its relationship to momentary affect (emotional state), trait emotional distress, and narcissism across multiple naturalistic settings. Across the 12,966 surveys, participants reported 20,646 relevant situations. Immersed self-talk was significantly more common across all situations. The most frequent contexts for distanced self-talk were self-critical and situations aimed at feeling better. Specifically, the mean within-person standard deviation was smaller for distanced self-talk (SD = 0.13) compared with immersed self-talk (SD = 0.21), reinforcing its stability. Distanced self-talk was most stable in preparatory and pleased situations. There were no significant associations between self-talk type and trait emotional distress or narcissism, and neither trait moderated the emotional outcomes of self-talk. Overall, the findings suggest that although distanced self-talk is less frequent, it remains relatively stable and may offer specific emotional benefits in contexts that require preparation or performance. Immersed self-talk was more common, while distanced self-talk occurred less often but was more stable and trait-like. Distanced self-talk proved beneficial only in preparatory situations, where it was linked to improved mood over time, supporting prior laboratory findings. No associations emerged between self-talk style and individual traits like emotional distress or narcissism, suggesting these patterns are broadly shared across personality types. The study's strengths include its ecological validity and real-time assessment of self-talk; however, its limitations include self-report bias and a lack of control over other regulatory strategies. Future research should explore cultural and linguistic differences, developmental origins, and how training might enhance the use of distanced self-talk to promote emotional well-being.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A daily glass of orange juice may do more than refresh; it can fine-tune thousands of genes tied to blood pressure and metabolism, with the benefits varying depending on your body weight. Study: A Global Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Body Weight-Specific Molecular Responses to Chronic Orange Juice Consumption in Healthy Individuals. In a recent study published in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, a group of researchers investigated how chronic orange juice (OJ) intake affects the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in healthy adults, and whether responses vary by body mass index (BMI) status. Fold-change ranges for individual genes were reported in supplementary data but were not emphasized in the main text. What if a breakfast staple could quietly tune the genes that steer blood pressure, lipids, and inflammation? Citrus fruits, especially OJ, supply flavanones such as hesperidin and naringenin that may influence vascular tone, lipid handling, and immune signaling. Yet, most people ask whether a daily glass truly alters biology in ways that matter, and whether body weight affects the response. Mapping gene activity in circulating immune cells can link a kitchen habit to outcomes families care about, although the mechanistic paper did not newly assess clinical endpoints; prior publications from the same cohort reported reductions in blood pressure and body-fat percentage with 500 mL/day OJ over 60 days. Healthy adults (n = 20; 10 men, 10 women; 21–36 years) without chronic disease consumed 500 mL/day of pasteurized OJ for 60 days, split into two home doses, after a three-day citrus-free washout; participants also avoided citrus foods during the intervention. Fasting blood was drawn at baseline (T0) and day 60 (T60). PBMCs were isolated and total ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted. Pathway enrichment was performed using GeneTrail with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways, and BioCarta; protein-protein interaction networks were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING). MicroRNA (miRNA) targets were derived via Mienturnet/miRTarBase; long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) targets via LncRRIsearch; small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) changes were also cataloged. In silico molecular docking (SwissDock) tested Phase II flavanone metabolites (for example, hesperetin- and naringenin-glucuronides/sulfates) and gut-derived catabolites against candidate transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunit 1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU), proto-oncogene (MYC), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), Yin-Yang 1 (YY1), E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ELK4 (ELK4), RELA (p65 subunit of NF-κB), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA), interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), and tumor protein 53 (TP53). Subgroup analyses were conducted to contrast normal-weight (NW) and overweight (OW) participants by BMI. Chronic OJ intake remodeled the PBMC transcriptome: 3,790 oligonucleotides changed, including 1,705 protein-coding genes (mostly downregulated), 66 miRNAs, 19 lncRNAs, and 67 snoRNAs. Principal components, partial least squares–discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and clustering analyses successfully separated T60 from T0, indicating a consistent intervention signal. Enriched pathways mapped to blood pressure control (aldosterone synthesis/secretion, renin secretion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-related signaling), lipid metabolism (thermogenesis, adipogenesis, mitochondrial fatty-acid β-oxidation), inflammation (toll-like receptor, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-17 (IL17)), cell adhesion (focal adhesion, actin cytoskeleton), and major signaling axes (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt), epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), insulin, and advanced glycation end product–receptor for advanced glycation end products). Additional enrichment included AHR signaling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein processing. Protein-protein interaction hubs included serine/threonine kinase AKT1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1), heat-shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90AA1), and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2). Blood-pressure-linked genes nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) were downregulated, alongside nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2), period circadian regulator 1 (PER1), salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1), G protein-coupled receptor 183 (GPR183), and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), aligning with mechanisms that favor lower blood pressure. Inflammatory mediators decreased: IL1B, IL6, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2/COX-2), and regulator of G-protein signaling 1 (RGS1), consistent with dampened NF-κB activity and reduced cytokine tone. Lipid/adipocyte programs also shifted: genes such as Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), perilipin-2 (PLIN2), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) moved toward a profile linked to better metabolic control. Among 66 altered miRNAs, weight-loss-associated species (for example, miR-548 family, miR-1185-1) rose, while inflammation-associated miR-640 and miR-1248 declined; miR-1305 increased, a change reported with anti-inflammatory effects. 19 lncRNAs changed, including downregulation of small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) and upregulation of apoptosis-associated transcript in bladder cancer (AATBC), a human adipocyte plasticity regulator. 67 snoRNAs shifted, 61 of which were downregulated, including reduced RPL13A cluster members (SNORD U32/U33/U34/U35), a pattern tied to lower oxidative stress and inflammation. Normal-weight participants exhibited unique modulation of inflammatory pathways, characterized by changes in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), solute carrier family 16 member 6 (SLC16A6), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), MAPK1, and miR-1185-2-5p. Thus, two people drinking the same OJ may experience different molecular benefits depending on BMI. Molecular docking supported direct interactions between Phase II flavanone metabolites (for example, hesperetin-3-glucuronide, hesperetin-7-glucuronide, hesperetin-3-sulfate; naringenin-4-glucuronide, naringenin-7-glucuronide) and transcription factors, including NFKB1, AHR, PPARA, ATF4, PLAU, NRF1, IRF9, MYC, YY1, ELK4, RELA, RXRA, and TP53, with free-energy range −6.29 to −9.63 kcal/mol; interactions <-6 kcal/mol were considered significant, offering a plausible route from juice metabolites to gene-regulatory effects. Daily OJ, a familiar food, reprogrammed immune-cell gene networks tied to blood pressure, lipids, and inflammation, with layered changes across protein-coding genes, miRNA, lncRNA, and snoRNA. Importantly, BMI-stratified effects revealed that lipid pathways dominated in overweight adults, while inflammation pathways shifted in normal-weight adults. Future studies should integrate fold-change magnitude data with targeted functional assays to validate these transcriptomic signatures. For individuals and clinicians, this supports tailoring “simple” dietary advice to body weight, to turn an everyday drink into a more precise cardiometabolic lever. Personalized nutrition requires both molecular evidence and practical application; these findings offer early molecular insights that can inform such individualized dietary guidance. Further research is needed to confirm and translate these transcriptomic effects into clinical outcomes.
