                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Some of the key cast involved in “National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation” have reunited, sharing a photograph of them together online. The 1989 release, written by John Hughes and directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik, is widely regarded as a classic Christmas movie and a staple of the holiday season. Juliette Lewis posted the image on Instagram to her personal account, which features Chevy Chase sitting on a chair, while Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, and Lewis all stand around him posing for the camera. “National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation” marked the final time that Hughes worked on a “National Lampoon” project and tells the story of Chase's character Clark Griswold as his attempts to have a normal family Christmas keep going awry. Chase, Quaid, and D'Angelo reprised their roles from previous movies, while Lewis replaced Dana Barron and Dana Hill in the role of the Griswold's daughter Audrey. Both Chase and Quaid worked together on the 2024 film “The Christmas Letter.” They were joined by Hallmark star Kristoffer Polaha alongside Brian Doyle-Murray. Polaha had previously shared photographs of him attending a convention in New York City, where he grabbed photographs with both CHase and Quaid. Earlier this year it was also revealed that a new documentary about Chevy Chase is on the way and should release in 2026. “I'm Chevy Chase and You're Not” is directed by Marina Zenovich and is set to arrive on Sky Documentaries next year. Zenovich has previously won awards for the documentaries “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic” and “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind.” Howard T. Owens, co-CEO of Propagate Content, released a statement about the film. He said, “We're thrilled to have Sky join the exceptional team behind this definitive portrait of Chevy Chase.” Owens continued, “Chevy is a complicated comedy legend, and Marina's unflinching approach captures that in a way only she can.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carrey, 63, and Momsen, 32, shared a sweet red carpet moment outside the Peacock Theater on Saturday, Nov. 8, smiling for photos and delighting fans who still cherish their unforgettable roles as the Grinch and little Cindy Lou Who. For the milestone event, Taylor Momsen, now the lead singer of the rock band Pretty Reckless, showed off her signature edge in a black lace dress with a thigh-high slit, layered under a sleek leather coat. She completed the look with calf-high boots, smoky eye makeup, and stacked silver jewelry. “We haven't seen each other since ‘The Grinch.' Twenty-five!” Momsen told reporters on the carpet, according to KNX News. Both Carrey and Momsen took part in the ceremony celebrating Soundgarden's induction. Carrey, who once hosted “Saturday Night Live” when the band was a musical guest in 1996, gave a heartfelt tribute to induct the rock icons. Momsen later joined Brandi Carlile, Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, and Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell on stage to perform “Rusty Cage” and “Black Hole Sun.” Her band, Pretty Reckless, had previously opened for Soundgarden on their final tour before Chris Cornell's passing in 2017. Before their reunion, Taylor Momsen looked back on her “Grinch” experience during a recent episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast. When asked whether Carrey's transformation into the Grinch ever frightened her, Momsen said it never did. “He was never scary to me,” she shared. As “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” celebrates its 25th anniversary, the beloved holiday classic will return to select theaters on December 12 and is also available to stream on Peacock and Prime Video.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The singer took viewers on a backstage tour of her daily talk show while running down the three LPs that are on constant rotation. By now you're surely aware that Kelly Clarkson can sing just about any song. Over the years, she's taken on songs from Ariana Grande, theWhite Stripes, Dolly Parton, Lady Gaga, Coldplay, Heart and the Pixies, as well as fellow American Idol winner Carrie Underwood, My Chemical Romance and many more. Pharrell's Adidas 'Jellyfish' Named Shoe of the Year at 2025 FNAAs Carlos Vives Announces 2026 North American Tour Al Sol: Here Are the Dates Vince Gill To Receive CMA Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award So we know Clarkson has eclectic musical tastes, but what inquiring minds really want to find out is what are the singer's top three albums of all time? She also noted that Americana legend Patty Griffin is her all-time favorite singer-songwriter and also shouted out Alanis Morissette, the Toadies and Aretha Franklin, among others. But when it come to her absolute favorites, there was no doubt, with Clarkson giving a jokey, no bones caveat: “I hope you like them. First up with Griffin's 2002 classic 1000 Kisses from the artist Clarkson loves so much that her fans have put together “secret” compilation albums of Griffin's music that have never been officially released. She just does everything so beautiful,” Clarkson said of the 61-year-old Maine native whose self-titled 2019 LP won the Grammy for best folk album. Clarkson recalled that former boyfriend musician Graham Colton introduced her to Griffin's music. I cannot thank him enough, she's changed my life,” Clarkson said. Number two on Kelly's list was U2‘s 1998 compilation, The Best Of 1980-1990. While there are other U2 albums she loves, Clarkson said this 14-song compilation featuring such indelible hits as “Pride (In the Name of Love),” “New Year's Day,” “With or Without You,” “I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,” “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” “Desire,” “Angel of Harlem” and others is the bomb. “Sometimes you're like, ‘is he talking about a woman? Is he just stoned and having a good time?' The third pick might be a surprise given Clarkson's pure pop roots, but holding up Hill's Miseducation, the singer said she had the CD — which she bought with her own money — cued up in her Walkman and did not leave her home except to go to school for days in order to listen to the album on repeat. “I was like, ‘this is the coolest thing,'” she recalled thinking. “It wasn't just the fact that she's an incredible vocalist. “This was a whole album story like something that will stand the test of time,” she said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charli XCX has shared the first of what will apparently be many original songs for Emerald Fennell's forthcoming Wuthering Heights movie. “House” is a collaboration with composer and Velvet Underground co-founder John Cale. The accompanying video was directed by Mitch Ryan, who also helmed Charli XCX's belated “Party 4 U” clip earlier this year. “A few years ago I watched Todd Haynes' documentary about The Velvet Underground,” Charli XCX wrote in a note posted to X last week. “As many of you know I'm a huge fan of the band and was really taken by the documentary. One thing that stuck with me was how John Cale described a key sonic requirement of The Velvet Underground. That any song had to be both ‘elegant and brutal. She continued, “When the summer ended I was still ruminating on John's words. We spoke about the idea of a poem. He recorded something and sent it to me. Since releasing her album Brat last year, Charli XCX has become involved in several other film projects. She also pulled double duty as host and musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live. John Cale shared his last studio album, Poptical Illusion, in 2024 as well. Revisit Quinn Moreland's review “Todd Haynes' Velvet Underground Documentary Breathes New Life Into a Beloved Band.” I got a call from Emerald Fennell last Christmas asking whether I would consider working on a song for her adaptation of Wuthering Heights. I read the script and immediately felt inspired so Finn Keane and I began working on not just one but many songs that we felt connected to the world she was creating. After being so in the depths of my previous album I was excited to escape into something entirely new, entirely opposite. A few years ago I watched Todd Haynes' documentary about The Velvet Underground. As many of you know I'm a huge fan of the band and was really taken by the documentary. One thing that stuck with me was how John Cale described a key sonic requirement of The Velvet Underground. That any song had to be both “elegant and brutal”. I wrote it down in my notes app and would pull it up from time to time and think about what he meant. When working on music for this film, “elegant and brutal” was a phrase I kept coming back to. One day whilst on tour in Austin, Finn and I went to the studio and wrote the bones for a song that would eventually become House. When the summer ended I was still ruminating on John's words. I sent him some songs and we started talking specifically about House. We spoke about the idea of a poem. He recorded something and sent it to me. I've been so excited to share it with you all, sitting quietly in anticipation.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>There will inevitably be someone who spends three or four times more than face value to attend Hayley Williams‘ upcoming solo tour. They'll be faced with the choice of either forking over whatever hiked up amount ticket resellers will charge on secondhand sites, or sacrifice their chance to hear “Good Ol' Days” and “Parachute” live. But Williams has put some preventative measures in place ahead of the tour presale to ensure that those who share this experience are in the minority, rather than part of a larger collective of fans being exploited by scalpers and bots. “My team and I are doing everything we can, and I am hopeful that the processes we've put into place will get as many tickets into the hands of my fans (at face value) as possible.” The sale will require two-factor authentication with fans verifying both their email address and phone number to gain access using a unique code. It isn't guaranteed that all verified fans will obtain tickets, but at least their competition in the queue will be each other, rather than bots and scalpers. “I want to get tickets into the hands of my fans, at a price that is as reasonable as I could get it,” Williams said. It's been tough (to say the least), and unfortunately, there's just no way to guarantee that zero tickets get scalped. If the presale sells out, those who weren't able to purchase one will have additional, if limited, chances to gain access. This restricted redistribution method prevents tickets from being resold through Ticketmaster, AXS, and other ticketing platforms for more than their original cost. As an additional precaution, ticket transfers will be disabled in eligible states (sorry New York and Chicago fans), limiting potential instances for tickets to appear on secondary sites like SeatGeek and StubHub.

No,” Grayson donned a full-skirted red tulle gown to kick off the legendary spy movies that would continue to break box office records for the next 75 years and counting. Jenner's Old Hollywood glamour, which featured a tiered strapless lace silhouette and black opera gloves, was an elegant tribute to the one who started it all. Her dress was a vintage Givenchy Haute Couture design, created by Julien Macdonald for the fall 2002 Couture collection. She also wore a vintage 1960s Bulgari diamond bracelet sourced from Joseph Saidian & Sons. The Jenner-Kardashian family has had some epic Givenchy archive moments lately. Just a few weeks ago, Kim stepped out in Paris to celebrate her 45th birthday in a goddess-inspired Givenchy Haute Couture look from 1997. Last May, Kendall Jenner attended the 2024 Met Gala in a never-before-worn Givenchy Haute Couture look from the French brand's 1999 collection. From Kylie's revealing swimwear-inspired look to Kendall's skin-tight satin gown, tributes to Bond girls through the ages were all over the headline-making birthday celebration this past weekend.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Subscribe for full access to The Hollywood Reporter The Oscar-nominated filmmaker gets frank about the success and controversy of her A24 rom-dramedy, including why she was eager to respond to those “broke man propaganda” claims — which swiftly went viral. She'd noticed a pattern in reactions to her New York-set rom-dramedy's love triangle that surprised her: Viewers were sympathizing more with Harry (Pedro Pascal), a wealthy financier courting matchmaker Lucy (Dakota Johnson), than John (Chris Evans), Lucy's old flame still living with roommates while struggling to make it as an actor. Kristen Stewart is "So Angry" About Lack of Progress for Female Filmmakers: "Our Business is in a State of Emergency" She wanted someone to let her know they had this perspective — because she wanted to respond, on the record. “The whole time I was like, ‘Just try me,'” she says now, grinning. In promoting the European release, she got her wish. One on-camera exchange between Song and a Refinery29 journalist, who asked Song to react to the cheeky claim that Materialists is “broke man propaganda,” went especially viral. “I find it very cruel to talk about John as a character who loves Lucy, and who is a beautiful character being played beautifully by Chris — to talk about him in such cruel terms as ‘broke boy' or ‘broke man. I'm speaking with Song three months out from that quote. Zohran Mamdani has just been elected mayor of her city, fueled by an inequality-focused campaign very relevant to the director and to her film's themes. And without prompting, Song brings up that “broke man propaganda” exchange for me in response to my question about her film's striking success, having grossed $108 million worldwide on a $20 million budget. It's meant to feel quite exposing of the way that we have let the marketplace of the world seep into our hearts.” Song, her actors, and her crew were in constant dialogue about their own romantic lives, prioritizing a level of vulnerable, authentic experience to inform Materialists' complex modern spirit. Among rising filmmakers, Song, previously best known as an acclaimed playwright, is in rare company. To follow that up with one of 2025's highest-grossing releases for original films, in a year where good box-office news has been increasingly hard to find? “There's been so much discussion right now in our world about how many things aren't working,” says producer Christine Vachon. While Song was heartened by the commercial response to Materialists, she says repeatedly in our conversation that “everything good comes with something bad” — another idea of the movie, and one she relates back to her own commercial success. “I don't like it when audience members know how the movie's doing,” she says. “The movie wasn't made so that it can make a certain rich group richer. “Every inch of our attention is being eaten up, is completely being colonized by corporate interests — everybody's just trying to sell you something,” Song says. “So anytime a movie is interested in just being itself, I do think that it can sneak into people's hearts.” In a fiery speech at the Academy Women's Luncheon on Tuesday, Kristen Stewart lambasted Hollywood's treatment of female filmmakers, echoing new studies showing that following an immediate post-#MeToo bump, the industry is again simply not backing movies helmed by women. “The backsliding from our brief moment of progress is statistically devastating,” Stewart said. “Such a pitiful number of films from the past year have been made by women.” The Ankler's Richard Rushfield recently pointed out that only three 2025 studio movies were directed by women, while only one specialty film helmed by a woman cracked the top 100 at the box office: Materialists. “That's always so confounding because there's a history of those kinds of movies doing very well if they're executed as well as this one.” Song felt that dynamic in the lead-up to Materialists. “There is this severe underestimation that is very infuriating, but on the other hand, it's so easy to surprise people,” she says. '” Song felt in sync with the same backers who steered her Past Lives success. We understood how to set it up for success,” says producer David Hinojosa. “Every domino was set up very carefully.” And Song felt steadfast support from A24, who gave the film a commercial summer release — unlike Past Lives, Materialists bypassed festivals — and didn't intervene with her vision. Sources close to A24 say that the movie has “redefined” its genre's expectations for the studio going forward, particularly given its massive showing overseas. It's a bright light for the studio in 2025 as other follow-ups from its homegrown filmmakers, like Ari Aster (Eddington) and Benny Safdie (The Smashing Machine), struggled to find traction relative to their budgets. Combined, their two movies have made less than half of Materialists' worldwide haul, and both cost more. Song hopes there's a lesson for the industry in seeing that her movie worked. When Song first tried breaking into film, she was taken aback by “how deep this systematic misogyny” ran in the industry, having come from the (relatively) egalitarian theater world. “You start making movies like the boys, for the film bros, or you have to just accept that there is a part of it where you're going to constantly be underestimated and undercut,” she says. So far, Song has consistently chosen the latter path. The audience met Materialists with a total open heart. What I feel confident in is that, as long as I'm showing up, the audience is always going to be open-hearted. That's the north star of my work moving forward.” Sign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day</p>

Last week that meant initiating a 10 percent reduction in flights at airports across the country. LAX Luxe: The New Delta One Lounge Is So Nice You'll Gladly Miss Your Flight Ex-BBC News CEO Responds to Trump Claims Over Edited Speech Controversy: "Not Institutionally Biased" “Last week, restrictions were announced on all aviation operations, including general aviation operations, at 40 U.S. airports,” NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen said in a statement. “Today, further restrictions were announced that will effectively prohibit business aviation operations at 12 of those airports, disproportionately impacting general aviation, an industry that creates more than a million jobs, generates $340 billion in economic impact and supports humanitarian flights every day.” Tha FAA said that exceptions could be made for “emergency, medical, law-enforcement, firefighting, military operations” or others, but don't bet on “I'm going to miss the start of principal photography” being one of them. Of course, private jet flyers may have other options: While JFK and Newark are off-limits, New York's LaGuardia is still available (despite the previously announced reduction in flights), as is Teterboro in New Jersey or Westchester airport north of the city. And while LAX will be PJ-free for a bit, Burbank, John Wayne airport and Long Beach airport can still handle the business jets, for now, though the NBAA warned its members that any of the other 40 FAA-identified airports could be restricted at any time.

Scott previously hinted at a potential reunion with West during a Circus Maximus show in October, telling fans, “We might have to do something special.” The surprise performance comes just days after West made headlines for a sit-down with Israeli Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, where he addressed past antisemitic comments and expressed a desire to make amends. “I feel really blessed to be able to sit here with you today and just take accountability,” Ye told Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto in a video posted on social media. “It's a big deal for me as a man to come and take accountability for all the things that I've said, and I really just appreciate you embracing me with open arms and allowing me to make amends.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>That's easy to say after an episode like “I Won. But I also mean it from a behind-the-scenes standpoint: The way this show is put together is unlike any other I can think of in recent memory. The increasingly strange digressions and knee-slapping non sequiturs The Chair Company rolls out this week obviously have analogues in Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin's previous half-hour show, Detroiters. I feel like you can also trace their lineage through 30 Rock, The Other Two, and any number of live-action Adult Swim series. Readymade sketch premises like “regional-theater actor wants to play Ebenezer Scrooge all year long” and “harrowing tale of survival undercut by survivor's fixation on not getting to choose the food that sustained him” blend seamlessly into an eventful road trip that leaves us with a new perspective on Mike. It's probably the best articulation of what Ron's going through, too: He wanted to solve a mystery, and doing so has turned out to be more mystifying and dangerous than he could've ever imagined. It's a riotous “be careful what you wish for” that sprinkles a little neon-and-synth-throb Michael Mann pastiche into what one observer on the Episodic Medium Discord recently described as The Chair Company's “‘stupidest version of a David Lynch film vibe.” And at its center, there's something kind of tender: Lonely Ron has made a new friend. About a third of the way into the episode, Mike warns Ron that they're headed to a “really weird town”—and if Mike thinks that, then it must be extremely weird. On this and so many other counts, “I Won. Alberto Isaac—previously seen as I Think You Should Leave's “king of dirty songs,” Don Bondarley—sets the tone as Oliver Probblo, who is not Red Ball CFO/Brucell Pharma board member Ken Tucker but rather an actor who posed for those photos as part of “life of the party” class. And so does the feeling that everyone Ron and Mike meet on their out-of-town jaunt has, as an improv teacher might call it, a strong “game”—that hook of a comedic scene or character that can be repeatedly revisited and heightened. Ron sets one up for the ponytailed guy with the dented forehead plate when he spots his elbow hovering dangerously close to some cheese soup. They get in some good gags, contribute to the feeling that Ron is in over his head, and then The Chair Company moves on. If nothing else, it is, as previously stated, an interesting approach to making narrative TV. Some of them advance the plot, like Oliver's anecdote about how he became “Ken Tucker” or Steve's scatological revenge plot and its overlap with Ron's Tecca visit. Others are just there for the laughs, like Douglas' tale of surviving his fridge ordeal by grabbing stuff from the freezer—the sort of comedic nonsense that Jim Downey was born to deliver with the straightest of faces. With its contrasting paint color and brighter lighting, it's like they've busted into a whole other dimension. If I may get highfalutin for a moment, there's this whole motif of crossing thresholds and barriers this week that really brings The Chair Company's “down the rabbit hole” nature to life. From that point forward, we can expect things to get curiouser and curiouser, and they do with every new room the camera wanders into—until Ron wakes up in the emergency room. (Want to push the Alice In Wonderland parallels even further? Get a load of the Cheshire Cat grin on Ron's fellow patient. Also: As Humpty Dumpty, Oliver is technically playing a Lewis Carroll character in the photo-hunt punchline to episode four's cliffhanger.) Why did he bring an extra shirt with him, and why did he previously spend some time in this Twilight Zone outside of Dayton? It turns out he has an estranged daughter who lives nearby. He and Ron are able to make it back home after their dark night of the soul—but, as the situation with Mike's daughter proves, there are some lines that, once you cross them, can never be uncrossed. It's a telling inverse to the band of idiots we meet in “I Won. Zoom In.” Despite a taste for meatballs made of “gray beef” and ramshackle living quarters where the neighbors are always screaming, Mike is no cartoon character. They are, perhaps to Ron's eventual dismay, kindred spirits. It helps that the scene is capped off by one final quasi-sketch flourish, with a Dickensian porn parody that would fit in right alongside the I Think You Should Leave holiday classic “The Night Scrooge Saved Christmas.” Zoom In,” I have to admit that at its chaotic peak, I was reminded of another half-hour HBO wrecking ball from a Saturday Night Live alumnus: Barry's “Ronny/Lily.” I recall that episode getting a lot of flack at the time for breaking the reality of what had previously been a fairly grounded show; The Chair Company's own drift into Wackyland was well underway before “I Won.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After being introduced by “Uncle Iggy” Pop, Jack White shared some rare public remarks from his former drummer, Meg White, who hasn't been seen publicly in more than a decade. “She also helped me write all this,” he continued. We used to walk around and animals, for some reason, would stare at us. They would stop and stare at us for some reason. She just wanted me to tell you that.” And the tree looked so glorious and beautiful, but it was just an oak tree,” White read. “And these two so loved the world that they brought forth a parade float—one they built in their garage behind the oak tree with their own bare hands. And the boy looked at this giant peppermint on wheels and felt pride, pride that it was produced in the Motor City, just like in the big factories, but it was just in their garage. And, like the Little Rascals, they said, ‘Let's put on a show. “And they paraded this float through the Cass Corridor, standing atop the peppermint pulled by white horses, or maybe it was a red Econoline van. Many of the blocks they traveled were empty, but some had people. In 2023, as part of the internet's unending debate over Meg's drumming, Jack posted a poem calling out the “demons, cowards, and vampires out for blood” who don't know anything about drumming. That year, Meg declined a request for an interview from Elle, saying she had said “no” to so many requests that it wouldn't be fair to say “yes” now. Other 2025 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees included Outkast, Cyndi Lauper, Soundgarden, Bad Company, Chubby Checker, and Joe Cocker for the performance category; Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon, recipients of the Musical Influence Award; Thom Bell, Nicky Hopkins, and Carol Kaye, recipients of the Musical Excellence Award; and Lenny Waronker, recipient of the Ahmet Ertegun Award.
