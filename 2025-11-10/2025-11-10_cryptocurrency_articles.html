                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Chinese blockchain industry could almost double in size by 2027 to be worth $1.4 billion. Wu Hai, CEO of the China Internet Investment Fund, made that prediction on Sunday, arguing that the integration with artificial intelligence projects will help the Middle Kingdom's blockchain sector surge by 71% from its 2024 $816 million high. “Our investment drives are helping the blockchain industry solidify its basic software and hardware foundations,” the CIIF chief told China's Cailian Press. Wu said that blockchain investors were following a two-pronged strategy. The first involves building key infrastructure and application platforms. AI-powered technical support service platforms are also set to adopt blockchain technology. Wu said that Chinese blockchain investment, financing, and industrial development have already yielded “significant results in integration and application.” And Wu noted that many of China's blockchain companies were founded between 2017 and 2019, several years before their overseas competitors. Wu added that last year saw investment flow into Chinese blockchain-powered services, financial companies, and agricultural projects. But he indicated that over 90% of investors still back early-stage projects. Two years later, top Beijing policymakers included a comprehensive blockchain strategy in the country's 14th Five-Year Plan. However, China's crypto purges have forced most businesses to focus on private blockchain network-powered solutions. But in recent years, telecom providers have launched blockchain-powered 5G projects. China's judiciary uses blockchain for a fast-growing range of purposes, such as storing and verifying electronic evidence.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Strategy Inc acquired 487 Bitcoin between Nov. 3 and Nov. 9, according to a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 10. The company did not sell any common stock during this period. The purchase brings Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 641,692 BTC. The company has spent $47.54 billion acquiring its entire position, reflecting an average purchase price of $74,079 per Bitcoin across all acquisitions. Company chairman Michael Saylor announced the acquisition on X, confirming Strategy achieved a BTC Yield of 26.1% year-to-date in 2025. BTC Yield measures the percentage change in Bitcoin-per-share, calculated by dividing total BTC held by diluted shares outstanding. At Bitcoin's closing price of $105,697.30 on Nov. 10, Strategy's holdings are worth approximately $67.83 billion. This represents an unrealized gain of roughly $20.29 billion compared to the aggregate purchase price. The company recently expanded its capital raising activities with Strategy's euro-denominated STRE stock offering, targeting European professional investors. The 487 BTC purchase falls within Strategy's typical acquisition range for late 2025. Strategy maintains substantial remaining capacity across its ATM program. This approach has drawn both support and criticism from analysts like Peter Schiff, who has questioned the company's Bitcoin-dependent business model.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>With Bitcoin (BTC) facing heavy selling pressure, miners are being squeezed by shrinking margins, and many are now turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to open new revenue streams. However, the virtual mining game PepeNode (PEPENODE) is taking a completely different path, making mining not only lighter on resources but also more fun and rewarding. Beyond mining its native PEPENODE token, players can also stack top meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) – and with more assets on the way, the game's shaping up to be a meme-coin-generating powerhouse. With BTC recently hovering near $100,000, miners in high-cost regions are starting to sweat as profit margins thin out. A prime example is CoreWeave, which began as an Ethereum mining firm in 2017. When Ethereum scrapped mining in 2022, CoreWeave repurposed its massive GPU fleet for AI and HPC workloads, turning it into one of the fastest-growing private tech firms in the U.S. Following its lead, other major miners, such as CleanSpark and Marathon Digital, have joined the shift. CleanSpark recently announced plans for AI-focused data centers, while Marathon reported $123M in Q3 2025 profits, largely driven by a strategic expansion into AI computing. Even players who can afford massive hardware setups are now looking elsewhere, trying to ensure their costly rigs don't go to waste as profitability thins out. Instead of a battle over capital, it's a game of skill and strategy, where success depends not on how much you can spend, but on how smart you play. PepeNode's virtual mining game drops all the talk about hardware and power bills and instead drops players straight into an empty digital server room, where it's up to them to build their virtual mining empire. The same PEPENODE tokens can also be spent to upgrade your virtual server room and improve equipment, transforming your setup into a more efficient, high-yield mining machine – all without requiring physical rigs or incurring additional electricity costs. It's like expanding your lot in FarmVille to grow more crops, except this time, you're harvesting real crypto. To take things a step further, PepeNode introduces leaderboards, ranking players based on the strength of their mining setups. In short, PepeNode transforms mining into a game of skill, strategy, and passive rewards – arguably the most fun way yet to earn top meme coins in crypto. Crypto influencers like Crypto Tech Gaming and CryptoTV have been buzzing about the PEPENODE token, even calling it a potential 100x play as the project's presale heats up. Their excitement stems from PepeNode's powerful tokenomics, where 70% of all tokens used for node purchases or facility upgrades are permanently burned. Since the game hasn't launched yet, investors currently have a rare opportunity to buy PEPENODE at presale prices before the burn mechanics and exchange activity kick in to push prices upward. For anyone looking to secure an early position, timing couldn't be more crucial. PepeNode is listed on Best Wallet's highly accurate project screening tool, Upcoming Tokens, allowing you to buy, track, and claim in-app. Established in 2013, 99Bitcoin's team members have been crypto experts since Bitcoin's Early days.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Why SWIFT and Ripple Are Really Competing for Institutional Legitimacy, Not Technology | Credit: Veronica Cestari /CCN The main issue between Ripple and SWIFT lies in a simple question: how global money moves. Ripple enables real-time settlements through blockchain-based technology that transfers value between digital wallets across its RippleNet network. SWIFT, by contrast, coordinates cross-border payments through its global messaging infrastructure used  by more than 11,000 financial institutions and in more than 200 countries and territories. It does not move money directly but sends secure payment instructions through applications that connect participating banks' internal systems. Their competition is about which one financial institution can rely on to support global finance. Because SWIFT and Ripple provide fundamentally different services, the question almost answers itself. Both systems are scaling rapidly, but their growth underscores different strengths: SWIFT's reach and compliance depth contrast with Ripple's agility and expanding use of blockchain for liquidity management. This divergence sets the stage for technical convergence under shared standards like ISO 20022. SWIFT evolves within the established banking framework, while Ripple continues to innovate outside it. It creates a structured language for financial data, allowing legacy institutions and new technologies to communicate seamlessly. This shift is making interoperability between SWIFT and Ripple increasingly practical. SWIFT's migration to ISO 20022 and Ripple's early compliance with the standard establish a foundation where both can operate within the same ecosystem while maintaining their distinct functions. In short, ISO 20022 acts as the bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based networks. It enables data interoperability, reduces friction in cross-border transactions, and lays the groundwork for a future where SWIFT and Ripple can coexist within a unified payment infrastructure. Ripple's distributed-ledger technology enables quick processing, but institutions weigh other factors before adopting a system at scale. While Ripple challenges traditional inefficiencies, SWIFT's institutional network still defines trust in global finance. The competition between SWIFT and Ripple is unlikely to produce a single winner. Instead, the future of global payments is heading toward a segmented model where both systems serve different markets and transaction types. In this hybrid future, SWIFT maintains its role as the backbone of institutional finance, while Ripple grows as a complementary network that addresses liquidity constraints and near-instant payments. The dividing line will not be technological capability but rather institutional purpose with both systems coexisting in a global architecture that prioritizes interoperability. The rivalry between SWIFT and Ripple has become a driver of innovation rather than conflict. SWIFT maintains its position as the backbone of institutional finance, trusted for security, governance, and global reliability. Ripple, meanwhile, advances a more agile model powered by distributed-ledger technology, removing the inefficiencies of pre-funded cross-border accounts. The adoption of ISO 20022 unites both systems under a single data framework, allowing greater efficiency and communication across networks. Asia-Pacific leads Ripple's ODL usage, accounting for over half of its transaction volume in 2025. A hybrid system where SWIFT handles high-value regulated transfers and Ripple powers faster, lower-value transactions. ODL removes the need for pre-funded Nostro/Vostro accounts by settling payments instantly across currencies.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cryptocurrency education has transitioned from really niche, specialty online forums to big conferences and scholarly seminars. Experts now devote entire sessions to explaining how market dynamics, human behavior and technology influence value. Understanding crypto prices requires translating technical data into clear, relatable insights that empower your learners to grasp the movement of this rapidly growing asset class. Their decentralized nature, global 7/24 trade cycle and dynamic regulation ensure that price variations remain more volatile than those of other markets. With existing Binance data of “over 9,510 cryptocurrencies with a total market cap of $4,215.22,” there is a wide asset scope, increasing volatility due to the uneven liquidity distribution. It's largely concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with tiny altcoins subject to huge changes from even small transactions. Educators in the classroom routinely indicate that volatility, although difficult, is not necessarily bad. It is an expression of innovation, investor attitudes and the rate at which new technologies are being implemented internationally. For students, knowing that volatility is just an expression of the growth phase of their market is an important point that breeds patience and a long-view mindset, not alarm. While the cryptocurrency market is significant, it remains smaller than regular currency or stock markets. When describing this phenomenon, speakers will refer to comparisons with real-world markets. This helps students and audiences understand that liquidity gaps contribute to sharp movements. They reveal that such movements result from a dynamic financial system and not signals of volatility. Most notably, converting tech data into ideas that the masses can understand. For instance, when presenters discuss 58.5% Bitcoin dominance, they don't read off of numbers, rather, they contextualize it as an expression of faith in the oldest and most established cryptocurrency versus newer, higher-risk substitutes. By using charts, pictures and comparisons, presenters make the technical aspects of blockchain less mysterious. Human psychology is responsible for influencing digital asset behavior in an essential role. When you give educational talks, this often emerges as a focal point, the way excitement, fear and speculation can drive sudden market movements. Price spikes, for instance, may not necessarily result from technological innovation or institutional uptake. At times, they're ignited by narratives on social media, calls from thought leaders, or viral community trends. On the other hand, sudden drops result from regulatory pronouncements or global confusion. This interplay of value and emotion itself makes for a feedback loop.Educators encourage audiences to see that while crypto represents cutting-edge technology, it is still subject to human behavior. By revealing the emotional motivators behind data, presenters provide audiences with interpretative tools to gauge volatility more thoughtfully and less frantically. Educators show students interactive charts, so they see how Bitcoin's price, for instance, reacts to changes in market sentiment or liquidity. When put in visuals, the lightning-fast changes that characterize crypto trading start to make more sense. Students get to actually see the market's rhythm; its surges, corrections and stabilization. Such visualization not only facilitates more understanding but also introduces clarity to an otherwise darkly criticized market for its obscurity. It reinforces that beneath the noise, markets move in accordance with recognizable patterns and principles. That's why effective presenters craft stories from the numbers, converting raw data into commonplace understanding. For example, instead of just demonstrating that Ethereum is worth $4,488.98 USD, speakers could place it in Ethereum's larger context; from experimental smart contract platform to decentralized finance bedrock. When put in context like that, numbers make sense and audiences connect market value to technological advancements. Economists condense blockchain economics to its essence by emphasizing fundamentals of scarcity, utility and network participation. With these three rules, much of the value in digital assets is explained. When audiences understand that Bitcoin's supply is capped or that Ethereum's demand rises as more applications are built on its network, they begin to see why value fluctuates. Riskier assets like altcoins fell the most, with Ethereum falling over 13% and Solana by 20%. BNB fell only by ~3% while BTC slipped ~6%.” Such data-driven context reinforces to your audience the message that crypto behaves as a real, responsive market, not a speculative bubble detached from fundamentals. They ask questions, poll their audience and employ simulations to demonstrate key principles. They induce critical thinking and fill in the gap that separates technical competence from popular understanding. Live participation also humanizes a subject that may otherwise be abstract. By turning lectures into discussions, educators create a space where curiosity and skepticism can coexist. Presentations once filled with early adopters now see policymakers, designers and entrepreneurs who seek to know how blockchain might transform industries. Such audience diversification highlights crypto's widening application beyond the domain of money. Speakers discuss the role policies play in forming liquidity, innovation and investor sentiment without touching on political reviews. “The CFTC's push to evaluate tokenized collateral and stablecoins for derivatives markets highlights a clear regulatory shift toward embracing blockchain-based financial infrastructure. This move could unlock 24/7 liquidity, lower systemic risk and pave the way for broader digital asset adoption.” Educators use such statements to demonstrate that the conversation around crypto is maturing. Volatility is an indication of active feedback, experimenting and constant adjusting. By introducing such facts in learning settings, professionals make market volatility less mystifying. They affirm that learning and not speculation, is the path to survival in this age of digital frontier. Our mission is to provide the most accurate transcripts of videos and audios online.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bank of England has partly softened proposals for ownership restrictions on UK stablecoins as it pushes forwards with new rules for the cryptocurrency. On Monday, the central bank said it is planning to temporarily impose caps on holdings of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged directly to traditional assets such as real currency. The plans indicate that individuals will be limited to owning up to £20,000 in UK stablecoins that are considered systemically important. It said most businesses would have a limit of up to £10 million. Last month, Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK should “reap the benefits” of stablecoins as part of the country's financial system and said it would be “wrong” to be against them as a matter of principle. In a new consultation document, the Bank said it is “preparing for a future where new forms of digital money may be widely used for payments alongside existing ones, offering valuable choice for the public”. It said its proposed limits would include allowing stablecoin issuers to have as much as 60% of the backing assets in short-term government debt. Sarah Breeden, deputy governor for Financial Stability at the Bank, said: “Our objective remains to support innovation and build trust in this emerging form of money. “We've listened carefully to feedback and amended our proposals for achieving this, including on how stablecoin issuers interact with the Bank of England. “These proposals are fit for a future where stablecoins play a meaningful role in payments, giving the industry the clarity it needs to plan with confidence.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are following in Bitcoin's footsteps, creating new opportunities for investors. The US Senate has voted to advance a bill that would reopen the government and keep it afloat at least until the end of January amid a record-breaking government shutdown. Seven Senate Democrats and one independent joined Republicans to advance the bill through a 60-40 procedural vote on Sunday. This is expected to pave the way for full-year funding for an essential food aid program that currently serves over 42 million Americans, as well as for rehiring federal workers laid off during the government shutdown, according to the media platform Baker City Herald. Riskier assets, including crypto, are showing signs of recovery following Sunday's vote, pointing to improving sentiment. Bitcoin is trading marginally above $106,000 at the time of writing on Monday, supported by improving sentiment in the larger crypto market. A sustained uptrend above the $106,000 short-term support may encourage investors to increase their risk exposure, possibly triggering a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the same daily chart. The RSI is at 44 after a bullish crossover on the daily chart, which indicates that bullish momentum is rising. Investors will likely increase their risk exposure if the MACD indicator confirms a buy signal on the same daily chart. Meanwhile, retail demand for Ethereum has stabilized, with futures Open Interest (OI) rising to $41 billion on Monday, up from $39 billion the previous day. Such stability is required to improve investor confidence, following a prolonged risk-off sentiment since the October 10 deleveraging event. Furthermore, a steady increase in the OI would indicate that investors are ready to return and increase their risk exposure. Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trading volumes are picking up across major exchanges as investors position for the week ahead, supported by positive ETF flow data and stable macro sentiment. However, altcoin performance remains uneven, with selective gains in Solana SOLUSDT and Avalanche AVAXUSDT while several mid-caps continue to lag. The ETH/BTC ratio rose slightly, hinting at possible rotation into smart-contract-based assets. Altcoins Trade Mixed as SOL, DOGE Rise Moderately While XRP Thrives The altcoin market displayed mixed sentiment, with the Solana SOLUSDT price advancing 6.6% to around $167, supported by rising DeFi volumes and active wallet growth. XRP and Hyperliquid surged over 7%, while the BNB price just reclaimed levels above $1000. Despite strong showings from select tokens, market breadth remains limited—a sign that capital rotation is still concentrated in the large-cap space. However, the future open interest continues to decline, indicating a drop in the momentum as traders are now closing their positions instead of opening new ones. While broader crypto market health shows tentative improvement, traders are watching whether rising volumes translate into a sustained rally. For now, the tone remains cautiously bullish—driven by BTC stability and selective altcoin strength rather than a full-scale breakout. Analysts expect volatility to remain contained ahead of midweek macro data and potential ETF inflow updates. Broader participation from mid-caps could signal a stronger recovery trend heading into the second half of November. Higher trading volumes, stable macro conditions, and steady ETF flows are supporting Bitcoin's rebound from last week's consolidation. Ethereum is seeing stronger on-chain activity, higher staking inflows, and mild rotation from BTC into smart-contract assets. If BTC holds above $105,000 and ETH stays over $3,600, short-term upside is likely, though volatility may stay contained until midweek data arrives.
