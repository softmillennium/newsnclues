                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ripple Labs has become one of the world's largest cryptocurrency companies, but executives aren't stopping there, CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC. Over the past year, the firm has ramped up efforts to bridge the Web3 world and an industry that has long been viewed as its foil — traditional finance. In an interview with CNBC's "Crypto World" at the Ripple Swell 2025 conference in New York, Garlinghouse said his firm aims to offer a wide range of traditional financial services built on blockchain infrastructure, capitalizing on growing institutional adoption of digital assets. "I want to see Ripple invest in [the] future and get ahead of where that market's going," Garlinghouse said Tuesday. "The assets we have been buying have been on the traditional finance side, so we can bring crypto-enabled solutions to that traditional financial world." Ripple has been on a nearly $4 billion acquisition spree in hopes of building a financial services powerhouse, in 2025 alone buying prime brokerage Hidden Road for nearly $1.3 billion in April and software firm GTreasury for more than $1 billion this fall. Last week, it launched Ripple Prime, a brokerage that will offer U.S.-based institutions access to over-the-counter spot market trading across several tokens, raised $500 million in fresh funding and lifted its market value to $40 billion. Ripple's bid to deepen its push into traditional finance comes as institutional demand for digital assets grows the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission dialing back digital assets regulations this year under President Donald Trump, a self-styled crypto champion. Bank of America and Citigroup have begun actively exploring stablecoins, with Citi recently unveiling plans to launch a crypto custody service for clients in 2026. JPMorgan in June said it plans to introduce a stablecoin-like "deposit token" on Coinbase's public blockchain Base. Beyond dollar-pegged tokens, institutional investors have poured billions of dollars into spot Bitcoin ETFs since their U.S. debut in January 2024. " The United States used to lean out on crypto, and now we're leaning in, and I think people underestimate how big a shift that is," and the likely impact on the entire crypto market, Garlinghouse said. Such partnerships could prove a boon to XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain aimed to service fast and low-cost transactions. XRP has traded sideways for much of 2025, even as ether and bitcoin sailed to record highs of about $3,900 and $126,000, respectively. But while high-profile partnerships might push up the price of XRP, dealmaking with traditional institutions is likely to remain difficult due to stalled efforts to create guardrails for cryptocurrency companies and holders in the U.S., Garlinghouse said. But with the U.S. government shutdown set to enter its sixth week, efforts to establish legislative guidelines for the industry have come to a halt. "Until we have that [legal go-ahead], it's gonna be hard," Garlinghouse said. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Warren Buffett laid out a plan to "step up" the pace of giving away his $149 billion estate to his children's foundations, while still allowing for a short period that lets Berkshire Hathaway shareholders gain confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel. Buffett, in a Thanksgiving letter that will become an annual tradition, said he needs to accelerate the disbursement of his Berkshire stock to his three children's foundations because of their own advanced ages and that by doing so it will "improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them." "I would like to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed," wrote Buffett, referring to longtime Berkshire vice chairman and his cherished business partner, Charlie Munger, who died two years ago. "That level of confidence shouldn't take long. Buffett owns about $149 billion worth of Berkshire based on shares held at the end of the second quarter, making him far and away the largest shareholder. He said 1,800 of those Berkshire A shares were converted into 2.7 million B shares and given Monday to four family foundations: The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. This donation is worth more than $1.3 billion. The note marks Buffett's first major communication since announcing plans to step down as CEO, signaling the close of a six-decade run that made him a household name and one of the most successful investors in history. "As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet.'... sort of," Buffett wrote in the letter. Abel, currently vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will take over writing Berkshire's annual shareholder letters — a tradition that Buffett began in 1965 and that has become essential reading across Wall Street — while Buffett said he will continue this Thanksgiving message. In one of the most personal passages of the letter, Buffett gave a rare update on his health. "To my surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people," he wrote. Since taking control of Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has transformed a struggling textile mill into a $1 trillion conglomerate spanning insurance, railroads, utilities and consumer brands. He devoted part of his letter to reaffirming Berkshire's durability, saying it is designed to withstand nearly any economic environment. "Berkshire has less chance of a devastating disaster than any business I know," he said. Berkshire held a record $381.6 billion in cash at the end of September, underscoring its unmatched balance sheet and cautious investing approach. It has also been selling equities for 12 straight quarters, reflecting Buffett's caution in a richly valued market. "In aggregate, Berkshire's businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll," he wrote. Berkshire's stock has risen roughly 10% in 2025, outpacing many defensive names but lagging the S&P 500 amid a tech-driven rally. "Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management," Buffett said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday called for House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., so that they can vote as soon as possible on a Senate deal that would end the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. President Donald Trump would then have to sign it into law. Johnson indicated to reporters that he expected votes in the House to occur this week, but he did not state a specific day. He later told the Republican House conference during a call that he would like the vote to occur on Wednesday, although that is contingent on the Senate voting for it completely by then, according to a person familiar with the situation. Johnson said, "There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us." Johnson has kept the House out of session since it passed a continuing resolution in September to fund the government through mid-November. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R.-S.D., speaking on the Senate flood Monday morning, urged his colleagues to vote as soon as Monday to send the deal to the House. "Let's not pointlessly drag this bill out," Thune said. "I am grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro-bill or anti-bill, not to stand in the way of being able to deliver the coming relief quickly," Thune said. "The American people have suffered for long enough." Any one senator can delay voting on the bill for days with procedural hurdles. But a vote can be held quickly if the entire Senate agrees that it should happen. The Senate deal, forged over the weekend, drew support from seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with Democrats, which, combined with 52 Republican senators' votes, was enough to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass. The deal does not include what had been the key demand for Democrats: an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of December. But the agreement, for the first time since the shutdown began, includes a guarantee by Republicans of a vote in December on a bill chosen by Democrats to extend those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use to reduce the cost of health insurance plans purchased on ACA marketplaces. CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdown, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve. The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps. Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay "at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates." — CNBC's Emily Wilkins contributed to this story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET It's no secret that buying a home is expensive. That review process has typically excluded crypto assets. But for the roughly 15% of Americans who invest in digital assets, that could soon change. In June, a directive issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ordered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals to consider crypto as an asset in single-family home risk assessments.The director of the agency, Bill Pulte, wrote in a post on X that he ordered the two enterprises to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said the process would look similar to how lenders account for stocks and other investments. "A lender would look at the assets that a potential borrower has, and before, they might have only considered stocks and bonds and those traditional kinds of investments, but now they would consider those less traditional cryptocurrency investments. And it might be a bit difficult for them to assess the riskiness, but I think they're used to assessing the riskiness," Fairweather said. "There are stocks that are even more volatile and risky than some long-standing cryptocurrencies so I think for the lender, it would be pretty easy for them to adapt their framework to incorporate crypto into that." The directive from the federal lending agency also faced criticism from those who argue backing loans with crypto could add new stress to the home lending market. In July, a group of Democratic senators sent a letter to Pulte, taking issue with his "risky proposals" to allow unconverted crypto assets in mortgage loan underwriting. The senators requested information regarding his directive to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and they expressed concern that crypto is more volatile than traditional assets. Watch the video above to learn why the Trump Administration wants to allow crypto-backed mortgages, and what it could mean for the housing market. We want to hear from you.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Flight cancellations were again piling up on Monday as air traffic controller shortages, worsened by the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown, snarled air travel coast to coast and President Donald Trump threatened to dock air traffic controllers' pay if they are absent from work. On Monday, 1,432 of the 25,733 scheduled flights across the country were canceled, around 5.5% "and growing," according to aviation data firm Cirium. Last week, the Trump administration ordered airlines to cut flights at 40 major U.S. airports starting with 4% reductions last Friday and ramping up to 10% by this coming Friday, Nov. 14. "All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!! !," Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who didn't take any time off during the shutdown. He said those who don't immediately return to work would be "docked." The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, their union, didn't immediately respond to Trump's comments on Monday. Disruptions over the weekend totaled 18,576 flights delayed and 4,519 canceled, according to FlightAware. Cancellations spilled over from regional, short-haul jets — which the largest U.S. airlines rely on for around half of domestic flights — to mainline flying. United Airlines and Delta Air Lines were each offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up flights, according to company messages seen by CNBC. Such extra pay is common during storms or other disruptions. In comparison, on Friday morning, as Trump administration-mandated flight cuts took effect, cancellations ranked 72nd since the start of last year. The disruptions that upended the travel plans for hundreds of thousands of travelers forced them to look for alternative transportation. Car rental company Hertz last week reported an increase in one-way demand. There's also been increased demand for private jet flights in recent days, according to the CEO of charter and fractional ownership company Flexjet. Though the Trump administration order didn't initially require private aviation to cut in the same way as commercial airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday began limiting those flights at a dozen U.S. airports. Air traffic controllers missed their second paycheck of the shutdown on Monday, though they are still required to work. "Now, they must focus on child care instead of traffic flows. Food for their families instead of runway separation," Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a news conference on Monday. The Senate made progress overnight on a deal that could end the shutdown, but it has not yet approved a funding bill. Daniels said it isn't yet clear how long it would take for controllers to receive back pay for their work. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a call to overturn its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The justices, without comment, turned away an appeal from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky court clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the high court's 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thomas was among four dissenting justices in 2015. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are the other dissenters who are on the court today. Roberts has been silent on the subject since he wrote a dissenting opinion in the case. Alito has continued to criticize the decision, but he said recently he was not advocating that it be overturned. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was not on the court in 2015, has said that there are times when the court should correct mistakes and overturn decisions, as it did in the 2022 case that ended a constitutional right to abortion. But Barrett has suggested recently that same-sex marriage might be in a different category than abortion because people have relied on the decision when they married and had children. Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson praised the justices' decision not to intervene. "The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences," Robinson said in a statement. Davis drew national attention to eastern Kentucky's Rowan County when she turned away same-sex couples, saying her faith prevented her from complying with the high court ruling. She defied court orders to issue the licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court in September 2015. The Kentucky legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses. Davis lost a reelection bid in 2018.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>BBC News said on Monday the broadcaster had received a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump threatening legal action over the edit of a documentary broadcast a week before the U.S. presidential election. The BBC has acknowledged the Trump speech edit gave a misleading impression and should have been handled more carefully. The documentary broadcast last year had spliced together two parts of a Trump speech so he appeared to be encouraging the Capitol Hill riot of January 2021. Samir Shah, the chairman of the publicly-funded broadcaster, said in an interview with BBC News that it was "considering" how to respond to Trump's communication. When prompted about whether Trump would be suing the BBC, Shah said: "I do not know that yet, but he's a litigious fellow, so we should be prepared for all outcomes." Got a confidential news tip?

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three former Meta and Google silicon executives on Monday announced they've raised a total of $100 million to build technology they say will reduce cloud companies' spend on data center buildouts. Called Majestic Labs, the startup's co-founders are Ofer Shacham, Sha Rabii and Masumi Reynders, all of whom spent years working together leading silicon products at Meta and Google. Majestic develops its entire chip system, much like Nvidia, but each of the startup's servers may replace up to 10 of today's leading racks, they said. The company closed its $71 million Series A funding round in September, led by Bow Wave Capital. Majestic's funding announcement comes as major tech companies raise their capital expenditures, primarily for data center infrastructure. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures in October, and they collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year. While the majority of large language models and AI workloads have relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, more companies are entering the fold. Google last week announced Ironwood, its latest tensor processing unit, or TPUs, which artificial intelligence startup Anthropic plans to use for its Claude model. However, memory capacity remains a challenge for companies that have large amounts of data to process, which the Majestic co-founders said they hope to address. "Nvidia makes excellent GPUs and has driven incredible AI innovation," Shacham, Majestic's CEO, told CNBC. "We're not trying to replace GPUs across the board — we're solving for memory-intensive AI workloads where the fixed compute-to-memory ratio becomes a constraint" Majestic is going after hyperscalers and large companies that run AI models, including those from the financial and pharmaceutical industries, the co-founders said. The technology underpinning the company includes patent-pending architectures that allow Majestic to collapse multiple racks worth of conventional equipment and memory into a single server. Majestic claims that will allow for a smaller footprint and requires less power and cooling, helping the company's clients reduce their data center costs. Prototypes of Majestic's box servers will be available for some customers in 2027, and the startup has already begun discussing pre-orders, the co-founders said. The company has fewer than 50 employees — half of which are based in Tel Aviv, Israel, while the rest are based in Los Altos, California. Majestic said it plans to grow each location and seek additional funding in the coming year. "Every large company needs AI, and that was a good time for me to say 'How about we go and do that?'" Reynders spent 15 years at Google, where she rose to director of product management and silicon. Rabii, Majestic's president, earned his doctorate from Stanford University, and in 2011, he sold his last chip design company, Arda Technologies, to Google, where he rose to senior director of engineering. Under Rabii, Google launched its video chip Argos, which is used in YouTube's data centers. Chip Genesis's technology was used broadly across many products including the AI accelerators in Google's Pixel smartphones. At Google, Shacham rose to head of silicon design and implementation for consumer hardware. Shacham rose to vice president and head of FAST. When Meta laid off employees from Reality Labs in 2023, Shacham had to conduct the cuts, he said. At that point, Meta was trying to conserve cash, he said. "We've been friends and colleagues for a long time, so this notion of working together and doing something exciting has always been in the periphery," Reynders said. As Majestic eyes growth and hiring in 2026, the co-founders said they're tapping into their collective of rolodex of the more than 1,500 employees they've worked with at prior companies, including Meta and Google. "There's that trust they already have with us," Rabii said of the former colleagues.

"Doesn't surprise me one bit that Alex Karp and his 'ontology' @PalantirTech cannot crack a simple 13F," Burry wrote. "A fundamental principle of any rigorous ontological/epistemological model — whether philosophical or in data science — is recognizing when your information set is insufficient for valid conclusions," he added. Doesn't surprise me one bit that Alex Karp and his “ontology” @PalantirTech cannot crack a simple 13F.A fundamental principle of any rigorous ontological/epistemological model - whether philosophical or in data science – is recognizing when your information set is insufficient… pic.twitter.com/863pcAJSvG Burry's Scion Asset Management revealed last Monday, in a quarterly portfolio disclosure known as a 13F, that at the end of September, it owned bearish put options on 5 million Palantir shares with a notional value of $912 million. But it didn't indicate whether Burry held those short positions through October or early November. Karp said it was "super triggering" when short sellers "pick on" Palantir, as it's doing "noble work" by enriching retail investors and supporting military personnel. The boss of the AI-powered data analysis and integration company suggested Burry may have lost money betting against Palantir, and had gone public with his short wager to push down its stock and recoup some of his losses. The software company projected its full-year revenues would be up about 54% this year at around $4.4 billion. Its stock has surged roughly 28-fold since the start of 2023, from around $6 per share to $178. That has catapulted the company to a $422 billion market capitalization as of Friday's close, making it more valuable than Costco, Bank of America, or AMD. Scion and Palantir didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider. Burry shot to fame after his massive, contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in author Michael Lewis' book "The Big Short." He was portrayed by actor Christian Bale in the movie adaptation. I am not 5'6," he posted the day after Scion's filing and Palantir's earnings, along with a photo of himself standing next to Bale, who's around six feet tall. Burry's cryptic message seemed to mean that he's not short — physically or in financial terms. Burry has also updated a tease in his X bio, suggesting he'll shed light on his thinking on November 25 instead of in December. The Scion boss returned to X after a two-year hiatus on October 30 with a coded warning that he believes the AI boom is a bubble, but the only "winning move" is to bet neither on nor against it. He followed that up by posting "Star Wars" memes, charts, and book excerpts supporting the idea that the AI boom is an echo of the dot-com bubble, growth could stall, and surging capital investments could lead to an infrastructure glut.</p>

By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman privately texted Shivon Zilis, one of Elon Musk's closest confidantes, to ask whether he should post a complimentary message about Musk on X — days before he did just that, according to a newly filed court document. The message, disclosed in Musk's case against Altman and OpenAI and filed in federal court last Friday, shows Altman reaching out to Zilis on February 9, 2023, seeking advice on whether to publicly praise Musk. "BTW, good idea for me to tweet something nice about Elon? Have been meaning to do this after he DMd about not being in the photo from the first day of OpenAI. Less than a week later, Altman seemed to enact this, posting on X: "society underestimates how much it owes elon for raising the collective ambition level at a time when optimism for the future was receding." It suggests that Altman sought to smooth things over by publicly acknowledging Musk's early role in the company. Zilis, who reportedly has four children with Musk, has long served as one of Musk's most trusted lieutenants, working as director of operations and special projects at Neuralink. This message was among dozens of emails, depositions, and text threads submitted by Musk's lawyers to support his argument that OpenAI abandoned its founding mission of developing artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity. Court documents show that years before Altman's conciliatory post on X, he and Musk had already clashed over OpenAI's direction. In one exchange filed as Exhibit 41, Musk said: "Guys, I've had enough. Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit. That back-and-forth — Altman placating, Musk erupting — would become a pattern. Six years later, his text to Zilis reads almost like a reprise of those earlier emails: another private effort to soothe a public feud. Altman's February 13 post on X was widely interpreted as an olive branch toward Musk, who by then had begun publicly criticizing OpenAI's commercial turn. Musk resigned from OpenAI's board in 2018, five years later launching xAI, his own AI company, and repeatedly accusing OpenAI of betraying its nonprofit roots. The latest filings — including those from the Zilis message — offer a rare glimpse into how two of Silicon Valley's most influential figures navigated, and at times massaged, their uneasy relationship in the high-stakes world of artificial intelligence.</p>

The market is loving it after a rough week, and stock futures are up. But first, let's take a trip down to Old San Juan. Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Oh, and did I mention major tax breaks on capital gains earned in the market? I'm talking about Puerto Rico, which has emerged as a destination for Gen Z and millennial day traders looking to minimize their tax bills while stacking market winnings. BI's Jennifer Sor dug into the growing trend, which has only gained steam in recent years. An attorney that Jennifer spoke to — who says he counsels hundreds of investors a year about possible moves to Puerto Rico — estimates that the trader influx doubled in 2024. One investor who moved to Puerto Rico in 2018 — and now uses his sprawling network of lawyers and realtors to "onboard" other traders — says activity in 2025 has already surpassed last year's, and has tripled since he first came. Jennifer also spoke to a 26-year-old crypto trader who moved to Puerto Rico during the pandemic once he recognized the tax-break potential. He says the town where he lives, Palmas Del Mar, is "mellow" and that the lifestyle is like "being on a permanent vacation." But it's not necessarily all sunshine and relaxation for new arrivals. Surely the bustling nightlife scene makes up for it? One source characterized the local scene as cliquish, while another said locals can be standoffish, bordering on hostile. For some, however, the social difficulties are a welcome silver lining. Fewer distractions make it easier to focus on the task at hand: racking up the market gains that they moved to Puerto Rico to protect in the first place. You can bunker down and focus on trading, or — as one of Jennifer's interview subjects recommends — you can lean into speaking Spanish, network, and explore the island beyond the San Juan city center. You definitely won't find me in Puerto Rico slinging stocks and crypto any time soon. I like my same-day Amazon Prime delivery too much. But it's a compelling option that clearly works for many. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is fresh off its worst weekly sell-off since the beginning of April, when President Trump's infamous Liberation Day tariffs rocked markets. One of the main smoking guns was Palantir, which tanked despite universally strong earnings. The inflection point for the week can be traced back to comments from Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who warned of a healthy pullback in the next year or so that will allow traders to reassess. What are your most burning questions about a possible AI bubble? Write in and let us know at firsttrade@businessinsider.com. Persistently high US inflation hangs over the above chart like a cloud. While not plotted, it's the driving force behind Bank of America's overall point: President Trump's approval rating (light blue line) has taken a hit in part because consumer prices have stayed so high. This stands in contrast to the S&P 500 (dark blue line), which — despite sharp selling last week — is still within shouting distance of record highs. I knew that, after we overloaded the First Trade index with high-flying mega-cap tech stocks, we would get nailed eventually. Such a strategy rides high when the market is going up, but gets hit doubly hard on the way down — and that's exactly what transpired. The presence of Tesla and Nvidia was rough enough. The reason was simple: We were banking on a strong earnings report, and a commensurate gain in the stock. After all, Palantir shares were up 165% year-to-date through the prior week. Little did we know that the company would crush earnings — and that it wouldn't matter at all. Investors instead elected to rebel against what they see as overextended valuations, and the entire market felt the effects. Should we ditch Palantir, or stick to our guns?

The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, to be frank, has been a rather lackluster way to own the market in recent years. During the last half-decade, it's up 63% while the tech-concentrated cap-weighted index you hear about more often is up 93%. But with the tech sector and mega-cap stocks selling off this past week, it could finally be the equal-weighted index's time to shine. Investors this week balked at lofty tech stock valuations and spending on AI — the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is down 5.6% since November 3. "At any point in time you could have a very big drawdown in these stocks, and that would not be unusual because these are volatile stocks," Hank Smith, the director & head of investment strategy at The Haverford Trust Company, said about AI-focused mega-cap stocks. "I don't think a lot of investors understand the risk they're taking buying the S&P 500 index when you consider 10 names in a 500 stock index represent 40% plus of the index," he continued. "Three names represent 25 give or take% of the S&P 500: Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. In addition to protection from over-concentration, there are reasons to believe the equal-weighted index could outperform the cap-weighted index going forward. For one, while the equal-weighted index's recent performance has been relatively poor, it has actually outpaced the cap-weighted index by 1.05% on an average annual basis from 1989-2023, according to Invesco. Invesco pointed out earlier this year that relative valuations between the two indexes are about as far apart as they have been in the last 20 years. Finally, Smith argues that broadening economic growth — which has been largely supported by AI capital expenditures — would also benefit the equal-weighted index. "If we're correct on our economic outlook, stronger growth would support that broadening out," Smith said. "And that would suggest that maybe over the next 6 to 9 months, you might see better relative performance from the equal-weighted S&P 500."</p>

In addition to protection from over-concentration, there are reasons to believe the equal-weighted index could outperform the cap-weighted index going forward. For one, while the equal-weighted index's recent performance has been relatively poor, it has actually outpaced the cap-weighted index by 1.05% on an average annual basis from 1989-2023, according to Invesco. Invesco pointed out earlier this year that relative valuations between the two indexes are about as far apart as they have been in the last 20 years. Finally, Smith argues that broadening economic growth — which has been largely supported by AI capital expenditures — would also benefit the equal-weighted index. "If we're correct on our economic outlook, stronger growth would support that broadening out," Smith said. "And that would suggest that maybe over the next 6 to 9 months, you might see better relative performance from the equal-weighted S&P 500."</p>

Having this skill means knowing how to invest wisely and maintain a strong savings habit, but it also means you understand how to spend money with intention. That's what my family did when we decided to hire a house manager. We also wanted to devote more time to our financial planning business, which my wife and I run together, rather than managing our household. Initially, growing the business I founded so that it didn't rely solely on me to operate was the best way to reclaim my time. We now have a larger team, and I've established strict working hours limits. I also have a greater degree of freedom and flexibility. I eat breakfast and dinner with my family every day because I'm actually home to do that, and I take random Monday afternoons off to take my daughter to events or the playground. We grew up in working-class families; my mother was a nurse for 40 years, and my wife's father was a firefighter for 30. The idea of having "household help" was extremely foreign to us. However, we know that many people who "do it all" aren't very happy. Reports of burnout and depression are at extreme highs. Mothers, in particular, are often extremely overwhelmed and overloaded, still shouldering the majority of the housework, even in dual-income families. Our own numbers — both in terms of where our hours went versus where we wanted them to go, and how much it would cost to change that — didn't lie. They indicated we needed help around the house. We used that list to create the following job description: We're seeking a part-time house manager/family assistant with light nanny responsibilities for our family of three. Schedule is flexible and can be built around your preferences. Our ideal candidate is willing to assist with light housework, including laundry and meal preparation, and would be open to helping with our two cats as well. We thought it would be better to find someone familiar in our community than a stranger from somewhere like Care.com. We received eight applications and hired our current house manager for $28 per hour in August. She's a stay-at-home mom whose own kids reached elementary school, so she had more time in her day and genuinely loved the work we needed help doing. The only thing is I try to stay out of the kitchen when she's doing meal prep, which can be a slight inconvenience. Could we save more money by doing everything ourselves? Perhaps we'd have a little more cash on hand, but we'd be extremely depleted in terms of time and energy. Of course, but my life would also be a lot smaller and emptier. Time, peace, energy, and health are all measures of wealth, alongside money. Arguably, those things are all more valuable than the dollars on my balance sheet. Have you hired a house manager and want to share your story?</p>

Hotel operator Marriott International signed a licensing agreement with short-term rental company Sonder in August 2024. On Sunday, Marriott announced that the agreement had been terminated due to "Sonder's default." The change canceled guests' current reservations and stopped future bookings. Marriott guests who had booked accommodations at Sonder properties say they were blindsided by the announcement. Tim Schaefer, a blogger from New York, told Business Insider he had booked two separate Sonder apartments in New York City for a total of 10 days. But he received cancellation emails from Sonder and Marriott about an hour before his check-in on Sunday. "We have a high loyalty status — Platinum Elite — with them. David Klingbeil, an NYU course instructor who studies luxury and marketing, said that he was halfway through his two-week stay at Sonder Flatiron in New York when he received an email on Sunday afternoon telling him he had to vacate the hotel by 8 a.m. on Monday. Then I saw the articles and posts on X," Klingbeil told Business Insider. Klingbeil said he had to book another hotel at a much higher price. It added that customers with future reservations would receive an email about the "potential to rebook at another Marriott Bonvoy property." Sonder's stock is down about 87% in the past year, to a $6.8 million market cap. The company had 9,400 live units in its portfolio as of March, according to its earnings report for the first quarter of 2025. Were you affected by the termination of Marriott-Sonder's licensing agreement?</p>

That's what it takes to launch a brand new hotel, Marriott International's chief commercial officer, John Toomey, told Business Insider. "The most difficult job for a hotelier is opening a hotel from zero, where you don't have one guest in your hotel," Toomey said. Toomey joined Marriott International in 1996 and has been with the hospitality giant for nearly three decades. In his current role, he oversees over 650 hotels run by Marriott in the Asia Pacific, excluding China. It takes everybody coming together to make that hotel a success." He added that customer loyalty programs such as Marriott Bonvoy have made it easier for hoteliers to expand their presence. As of 2024, Marriott Bonvoy had nearly 228 million members worldwide. "Now that we have such a deep loyalty program, we are in a better position to open hotels than when I was opening hotels 25 years ago," Toomey said. "I opened the first four hotels we had in India. Opening those was probably a lot more challenging than the nearly 160 hotels we have there now," he added. In June, Kwon Ping Ho, the founder and executive chair of the luxury hotel chain Banyan Group, told Business Insider that "the worst business to be in is hospitality." It is so time and people-intensive, and it is so vulnerable to event risk," Ho said. Ho said running a hotel chain effectively is all about building a working culture that prioritizes the customer in everything it does. People are not very forgiving about screw-ups," Ho said. Business leaders across sectors have also talked about how difficult it is to launch a new venture. Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, told Khan Academy founder Sal Khan in a 2013 interview that creating companies is not as fun as people think. "I think you have to feel quite compelled to do it, and have a fairly high pain threshold," he added. Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of the chip giant Nvidia, said in an October 2023 interview on the "Acquired" podcast that "nobody in their right mind" would start a company from scratch. "Building a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be," Huang said.</p>
