                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten delivered a powerful statement on Monday at the Nitto ATP Finals, where they kick-started their title bid with a commanding victory. The second seeds shook off Christian Harrison and Evan King 6-4, 6-4 upon return to Inalpi Arena for the second straight year. Having fallen to the Americans in the Roland Garros quarter-finals earlier this year, Heliovaara and Patten responded with a 64-minute clinic in Turin, where they dropped just five of 45 service points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “We didn't do much wrong in our service games, we faced one break point in the whole match and came up with a great serve there,” said Heliovaara. “It was so fun to be on court… We were ourselves and enjoyed the moment. I'm just super happy to be here and playing well.” Heliovaara and Patten, who are riding a five-match winning streak after triumphing in Paris, still have an outside chance of claiming ATP Year-End No. They are trying to make ground on British stars Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, who fell to Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori in their respective opening match. “I never thought I would have one win on the Tour, so to have 100 is something incredibly special,” said Patten, who recorded his 100th tour-level win.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A first-ever opening round-robin win may go a long way to helping Alcaraz secure the year-end No. The Nitto ATP Finals represent a "real big and important week" for Carlos Alcaraz with both a first year-end title and a second year-end No. According to the ATP, he must reach the final with at least one round-robin win or sweep his round-robin matches. "I think doing good in this tournament, winning matches here, it comes together with ending the year as No. 1," Alcaraz said ahead of his third year-end championships appearance.

Alcaraz edged a first set where both men had leads in more than an hour, on the way to extending his head-to-head record against de Minaur to 5-0. Alcaraz first led 4-1, 40-0 in less than 30 minutes, but ultimately won four straight points from 5-3 down in the eventual tiebreak to quell de Minaur's challenge.After the two players traded breaks of serve to start set two, four straight games won by Alcaraz gave him a lead he never relinquished. I'm really happy about it," Alcaraz said afterwards. So just really happy to stay there playing good shots, good points, and getting the win in two sets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 was in a joking mood after falling short in another big final, this time at the WTA Finals.ByTENNIS.comPublished Nov 09, 2025 copy_link Aryna Sabalenka famously shot from the hip in the press room after tense three-set losses in the finals of the Australian Open and at Roland Garros this year, saying that her emotions got the better of her and prevented her from finding her best tennis in the clutch moments.But another high-profile loss—a 6-4, 7-6(0) defeated to Elena Rybakina on Saturday—for the title at the year-end WTA Finals saw the world No. 1 singing a different tune, crediting the 2022 Wimbledon champion for outplaying her when it mattered.🖥️📲REPLAY: Elena Rybakina def. Aryna Sabalenka, 2025 WTA Finals F"After a little time, I feel actually great," she told reporters after the match. But I leave this tournament being proud of myself and the things that we've been able to achieve.”"I guess by doing this mistake over and over again, next time I show up in the big matches I'm in a better control," she continued. "But yeah, I was maybe a little bit emotional today, but it didn't really aIect my game. No, I think she played incredible. And, yeah, basically, that's it. "While wanting it too much may not have contributed to the last of Sabalenka's high-profile defeats this season, she still couldn't hold it all in. The tears flowed as the WTA's consensus top-ranked player told her team that they had "so many things to be proud of" this season, leading the four-time Grand Slam champion to joke that an impending offseason vacation in the Maldives was the time to recalibrate mentally in more ways than one. 1 singing a different tune, crediting the 2022 Wimbledon champion for outplaying her when it mattered.🖥️📲REPLAY: Elena Rybakina def.

That was a tough season. How do you mentally regroup after such a tough loss? And what do you think was the key moment where you thought, 'OK, this is not my game today. 'ARYNA SABALENKA: Well, you never think like that on the court. Every match you play, sometimes things are not going your way, and you still have your hopes that, OK, maybe I'll find my game. And you just keep digging, keep trying, keep fighting and most of the times you're able to turn around things. But sometimes players are better on the day than you.And how to recover after such a tough loss? The bad thing this season, I lost most of the biggest finals I made. So, I guess I'll just sit back in Maldives having my probably tequila, and think back and try to analyze my maybe behavior, my emotions and think that actually it's been pretty good so far. I just need to get little bit better with myself a little bit more, and hopefully next season I'll improve.Though she only won one of the sport's five biggest prizes this season, Sabalenka nonetheless finished the year with most match wins (63), the most ranking points (10,870) and a single-season record for prize money won with $15,008,519.
