            As all eyes turned to the Louvre after the shocking theft of the French crown jewels, one especially stylish figure on the museum grounds caught the internet's attention: a sharply dressed young man, wearing a three-piece suit and a fedora tilted just so.
    


            As speculation swirled about the identity of the so-called “French detective” pictured at the scene, 15-year-old Pedro Elias Garzon Delvaux, who featured in the photo, was enjoying his new double life.
    


            The teenager met CNN at his home in Rambouillet, about 30 miles southwest of the French capital, to discuss the social media furor.
    


            Though he may cite fictional Belgian detective Hercule Poirot as a style icon, Pedro confirmed that he was not involved in any investigations and that he had not been able to locate any of the €88 million ($102m) stolen crown jewels.
    


            He learned about the viral photo when a friend showed him a TikTok video with the now-famous image. The video had nearly 6 million views.
    


            “In the moment, it was, like, very funny. And we went back to the Louvre to see the reaction of the people,” he told CNN. “People maybe recognized me, but I'm not sure.”
    


            Pedro had planned to spend October 19, the day of the Louvre heist, at the famed museum with his mother and grandfather. When the trio arrived to find the museum closed, the stylish highschooler was unknowingly photographed by an AP journalist documenting the crime scene.
    


            What many online commentators had deemed a detective outfit is simply Pedro's everyday look.
    


            “For me, it's important to dress classic. And I like to dress like that because I love history, especially the 20th century,” he said.
    


            The young history buff has been embracing 40s-era fashion for almost a year now, he said. His obsession with the style began when he dressed as Jean Moulin, a hero of the French resistance during World War II, for carnival, a festive period celebrated in many countries ahead of Lent. Amid the parades and costumed festival-goers, he found a liking for the new look.
    


            “He realized the effect he had on other people,” his mother, Félicité Garzon Delvaux, explained. “Everyone looked impressed. Okay, something is happening there.”
    


            Since then, he has adopted the vintage style everywhere, even at school.
    


Nuclear codes, voicemail hacks and businesses going bust. These are some of the biggest password blunders



            Unlike many of his classmates, Pedro does not own sweatpants. He is not, however, above reaching for the cargo pant on occasion.
    


            Good taste has long been a topic of discussion for the Garzon Delvaux family.
    


            Pedro's mother, who brought him to the Louvre on that eventful day, grew up in Chartres, about 50 miles southwest of Paris, “in a museum” with an art curator for a mother and a prolific French storyteller for a father.
    


            In their home in Rambouillet, paintings, antiques and knick-knacks line walls and shelves in a manner reminiscent of an exhibition.
    


            “The beauty of things is always very important in our family,” Félicité affirmed.
    


            Due to her husband's job as a diplomat, the family moved often, living in England, Spain, Bangladesh, and eastern France before returning to Rambouillet four years ago.
    


            Some of the Pedro's most striking pieces have been gathered from around the world.
    


Museum heists have changed. Why the Louvre robbery is a worrying escalation



            His vintage Soviet watch, for example, was bought in an antique store in Calcutta and repaired with parts that he sourced from Bulgaria with his father.
    


            His first tailored suit was commissioned at the age of 12 during a year spent in Bangladesh.
    


            Asked what he wants to do in the future, Pedro said he was interested in pursuing diplomacy like his father and paternal grandfather, or perhaps joining the military.
    


            The young man conceded that the uniforms may have something to do with the matter.
    


            But despite his carefully cultivated appearances, Pedro remains an enthusiastic young man of his own generation.
    


            When asked if his friends at school appreciate his style, he was quick to respond.  “Yeah, I think I have a lot of aura.”

            A car explosion killed at least 10 people near a metro station at the landmark Red Fort monument in Delhi, India, on Monday.



            More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters.
    


            While the cause of the blast is not yet known, airports, railway stations, government buildings and heritage sites across the country have been put on high alert, according to the Central Industrial Security Force.
    


            The Red Fort, known in India as the Lal Qila, is a 17th-century Mughal-era fort in the old city and visited by tourists throughout the year.
    


            Before the explosion, a “slow-moving” vehicle “came to a stop” near a red light around 6:42 p.m. local time (5:42 a.m. ET), Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.
    


            “An explosion occurred in that vehicle. The passengers in the vehicle and people in surrounding vehicles were impacted,” Golcha said. At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws were set on fire, Reuters reported, citing Delhi's deputy fire chief.
    


            Emergency crews then arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze – after receiving a call at 6:55 p.m. local time (5:55 a.m. ET), Sumit Kumar, a Delhi fire services official, told CNN. Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital.
    


            Authorities will search surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the blast, according to Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, who has visited the site of the attack.
    


            “We are investigating the explosion from every angle,” Golcha, the Delhi police commissioner, added. “The situation is being regularly monitored.”
    


            Footage of the aftermath showed streams of motorcyclists and passersby rushing toward the site of the blast, where huge, orange flames rose into the pitch-black sky. Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood.
    


            “We heard a big sound. Our windows shook,” one resident who did not give a name told Indian broadcaster NDTV, according to Reuters.
    


            Another resident saw the flames from his house. “There was a loud explosion. I live nearby,” Rajdhar Pandey told CNN affiliate CNN News-18.
    


            India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the relatives of those killed. “May the injured recover at the earliest,” he said in a post on X.
    


            Defense Minister Rajnath Singh described the explosion as “painful and disturbing.”
    


            “Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured,” he said on X.

            Intense lake-effect snow is creating dangerous travel conditions in the Great Lakes and it's all being fueled by a record cold snap sending the eastern half of the United States into a brief bout of winter.
    


            The snow developed overnight in Chicagoland along with thunder and strong winds. Forecasts for the city on Sunday called for potential historic November snow totals over 10 inches, but the heaviest bands of snow have so far spared the downtown area from those kinds of totals.
    


            Lake-effect snow totals often swing wildly from location to location depending on where heavier bands develop because of how narrow they are.
    


            That's what we've seen this morning near Lake Michigan. Up to a foot of snow has fallen more than 50 miles south of Chicago, and totals north of the city from far northeast Illinois into southeast Wisconsin have topped 10 inches. Dangerous travel conditions from snow and strong winds were reported earlier this morning along Interstate 57 south of Chicago in Kankakee and northern Iroquois counties in Illinois, the National Weather Service said.



            The snow threat stretches beyond Chicago across the Great Lakes. It's being spawned by a rush of Arctic air that's unusually cold for November pushing south and east and threatening dozens of low temperature records as far south as Florida over the next couple of days.
    


            Over a foot of snow has fallen in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. In northwest Indiana, up to 10 inches of snow has fallen in spots, with more accumulation expected the rest of the day. Several inches of snow will pileup in the eastern Great Lakes through Tuesday, particularly in the snow belts of northeast Ohio, northwest Pennsylvania and southwest New York.
    


            This brutal winter-like setup in the Midwest is being driven by the same Arctic air mass that's crashing across the eastern two-thirds of the country. This isn't just a “cold front.” This is a full-scale polar plunge.
    


            Some southeastern cities could face some of their coldest early-November temperatures in decades on Tuesday morning.
    


            Daily record lows will be threatened parts of Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, the Carolinas, southeast Louisiana and even Florida. That includes places like Birmingham and Huntsville in Alabama, Baton Rouge in Louisiana, Savannah in Georgia and Tampa and Fort Myers in Florida.
    


            Jacksonville, Florida, is predicted to hit 30 degrees Tuesday morning, marking the earliest it's been that cold in fall since 1976. That would also be the case in Savannah, Georgia, if the low drops to 28 degrees.
    


            Tuesday daytime highs in Florida could be some of the coldest on record for the date. Melbourne, Florida, could see its earliest day below 60 degrees since records began there more than 85 years ago.
    


            Cold weather advisories for wind chills in the 20s or lower 30s have been issued in Florida for Monday night into Tuesday morning as far south as Naples. Freeze warnings cover parts of several other states in the Southeast.
    


            Washington, DC, and New York City are also likely to log their coldest morning of the stretch on Tuesday. DC could wake up near 30 degrees﻿. New York only reaches a high in the mid-40s Tuesday afternoon. Morning wind chills in both cities could sit in the lower to mid-20s.
    


            There will be snow in other regions as well. Lake-effect snow continues downwind of the Great Lakes. The west slopes of the central Appalachians could pick up several inches Monday. Higher elevations from West Virginia through the border of North Carolina and Tennessee can expect accumulating snow.
    


            The good news: The cold snap won't stick around long. Temperatures across the central US rebound quickly on Tuesday, and most of the East warms up again on Wednesday.

FBI Director Kash Patel made an unannounced visit to China last week to discuss “fentanyl and law enforcement issues,” Reuters reported on Monday, citing two people familiar with the trip.

According to Reuters, Patel arrived in Beijing on Friday and stayed for about a day. He reportedly held talks with Chinese officials on Saturday. Neither side has officially confirmed the talks.

The report comes after US President Donald Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during a regional summit in South Korea last month. Following the meeting, Trump lifted tariffs on imports from China that his administration had linked to fentanyl. The two powers are engaged in what the US president has called a trade war.

US officials have accused Beijing of enabling the flow of fentanyl and precursor chemicals used to manufacture the synthetic opioid blamed for tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually in America.

China has called the allegations politically motivated, pointing to its domestic crackdown on illegal chemical producers.

According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), most fentanyl entering the US comes from Mexico, where cartels synthesize it using imported precursors. Drug seizure statistics indicate that the majority of fentanyl comes through official ports of entry along the southern border rather than through clandestine smuggling routes.

The Trump administration has also used allegations of narcoterrorism to justify maritime airstrikes strikes on civilian vessels that the president claimed were involved in fentanyl smuggling from Venezuela.

While the administration has linked Venezuela to cocaine transit routes, DEA records indicate that its role in the global fentanyl trade is negligible.

NEW YORK, November 10. /TASS/. The outcome of a three-year-long investigation into the act of sabotage against the Nord Stream gas pipelines threatens to splinter Europe's support for Ukraine, the country that German detectives hold responsible, the Wall Street Journal writes, citing sources.

According to the newspaper, ""any legal hearing appears certain to further strain relations between Ukraine and Germany, Kiev's largest financial backer and the supplier of some of its most sought-after military hardware, especially air defense systems.""

The sources point out that German police, prosecutors and other people familiar with the case developed ""a clear picture of how an elite Ukrainian military unit carried out the attacks under the direct supervision of Ukraine's then-supreme commander, General Valery Zaluzhny.""

By tracking boat rental companies, phones and license plates, investigators ""laid the groundwork for German authorities to issue arrest warrants for three soldiers from the special Ukrainian military unit and four veteran deep-sea divers,"" the paper points out, citing people familiar with the case. According to them, ""the saboteurs' goal was to cut both Russia's oil revenues and its economic ties with Germany.""

According to earlier reports, German investigators identified all saboteurs behind the explosions that damaged the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 pipelines. They issued arrest warrants for six Ukrainian nationals, while the seventh individual died in December 2024 during military operations in eastern Ukraine. According to the German prosecution authorities, the sabotage group comprised a skipper, a coordinator, an explosives expert, and four divers, who arrived at the intended crime scene in the Baltic Sea aboard the yacht Andromeda from the German city of Rostock.

Italian judges are expected to make a decision by December whether to extradite Ukrainian national Sergey Kuznetsov, who is believed to be the commander of the sabotage unit, to Germany. ""German police have already prepared a dedicated aircraft"" to pick him up in Italy and bring him to Hamburg for trial, the Wall Street Journal notes.

Berlin also sought the extradition of another suspect, detained in Poland. However, a Warsaw court refused to extradite the man, also a Ukrainian citizen, to Germany.

Unprecedented damage to three strings of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 offshore gas pipelines was recorded on September 26, 2022. The Russian Prosecutor General's Office opened a case into an act of international terrorism.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

STOCKHOLM, November 10. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky should end attacks on Russian regions and resume dialogue with Moscow, said Armando Mema, a member of the Finnish national-conservative Freedom Alliance party.

""Zelensky should stop attacks inside Russian territories; all Ukraine is under heavy attacks after the Moscow Region and others were attacked with drones. It makes no sense strategically for him to do so,"" he wrote on the X social media platform.

""A return to dialogue and diplomacy is the best thing he could do,"" Mema added.

The Russian Defense Ministry reported on November 7 that in response to terrorist attacks on civilian facilities, the Russian Armed Forces had carried out seven combined strikes on military sites in Ukraine using high-precision weapons and drones in the previous week. On November 8, Ukraine once again reported major damage to energy infrastructure, and imposed emergency blackouts. The Ekonomicheskaya Pravda media outlet reported, citing sources in the country's political circles, that the power generating company Centrenergo's report that all state-run thermal power plants had stopped operating sent Vladimir Zelensky's office ""really hysterical.""","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Decision to advance bill that would reopen government has sparked furor from party and base; House speaker says he will call lawmakers back as soon as Senate holds final vote

Senate Democrats who defected in shutdown vote: ‘This was the only deal'

The eight Democratic and Independent senators who broke ranks with the party to advance a bill that would end the government shutdown – the longest in US history – have defended their decisions amid furor from their party and base.

“What happened tonight is not the closing of a chapter. It's the opening of an opportunity. What the chapter does close is the damaging shutdown that is only getting worse, that is only going to impact more and more people,” said Angus King, the Independent lawmaker from Maine who caucuses with Democrats.

Maggie Hassan, the Democratic senator from New Hampshire, who was part of the bipartisan talks to strike a deal with Republicans, addressed the fact that the revised bill forgoes the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats made a central part of their negotiations.

“Congress has one month to engage in serious, bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act's expiring tax cuts for health insurance,” Hassan wrote in a statement, referring to the vote that GOP lawmakers promised Democrats. “My Democratic colleagues and I have been ready to work on this for months. With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table – or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way.”

Meanwhile, senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who was part of the small faction of Democrats in the upper chamber who voted in favor of the original House-passed funding bill on several occasions, said that “it should've never come to this,” referring to the ongoing 40-day shutdown. ““I'm sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven't been paid in weeks,” he added.

An important note. None of the Democratic senators who voted yes on Sunday's procedural motion are up for re-election in 2026. Two of them, Dick Durbin of Illinois, and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, are retiring next year, while the earliest that any of the others would face a challenge would be in 2028.

Christine Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's daughter, has announced that she is running for a California state senate seat, ending speculation that she might run for the seat long held by her mother in the House.

“I'm running to represent you, San Francisco, in Sacramento,” she said in an announcement video posted on X. “Fighting for consumer rights, women's rights, gun violence survivors, immigrants and our most vulnerable communities against the threat we face.”

Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she would not seek re-election. Her daughter is an attorney and Democratic party organizer, and is running for the seat currently held by state senator Scott Wiener, who is one of those running for Pelosi's congressional seat.

In a development that is sure to breathe new life into the saga of the Epstein files, a spokesman for Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said he plans to swear in newly elected Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva as soon as the chamber returns to session, likely later this week.

Grijalva was elected in a September special election to a seat representing southern Arizona that her late father, Raúl Grijalva, held for more than two decades.

At the time, Johnson was keeping the House recessed in an effort to pressure Democrats to pass a government funding bill through the Senate, and said he would swear her in once he called the chamber back into session – which he would only do once Democrats renewed government funding.

They have now done so, and Johnson said he will call the House back as soon as the Senate votes on final passage of the bill.

Grijalva is expected to be the 218th signature on a petition that will force a vote in the House on a bill to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who died six years ago while facing sex trafficking charges.

Epstein was a one-time associate of Donald Trump, and while campaigning last year, the president and his allies flirted with conspiracies that Epstein was at the center of a conspiracy to procure minors for abuse by global elites.

An uproar began in July when the justice department announced that it would not reveal further details about the Epstein case, leading to a push by congressional Democrats to release files related to his prosecution, which they believe will shed more light on his ties. While Trump has sought to release some documents related to the case, he opposes release of the files, calling them a “Democrat hoax”.

The expected House vote on the matter is expected to once again shine a light on the issue, which had faded into the background amid the larger struggle in Congress over funding the government.

Per an earlier post, House speaker Mike Johnson this morning urged representatives to begin traveling back to Washington to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

He told reporters on Capitol Hill that once the Senate passed its version of the bill to end the shutdown, he would issue a formal 36-hour notice for House members to return to Washington “so that we can vote as soon as possible” to pass the amended bill and get it to Trump's desk.

“There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” Johnson said. (A reminder that Johnson could have kept the House in session during the shutdown, but he chose not to since 19 September to pressure Democrats into reopening the government).

Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures after a campaign against the broadcaster that reached fever pitch over criticism that its flagship documentary programme in 2024 used a misleading edit of a Trump speech.

Lawyers for Trump said that the BBC must retract the Panorama documentary by Friday or face a lawsuit for “no less” than $1bn (£760m), according to US media outlets who cited the letter. The BBC has confirmed it had received a letter and said it will respond in due course.

The resignations of the BBC director general, Tim Davie, and its News CEO, Deborah Turness, came after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster's coverage. The report criticised BBC coverage on transgender issues, Israel's war in Gaza and an edit of a Trump speech from January 6 during the Capitol Hill insurrection.

“Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.

The leaked BBC report said the current affairs Panorama documentary had “completely misled” viewers by splicing two parts of Trump's speech together. The Panorama edit cut together quotes from sections of the speech delivered up to an hour apart, combining a line about walking to the Capitol with the instruction to “fight like hell”.

The BBC chair, Samir Shah, later on Monday apologised for the editing of the Trump speech, calling it an “error of judgment”.

Trump in fact gave conflicting advice that day to supporters, who he had called on to gather in the capital as part of his efforts to discredit his election loss based on false claims of widespread fraud. The US president was later impeached for “incitement of insurrection” related to the storming of the Capitol by rioters, but he was acquitted by the Senate after Republicans rallied around him.

In a speech on the Senate floor, majority leader John Thune called for the quick passage of legislation to reopen the government, which cleared a key hurdle in the chamber yesterday evening. He said:

I'm grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro bill or anti bill, not to stand in the way of our being able to deliver the coming relief quickly.

The American people have suffered for long enough. Let's not pointlessly drag this bill out.

The compromise bill that emerged yesterday funds the government through January, but does not include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats had demanded. It was able to proceed thanks to the support of eight members of the Democratic caucus, all of whom are moderates or set to soon retire.

The rest of the Democratic caucus opposes the measure, and any one lawmaker could stop Thune from moving to vote on final passage of the bill as soon as today.

Over in the House, speaker Mike Johnson has said that as soon as the bill passes, he will give the chamber's lawmakers 36 hours' notice to return to Washington DC. He has kept the chamber out of session since 19 September to pressure Democrats into reopening the government.

As Democratic senators who broke ranks from their party continue to face heat from most of their colleagues, senator Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire, defended her decision in an interview with CNN today. “We need to get the government open because we have millions of Americans who are suffering, whether it's because they're not getting their food benefits or because travelers can't get their flights,” she said.

The lawmaker, who is retiring in 2026, said she was confident that Republicans were “willing to come to the table” when it comes to a vote on the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are notably missing from the bill Shaheen, and others, agreed to advance.

“We've heard the same thing from the White House. So, now we'll see. We'll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance,” she added.

Syria's president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has arrived at the White House according to the press pool, who noted that he was due to enter through the West Wing, but ended up not getting eyes on his motorcade.

The Syrian leader's meeting with Donald Trump has also started, per the pool reporters. A reminder, that the administration has began undoing US sanctions on Syria in May, ahead of Trump's first meeting with al-Sharaa in Riyadh. They're expected to discuss this further today.

Today, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, announced the removal of a “black box” of warnings across hormone replacement therapy (HRT) – often estrogen and progesterone products that are prescribed to those contending with low levels of these hormones while experiencing menopause.

“Millions of women were told to fear the very therapy that could have given them strength, peace and dignity through one of life's most difficult transitions,” Kennedy said. “We're challenging outdated thinking and recommitting to evidence based medicine that empowers rather than restricts when prescribed response started early, hormone replacement therapy transforms the lives of women.”

The HHS noted ahead of today's announcement that the use of HRT “plummeted in the early 2000s” when the Food and Drug Administration applied “boxed warnings following a Women's Health Initiative study that found a statistically non-significant increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis”.

Per our earlier post about the $2,000 payments that Donald Trump said he would dole out to Americans as the country collects tariff revenue, he's added that “all money left over” will be “used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT” in a post on Truth Social.

This, along with the payments themselves, defies Congress's control of government spending. While Trump can suggest how this money is spent, urging lawmakers to pass legislation that confers money to various groups and programs, federal law prohibits him from unilaterally deciding where funds go.

The US supreme court announced on Monday it will hear a high stakes case about whether states can accept mail-in ballots that arrive after election day, even if they are filled out and mailed before then.

The case, Watson v Republican National Committee, involves a challenge to a Mississippi law that allows ballots to count if they are received within 5 business days of election day. Sixteen states, as well as Washington DC, Guam, and Puerto Rico, allow a mail-in ballot from a domestic voter to count if it arrives in a certain timeframe after election day but is postmarked by the election. The policy is designed to ensure that voters who put their ballot in the mail ahead of election day are not punished if the mail is slow.

A federal judge in Mississippi upheld the state's law, but it was reversed by the US court of appeals for the 5th circuit, one of the most conservative courts in the US. The majority in that court said that federal law sets one day as the day for federal elections and allowing ballots to arrive after that undermines the law.

Donald Trump and Republicans have railed against the practice of allowing ballots to arrive after election day. At least three states this year have ended the practice of allowing late-arriving ballots, and a March executive order by the president sought to punish states that allowed the practice. Lawsuits against portion of the executive order are still ongoing.

At his daily press conference, the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, said that he welcomed the news that “some senate democrats finally have stepped forward to end the pain” of the government shutdown.

Johnson added that he would call all House members to return to Washington as soon as the Senate has its final vote. As of now, it's not clear how long that might take and if the lawmakers will be able to expedite the process using unanimous consent.

“We have to do this as quickly as possible. We look forward to the government reopening this week so Congress can get back, can get back to our regular legislative session,” he said.

Despite the seismic shift on Capitol Hill over the, Johnson took no questions from reporter.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Leaked BBC report said film had ‘completely misled' viewers by splicing two parts of January 6 speech together

Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures after a campaign against the broadcaster that reached fever pitch over criticism that its flagship documentary programme in 2024 used a misleading edit of a Trump speech.

Lawyers for the US president said that the BBC must retract the Panorama documentary by Friday or face a lawsuit for “no less” than $1bn (£760m), according to US media outlets who cited the letter. The BBC has confirmed it had received a letter and said it will respond in due course.

The resignations of the BBC director general, Tim Davie, and its News CEO, Deborah Turness, came after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster's coverage. The report criticised BBC coverage on transgender issues, Gaza and an edit of a Trump speech from January 6 during the Capitol Hill insurrection.

“Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!,” Trump said on his social media platform, Truth Social.

After Davie resigned, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, also celebrated by posting on X her Saturday interview with the Telegraph, which she captioned with “shot” and the BBC article announcing Davie's resignation, captioned with “chaser”.

On Saturday Leavitt had described the BBC to Telegraph as “100% fake news” and a “propaganda machine”, saying that watching BBC bulletins while on trips to the UK “ruins” her day and that taxpayers were being “forced to foot the bill for a leftist propaganda machine”.

The independent and publicly funded BBC has been under mounting pressure for years. Rightwing critics accuse it of a liberal bias, while leftwing critics express frustration that its management was unduly influenced by previous Conservative governments and that it has allowed itself to be drawn into “culture wars” over issues like race, sex and gender.

A tense and unpredictable atmosphere has left BBC journalists feeling exposed when reporting on contentious issues, particularly the Israeli bombardment of Gaza.

At home and abroad, Trump has maintained a persistently antagonistic relationship with many major news organisations, frequently labelling outlets as “the enemy of the people”. This strategy has included suing news organisations, revoking press credentials for reporters, and exerting pressure on media companies and platforms.

The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists has stated that “press freedom is no longer a given in the United States”, arguing that the Trump administration's policies could cause irreparable harm and will probably take decades to repair.

The leaked BBC report said the current affairs Panorama documentary had “completely misled” viewers by splicing two parts of Trump's speech together. The Panorama edit cut together quotes from sections of the speech delivered up to an hour apart, combining a line about walking to the Capitol with the instruction to “fight like hell”.

The BBC chair, Samir Shah, later on Monday apologised for the editing of the Trump speech, calling it an “error of judgment”.

Trump in fact gave conflicting advice that day to supporters, who he had called on to gather in the capital as part of his efforts to discredit his election loss based on false claims of widespread fraud. The US president was later impeached for “incitement of insurrection” related to the storming of the Capitol by rioters, but he was acquitted by the Senate after Republicans rallied around him.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Several fire engines rushed to the scene after blast reported near the historic Red Fort, fire services said

A car explosion outside the historic Red Fort monument in Delhi has killed at least eight people and started a fire in the surrounding area, according to police.

The cause of the explosion, which took place just before 7pm local time (1330 GMT) on Monday night, is being investigated. The registered owner of the car has reportedly been detained for questioning.

Police said a slow-moving car had stopped at a red light just outside the Red Fort metro station before the blast. “An explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to the explosion, nearby vehicles were also damaged,” said the Delhi police commissioner, Satish Golcha.

Dozens of fire engines and ambulances rushed to the scene after the blast. Footage on Indian TV news channels showed the chaos of the aftermath, including a car with its doors blasted off, mangled bodies and people screaming in panic. More than a dozen other cars, rickshaws and motorcycles were blackened and burned in the fire caused by the explosion.

One witness told NDTV the force of the blast had sent shock waves through nearby buildings. “One person's body was torn into pieces. I saw a hand on the road,” he said. “It was a very strong explosion.”

Golcha confirmed at least eight people had been killed and 20 injured. “The situation is being monitored. We are investigating the incident and will update you shortly,” he added.

India's home affairs minister, Amit Shah, said it was “difficult to say what caused the incident until the samples recovered from the blast site are analysed”.

As he travelled to the explosion site, Shah added: “We do not consider any angle closed. We will investigate all angles with determination.”

In a post on X, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, said he was reviewing the situation with Shah. “Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi earlier this evening. May the injured recover at the earliest. Those affected are being assisted by authorities,” he said.

The Red Fort, known as Lal Qila, is located in the heavily congested Old Delhi area of India's capital which is usually heaving with people, food stalls and vehicles and is a popular tourist destination.

A vast 17th-century Mughal palace, the fort is one of India's most significant monuments. The prime minister makes an annual address on the fort's ramparts on Independence Day and it features on the country's banknotes.

The city of Mumbai in Maharashtra was put on “precautionary” high alert after the Red Fort blast. In the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, an order was issued to increase security at religious sites and sensitive border areas and alerts were also issued in the states of Haryana and Punjab.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Central Weather Administration (CWA) today issued a sea warning for Typhoon Fung-wong effective from 5:30pm, while local governments canceled school and work for tomorrow.



A land warning is expected to be issued tomorrow morning before it is expected to make landfall on Wednesday, the agency said.

Taoyuan, and well as Yilan, Hualien and Penghu counties canceled work and school for tomorrow, as well as mountainous district of Taipei and New Taipei City.



For updated information on closures, please visit the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration Web site.



As of 5pm today, Fung-wong was about 490km south-southwest of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost point. 



It was moving west-northwest at 13kph, with maximum sustained winds of up to 137kph and gusts reaching 173kph.



CWA forecaster Lin Ping-yu (林秉煜) said Fung-wong has slightly strengthened in the past three hours and is expected to pose a threat to waters near Pratas Island (Dongsha Island, 東沙島), the Bashi Channel and the southern Taiwan Strait, with a possible further increase in intensity.



The typhoon, combined with the effects of northeasterly winds, is expected to bring increasingly heavy rain tonight and tomorrow to the Keelung north coast, greater Taipei, eastern Taiwan and the Hengchun Peninsula (恆春半島).



Extremely heavy to torrential rainfall is expected in mountainous areas of greater Taipei and eastern Taiwan, and the CWA is likely to issue a land warning tomorrow morning, Lin said.



Fung-wong is forecast to approach and pass over Taiwan on Wednesday. 



Central and southern Taiwan, Hualien, Taitung and Penghu may see scattered showers with the possibility of heavy or torrential rain, Lin added.



Northern Taiwan, Yilan and outlying islands including Kinmen and Lienchiang counties are expected to experience brief showers.



Even after the typhoon moves away on Thursday, northern Taiwan may still see significant rainfall, Lin said.



During the typhoon, strong gusts may occur in open coastal areas and offshore islands, with waves exceeding 3m along the coast, Lin said.



Waves could reach up to 6m in southern Taiwan, the Hengchun Peninsula, southeastern regions and Penghu County, Lin added.



As the typhoon approaches, the Kinmen Harbor Bureau announced today that ferry services between Kinmen and the Chinese cities of Xiamen and Quanzhou would be suspended in both directions tomorrow.


UNILATERAL MOVES: 
                                        Officials have raised concerns that Beijing could try to exert economic control over Kinmen in a key development plan next year                                        The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) yesterday said that China has so far failed to provide any information about a new airport expected to open next year that is less than 10km from a Taiwanese airport, raising flight safety concerns. 
Xiamen Xiangan International Airport is only about 3km at its closest point from the islands in Kinmen County — the scene of on-off fighting during the Cold War — and construction work can be seen and heard clearly from the Taiwan side. 
In a written statement sent to Reuters, the CAA said that airports close to each other need detailed advanced                                    



                                                                                Tropical Storm Fung-Wong would likely strengthen into a typhoon later today as it continues moving westward across the Pacific before heading in Taiwan's direction next week, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said.
As of 8am, Fung-Wong was about 2,190km east-southeast of Cape Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost point, moving westward at 25kph and possibly accelerating to 31kph, CWA data showed.
The tropical storm is currently over waters east of the Philippines and still far from Taiwan, CWA forecaster Tseng Chao-cheng (曾昭誠) said, adding that it could likely strengthen into a typhoon later in the day.
It is forecast to reach the South China Sea                                    



                                                                                Almost a quarter of volunteer soldiers who signed up from 2021 to last year have sought early discharge, the Legislative Yuan's Budget Center said in a report.
The report said that 12,884 of 52,674 people who volunteered in the period had sought an early exit from the military, returning NT$895.96 million (US$28.86 million) to the government.
In 2021, there was a 105.34 percent rise in the volunteer recruitment rate, but the number has steadily declined since then, missing recruitment targets, the Chinese-language United Daily News said, citing the report.
In 2021, only 521 volunteers dropped out of the military, the report said, citing                                    



                                                                                WEATHER
Typhoon forming: CWA
A tropical depression is expected to form into a typhoon as early as today, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said yesterday, adding that the storm's path remains uncertain. Before the weekend, it would move toward the Philippines, the agency said. Some time around Monday next week, it might reach a turning point, either veering north toward waters east of Taiwan or continuing westward across the Philippines, the CWA said. Meanwhile, the eye of Typhoon Kalmaegi was 1,310km south-southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost point, as of 2am yesterday, it said.

Hello, this is Asami Terajima reporting from Kyiv on day 1,355 of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Today's top story:

The Ukrainian military denied once again on Nov. 10 that Russian troops had managed to encircle the embattled city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast, but admitted that logistics to keep supplying troops there are difficult. 

Major Andrii Kovalev, a spokesman for Ukraine's General Staff, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that logistics to Pokrovsk still exist, and the troops, including wounded soldiers, are being rotated in and out. 

The military's comment comes as Russian troops close in on the Ukrainian pocket that includes Pokrovsk and some areas south of it, including the neighboring town of Myrnohrad. 

Nearly encircled, Ukrainian troops have less than 10 kilometers to keep logistics flowing into the pocket, according to the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring website DeepState. 

Kovalev denied to Ukrainska Pravda that the last remaining supply routes are all in the Russian artillery and drones' control, which would mean they can strike any targets moving by. 

The 7th Rapid Response Corps said on Nov. 10 that Russian troops launched 132 assaults in the Pokrovsk sector over the past week, which is ""almost 20% more than the previous week."" 

The fiercest fighting is raging in the northern part of Pokrovsk, with the city's industrial zone being under the heaviest fire.

Memorial of Heroes, a Ukrainian memorialization and documentary project that records the stories of those killed by Russia's war against Ukraine, has had its YouTube channel deleted without the right to appeal.

""Five times this month, our channel has been deleted,"" the project's deputy editor, Kateryna Maiboroda, wrote on Instagram on Nov. 10.

""The formal reason — 'spam and fraud.' Without a single example, without any sense.""

According to Maiboroda, after the sixth and most recent deletion, the appeal option —previously followed by quick restoration — was withheld, with no immediate explanation.

The Memorial of Heroes' channel, part of a larger project that includes a website, social media pages, and an event, hosted 18 documentary films and over 100 profiles in memory of fallen Ukrainian soldiers.

Maiboroda said the accusations behind the mass reports, which are unrelated to the channel's actual content, indicate a coordinated Russian operation.

""They are not only destroying our cities, but our memory, too,"" she said in an Instagram story in connection to the deletion.

Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) said on Nov. 10 that they conducted what they described as ""a successful"" drone attack on a pumping station at an oil depot near the city of Simferopol in Russian-occupied Crimea. 

The SSO said that the Nov. 10 overnight drone attack marked the third hit on the same target in a month. It stressed the importance of such attacks, explaining that the Hvardiiske oil depot, named after a village just 20 kilometers north of Simferopol, is ""an important element of the fuel and logistics system"" in Crimea that Moscow then supplies to military facilities and its army. 

Russian occupational administration head in Simferopol, Mikhail Afanasyev, has not commented on the drone attack or the SSO's claim. The Kyiv Independent couldn't independently verify the claim. 

Earlier on Nov. 7, the SSO also reported hitting the same oil depot. 

Last updated 4:34 p.m. Kyiv time.

Ukraine's former military chief and incumbent ambassador to the U.K., Valerii Zaluzhnyi, wrote in an opinion piece published on Nov. 10 that a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine at all costs is ""premature."" 

Zaluzhnyi stressed in the lengthy article published on Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda that a comprehensive peace deal could take months, if not years, of tough negotiations. 

""It's hard to say whether those who try to push us to make certain decisions understand this,"" Zaluzhnyi wrote in his opinion piece, where he delved into diplomacy tactics that Ukraine and Russia are using. 

""However, it's perfectly clear that our fate is in our own hands.""

Russia's port town of Tuapse on the Black Sea was rocked by explosions overnight on Nov. 10, as local Telegram channels reported an attack by Ukrainian sea drones.

Photos and videos uploaded by locals in the town and later published by major Telegram channel Astra show explosions and a resulting fire in the area of the town's port.

Tuapse is located in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, around 75 kilometers northwest of the major city of Sochi.

The coastal town is home to a major oil terminal and refinery, and has been the target of Ukrainian strikes as recently as Nov. 2, when fuel exports out of the port were halted by drone attacks, as reported at the time by Reuters.

Last updated 1:20 p.m. Kyiv time.

At least one person have been killed and 15 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 10.

Russian troops launched 74 missiles and drones against Ukraine overnight, which included around 40 Shahed-type drones and two aeroballistic Kinzhal missiles, the Air Force reported on Nov. 10. It said it had intercepted 52 drones of various types in the eastern, southern, and central parts of Ukraine.

In eastern Donetsk Oblast, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said that at least two people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said that two women, aged 55 and 75, were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day.

In northeastern Sumy Oblast, the regional military administration said that 45-year-old and 89-year-old women were injured in the Russian attacks over the past day. 

In central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, regional governor Vladyslav Haivanenko said an 83-year-old woman was injured by a Russian attack that involved heavy artillery and first-person view (FPV) drones over the past day.

In southern Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and eight were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin and his regional military administration. 

Russia has lost around 1,152,160 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 10.

The number includes 1,090 casualties that Russian forces suffered over the past day.

According to the report, Russia has also lost 23,552 (+7) armored fighting vehicles, 66,957 (+77) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,349 (+9) artillery systems, 79,425 (+57) drones, and 3,993 (+0) units of special equipment.

Russia's port town of Tuapse on the Black Sea was rocked by explosions overnight on Nov. 10, as local Telegram channels reported an attack by Ukrainian sea drones.

Photos and videos uploaded by locals in the town and later published by major Telegram channel Astra show explosions and a resulting fire in the area of the town's port. 

Tuapse is located in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, around 75 kilometers northwest of the major city of Sochi.

The coastal town is home to a major oil terminal and refinery, and has been the target of Ukrainian strikes as recently as Nov. 2, when fuel exports out of the port were halted by drone attacks, as reported at the time by Reuters.

Municipal administration head Sergey Boiko had earlier posted on his official Telegram channel about the threat of attack from both air and sea drones, but later redacted the latter from the message.

Later, the official Telegram channel of Krasnodar Krai confirmed the attack, claiming that four Ukrainian sea drones had been destroyed. 

""One of the unmanned boats detonated near the shoreline,"" the message read. ""The shock wave damaged the second-floor windows of a two-story house, as well as a garage and a boat shed.""

At the time of publishing the Kyiv Independent is unable to verify the results of the attack. Kyiv is yet to comment officially on the operation.

Over 2025, Ukraine has escalated attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, in particular oil refineries, identified as a vulnerable target for asymmetric strikes as the fighting along the front line continues.

Meanwhile, with the continuing advancement of sea drone technology, first deployed in 2022, Kyiv has been able to target Russian military and energy assets on the Black Sea at increasing range and effectiveness.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.

Three drones were spotted flying over the Doel Nuclear Power Plant in northern Belgium on the evening of Nov. 9, according to Deutsche Welle.

Operations at the power plant near Antwerp were not impacted by the drone sighting, a spokesperson for local energy company Engie said.

Several unidentified drone sightings have occurred in recent days near Belgian infrastructure. On Nov. 3, the Belgian army issued orders to shoot down unknown drones spotted over the country's military bases in response to the sightings.

On Nov. 4, Belgium suspended air traffic at Brussels Airport due to a reported drone sighting in the area, according to the Belga News Agency. Some flights were diverted to the country's Liege Airport, which was later temporarily closed because of another drone sighting.

Meanwhile, suspicious drones were spotted over Belgium's Kleine Brogel Air Base for three nights in a row between Oct. 31 and Nov. 2, local media reported.

Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken said that the sightings near military bases appear to be part of an espionage operation, not naming the culprit but linking the incidents to recent Russian airspace violations in Europe.

The drone sightings have caused disruptions in several European countries, including Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. As investigations continue, authorities have not ruled out that the drones may be Russian.

Amid the drone sightings, Ukraine is set to open defense production offices in Berlin and Copenhagen by year's end as Kyiv seeks to boost its weapons exports, President Volodymyr Zelensky told journalists on Nov. 3.

The two cities were chosen as Denmark and Germany are both co-production partners for the Ukrainian defense industry, Zelensky told journalists, adding that ""opening two export capitals"" will fund the ""domestic production of scarce goods.""

Ukraine has previously signalled it is ready to help its allies produce drones using its wartime knowledge as Europe increasingly faces signs of hybrid warfare from Russia.

The Wealthy Barber author David Chilton answers questions about passive investing, estate plans, spending habits, and what the future looks like for advisors.Supplied

The Wealthy Barber is back, rewritten and updated for a new generation. 

Author David Chilton, who sold more than 2 million copies of the original 1989 book that demystified personal finance for the masses, says the wealth management landscape has changed vastly since, with new registered accounts, products and advice channels. But he adds that some things never go out of style – namely, “paying yourself first” to ensure enough savings for the long term.

In an interview with Globe Advisor, Mr. Chilton answered advisors' questions about passive investing, estate plans, spending habits and what the future looks like for advisors.

The first exchange-traded fund didn't launch until 1990. Today, passive investing dominates much of the conversation. How has the rise of index funds reshaped your views on what smart investing looks like?

At the time, we didn't have the robust research that picking actively managed funds to outperform the broad market averages is almost impossible. There's no perfect way to invest, but the evidence shows that the combination of low-cost index funds and watching your fees is the most sensible way for equity investors to gain access to the markets. 

That means in the advisor industry, you're going to see more models come out in which that's the investment vehicle of choice, at least for the equity component of portfolios, and, therefore, the advisor is going to have to be compensated in another way.

How does the financial advice industry need to improve?

The industry has come a long way. The training is much better. We have great designations. Clients have started to realize it's not just about the advisor's knowledge, it's about their communication skills. 

The challenge is how do we strike the balance between the industry making enough money to support itself, but also treating clients fairly on the cost front. That's a difficult balance to strike.

If you have a 23-year-old looking for financial advice and to set up that first tax-free savings account, if they're put into high-cost mutual funds, that could hurt them – that could take away 25 to 30 per cent of their retirement capital down the road.

But the advisors putting them in those funds make a fairly good argument: “What else are we supposed to do? We charge them the proper amount for the time we're going to have to spend doing this on a thorough basis.”

Artificial intelligence will come in and play a helpful role. It's not there yet; there are still mistakes being made. I think AI will improve dramatically in the next 24 to 48 months. You'll see some efficiency in which the advisor can spend less time, still give the client a fairly solid plan and not be forced to put them into high-cost funds.

How has estate planning changed in the past four decades?

It's much more complex today. We have holdcos now. We've got foreign real estate holdings. We have far more blended families. Some people have private company shares. I can't believe how many Canadians just stick their kids' names on joint accounts without recognizing potential pitfalls. They will be exposed to the other person's creditors, for example, and few people seem to know that.

In the original book, I talked about wills and life insurance. But I didn't talk about powers of attorney, so I added that to the updated version. Powers of attorney are as important as wills, especially as you get older. 

What part of human nature did you underestimate when you first wrote the book, and what part surprised you the most over the years?

I didn't underestimate the downside of what our minds can do to us and the weaknesses we have in human nature. But I may have underestimated the marketplace's ability to take advantage of that. 

Of course, I didn't know social media was coming. And now with the algorithms and all the scientific research, there are a lot of very clever, adept businesses trying to get us to spend money. 

So, I don't think human nature has changed much, but the attack on human nature and its weaknesses has intensified. That's made it tougher still for younger generations. They don't only have to battle a higher cost of living and higher real estate prices; they have this ongoing assault against their human nature, trying to get them to part with their money.

“Pay yourself first” is one of the positive things I underestimated. That was a huge part of the initial book, and if anything, I'm a bigger fan of it now because of what people have been able to achieve. The idea is to take out the money before you have an opportunity to spend it.

What's one thing that has surprised you about people's spending habits today?

How much people spend on cars. And it's not just the car payments, but the insurance, gas, upkeep and parking. It adds up to a number that's hard to believe relative to income. For a couple, I've seen up to $2,700 a month. It's not tenable.

President Donald Trump demanded air traffic controllers return to work on Monday as government-directed flight cuts and air traffic staffing absences continue to wreak havoc with U.S. air travel.

Trump added that he will reward those who did not take any time off during the 41-day federal government shutdown, but it is not clear how many controllers could qualify. Trump said he would welcome the resignation of those who took time off.

“All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn't will be substantially 'docked,'” Trump wrote on social media. “REPORT TO WORK IMMEDIATELY.”

Shares of the biggest U.S. airlines, including American Airlines, Delta Airlines and United Airlines, turned negative after Trump's social media post. The shutdown has led to shortages of air traffic controllers who, like other federal employees, have not been paid for weeks. Officials said it is unclear under the controllers' union contract how they could be docked or what the source of the US$10,000 bonus Trump proposed.

Last week, Federal Aviation Administration chief Bryan Bedford said 20-40 per cent of controllers were not showing up for work on any given day at the 30 largest U.S. airports since the shutdown began. Staffing issues worsened over the weekend and Saturday was the worst single staffing day since the shutdown began, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Sunday.

Asked about Trump's comments, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels said Monday the union would appreciate anything that recognizes controllers and “we'll work with the administration or any issues that are out there. Air traffic controllers will continue to show up during this shutdown.”

Airlines cancelled 1,700 U.S. flights on Monday, numbers set to worsen this week after the FAA mandated flight cuts set to rise to 10 per cent Friday. FlightAware, a flight tracking website, said by 11:30 a.m. ET, 3,480 flights were also delayed Monday after 2,950 flights were cancelled and nearly 11,200 delayed Sunday in the single worst day for flight disruptions since the government shutdown began on October 1.

A November winter storm in Chicago is also disrupting air travel.

The shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, has forced 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Transportation Security Administration agents to work without pay.

Explainer: How the government shutdown could affect Canadian travellers

The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels. Many had been working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks even before the shutdown. Duffy has offered incentives to retain more retirement-eligible controllers as he works to speed hiring while also launching a US$12.5-billion effort to overhaul air traffic control.

The FAA late Sunday also said it was suspending general aviation traffic at 12 airports with air traffic control staffing issues including Chicago O'Hare and Reagan Washington National. 

The FAA instructed airlines to cut 4 per cent of daily flights starting last week at 40 major airports because of air traffic control safety concerns. Reductions in flights are mandated to reach 6 per cent on Tuesday and then hit 10 per cent by November 14. 

One big question for airlines is when the FAA will lift the government-required flight cuts. Duffy has said he first wants to see air traffic control staffing and safety data improve.

A group of Democrats voted with Republicans to advance a measure to end a 40-day shutdown, the longest in US history. 

The US Senate on Sunday night advanced a procedural measure aimed at ending a record-setting government shutdown.

The stopgap funding bill would allow the government to be funded until January 30.

The US government has been shut down since October 1 as Democrats refused to support a Republican-drafted spending bill they say will cut healthcare support for millions of people.

The shutdown has kept federal workers at home, while disrupting air travel, and food aid. 

With the support of some Democrats, the vote to advance the funding bill passed by a 60-40 margin. Republicans currently hold a majority in the Senate, with 53 of the upper chamber's 100 seats. 

Seven Democrats and one independent senator voted to advance the package.

The bill would restore funding for the SNAP food stamp program, which helps 42 million people pay for groceries.Thousands of federal workers fired by President Donald Trump over the past month would also get their jobs back.

On the crucial issue of health care, Republicans also agreed to a vote in December on extending the Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of the year.

Democrats have insisted that any vote to reopen the US government should also be tied to a vote extending ACA subsidies. 

Lower-income Americans are dependent on these subsidies to pay for private health insurance.

""I have long said that to earn my vote, we need to be on a path toward fixing Republicans' health care mess and to protect the federal workforce,"" Democratic Senator Tim Kaine said in a statement.



However, many Senate Democrats opposed the deal.

Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, voted against the measure, arguing that the deal offers a vote for extending the health care tax credits, rather than extending them directly. 

The vote on Sunday clears the way for the Senate to pass the measure. It will then be sent to the Republican-controlled House of Representative for approval before landing on Trump's desk for a signature. 

The process could take several days, or longer, depending on the degree of opposition. 

When the Senate reconvenes on Monday, Republicans said they would try to expedite the voting process to get the bill through procedural measures quickly, and end the shutdown by the weekend. 

""It was a good vote tonight,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters after the Senate adjourned on Sunday.

""Hopefully, we'll get an opportunity tomorrow to set up the next votes. Of course, that's going to take some cooperation and consent.""

Police confirmed there were fatalities from a car explosion near a metro station close to the Red Fort landmark.

Police say at least eight people were killed and more injured Monday in an explosion near the Red Fort in the Indian capital, New Delhi.

""A slow-moving vehicle stopped at a red light, an explosion happened in that vehicle, and due to the explosion, nearby vehicles were also damaged,"" New Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha said.

""Some people have died, and some have been injured.""

Emergency services rushed to the scene after the blast was reported near a metro station close to the historic landmark, according to the city's fire department.

The cause of the explosion, which took place just before 7 p.m. (2:30 p.m. CET, 1:30 p.m. GMT) was not immediately clear. 

""We are investigating the cause of the blast,"" Sanjay Tyagi, a spokesman for the police said. 

Mumbai, India's financial hub, and Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state bordering Delhi, were placed under heightened security following the blast.

The Red Fort, built in 1648 under Mughal rule in Delhi's old quarter, is one of India's most famous landmarks. The prime minister delivers the Independence Day address from there, and it appears on the country's largest banknote.

The contested Museum of West African Arts in Benin City has postponed its preview week after protesters stormed a museum event.

The multi-million dollar Museum of West African Arts (MOWAA), a prestigious cultural project in Edo State in southern Nigeria, has suspended preview events scheduled for this week.

MOWAA made the decision after around 20 men, some armed with wooden bats, stormed the museum courtyard on Sunday during a pre-opening event. Guests, including ambassadors and donors, were forced to take refuge inside.

""If you were planning on travelling to Benin [City] for the MOWAA preview week, please suspend your travel plans,"" a MOWAA statement posted on Instagram says.

The incident comes just days after dozens of demonstrators protested outside the Edo state legislature against the museum's opening.

MOWAA has sparked intense political tensions since its conception five years ago.

The new museum is dedicated to preserving and celebrating West Africa's artistic and cultural heritage.      

It's due to house exhibition spaces and archives and aims to host residencies for West African artists and craftspeople.

Costing around $25 million (€21.6 million), it's attracted significant support from international governments and private institutions.

Germany, France and Denmark are among those financing the museum as well as the British Museum, the Getty Foundation and the Ford Foundation.

Edo State's former governor also gave some 3.8 billion naira ($2.6 million) toward the ambitious art project.

MOWAA has been caught in the cross-fire o ownership of the Benin Bronzes.

These are thousands of artifacts looted by British soldiers in the 19th century from what was then the Kingdom of Benin, which is now located in Nigeria's Edo State.

The metal artifacts and ivory carvings, which have significant cultural meaning, ended up scattered in collections across Europe and the United States.

Nigeria's former president Muhammadu Buhari declared back in 2023 that the ancient Kingdom of Benin's traditional ruler, Oba Ewuare II, was the owner of the bronzes. (The non-sovereign kingdom bears no relationship to the African country of Benin.)

This meant that any bronzes repatriated to Nigeria must be returned to the Oba.

Part of the original premise of MOWAA when it was launched in 2020 was to house the Benin Bronzes, an ambition the museum has since abandoned.

Numerous Benin Bronzes have been returned to Nigeria in the past years, including 119 from the Netherlands in June 2025, which were handed directly to the Oba.

Oba Ewuare II has said several times that he plans to showcase the returned bronzes, none of which are yet on public display, in a museum of his own.

Critics of MOWAA say the museum is a provocation to the Oba and a ploy to take the Benin Bronzes away from him.

MOWAA supporters say the museum, which is designed by renowned British-Ghanaian architect David Adjaye, will make Edo State a global cultural and art hub.

Nigeria's Culture Minister Hannatu Musa Musawa condemned the incident in a statement late Sunday.

""The reported disruption at MOWAA not only endangers a treasured cultural asset but also threatens the peaceful environment necessary for cultural exchange and the preservation of our artistic patrimony,"" she said in a statement on Instagram.

Doug Ford, the Ontario Premier, was moments from taking the stage at a trade conference in Toronto when organisers announced an unexpected guest.

Beaming in from Washington, DC, Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's commerce secretary, had joined to speak on the escalating trade rift between the US and Canada.

Mr Lutnick's tone, those present say, was aggressive and his message clear; automotive manufacturing, the pride of Ontario, was coming back to America.

“Lutnick took it further and said, ‘we intend to bring back all manufacturing as we're stealing your jobs and you should start thinking now about what you're going to replace it with',” a source with knowledge of the event told The Telegraph.

“That's kind of like walking into Washington and saying, ‘we're going to take your entire Silicon Valley and move it to Japan'.”

The remarks, delivered a day after Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, returned from the White House for the second time without a trade deal, enraged Mr Ford, according to those close to him.

He watched as Mr Lutnick effectively declared open season on the province's biggest export and the backbone of the Canadian economy.

“I would say it's a massive threat when you have the secretary of commerce coming out and saying that, and he would only say it if the president gave him the green light,” Mr Ford told reporters on the sidelines of the Eurasia Group summit.

“So right away you gotta put your guard up and be prepared.”

Anxious that the crowning achievement of Canada's most populous province was at stake, it was decided that Mr Ford would pull the trigger on a fiery attack ad he had prepared for this very eventuality, insiders say.

“The decision to go ahead, how hard to go ahead, was really triggered by Lutnick,” a source with knowledge of Mr Ford's decision said.

The minute-long advert included an excerpt from Ronald Reagan's 1987 radio address to the nation on free and fair trade in which he argued that tariffs cause trade wars and economic disaster.

The address said that while tariffs may seem “patriotic,” they eventually “hurt every American worker and consumer”.

It's official: Ontario's new advertising campaign in the U.S. has launched. Using every tool we have, we'll never stop making the case against American tariffs on Canada. The way to prosperity is by working together.Watch our new ad. pic.twitter.com/SgIVC1cqMJ

Mr Ford eventually pulled the ad but allowed it to be shown in the first two games of the baseball World Series to millions of viewers.

It was aired to millions in the US and inevitably caught the ire of Donald Trump.

“Their Advertisement was to be taken down, IMMEDIATELY, but they let it run last night during the World Series, knowing that it was a FRAUD,” Mr Trump posted on Truth Social, describing the ad as a “misrepresentation of facts”.

In retaliation, Mr Trump halted trade talks with Canada over Ontario's decision to air the ad and increasing tariffs on goods from the entire country by 10 per cent.

It was not the first time Mr Lutnick had caused headaches for the president. Earlier this year, the trade envoy was quietly pulled from TV after Wall Street executives told the president to rein him in.

The president's influential banking allies had grown increasingly frustrated with Mr Lutnick's public appearances and feared he lacked understanding of tariffs and the economy.

On this occasion, however, the White House believes their man did no wrong.

“Howard Lutnick is the secretary of commerce for the United States of America. It is his job to put America first by prioritising American workers and manufacturing,” Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said.

“Foreign officials need to drop the arrogant delusion that they can support their domestic industries but America cannot.”

The advert forced Mr Carney to apologise to the US president when they both attended a dinner hosted by South Korea's president on Oct 29.

“I did apologise to the president,” Mr Carney told reporters on Saturday after attending an Asia-Pacific summit in South Korea.

He also confirmed he had reviewed the ad with Mr Ford before it aired, but said he had opposed using it. “I told Ford I did not want to go forward with the ad,” Mr Carney said.

The majority of Canadian exports to the US are exempt from tariffs because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that was signed during Mr Trump's first term.

In August, the Trump administration imposed a 35 per cent tariff on Canadian goods not covered by the USMCA. Canada's economy has suffered from sector tariffs of 50 per cent imposed this year by Mr Trump on steel and aluminium from all countries.

Insiders speculate that Mr Carney had agreed a deal in principle to solve the aluminium issue but they were torpedoed by Mr Ford's attack advert.

In the end, what was a trade summit celebrating cross-border cooperation became the launchpad for a renewed trade war.

Ghislaine Maxwell is reportedly planning to formally ask Donald Trump to reduce her 20-year prison sentence.

In October, the US Supreme Court rejected Maxwell's appeal against her sex trafficking conviction. She is currently serving 20 years for trafficking underage girls to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.

The only option left to reduce her prison sentence is a commutation or pardon, granted by Mr Trump.

The convicted sex offender, 63, told her lawyer she would send supporting documents for her commutation application through the prison warden, according to emails provided to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee by a whistleblower.

“I am struggling to keep it all together as it is big and there are so many attachments,” she allegedly told her lawyer Leaf Saffian in an email seen by Politico with the subject line “RE: Commutation Application”.

She added: “More coming to replace others... hopefully it will all make sense.”

In July, Mr Trump refused to rule out granting clemency to Maxwell, saying it was something he is “allowed to do”.

Speaking to reporters, he said: “I'm allowed to do it, but it's something I haven't thought about.”

On Monday, Jamie Raskin, the most senior Democrat on the committee, demanded Mr Trump release information about the application and urged the US president to reject the request.

“You should not grant any form of clemency to this convicted and unrepentant sex offender,” Mr Raskin wrote, according to Politico.

Mr Raskin also called for Todd Blanche, the US deputy attorney general, to testify about the commutation application in front of Congress.

Mr Blanche interviewed Maxwell in July about her relationship with the Epstein and those associated with him. Days later, she was moved to a minimum security prison in Texas.

The whistleblower also reportedly claimed Maxwell had received “concierge-style” treatment at Federal Prison Camp Bryan, which included customised meals and access to the exercise area after hours.

Mr Raskin added: “Your administration should not be providing her with room service, with puppies to play with, with federal law enforcement officials waiting on her every need, or with any special treatment or institutional privilege at all.”

Mr Raskin also claimed information from the whistleblower indicated Maxwell's guests could bring computers, and the warden helped organise visits which included “snacks and refreshments for her guests.”

In emails to her friends, Maxwell said she was “much happier” after she was moved from a stricter prison in Tallahassee, Florida.

Days after moving to Maxwell sent a series of emails to friends and family praising the cleanliness and safety of the new facility, where inmates mostly serve time for non-violent offences and white-collar crimes.

Maxwell said the food was “legions better” and that “everyone can breathe a sigh [of relief]”, comparing the sharp difference between the two prisons to climbing through “Alice in Wonderlands [sic] looking glass”, NBC News reported.

White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said: “The White House does not comment on potential clemency requests. As President Trump has stated, pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell is not something he has thought about.”

The Telegraph has contacted Maxwell's lawyers for comment.

Relying on agents to archive their own messages via screenshots has the potential for error and abuse, experts say.

Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. Please make this work possible with a quick donation.

An agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tasked with ensuring that electronic messages on the devices of its workforce comply with public records laws admitted last week that it has stopped using software to do so.

Instead, ever since April, workers have been told to take screenshots on their own devices in order to abide by the law — a shift in policy that has a high potential for misuse and abuse, and which makes it much more difficult to track messages when requested in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiries.

The Federal Records Act requires all agencies within the government to document their employees' communications, with some exceptions ostensibly granted for national security concerns. Since 2023, DHS has relied on a software archival tool called TeleMessage for that purpose.

In testimony before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia he gave last week, Michael Weissman, executive director of the Chief Data Officer Directorate within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (CIO), said that TeleMessage had “cybersecurity failures” that meant DHS had to stop using it. However, it was not replaced with new software — instead, DHS employees were “obligated to manually archive their messages,” via screenshots taken by themselves, “in accordance with existing” department policies.

The testimony from Weissman stems from a lawsuit brought against the agency by American Oversight, a nonprofit government watchdog organization, which had sought communications from DHS staffers regarding the National Guard's deployment in Los Angeles as well as records relating to the prison camp in Florida known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” 

Following a FOIA request earlier this summer, OIC had told the group that it didn't have any of the texts it sought on file. American Oversight made additional requests in the following months, only to be told the same answer. The group sued in October, when DHS officials said those responses from OIC were made by mistake — text messages were indeed preserved, but because of their being kept intact via device screenshot, they weren't readily searchable, requiring a manual search instead. 

The revelation of the changes to how DHS is keeping track of its own communications — including its willingness to dismiss FOIA requests on account of its own inability to do so — has many open records advocates deeply concerned.

“80 Years of US Federal Records Management Theory, Training, Regulation, and gosh darn it, patriotic democratic aspiration. Down the Tubes,” wrote James Cassedy on social media, a former National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) archivist.

Others noted that the new system could easily be manipulated, and perhaps already has been.

“If you are an immigration official or an agent and believe that the public might later criticize you, or that your records could help you be held accountable, would you go out of the way to preserve those records that might expose wrongdoing?” questioned Freedom of the Press Foundation's Lauren Harper.

Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, blasted OIC for providing “inaccurate information” about whether or not the text messages the organization had sought were preserved.

“We're talking about messages exchanged amid major national controversies — from the deployment of military forces on American streets to inhumane immigration crackdowns and deportations carried out in defiance of court orders. The public deserves to know whether these records still exist, and whether officials destroyed evidence of how those decisions were made,” Chukwu said.

 Divide and Conquer in Gaza and at Home

 Aluf Benn

Israelis were glued to their screens on October 13. The cease-fire in Gaza had just taken effect, the last 20 Israeli hostages had returned from Hamas captivity, and U.S. President Donald Trump—who masterminded the peace deal—was addressing the Knesset. “This is not only the end of a war,” Trump declared, “this is the end of an age of terror and death, and the beginning of the age of faith and hope.”

Sitting in the audience was Trump's host, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The president made sure to thank him. “I want to express my gratitude to a man of exceptional courage and patriotism,” he said. He asked the prime minister to rise. Netanyahu did, then nodded and grinned. It was a remarkable moment. When Hamas carried out the worst-ever attack in Israel's history on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 civilians and soldiers and kidnapping 251 people, few analysts expected that Netanyahu would still be in power two years on, let alone be showered with praise by an American president. The last prime minister to govern Israel when it suffered a surprise attack, Golda Meir, stepped down shortly after. But Netanyahu denied any responsibility and refused to bow out. Instead, he blamed the failure to anticipate and repel the assault squarely on the military and intelligence services. He blocked an inquiry. And to keep his government intact, he dragged out the subsequent conflict despite mounting domestic fatigue and international pressure.

As Trump, who forced Netanyahu to halt the war, sang his praises from the Knesset podium, the prime minister was busy plotting his next fight: Israel's upcoming elections. Israelis are due to go to the polls in October 2026, and the contest could end up happening as early as June. And Netanyahu has vowed to run and win again. To do so, he is trying to spin the war as a grand victory, castigating his critics as enemies within. Most of all, he has restarted his effort to turn the country into an autocracy by stripping the judiciary of its independence and turning the political system, the military, the intelligence services, and the civil servants more generally into his stooges—as well as trying to control the media through new regulation.

The country's next election will be a national referendum on Netanyahu's rule, as all Israeli elections have been since he returned to power in 2009. (He led the country from 1996 to 1999.) At first, that might seem to bode poorly for the prime minister. Netanyahu, after all, was not only in office when Israel was attacked on October 7—he failed to deliver the “total victory” over Hamas that he pledged, despite his claims to the contrary, and remains haunted by a string of criminal scandals. But despite all that, and despite lagging in the polls, Netanyahu could well win again. The prime minister has a large, loyal base of supporters. His foes, by contrast, can agree on little other than their hatred of him. Even if Netanyahu can't win outright, he may be able to stop the opposition from establishing a working majority. The result would be a caretaker government that he can dominate, much as he has in the past.

To call Netanyahu polarizing is an understatement. To supporters, he is a savior: their frontline fighter in a cultural war that divides Israel's Jewish society. He has worked to replace an old elite that was secular, liberal, and Western-oriented with a new one that is conservative, religious, and unashamed to express nationalistic views and pass laws that discriminate against non-Jews. To his opponents, by contrast, he is a deeply corrupt demagogue who will stop at nothing to gain and keep power, including by making cynical use of class grievances. In this view, his true goals, even during the war, have nothing to do with national security. They are to fuel his cult of personality, eliminate his criminal charges, and keep himself in office. His key motivation, in other words, is not saving Israel but saving himself.

This divide preceded Netanyahu's rule, defining Israel's political battles for decades. But in recent years, it has grown more intense and the stakes have risen. In November 2022, Netanyahu's coalition secured a solid majority (by Israeli standards) of 64 out of 120 seats in Parliament, allowing the prime minister to push ahead with his most controversial policies. He wasted no time in doing so. Relying on the country's far-right parties, the new government declared that “the Jewish people have an exclusive and indisputable right to all areas of the land of Israel”—including the occupied West Bank. This means denying any rights to the Palestinians, who could only watch in frustration as Israel pushed forward with an unprecedented campaign of land-grabbing and settlement expansion.

Most Jewish Israelis, however, had little concern for the Palestinians, let alone the peace process. Instead, they were much more worried about the crisis unfolding in their midst. In January 2023, Netanyahu's government introduced laws that would usurp the independence of Israel's Supreme Court and attorney general—the custodians of civil liberties in a country that lacks a formal constitution. Nominally sold by Netanyahu as “a much-needed reform to strengthen governability,” these laws were really designed to build an autocratic theocracy that he would lead. The legal system, after all, was not only prosecuting the prime minister for corruption. For decades, it protected the rights of Israel's Arab minority, guaranteed religious freedoms, LGBTQ rights, and a free press—all anathemas of Israel's right-wing and Orthodox politicians, who sought more power and resources for West Bank settlers and rabbinical institutions. The Supreme Court has, of course, also done much to help the settlers. Across the Green Line that divides pre-1967 Israel from its Palestinian territories, the judiciary has largely built a legal shield around the subjugation of Palestinians and settlement expansion. But here and there, it has interfered with the settler project, serving as a constant reminder of international humanitarian law and its obligations.

These so-called judicial reforms were Netanyahu's most daring effort to win the cultural war, and they were met with Israel's strongest-ever protest movement. Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets. Thousands of military reservists declared that they would refuse to serve until the legislation was withdrawn. But the prime minister plowed ahead until October 7 forced him to suspend the bills and form a broader war cabinet. Even then, Netanyahu did not position himself as a national healer. Instead, as the Israel Defense Forces fought on several fronts and Israel faced severe criticism abroad, he busied himself hunting for scapegoats. He targeted, in particular, Israel's national security establishment—traditionally the most influential force in public life and a bastion of resistance to Netanyahu. Pointing to the October 7 failure, the prime minister purged security and intelligence chiefs who had challenged him. Netanyahu, for example, pushed Ronen Bar, the head of the Shin Bet, out of his job after Bar testified that the prime minister had asked him to target antigovernment protesters as if they were terrorists. He replaced him with David Zini, a former general and self-declared “messianic Jew” who had grown up at the far-right religious fringe of West Bank settlements.

Netanyahu's autocratic drive has eroded his support. Since the judicial laws were introduced, independent public opinion polls have consistently shown his coalition, led by his Likud Party, failing to achieve a majority. Channel 12 polling tells the story: in May 2023, Netanyahu's coalition had support that would have won it 52 seats of the 120 seats in Knesset. In December 2023, a few months after the attacks, that number plummeted to 44. But it rebounded to 52 after Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in 2024, and remains at that level today.

But the coalition's visible unpopularity does not translate into an obvious electoral defeat given the chaotic nature of Israel's political system, in which victory is as much about preventing alternative coalitions from forming as it is about protecting one's own. And Netanyahu enters the 2026 campaign with several advantages. Incumbency, for example, gives him control over state affairs such as war, budgets, and taxes, which means he can launch another round of hostilities with Hamas, Hezbollah, or Iran and postpone the election, or bribe voters with tax cuts and budgetary favors. Israel's economy has proved resilient despite the high costs of war and the growing threat of international boycotts, with the shekel outperforming its prewar levels and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange breaking records. The prime minister also benefits from a base that is united behind his leadership. They share a common vision: Jewish supremacy over the Palestinians; a greater Israel that includes the West Bank, perhaps Gaza, and perhaps parts of Syria; and outright opposition to a Palestinian state. They loathe any institution that places checks and balances on government power.

Netanyahu's opposition, by contrast, is divided. The various parties that sit outside his government may all dislike Netanyahu's personality and power grabs. But they are otherwise all over the political spectrum. Some of them support the prime minister's nationalistic agenda, whereas others abhor it. Most of them refuse to work with Israel's two Arab parties, even though those parties are predicted to win ten seats—without which the opposition falls short of a 61-seat majority. And Israel's Jewish opposition has preemptively ceded ground to Netanyahu when it comes to the recent war. Yair Golan, a former general who united the relics of Israel's Zionist left under the Democrats party, has dared to criticize Israel's conduct in Gaza as “a state killing babies as a hobby.” But even he will not stand all out against the conflict or show compassion toward the battered Palestinians. He supports a two-state solution, but only in the distant future.



The prime minister may thus be able to build support by pointing to the war. His aggressive style of fighting, after all, found wide support among the country's Jewish majority. Mainstream opinion viewed the devastation of Gaza—the killing of more than 68,000 Palestinians, razing of entire cities and villages, and preparations for mass expulsions—as justified responses to Hamas's atrocities. Global criticism of Israel's indiscriminate use of force, accusations of genocide, and the portrayal of Netanyahu as a mass murderer on an epic scale were presented to Israelis as mere expressions of anti-Semitism.

Israel's offensives outside Gaza were even more popular. Defeating Lebanon's Hezbollah, including killing Nasrallah, and bombing Iran's facilities in June (with Trump sending American warplanes to assist) were widely seen by Israelis as historic victories over the country's most threatening foes. Here, too, the opposition was wholeheartedly supportive. The only debate was over who deserves the accolades—the prime minister who ordered the strikes or the pilots and intelligence operatives who carried them out.

The only issue that divided public opinion during the war was the plight of Israeli hostages in Gaza. During the second year of the conflict, most Israelis favored a cease-fire that would bring them home, and Netanyahu faced mass protests led by hostage families. But driven by his two far-right coalition leaders, Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, Netanyahu opted to escalate the fight instead. His allies smeared the hostage families leading the demonstrations as enemy collaborators. The last hostages came back only when Trump imposed the cease-fire and Israeli hostage–Palestinian prisoner exchange deal on Netanyahu.

Still, for the prime minister, this was a good outcome. By accepting the deal, he delivered on the two key demands of the protesters: ending the war and getting the hostages back. By blaming Trump for the settlement, he avoided the wrath of his hard-line partners. Netanyahu sails through political controversies by playing heads and tails simultaneously. The same prime minister who exaggerates his power is also fine with being portrayed as the patsy of more influential actors. He doesn't care if he appears strong or weak, as long as he can keep his seat.

Netanyahu's most formidable opponent is former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who, from June 2021 to June 2022, interrupted Netanyahu's 15-year reign. Bennett is ambitious, goal-oriented, and not marred by accusations of personal corruption. A successful tech entrepreneur and former special ops officer who wears a yarmulke, Bennett blends two dominant strains of contemporary Israeli culture: religious nationalism and secular materialism. He understands firsthand that the key to power in Israel's multiparty system is switching sides and tempting defectors. Netanyahu mastered this tactic, buying the support of rivals by offering them ministerial titles. In fact, Bennett served in Netanyahu's cabinet from 2013 to 2020, becoming the defense minister and outflanking the prime minister from the right. But in 2021, Bennett outmaneuvered his former boss, crossed the aisle, and forged an unprecedented coalition with the centrist leader Yair Lapid, two leftist parties, and even a socially conservative Arab party. This opportunism won him power.

This “change” government collapsed after a year, paving the way for Netanyahu's vengeful return. But its emergence showed that Bennett knows how to bridge societal rifts and bring together right and left, Jew and Arab, religious and secular. His slogan for the coming election could be “Netanyahu divides, I unite.”

Right now, the polls give Bennett a decent chance of winning. But his path is hardly clear. For starters, Bennett—who stepped down from Parliament after his year as prime minister—only recently announced that he was running. He has not yet built a political team, let alone brought Israel's factious opposition leaders (who have yet to agree to a group photograph) together. And he will go only so far this time: like most of Parliament's existing opposition leaders, he has pledged not to include an Arab party in his coalition.

He has also effectively ruled out a coalition with Israel's other most polarizing, and fastest-growing, demographic—ultra-Orthodox Jews. Unlike with Arab parties, however, excluding the ultra-Orthodox might be a politically savvy move. The demographic offers Bennett a wedge issue that could break Netanyahu's coalition apart: conscription. For decades, ultra-Orthodox rabbinical students have enjoyed a blanket exemption from the draft, which their leaders are keen to protect. But in 2023, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal, ordering the government to draw up legislation that would ensure equality among military-age youth. At first, the military was not eager to draft scores of teenage boys who lacked a basic education in math and English, demanded a special diet, strict Torah lessons, and distance from servicewomen. But October 7, which resulted in thousands of casualties and extended service for conscripts and reservists, changed perceptions. The rest of Israeli society grew furious that their youth had to serve while the ultra-Orthodox did not. The anger was most intense among religious nationalists, who serve while still observing Orthodox lifestyles—often on the frontlines and sometimes for most of their careers.

Finding a compromise that will satisfy both ultra-Orthodox rabbis and the law of the land has proved impossible so far, creating headaches for Netanyahu. The prime minister's coalition is built on his alliance with both ultra-Orthodox and nationalist Orthodox parties. The ultra-Orthodox parties left the Netanyahu government in July to push the prime minister into finding a workaround to the court's decision. But the ultra-Orthodox still clearly prefer Netanyahu to Bennett and his secular partners, and so they have not brought his government down. Religious nationalist voters are more likely to jump ship, and Bennett has tempted them by promising “an alliance of the serving.” Still, many of them also prefer the current prime minister's raw nationalism over his competitor's cooperation with the center left, who are less enthusiastic about West Bank settlements.

While Bennett puts together his campaign, and with the war over (or at least on pause), Netanyahu has resumed his efforts to make Israel an autocracy. The government has restarted its judicial upheaval, scoring its biggest public victory so far by taking down the military's chief legal officer, General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi. Tomer-Yerushalmi is hardly a paradigm of virtue: she repeatedly looked the other way as the armed forces were accused of war crimes. But when she prosecuted a team of reservists for torturing a prisoner from Gaza, she drew the rage of the government's supporters. Eventually, she was caught and arrested for leaking a video of the abuse and then covering up and lying about releasing the video. Tomer-Yerushalmi was then arrested, and Netanyahu's team has used her story to portray the judiciary as a collection of traitors who must be purged. Netanyahu has also announced support for executing terrorists, a core demand of Israel's far right, and has revived his attempts to sack Israel's attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara. As the country's top prosecutor, Baharav-Miara enjoys wide powers outside political control, which has allowed her to continue prosecuting the prime minister. Meanwhile, the government is advancing its theocratic authoritarianism through legislation, introducing a bill to give it more control over the media and a bill that would expand the powers of the rabbinical courts.

The fate of these efforts may determine what happens to the scandals involving both Netanyahu and his inner circle. In addition to his ongoing trial for three corruption charges, Jonathan Urich, Israel Einhorn, and Eli Feldstein—the spin masters who shaped Netanyahu's political messaging—are under criminal investigation for being on the payroll of both the prime minister and Qatar (the sponsor of Hamas) before and during the recent war. The prime minister's agreement to have Qatar fund Hamas in the years before October 7 has further fueled this controversy. The appointment of Zini to head the Shin Bet is widely seen as a maneuver to shut the case down, as well as another way to try getting rid of Baharav-Miara. The country's national police have already been deeply politicized by its minister, Ben-Gvir.

Police brutality and war fatigue has dulled protests. Still, given this parade of controversies, it can be hard to understand why Israelis might want to return Netanyahu to power even if the criminal cases go away, particularly after October 7. But the prime minister's supporters see the investigations into him as a deep-state plot to prevent Israel from transforming into the Jewish theocracy they want. In this way, they are not all that different from Trump's most ardent voters. The two leaders use similar playbooks. And in a country where U.S. support is paramount, Netanyahu has Trump's endorsement. Trump has even decried the trials against Netanyahu as a witch hunt, much as he decried his own. During his Knesset remarks, the U.S. president called on Israel's president to pardon the prime minister.

Netanyahu thus had every reason to smile as Trump spoke, even while preparing for the newest and toughest battle of his career. Winning reelection may be tougher than battling Hamas. But this is a familiar fight for Netanyahu—Israel's consummate survivor. He can emerge victorious.

 A Policy That Confuses Strength and Weakness

 Lael Brainard

The landmark meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in October brought a respite to the trade war and led to some reciprocal deals. But it did not suggest any breakthrough in addressing the problems that have fueled tensions between the two countries in recent years. Instead, the meeting confirmed the curious direction of U.S. China policy in Trump's second term. The president has not only broken with the policy of the Biden administration but also seems to have forsaken the strategic direction of his own first term.

For much of this century, U.S. policy toward China rested on a calculated bet that the country's integration into the global trading system would drive its political and economic liberalization—in alignment with U.S. interests. That bet did not pay off. China developed not into an economic partner but into a disruptive competitor bent on shaping the global order in its favor. Washington waited too long to counter Beijing, which allowed it to grow strong enough to edge out American industry in many areas.

Under the first Trump administration and then the Biden administration, the United States finally built a coherent strategy to confront China's growing economic power—one grounded in painful lessons from the past. But the second Trump administration is reversing that progress and offering a transactional, contradictory approach to replace it. The White House is imposing sweeping tariffs based on fiscal rather than strategic goals, alienating allies, weakening American innovation, placing national security on the bargaining table, and eroding the U.S. dollar's preeminence.

Trump's surprising pivot regarding China will not help make America great or put America first. It will only set Washington back relative to its chief rival. A better policy would double down on the United States' core strengths, not actively undermine them.

In 1995, China accounted for less than five percent of global manufacturing output. By 2010, that number had jumped to around a quarter, and today it stands at nearly a third. Those gains came on the back of the evaporation of manufacturing jobs elsewhere. China's share of U.S. imports climbed from eight percent in 2000 to 22 percent by 2018, all while American factory towns were hollowed out. Geopolitics compounded the domestic toll of economic dislocation: China was both a rising economic powerhouse and a strategic rival to the United States.

Instead of embracing liberalizing reform (as so many in the West assumed was inevitable), the Chinese Community Party tightened its grip, strengthened state capitalism, and maintained significant controls on foreign inflows of investment, trade, and information. Its massive trade imbalances were the result not of market forces but of a dense web of nonmarket interventions—industrial subsidies, discriminatory rules, currency management, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and cyber-intrusions—which imposed immense costs on U.S. workers and businesses.

It took a while for Washington to push back. Given the greater than threefold surge in Chinese imports between 2001 and 2008, the Bush administration could have invoked Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974—the “China safeguard,” negotiated specifically to protect U.S. industries from threats or disruptions caused by increased imports of Chinese goods—but it never did. The Obama administration used the safeguard once, on tires, but declined to apply it in sectors such as auto parts and solar panels, where state-supported Chinese manufacturers were undercutting Western innovators. U.S. policy neither protected American workers, companies, and technologies nor promoted investments to compensate for China's nonmarket interventions and level the playing field. Private-sector financing could not match the forbearance or patience of Chinese state financing in sectors that required tremendous capital.

Beijing also kept its currency artificially weak. Between 2001 and 2012, China's foreign exchange reserves soared from $212 billion to $3.3 trillion, and in 2007 its current account surplus swelled to more than ten percent of GDP, which contributed to the United States' lopsided deficit and the 2008 global financial crisis. Only in the wake of the crisis did the Obama administration finally negotiate a corrective: a 16 percent appreciation of the Chinese currency against the dollar and a reduction of China's current account surplus to two percent of GDP.



In recent years, China has also begun to challenge the dollar-based order—that is, the U.S. dollar's centrality in the global trading system—after being a major beneficiary of that order for several decades. What began as an effort to internationalize the renminbi morphed into a de-dollarization campaign, which picked up speed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the ensuing Western sanctions. Those sanctions underscored the leverage conferred by the dollar's dominance.

U.S. officials began to more firmly revise their approach to China by the mid-2010s. The first Trump administration marked a sharp break from the previous course. In 2018, it imposed tariffs on nearly half of U.S. imports from China. Although this sweeping approach led to higher prices on many products and greater imports from third countries, it started to loosen the codependence of the two economies. The pandemic accelerated this decoupling.

The Biden administration built on that foundation. Rather than imposing duties across the board, it raised tariffs steeply on select Chinese imports in sectors vital to national security, clean energy, and technological leadership, in which China appeared determined to dominate global supply, and removed tariffs on inputs imported from other countries. The administration combined these defensive measures with offensive investment incentives for the domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy technologies, secured through legislation. For the first time in decades, Washington married trade protection with industrial renewal and supply chain diversification.

This strategy also recognized that maintaining the U.S. lead over China would require coordination with allies. Both the Trump and the Biden administrations applied restrictions on select semiconductor exports to China; the Biden administration also enlisted Japan and the Netherlands to jointly implement export controls on semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Washington understood that it could not grapple with Chinese practices on its own. By 2024, bipartisan support had coalesced around a strategy of selective protection and controls, strategic investment, and allied cooperation to counter the national security and economic risks of dependence on China.

Trump returned to office in 2025 after a campaign that repeated his familiar rhetoric about China. But his second administration has not simply picked up where it left off. Instead, it has been reversing U.S. strategy on almost every front.

Take, for instance, Trump's use of tariffs. The administration's tariff policy is driven by fiscal arithmetic rather than strategic calculus. It is imposing steep rates on all trade partners—not just China—in order to raise between $300 billion and $400 billion in annual revenue to offset the shortfall produced by new tax cuts. These tariffs, designed to fill budget gaps, in fact amount to a tax on American manufacturers and consumers. The majority of U.S. imports are industrial inputs, so U.S. manufacturers will face higher input costs than their foreign competitors as a result of the tariffs. General Motors and Ford are projecting several billion dollars in additional tariff costs this year, even after winning some initial relief.

In addition, at the very moment when Washington needs allies and partners more than ever, these sweeping unilateral tariffs are alienating U.S. partners. The administration has imposed duties on close allies with whom it has a trade surplus, such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Between the Trump administration's focus on maximizing revenues and China's retaliatory power, tariffs on some friendly countries are now higher than those on China. Following the understanding reached between Trump and Xi in their recent meeting, tariffs on India and Vietnam exceed those on China, and Switzerland's and Brazil's rates are only slightly lower. Even Canada, a North American ally that joined Washington in setting 100 percent tariffs on Chinese auto imports in 2024, is facing high tariffs on many goods as a result of petty irritants, such as an ad about tariffs aired by the government of Ontario. Imports from China now face a smaller penalty, relative to imports from elsewhere, than they did before Trump began his second term—a puzzling reversal. While Beijing is bolstering production networks and investing in infrastructure in countries in Southeast Asia, Washington is penalizing those countries with punitive tariffs. It is hardly surprising, then, that many U.S. allies and partners are considering trade arrangements that would exclude the United States.



Alongside raising costs and alienating allies, current policy is weakening the American innovation ecosystem. The administration has slashed funding for federal and university research and severely restricted visas for foreign scientists and technologists. The administration's termination of incentives for innovation and investment in clean energy is a strategic setback in the race to dominate advanced AI, in which low-cost energy from multiple sources will be crucial to powering the expansion of AI data centers. Similarly, domestic investment incentives for electric vehicles, batteries, and alternative energy were designed to give U.S. auto companies a better chance to compete with China's surging EV producers. But the administration has suspended many of those incentives, jeopardizing key business investments and the high-paying jobs they were poised to create in factory towns. Ceding dominance of the EV industry to China also means ceding ground on advancements in autonomous vehicles and drones, as well as in battery technology, which is critical for grid storage and electronics.

The Biden administration understood the important role that government could play in spurring innovation in the private sector. Under the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in August 2022, the United States was on track to restore domestic manufacturing of advanced semiconductors—with its global share of production projected to reach nearly 30 percent by 2032, up from zero in 2022—and had attracted the world's leading advanced semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, to fabricate chips in the United States. But the Trump administration has converted final CHIPS grants that provided for “upside sharing”—that is, when companies receiving $150 million or more in federal funding shared a portion of their profits with the U.S. government when returns materially exceeded projections—into a government equity stake that no longer requires companies to meet advanced manufacturing benchmarks. This move is uncomfortably reminiscent of China's state capitalism, not to mention the attendant risks of cronyism.

The second Trump administration also appears to be backing away from a settled bipartisan strategy of implementing technology export controls at a time when advanced AI accelerators are one of the core advantages sustaining the U.S. lead in the AI race. The first Trump administration initiated the use of semiconductor export controls on some Chinese entities, and the Biden administration expanded these in collaboration with foreign partners. So it came as a surprise when the Trump administration rescinded some restrictions in July after Beijing threatened to curtail rare-earth magnet supplies. Beijing has systematically strengthened its own export controls since the first Trump administration. Partly as a result, the second Trump administration has seemed willing to negotiate over certain key U.S. controls. In an August press conference, the president confirmed a deal under which American producers could obtain licenses to export chips to China by sharing 15 percent of the revenues with the government—another triumph of fiscal considerations over strategy.

An emboldened Beijing tested American resolve again in October by expanding its restrictions on rare-earths exports. In the deal that emerged from the bilateral meeting later that month, the United States committed to a one-year delay on extending its list of restricted entities to majority affiliates in return for a one-year delay on China's rare-earths restrictions. This deal with Beijing crossed a decades-old redline maintained by U.S. administrations of both parties that national security technology controls are not on the table in trade negotiations. Moreover, if the president's public musings give any indication of future policy, it may be only a matter of time before he decides to put Nvidia's Blackwell chips on the negotiating table, which would be a serious own goal, ceding to China a key U.S. advantage in the AI race.



Finally, the second Trump administration is undermining confidence in the foundations of dollar dominance, just as China accelerates efforts to challenge it. Dollar dominance is not merely symbolic: it underpins global demand for U.S. Treasuries and enables the selective use of sanctions to advance national security goals. It also allows the United States to borrow in its own currency at lower rates and save an estimated $100 billion to $200 billion a year in interest, which translates to lower rates on mortgages and car loans for Americans.

These benefits reflect investor faith that the United States will remain highly creditworthy, inflation will be low, and the dollar will hold its value. Yet the administration's fiscal and institutional carelessness has begun to test investor faith. It signed into law a $4 trillion expansion of federal debt, despite a U.S. credit downgrade that weakened the dollar and raised the yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries to more than five percent.

The White House has mounted an unprecedented attack on the independence of the Federal Reserve—threatening to fire its chair, attempting to remove a Senate-confirmed governor without due process, and appointing a governor who remains on the president's staff. Trump has called on the Fed to lower interest rates to reduce payments on the federal debt, even though investors would demand higher interest rates on long-term Treasuries if they expected the Federal Reserve to prioritize reducing debt payments over controlling inflation. Congress has been surprisingly acquiescent, considering that it originally delegated its own constitutional power over currency to the Federal Reserve and legislated a for-cause removal safeguard to protect the Fed from political interference.

These actions jeopardize confidence in U.S. creditworthiness and institutional independence—key pillars of the dollar's global role. Although renminbi-denominated capital markets lack the liquidity and depth to replace the dollar outright, Beijing's de-dollarization campaign could progressively erode the network benefits that sustain U.S. financial primacy. The fact that there is currently no single alternative to the dollar should be cold comfort at a time when foreign central banks are increasing the share of gold in their reserves to rival the share of U.S. Treasuries, and foreigners are hedging more of their exposure to dollar assets. As I have noted in Foreign Affairs, Americans will pay the price if the dollar loses its preeminence.

Trump's economic strategy toward China is effectively unwinding the progress made not just by the Biden administration but also by Trump's first administration. Sweeping tariffs designed to maximize revenue are hurting American manufacturers and straining consumers. They are alienating U.S. allies and partners and fracturing the coalitions needed to sustain U.S. technological leadership. By weakening the country's world-class innovation ecosystem, eliminating advanced manufacturing and clean energy investment incentives, and reversing technology export controls, current policy is undermining key U.S. industries. Fiscal profligacy and political meddling in monetary policy are eroding the foundations of dollar dominance. China stands to gain from all these measures.

The core objective of U.S. China economic policy should be to sustain American preeminence in vital sectors into the future. A winning strategy for Washington—one that is truly “America first”—would impose targeted tariffs on Chinese imports so that Beijing does not have a chokehold on any node of the supply chain in strategic sectors. At the same time, the United States should strive to attract, rather than attack, allies and partners, using preferential access; investment partnerships, including in critical minerals and rare earths; and regulatory alignment to place the United States at the center of the world's leading technology ecosystem.

Maintaining U.S. tech leadership relative to China requires incentivizing private-sector investments in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and rare earths. Supporting partnerships between universities, federal research, and businesses and attracting and developing the world's best talent will spur greater innovation and sustain U.S. leadership in advanced AI and other industries. A smart U.S. economic strategy would also buttress, not bargain away, targeted export controls on advanced semiconductor technology to sustain the U.S. lead in frontier AI models for as long as possible.

Washington should also safeguard dollar dominance at a time when China is working with other countries to erode the dollar's central role. The United States should maintain the dollar's incumbency advantage by demonstrating its commitment to the international financial system, fiscal sustainability, and the institutional independence of the Federal Reserve.

The competition with China will hinge not on mimicking Beijing's methods but on buttressing the core strengths of the United States. To sustain preeminence, Washington must reinforce its institutions, alliances, and incumbency advantages—not erode them.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","Trump's NASA pick has the space community buzzing with a leaked plan for the agency","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-project-athena","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:07:37 GMT","


            A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump's on-again-off-again pick to run NASA, billionaire Jared Isaacman, outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency.
    


            Isaacman, who was tapped to be NASA administrator after Trump was elected in 2024, only to see his nomination retracted months later, was renominated for the top job last Tuesday.
    


            While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he said in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete.
    


            It nonetheless set off a flurry of speculation about how the space agency would function with Isaacman at the helm. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN.
    


            In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman said that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.”
    


            “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads.
    


            Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency.
    


            If enacted, many of the policies laid out could significantly alter the day-to-day lives of NASA workers and transform the 67-year-old agency.
    


            “I think it is presenting a more dramatic set of changes than many in the space community were expecting,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, of the document.
    


            Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country.
    


            Isaacman still faces a confirmation vote in the Senate and would need Congressional approval for many of the objectives mapped out in the document.
    


            As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice flown to orbit on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA's top role.
    


            Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants.
    


            But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he's perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era.
    


            According to a source familiar with the matter, the original Project Athena document was more than 100 pages. Isaacman made only three hard copies of a truncated 62-page version and distributed them to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and his chief of staff. The leak — according to a recent Ars Technica report and a source who confirmed the account to CNN — looked to have been part of an effort by Duffy, who is temporarily running NASA, to spur controversy and potentially thwart Isaacman's renomination.
    


            CNN previously reported that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he's said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.)
    


            “If there is any friction, I suspect it is more political operators causing the controversy,” Isaacman said.
    


            Isaacman was renominated for the NASA post on November 4, one day after reports about the Athena document began circulating in the news.
    


            “I think (the people who leaked Project Athena) thought this would ruffle feathers amongst the delegations that care about human spaceflight,” said one former NASA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private document. “I will tell you — it hasn't worked.”
    


            CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — the home of Goddard Space Flight Center — offered the most detailed responses.
    


            Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.”
    


            “To protect our nation's innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration's chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said.
    


            Warner, whose state houses NASA's Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.”
    


            “The reported proposals to downsize or privatize key missions at Langley and Wallops would be a serious mistake, jeopardizing critical scientific capabilities and the talented workforce whose expertise keeps the United States at the forefront of aerospace research,” Warner's statement reads.
    


            No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman's confirmation.
    


            One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.”
    


            Much of that vision, the source familiar with the document told CNN, was intended to align NASA with SpaceX's goal of sending an uncrewed Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface next year.
    


            SpaceX's plan, which CEO Elon Musk discussed publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The thinking was that NASA could step in to provide support through the Olympus program at minimal cost to taxpayers, according to the source.
    


            The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel.
    


            Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for RealClearScience that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.”
    


            Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues.
    


            “Our competitors are not waiting. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. If America wants to lead, NASA must take on the hard problems again and do the near-impossible,” Isaacman and Gingrich wrote in the article.
    


            Project Athena also suggests setting up a demonstration mission to dock a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft with a crewed vehicle in orbit, according to the leaked paper.
    


            Isaacman's nuclear vision also proposes that NASA centers working on projects like the Space Launch System rocket — including the Marshall and Michoud facilities in Alabama and Louisiana — shift their focus to nuclear electric propulsion development when the SLS program concludes.
    


            When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.”
    


            The source familiar with the document noted that it was crafted around the same time the Trump White House drafted the President's Budget Request, or PBR, which called for canceling NASA's SLS rocket and some other major projects that could have left multiple NASA centers without a cornerstone program.
    


            The source said that Isaacman began compiling the Project Athena document in late 2024 and updated it as he had conversations with policymakers. The source also said that Isaacman did not help draft the PBR.
    


            With this summer's “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research.
    


            Isaacman said November 4 on social media that he hopes to zero-in on those pursuits only after a “foundation” of lunar exploration has been built.
    


            When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his inaugural address while staying silent on NASA's ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon.
    


            Isaacman echoed Trump's Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA's moon program. However, questions about how he would fund such projects loomed.
    


            In the months since, however, the moon has emerged as the clear policy priority amid a renewed space race with China, which is aiming to land its taikonauts on the lunar surface by 2030.
    


            The recent push to bolster NASA's moon missions, including a $10 billion influx Congress gave the agency's human spaceflight efforts in July, “brings clarity to the topic,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.
    


            But Isaacman is back in the running for the top NASA job at a time when the agency's plans for a crewed moon landing, called Artemis III, are in flux.
    


            The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX's Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface.
    


            But some policy experts have grown increasingly concerned that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA's urgent timeline.
    


            Duffy recently signaled a willingness to boot SpaceX off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers.
    


            Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman's, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “Sean Dummy.”
    


            Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander.
    


            The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.
    


            “The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman said. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.”
    


            The source familiar with the Project Athena document said some of the more controversial aspects of the plan warrant more explanation.
    


            One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation's ability to gather crucial environmental data.
    


            The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA's initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects.
    


            Such measures, calling for researchers to focus on purchasing data from the private sector, could mark a significant change for the agency.
    


            Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a pair of Mars missions were lost.
    


            And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman's Athena document suggests it can, he said.
    


            “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn't had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said.
    


            Isaacman's social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?”
    


            Isaacman has also publicly defended science programs such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was slated for budget cuts in the PBR. And he stated he'd be willing to spend his own money to get the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope off the ground. “I was prepared to personally cover the cost to launch Roman — if that's what it took to get to the science,” Isaacman said in a June social media post. (That same promise appears in the Project Athena document.)
    


            “Anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue,” Isaacman's November 4 statement reads.
    


            Among the other proposals in the Project Athena document are plans to hasten NASA's reorganization. The agency has already lost roughly 4,000 of its 18,000 employees as part of the Trump administration's deferred resignation program.
    


            Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.”
    


            Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been reeling from looming budget cuts and what employees have described as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership.
    


            Isaacman's document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA's boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency's approach to risk assessment.
    


            “We will ensure safety is at the forefront of our decisions but achieving the mission of NASA means accepting that some risks are worth taking,” the document reads.
    


            Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency.
    


            It would be unwise, he added, to start eliminating safety organizations — but they could be revamped to create a “healthy tension” between risk assessors and engineers seeking to push boundaries.
    


            However, he cautioned that “it's really hard to know in the moment if you're going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It's a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.”
    


            Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change.
    


            In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump's proposed cuts to research.
    


            Isaacman's renomination to the NASA chief job now presents “a good opportunity to engage on some of these proposals, particularly as they relate to science,” Dreier added.
    


            In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.”
    


            But he did not wish to debate the plan “line-by-line while NASA and the rest of the government are going through a shutdown,” according to the November 4 post.
    


            More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.
    


            In a social media post in June, for example, Isaacman wrote that he “didn't love” being approached by “people who thought they were uniquely NASA's savior.” He added: “I have little interest in doing the same.”

            The Senate on Sunday advanced a deal that would bring an end to the shutdown by extending government funding through January that would be tied to a larger package to fully fund several key agencies.
    


            The weekend vote tees up another vote in the chamber this week to pass it and send it the House. After the House gives it final passage, President Donald Trump can sign it into law to officially end the longest shutdown in US history.

            • Deal reached: GOP leaders are trying to push a funding bill as quickly as possible after the Senate took a key step last night toward reopening the government. Eight Democrats joined Republicans to advance a federal funding measure, which the White House endorsed, in exchange for a future vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care subsidies.
    


            • What next?: Senators need to agree on how long to debate before voting on the final bill. This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process. The House will have to return and adopt the deal struck in the Senate before it is sent to President Donald Trump's desk to be signed.
    


            • Ongoing impacts: An appeals court rejected the Trump administration's effort to block fully paying food stamp benefits in November, but many recipients are still in limbo. Meanwhile, more staffing issues are being reported at airports after the worst weekend for air traffic control staffing since the start of the shutdown.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he hopes his chamber can pass the compromise government funding package within “hours,” as leadership sorts through whether any lawmakers will hold up the process.
    


                    “We will be voting on the final package in the very near future, and I'm hoping that will be hours and not days,” he said on the Senate floor, detailing the impacts of the record-breaking shutdown that have “snowballed” over the past 41 days.
                





            “All of us, Democrat and Republican who voted for last night's bill are well aware of the facts, and I am grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro-bill or anti-bill, not to stand in the way of ever being able to deliver the coming relief quickly. The American people have suffered for long enough,” he said.
    


            Thune urged his colleagues not to “pointlessly drag this bill out” so the House can take it up quickly and send it to President Donald Trump's desk to reopen the government.
    


            The GOP leader told reporters that his team is “waiting” to hear what Democrats will ask for in order to reach a timing agreement to move the bill to the floor.
    


            “I don't think it's in anybody's best interest to drag this out. So hopefully we'll be — that would be the best outcome, I think, to get it done,” he said.
    


            Asked about the potential that Sen. Rand Paul, the only Republican who consistently voted with Democrats to block a short-term funding package, might hold up the process over a demand on an amendment related to agriculture appropriations, Thune responded: “We will cross that bridge when we come to it. When we hear from the Dems about whether or not they're ready to move, then we'll figure out the rest of it with our objector.”
    


            A group of Democrats and one Democratic-aligned independent helped clinch an agreement to end the government shutdown, saying they had secured a vote on the Affordable Care Act subsidies at the center of the standoff.
    


            Here's a look at some of those lawmakers, none of whom are up for reelection in next year's midterms, and their rationale for ending the shutdown:
    


This post has been updated. 



            Reports of staffing issues at Federal Aviation Administration faculties has gone up to 17 for the day Monday, according to the latest publicly available operations plans.
    


            New delays are reported for flights arriving or departing Nashville of 30 minutes. The tower there is short-staffed until 1:30 p.m. ET. Las Vegas is also reporting delays averaging 45 minutes, according to FAA advisories.
    


            Delays for flights headed to Phoenix averaging nearly an hour. The TRACON, which controls flights approaching or departing the city, is short-staffed until 5 p.m. ET.
    


            Chicago's O'Hare International Airport also has a short-staffed tower until 3 p.m. ET and is reporting delays for arrivals and departures of more than half an hour. The FAA TRACON for Chicago is also without their normal number of controllers today.  The city is getting hit with a snowstorm today which has affected air travel.
    


            An earlier ground stop was lifted for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, but delays are likely to continue. The DFW tower is short-staffed until 2 p.m. ET and the Air Route Traffic Control Center there, which deals with flights at high altitudes, is short-staffed until 1 p.m. ET.
    


            TRACONs in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, New York, Newark, Orlando and two parts of Southern California are also short-staffed and some delays are expected.
    


            Two parts of the Air Route Traffic Control Centers in Jacksonville and one in Oakland also report being understaffed Monday.
    


            There were 146 staffing problems reported from Friday morning to Sunday night, making it the worst weekend since the start of the shutdown. There have been 607 reports of short staffing since October 1, more than six times as many as were reported on the same dates last year.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans that he is hoping to vote on the Senate's deal to end the government shutdown on Wednesday, according to a source on Monday's House GOP conference call.
    


            Johnson also would not commit to holding a separate vote on the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to a separate source on the call.
    


            The Wednesday projection from Johnson is to help members get back to Washington, DC, from their districts amid increasing flight delays and cancellations. It is not official yet.
    


            The House would only vote Wednesday if the Senate finished their work before then.
    


            The White House on Monday threw its support behind a Senate plan to reopen the government, calling the funding deal a “positive development” toward ending the record-long shutdown.
    


                    “President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down,” a White House official said in a statement. “The action in the Senate is a positive development and we look forward to seeing it progress.”
                





            The endorsement comes a day after eight Democratic senators joined Republicans to advance a measure funding the government into January in exchange for a promised vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.
    


            The Senate is expected to pass the funding bill in the coming days, setting up a subsequent vote in the House that could end the shutdown as soon as this week.
    


            Trump and Republicans have opposed continuing the ACA subsidies at the center of the shutdown negotiations, and GOP leaders have refused to guarantee that the extension measure will receive a similar vote in the House.
    


            Speaker Mike Johnson plans to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona this week when the House returns for a funding measure to reopen the government after a weekslong stalemate, according to a source familiar with the plans.
    


            Grijalva was elected September 23, but Johnson refused to swear her in until Senate Democrats agreed to reopen the government. That delay drew fierce scrutiny from congressional Democrats, who pointed to other instances in which lawmakers were sworn in during shutdowns.
    


            Johnson repeatedly said he would officially swear in Grijalva when the Senate passed a funding deal and required the House to return. The swearing-in is expected to take place after the House gavels in but before a possible vote on government funding.
    


            Once Grijalva is sworn in, she is expected to provide the final signature necessary to bypass leadership and force a vote on compelling the release of files in the Jeffrey Epstein case. But that will not be immediate. Once she officially becomes the 218th lawmaker to support the measure, it will take at least seven legislative days before it can be brought to the floor, and House leaders can take up to two legislative days before putting it to a vote.
    


            Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the Democrats who last night voted in favor of a funding bill to end the government shutdown, responded to fellow Democrats who have criticized the group for siding with Republicans on legislation that does not include a guaranteed extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies.
    


            “Staying in a shutdown mode was not getting us anywhere, and they need to train their fire on the people who are responsible — that's President Donald Trump, it's Speaker [Mike] Johnson, and it's the Republicans who have blocked every attempt to get health care. We need to be working together,” Shaheen said on CNN News Central.
    


            Some Democrats have called out Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for failing to keep Democrats united, including Rep. Ro Khanna, who said Schumer is “no longer effective and should be replaced.”
    


            Shaheen addressed those critics in an earlier appearance Monday on CBS Mornings: “House members who are critical should stay focused on what they can do in the House to ensure that we have a vote on health care,” she said.
    


            The New Hampshire senator added, “What this agreement is going to do is it's going to force Speaker Johnson to bring the House back in. It's going to force him to come back in and to deal with health care and all kinds of other issues.”
    


            Johnson has not said if he would bring a bill extending health care subsidies to the House floor.
    


            Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said he will take “take anything that recognizes these hardworking men and women,” when asked during a news conference Monday for his response to Trump saying he would recommend a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers who did not take off work during the shutdown.
    


            Daniels said he is willing to work with the Trump administration “on any issues that are out there.” However, Daniels also insisted he did not want air traffic controllers to be used as political pawns.
    


            “Air traffic controllers have continued to show up during the shutdown,” Daniels said. “They've endured the longest shutdown in American history, and every single day they absolutely, not only deserve their pay, they deserve to be recognized for what's going on.”
    


            We're hearing from a senator who caucuses with Democrats and broke ranks to advance a funding measure to potentially end the government shutdown.
    


            Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said he voted with Republicans because Democrats' goals were stalled.
    


            King said that the Democratic strategy at the beginning of the shutdown was two-fold: to stand up to Donald Trump and bring the Republicans to the table to negotiate an end to the “drastic increases” to the Affordable Care Act premiums.
    


            “The problem was, after over 40 days, neither of those goals was being accomplished. And in the meantime, a lot of collateral damage was happening. People's lives were being hurt,” he explained on CNN's “The Situation Room” this morning.
    


            “And so the question I was wrestling with is, if the tactic isn't working and there were no prospects that it was going to work, then let's move on, not make a lot of other people suffer in order to get a goal that wasn't attainable,” King said.
    


            King went on to discuss the benefits of the current deal, including “three appropriations bills” that he said weren't in the “original discussion.” He noted that one of them related to agriculture would keep SNAP benefits “safe” until next year.
    


            He added that Senate Majority Leader John Thune has also agreed to bring a bill drafted by Democrats on Affordable Care Act subsidies to the Senate floor for a vote.  “Historically, that doesn't happen,” King said.
    


            He said while the chances of Republicans voting for the extension of subsidies are low, yesterday “the chances were zero of getting anything on the ACA.”
    


            Asked if he believes the government will reopen this week, King said, “I do.”
    


            President Donald Trump demanded Monday that all air traffic controllers “get back to work, NOW,” warning that those who don't would face penalties while promising bonuses for those who have worked during the government shutdown.
    


            “Anyone who doesn't will be substantially ‘docked.' For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS, and didn't take ANY TIME OFF for the ‘Democrat Shutdown Hoax,' I will be recommending a BONUS of $10,000 per person for distinguished service to our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, going on to add that those who didn't work “will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record.”
    


            After the worst weekend for air traffic control staffing since the shutdown began, delays due to staffing problems were already reported Monday morning, despite a potential deal to end the government shutdown. Controllers are required to show up for their job during the shutdown but are not being paid.
    


            Trump's own Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said controllers were considering taking second jobs to make ends meet. He had previously cited controllers talking about driving for rideshare companies like Uber or delivering food on DoorDash to pay bills.
    


            Trump on Monday also urged any controllers who wish to leave to do so, without “payment or severance of any kind,” adding that they would be replaced by “true patriots.”
    


            “For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,” Trump wrote.
    


            “If you want to leave service in the near future, please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind! You will be quickly replaced by true Patriots,” he added.
    


            The leader of the labor union representing air traffic controllers called on Congress to end the government shutdown as soon as possible, warning that added stresses and pressures threatens the safety of the flying public.
    


            “The fatigue has led to the erosion of safety and the increased risk every day that this shutdown drags on,” Nick Daniels, President of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association said at a news conference Monday. “If you want to know what the real fallout of this shutdown is, it's not a budget line, it is the smallest and the most dangerous shift of all– when the most disciplined safety workforce in America is forced to think about survival instead of public safety.”
    


            More air traffic control staffing problems were reported this past weekend than any other weekend since the start of the shutdown, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Aviation Administration operations plans. Air traffic controllers must work without pay during the shutdown, and have now received two $0 paychecks. Some workers are calling out.
    


            “Air traffic controllers must show up day in and day out, fully prepared to handle the stress, pressure and the weight of their responsibilities to the American flying public and their safety…” Daniels said. “But now they must focus on child care instead of traffic flows, food for their families instead of runway separation.”
    


            The Trump administration told the Supreme Court today that it will continue to fight to withhold full food stamp benefits to states during the government shutdown, keeping in play a high-profile case that would likely be dismissed if federal agencies are reopened.
    


            The Trump administration is fighting a lower court order that required it to use $4 billion from another fund to full pay for SNAP benefits. On Friday, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson halted that court order temporarily – effectively allowing the administration to pay reduced benefits for a few days while courts consider the fast-moving case. Those reduced payments are being paid for with separate contingency funds.
    


Two major developments took place over the weekend: An appeals court in Boston upheld the lower court order that required the full payments to be made. And the Senate moved toward an agreement that could end the historic shutdown.
    


What may happen next: For now, Jackson's order blocking the full payments remains in effect – despite the appeals court ruling – through Tuesday night. If the government shutdown is not ended by then, Jackson could extend her order, or the full Supreme Court could decide what to do with Trump's emergency request. If government funds begin flowing again by Tuesday, then the appeal pending before the Supreme Court would likely be dismissed as moot.
    


            “That proposal, if ultimately adopted by both Houses of Congress and signed by the president, would end the shutdown and moot this application,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in his letter.
    


            But for now, Sauer said in the letter, the administration will continue to fight to withhold the full benefits.
    


            It's a busy day in Washington, DC, following last night's breakthrough vote in the Senate, where a funding measure advanced and put Congress on a path which will potentially end the longest government shutdown in US history.
    


            Here's what's happening at the White House, according to the president's schedule, and on Capitol Hill:
    


            We'll keep you updated on this throughout the day, stay with us.
    


CNN's Mostafa Salem contributed to this post.



            There have already been 11 reports of staffing issues at Federal Aviation Administration facilities as of 10:30 a.m. Monday.
    


            Delays are reported for flights heading to Phoenix averaging more than two hours. The TRACON, which controls flights approaching or departing the city, is short-staffed until 5 p.m. ET. Las Vegas is also reporting delays averaging 45 minutes, according to FAA advisories.

            House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the Senate for reaching a deal to end the government shutdown and warned his members they will soon have to return to Washington.
    


            “At least some Democrats now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks,” he said.
    


            Johnson said he will give a 36-hour notice to House members as soon as senators have final passage of the continuing resolution, or CR, in their chamber and send it for a vote in the House.
    


                    “I'm stating the obvious, all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible,” he said.
                





            Johnson, who has kept the House out of session for weeks, said members should expect “long days and long nights.”
    


            “And we look forward to the government reopening this week so Congress can get back, get back to our regular legislative session. We have a lot of business to do, as you all know, and we will be working in earnest. Will be there'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” he said.
    


            Johnson did not say mention when he would swear in Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona.
    


            Johnson did not take questions, saying he is planning to have many of his own questions answered later today.
    


            Dozens of major airports have implemented a government-mandated 4% reduction in flights and air traffic control staffing just experienced its worst weekend since the start of the government shutdown.
    


            So it's possible you may not have the smoothest travel experience while flying right now.
    


            “You really have to be an informed traveler right now,” Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy travel site, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday.
    


Here are some of his tips:



            With Thanksgiving and the holiday season on the horizon, Henderson says it's possible residual impacts could linger, even if the shutdown is resolved soon.
    


            He suggests considering options other than flying, such as taking Amtrak or driving to your destination.
    


            We're continuing to cover the impacts of the historic government shutdown today after the Senate took a critical step forward on Sunday to advance a funding bill — putting Congress on a path to ending the shutdown.
    


            A key group of eight Senate Democratic centrists broke with party leaders, striking a deal with Senate Republicans and the White House.
    


            If you're just joining us, here's how we got here and where things stand as of this morning:
    


            We can bring you these pictures from yesterday showing the impact of the weekend's 4% cut to flight traffic and shortage of air traffic controllers — with more staffing problems reported this weekend than any other since the start of the government shutdown.
    


            As we've been reporting, an end could be in sight for the shutdown after eight Democrats joined with Republicans on a key vote to advance a federal funding measure.
    


            One couple's travel plans went from bad to worse as they were left stranded on a highway during the Chicago snowstorm Monday morning.
    


            Grace Butler and her boyfriend were traveling on I-57 near Onarga, Illinois, when the snowy conditions took over and visibility was slim.
    


            Onarga is about 125 miles south of Chicago.
    


            They were driving back to the Chicago area from New Orleans after their flight was canceled Sunday due to air travel snarls caused by the government shutdown, Butler explained to CNN.
    


            As the snow continued to fall, they were left stranded on the highway for nearly two hours early Monday morning.
    


                    “No visibility, road is covered with snow and ice. Have lived in Chicago my whole life and never seen a blizzard this bad,” Butler said.
                





            As of about 6 a.m. CT, Butler said they were finally able to begin driving again and have passed many cars in ditches along the way.
    


Get a glimpse at what the conditions looked like:



            Delays due to staffing problems are already reported Monday morning, despite a potential deal to end the government shutdown and after the worst weekend for air traffic control staffing since the shutdown began.
    


            A ground stop was reported this morning at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, according to a Federal Aviation Administration advisory.  The tower at the Texas airport will not have its normal number of controllers until 2 p.m. ET.  Flights headed to DFW will wait on the ground an average of 76 minutes.
    


            Chicago's O'Hare International Airport also has a short-staffed tower until 3 p.m. ET.  The city is getting hit with a snowstorm today which will also affect air travel. The FAA TRACON operations controlling flights approaching or departing Chicago are also without their normal number of controllers today.
    


            TRACONs in Atlanta, Detroit, and Newark are also short-staffed and some delays are expected.

            Tens of millions of Americans who rely on the nation's largest federal food assistance program have been caught in a weekslong swirl of Trump administration pronouncements, court orders and anxiety since the US government shutdown has called their ability to buy groceries into question.
    


            Some recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, the program formerly known as food stamps, have received their full benefits this month, while others have only received a fraction of their usual allotment, while still others remain in limbo, uncertain if or when their payments will arrive.
    


            In response, a group of Democratic-led states and a coalition of cities, nonprofits, unions and small businesses have launched fast-moving legal challenges seeking to restore full benefits.
    


            The fight over food benefits has become a central flashpoint between all three branches of government during the historically long shutdown as one of the clearest and most tangible ways the impasse is affecting Americans' daily lives.
    


            While a bipartisan Senate deal has emerged to fund the government through January 30 and ensure SNAP benefits through fiscal year 2026, the successful procedural vote is only a first step. The measure must still pass the full Senate and the House before heading to the president's desk.
    


            At stake is critical assistance nearly 42 million people rely on to feed themselves and their families. On average, households receive about $350 a month in benefits.
    


            Here's where things stand:
    


            It is still unclear when all recipients will receive their full allotment for November.
    


            Much depends on when – and whether – Congress actually approves a short-term spending package to temporarily fund federal agencies and reopen the government, and whether President Donald Trump signs it, which could take several more days to play out.

            If the deal falls through and the government remains shuttered, exactly how SNAP gets funded in the short term will continue to play out in the courts.
    


            At issue now is a lower court ruling ordering the US Department of Agriculture – which administers SNAP funds on the federal level – to swiftly issue full food stamp benefits to all recipients. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson temporarily halted the lower court ruling on Friday evening to allow the appeal to play out.
    


            Late Sunday, the First Circuit Court of Appeals declined a request by the Trump administration to block the lower court ruling, but the ruling has no immediate effect because Jackson's temporary hold remains in place.
    


            Even after funding is decided and the USDA directs states to provide enrollees with their usual allotment, the timing of the benefits arriving will depend on the state: Some will be able to act immediately, while others may need more time.
    


            After a federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to pay full SNAP benefits – and the agency issued guidance on Friday saying it was complying – several states rushed to distribute to recipients their full November allotment.
    


            Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Kansas, New York, Massachusetts, California, Michigan, Colorado, New Mexico, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and Oregon are among the states to issue full SNAP benefits to at least some of their residents in recent days.
    


            Several states have said they will not seek to undo those distributions, as ordered Saturday by the USDA. The states argue they issued the full benefits before Jackson's pause.
    


            North Carolina, meanwhile, issued partial benefits to recipients on Friday but has halted further action in light of Jackson's stay.
    


            At the heart of the turmoil is whether the USDA must pay full SNAP benefits without new funding from Congress and if courts can force the agency to fund the program during the shutdown.
    


            Last month, the USDA said it would not use its roughly $5.3 billion contingency fund to provide at least partial payments for November. Full benefits for November are expected to total around $8.2 billion and other expenses push the total cost to nearly $9 billion.
    


            Lawsuits surfaced against the Trump administration, and on Halloween, two federal judges rejected the agency's claim the contingency fund was untouchable and said the administration was required to tap into billions of those dollars to at least partially cover food stamp benefits in November.
    


Millions of Americans are facing delays for their SNAP food assistance. Here's who relies on the program



            Days after the administration committed to providing 50% – and then 65% – of the maximum allotments at the order of a federal judge in Rhode Island, the judge then said the government must immediately pivot to fully cover SNAP for tens of millions of Americans because some states might not be able to send partial payments for weeks or even months.
    


            “People have gone without for too long,” US District Judge John McConnell said during a hastily called hearing Thursday. “Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable.”
    


            Hours later, the Trump administration filed an appeal seeking to stay McConnell's decision. Still, the USDA announced Friday it was working to fully fund food stamp benefits for November to comply with McConnell's order.
    


            That evening, Jackson granted the administration's request for a temporary pause, saying the government did not have to immediately transfer additional funds to provide full benefits.
    


            Jackson's order does not resolve the underlying legal questions raised by the case – and the Trump administration has already committed to using the program's contingency fund to partially pay benefits. Rather, Jackson's administrative stay freezes any additional action by the administration to give an appeals court additional time to review the case.
    


            Following the justice's order, the USDA ordered states to stop issuing full food stamp benefits for November and to “immediately undo” any issuance of the full allotments. In the Saturday directive, the USDA told states to instead proceed with issuing partial benefits.
    


            “To the extent States sent full SNAP payment files for November 2025, this was unauthorized,” Patrick Penn, a top USDA official, wrote in the memo. “Accordingly, States must immediately undo any steps taken to issue full SNAP benefits for November 2025.”
    


            States failing to comply could face a cancellation of federal cost-sharing of SNAP, as well as be financially responsible for over-issuances of benefits, the memo said.
    


            This latest directive leaves in limbo the roughly one in eight Americans who depend on the nation's larger anti-hunger program.

            Off Brazil's northeastern coast, where the sediment-heavy water of the vast Amazon River tips out into the Atlantic, are two very different types of treasure. The first is an ecological gem: a 3,600 square-mile deepwater coral reef discovered less than a decade ago. The second treasure puts the first in immediate danger. Billions of barrels of oil may lie in the ancient sediments beneath the seabed, and licenses have just been approved to drill there.
    


            A few hundred miles north, off the coast of Guyana, companies are already pumping around 650,000 barrels of oil a day from a huge deep-water reservoir discovered in 2015. The find has transformed this rainforest-carpeted country into the planet's newest petrostate and highest oil producer per capita.
    


            Several thousand miles inland to the south, the wide, dusty plains of western Argentina's Vaca Muerta — “dead cow” in English — are dotted with oil wells. Fossil fuel production from this enormous shale deposit has boomed over the past decade, putting it on track to produce more than a million barrels a day by 2030, analysts predict.
    


            Welcome to South America's new oil frontier. “It's really incredible how fast and how much it's expanding,” said Nicole Figueiredo de Oliveira, the executive director at environmental non-profit Arayara.
    


            Countries across the region are ramping up extraction but Brazil, Guyana and Argentina are at the forefront — among the top five drivers of global oil growth outside of OPEC, the group of major oil exporters.
    


            They are three very different countries: an economic behemoth with an environment-championing president, a biodiversity hotspot with high rates of poverty and an economically volatile country led by a chainsaw-wielding climate denier. Yet they are united in their quest to expand oil production, arguing it's vital to their economic and social development.
    


            This new fossil fuel boom is happening just as the impacts of the climate crisis — driven by fossil fuels — are beginning to bite in ever more alarming ways. People in South America are dying in fires, floods, storms and droughts made longer and more catastrophic by climate change.
    


            Brazil's role as host of the COP30 climate conference, which is supposed to be a landmark summit where countries set out goals to radically reduce planet-heating pollution, adds a particular dissonance to this oil surge.
    


            But as global oil demand stays strong, and other, richer, countries show few signs of scaling back, their argument is: Why shouldn't oil supply come from South America?
    


            The continent has a long history of fossil fuel extraction; it holds the second-largest reserves of oil and gas after the Middle East.
    


            Yet it's one of the few regions that didn't take advantage of the oil boom at the beginning of this century due to political riskiness and an aversion to private investment, said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin America Energy Program at Rice University. “But that is changing very significantly,” he told CNN.
    


            Recent discoveries have stirred excitement, especially as the oil in South America is typically cheaper than average — deepwater sources, in particular, tend to produce large amounts at lower cost — and it also tends emit slightly lower levels of climate pollution per barrel, as it often requires less processing and is produced using newer infrastructure and cleaner energy.
    


            Huge oil companies including Exxon and Chevron have plowed in, seeing dollar signs in South America's deep oceans and shale fields just as the US shale boom starts to plateau.
    


The surprising countries pulling off stunningly fast clean energy transitions



            Brazil is a superstar: the region's largest oil and gas producer. Production has “reached levels that have never been seen in the region,” Monaldi said. This is in large part due to ultra-deep “pre-salt” oil reserves discovered in 2006 buried under thick layers of ancient salt beneath the ocean.
    


            Crude oil became the country's top export in 2024 for the first time, overtaking soybeans, and there are hopes production will ramp up much further.
    


            In August, BP announced it had made its largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Farther south, near Uruguay, oil companies hope the Pelotas Basin could be another new frontier.
    


            Perhaps the most controversial project is the one at the mouth of the Amazon River — the Foz do Amazonas basin — part of what's known as the “Equatorial Margin,” a stretch of ocean along the northern coast of Brazil.
    


            In June, Brazil auctioned off several offshore oil blocks in the region, 19 of which are in the Amazon Basin, to companies including Chevron, Exxon and Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras.
    


            Petrobras has been trying to drill here for many years. In 2023, Brazil's environmental agency IBAMA denied it an offshore drilling license, citing environmental concerns. But last month, the agency gave the greenlight for exploratory drilling “after a rigorous environmental licensing process,” according to a statement from IBAMA.
    


            The agency's task was to assess the “technical feasibility” of the project only, not the political or strategic side of oil exploitation, said a spokesperson for Brazil's Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, which oversees IBAMA. Any process involving high-risk areas such as the Foz do Amazonas “must comply with the strictest technical, scientific, and environmental standards,” they added.
    


            The decision “is an achievement of Brazilian society,” said Magda Chambriard, president of Petrobras, in a statement.
    


            Environmental advocates are strongly opposed, arguing drilling in this ecologically delicate swath of ocean, with its unique reefs and huge stretches of mangrove forests, could bring catastrophic consequences.
    


            Ultra-deep water and strong currents mean any oil spill could quickly be swept across miles of ocean and coastline, and the remoteness of the drilling location from large settlements could delay clean-up operations, said Arayara's Figueiredo de Oliveira.
    


            Approving drilling here mere weeks before the start of COP30 in the city of Belém — known as the gateway to the Amazon — presents tricky optics for Brazil, which is trying to walk a tightrope between environmental champion and fossil fuel power.
    


            The country's mighty rivers and abundant rains mean most of its electricity comes from clean hydroelectric power. Brazil's president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has presided over a sharp decline in deforestation and an increase in renewables.
    


            But Lula has always been pro-oil, Figueiredo de Oliveira said. He greeted Brazil's big pre-salt discovery, made during his previous presidential term, with the words, “God is Brazilian.” A famous photo shows him raising oil-drenched hands at a Petrobras event in 2010.
    


            Lula has firmly rejected claims of hypocrisy. “I don't want to be an environmental leader. I never claimed to be,” he said at a COP30 meeting last week, adding it would be “irresponsible,” to quit oil.
    


            He argues oil wealth can help fund Brazil's clean energy transition, although some fear the quest to become a major oil power will only delay it. “Every new discovery does set back the effort to move the world off fossil fuels; there's a loss of momentum,” said Michael Ross, a political science professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
    


            Perhaps Lula's main narrative  is that oil revenues will provide a route to development and a pathway out of poverty, especially for the country's poorer Amazon states. But Brazil is already a powerhouse “with many other economic opportunities,” Ross told CNN.
    


            The argument oil is vital for development may be easier to make in a country like Guyana, where around 48% live on less than $5.50 a day, according to the World Bank.
    


            Guyana, which has a similar geology to Brazil's Equatorial Margin, is experiencing a remarkable oil boom. The 2015 offshore discovery “represents one of the most transformative milestones” in the country's modern history, said President Irfaan Ali.
    


            It has transformed the nation of around 820,000 people into the world's fastest expanding economy. “We have never seen a country produce so many barrels per capita in the history of (the region)… they belong now in the category of the countries of the Middle East,” Monaldi said.
    


            The government has insisted it can balance oil exploitation with environmental priorities. Guyana is one of the few countries that stores more planet-heating pollution than it produces due to its vast rainforests. It also says that revenues will boost socioeconomic growth.
    


            “We do not see a contradiction between the responsible development of our oil and gas sector and our commitment to protecting the planet's climate,” Ali told CNN. Both are “integral parts of a single national mission” to cut poverty, boost the economy and protect the environment, he said.
    


            But there are concerns Guyana could fall victim to the “resource curse,” in which huge windfalls can make life worse for those who live there. Venezuela, for example, holds the world's largest proven oil reserves, and has descended into authoritarianism and economic crisis.
    


            Ali insists the resource curse “is not destiny” and oil wealth will translate into “benefits for every household.” Yet some residents say they face sky- high living costs they blame on oil development, and the country's health outcomes remain below the regional average, according to the World Bank.
    


            South American oil is not just about deep water. Argentina's huge shale region, Vaca Muerta, often compared to the Permian Basin in Texas, holds the world's second largest reserves of shale gas and fourth largest of shale oil.
    


            It's Argentina's big hope for economic recovery under libertarian President Javier Milei. “Almost everything is about expanding Vaca Muerta,” said Gabriel Blanco, a professor in the Faculty of Engineering at the National University of Central Buenos Aires and former national director of climate change in Argentina.
    


            Oil and gas are a very easy sell domestically, Blanco told CNN. Climate change has “never ever” been on the public or political agenda, he said. Instead, “the narrative says that we are going to be rich and we're going to develop.”
    


            Vaca Muerta is an attractive proposition for fossil fuel companies. Shale is a very different type of investment than deep-water drilling, Monaldi said. Companies can spend relatively small amounts to see if they can recover their money before putting in more. This encourages investment in Argentina, a country with “high political and regulatory risk,” he said.
    


            But environmental experts fear the impacts of this booming shale field. Fossil fuels are extracted by “fracking,” a process that involves drilling into the Earth and injecting fluids at high pressure. “They use a lot of water, they use a lot of sand and chemicals, and so it's a mess,” Blanco said.
    


            Exactly how South America's oil future will unfold is not yet clear. New discoveries in Brazil may turn out to be less viable than hoped. For projects already drilling and pumping, reserves often run out earlier than anticipated, UCLA's Ross said.
    


            Oil demand is also predicted to peak at the start of the next decade, which could mean countries that go hard on fossil fuels will find themselves locked into an unprofitable industry. “These countries are getting to the party right as the bar is closing,” Ross said.
    


            For now, however, demand remains. “While there's still a gap between current production and demand, there will be investment into new projects,” said Flávio Ferreira Menten, an analyst at the research firm Rystad Energy.
    


            There are geopolitical considerations, too. If US oil production doesn't keep growing, South America “becomes much more important,” Monaldi said, otherwise the world risks becoming reliant on countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia.
    


            What's happening in South America is reflective of something bigger, according to Blanco. The region's love affair with fossil fuels is part of a global movement, he said: an implicit — and sometimes explicit — consensus that oil exploitation can and should continue for decades to come even in the face of a barreling climate crisis.
    


            “It seems like leaders decided to step strongly on the on the gas pedal and move forward with fossil fuels everywhere,” he said, “no matter what.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic senators — eight in total — faced almost instant blowback from members of their own party as they voted to allow the Senate to move forward on compromise legislation that would reopen the government.

Their decision Sunday night was labeled a “betrayal” and “pathetic” by some of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party.

“To my mind, this was a very, very bad vote,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. 

The group of defectors consisted of several senators who are retiring next year, as well as a number of former governors. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana praised them Monday morning, saying they “decided to put principle over their personal politics.”

The group of moderate Democrats surely knew the criticism that was coming when they broke with the rest of their party on the 40th day of the government shutdown. But after huddling for hours — often in the Senate basement — over the last week, each senator reached the same conclusion: It was time for the government shutdown to end.

Shaheen, a senior Democrat who will be retiring from the Senate, often took the lead in negotiating the compromise legislation to end the shutdown. She had made it a priority to extend subsidies for health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, but she had also expressed reservations about voting to shut down the government.

In the end, she settled for a pledge from Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota to hold a vote in December on the health subsidies.

“This was the only deal on the table. It was our best chance to reopen the government and immediately begin negotiations to extend the ACA tax credits that tens of millions of Americans rely on to keep costs down,” she said at a news conference following the Sunday night vote.

Durbin is another senator who will be retiring after a long Senate career. Durbin holds the No. 2 position in Democratic leadership and broke ranks with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York after saying that the shutdown had caused too much pain for the American people.

In a statement before the vote, Durbin, who argued that Republicans are still to blame for the shutdown, said, “This bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown's hurt. Not only would it fully fund SNAP for the year ahead, but it would reverse the mass firings the Trump Administration ordered throughout the shutdown.”

Kaine, a former Virginia governor, was one of the last Democrats to join the group willing to vote to advance to the bill. He said that, as late as Sunday evening, he was checking over the legislation with his staff. For him, the deciding factor was language in the funding bill that prevents President Donald Trump's administration from conducting more mass layoffs — an issue that is particularly important for his state.

He called the agreement a “moratorium on mischief” and said he was only able to get the agreement as negotiations reached a crucial juncture.

“The kinds of just non-strategic mass firings and (reduction in force actions) that have traumatized federal employees since Inauguration Day, they can't do them anymore,” Kaine said.

Hassan, a former governor, had been involved with negotiations from early on and emphasized that the threats to federal food aid had made the situation more urgent.

Hassan said she “heard from families about the deep pain that the government shutdown has caused, made worse by a president who illegally and repeatedly chose to cut off help for families who are just trying to buy groceries.”

“After weeks of bipartisan conversations,” she said Sunday, “I voted today to reopen the government so that we can get back to the work of helping Granite Staters.”

The government funding bill refills funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as ensuring that states that spent their own funds to keep it running during the shutdown will be reimbursed.

King is an independent who caucuses with the Democratic Party and is a former governor. He had been voting since the outset to reopen the government, yet he also played a key role in the negotiations, including often hosting senators for talks in his Capitol basement office.

He has consistently said that he is opposed to using a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic, yet he also wanted Congress to extend the health care subsidies. After Republicans rejected a proposal from Schumer to extend the ACA tax credits for one year, King said it showed that the shutdown was not working.

“The question was: Does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits? Our judgment was that it would not produce that result,” King said.

Rosen has grown increasingly irate as the shutdown has worn on and Republicans refused to give in to Democrats' demands on the ACA credits. As air travel was increasingly affected by the shutdown, the economy of her home state of Nevada, a political swing state, was also under threat.

In a statement, Rosen said that Trump and fellow Republicans “are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt.”

Cortez Masto is another Democrat who has been voting to reopen the government. She also emphasized that the impact to travel had been particularly harmful to Nevada and that the impacts to food assistance programs provided a new sense of urgency. She said that lines at food banks were the longest she has seen since the coronavirus pandemic.

“The stories were horrific,” she said.

Fetterman, who was elected in 2022, has also been voting to reopen the government, breaking with his party as he does on many other issues. He has criticized Democrats for using the shutdown to demand concessions on health care.

“I'm sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven't been paid in weeks,” he said on social media. “It should've never come to this. This was a failure.”

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether states can continue to count late-arriving mail ballots, which have been a target of President Donald Trump.

The justices took up an appeal from Mississippi after a panel of three judges nominated by the Republican president on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the state law allowing ballots that arrive shortly after Election Day to be counted violated federal law. 

Mississippi is among 18 states and the District of Columbia that accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

The list includes swing states such as Nevada and states such as Colorado, Oregon and Utah that rely heavily on mail voting.

An additional 14 states allow the counting of late-arriving ballots from some eligible voters, including overseas U.S. service members and their families, according to a filing from Democratic-led states that urged the justices to reverse the appellate ruling.

The case will be argued in the late winter or early spring. A final ruling almost certainly will come by late June, early enough to govern the counting of ballots in the 2026 midterm congressional elections.

Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, told the Supreme Court that the appellate ruling “will have destabilizing nationwide ramifications” if left in place.




“The stakes are high: ballots cast by — but received after — election day can swing close races and change the course of the country,” Fitch wrote. 

Trump has claimed that late-arriving ballots and drawn-out electoral counts undermine confidence in elections. In March, the Republican president signed an executive order on elections that aims to require votes to be “cast and received” by Election Day. The order has been challenged in court.

The Republican National Committee and the Libertarian Party of Mississippi led the challenge to the Mississippi law. A federal judge dismissed a similar challenge to Nevada's law, but the decision has been appealed.

The Supreme Court is separately considering reviving a lawsuit filed by Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., and backed by the Trump administration that challenges Illinois' ballot receipt law. The issue is whether the congressman has the legal right to sue.

Some Republican-led states, including Kansas and North Dakota, have taken steps to stop counting late-arriving ballots. In Ohio, Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation that would require ballots to be received by Election Day, closing the window for mailed ballots. The measure has passed the state Senate.

In the Mississippi case, Judge Andrew Oldham wrote for the appellate panel that Congress established a “singular” Election Day for members of Congress and presidential electors, “by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.” Judges James Ho and Stuart Kyle Duncan joined Oldham's opinion invalidating the Mississippi law.

The ruling reversed a decision by U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola Jr., who had held that there was no conflict between the state and federal laws. “All that occurs after election day is the delivery and counting of ballots cast on or before election day,” wrote Guirola, who was nominated by President George W. Bush, a Republican.

In a test vote that is the first in a series of required procedural maneuvers, the Senate voted 60-40 to move toward passing compromise legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire Jan. 1. Final passage could be several days away if Democrats object and delay the process.

WASHINGTON (AP) — A legislative package to end the government shutdown appears on track Monday after a handful of Senate Democrats joined with Republicans to break the impasse in what has become a deepening disruption of federal programs and services, the longest in history.

What's in and out of the bipartisan deal drew sharp criticism and leaves few senators fully satisfied. The legislation provides funding to reopen the government, including for SNAP food aid and other programs, while also ensuring backpay for furloughed federal workers the Trump administration had left in doubt.

But notably lacking is any clear resolution to expiring health care subsidies that Democrats have been fighting for as millions of Americans stare down rising insurance premiums. That debate was pushed off for a vote next month, weeks before the subsidies are set to expire. 

President Donald Trump noted the deal as he arrived at the White House after watching the Washington Commanders' game on Sunday evening against the Detroit Lions, on the 40th day of the funding lapse. “It looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending,” he said.

The Senate could wrap up passage as soon as Monday. The bill cleared a procedural hurdle, 60-40, late Sunday, with eight Democrats joining most Republicans. In a rare dissent, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against because it failed to fully address the health care funds. 

Government shutdownThe AP has journalists around the country covering the shutdown of the federal government. What questions do you have for them?

It would next go to the House, where lawmakers have been away since September but were being told to prepare to return to Washington this week. Then, it's to Trump's desk for his signature.

Here's a look at the deal as it's moving through Congress:

Included is funding to keep much of the federal government running for the next couple of months, to Jan. 30, with a stopgap measure. It largely funds government operations at their current rates.

Yet in a breakthrough for what's considered a more normal appropriations process, the package also includes several bills to fully fund other government operations including agricultural programs and military construction along with veterans' affairs for the full fiscal year, through September 2026.

Additionally, the package ensures states would be reimbursed for money they spent to keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC, running during the shutdown. 

Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, said she was “relieved.” 

“This shutdown has gone on far too long,” she said. “And I also think it's highly significant that we'll have three yearlong appropriations bills attached. Veterans Day is coming very soon, and it would be wonderful if we get the full-year Veterans Affairs bill signed into law.”

The Democrats failed to secure their main demand during the shutdown, which was an extension of the health care subsidies that many of the 24 million people who buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act rely on to help defray costs.

Instead, the package guarantees a vote on the issue in December — which was not enough for most of the Democrats, who rejected the deal and voted against it.

“The American people want us to stand and fight for health care,” said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.

The package seeks to roll back some of the Trump administration's shutdown-related hits to the federal workforce. Employees have faced repeated threats of firings and mass layoffs this year.

The stopgap measure reinstates federal workers who had received reductions in force, or layoff, notices and protects against such future actions.

It also would provide back pay for federal workers who were furloughed or working without pay during the shutdown — something that's traditionally provided but that the Trump administration had threatened was not guaranteed.

Political and procedural hurdles remain as Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, slogs through more voting and the shutdown entered its 41st day Monday.

Senators hope to skip past a series of steps that could drag voting out all week if the dissenters put up a prolonged fight.

One Republican, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against advancing the package Sunday, and he is said to have concerns over a hemp industry provision. And three ultra-conservative GOP senators held up voting for more than two hours as they demanded consideration of their ideas. It is unclear if any of them plans to stage further protests.

Democrats, who have fought for the past month in their hopes of preserving the health care subsidies, also could delay final passage, and their next steps are uncertain. 

And the package faces fresh scrutiny once it goes to the House, where Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana holds a slim GOP majority and would likely need almost all Republicans to support the bill in the face of objections from Democrats who are holding out for the health care funds.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said the party will fight the bill, forcing the Republicans in the House to pass it largely on their own.

“We will not support spending legislation advanced by Senate Republicans that fails to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits” Jeffries said. “Donald Trump and the Republican Party own the toxic mess they have created.”

Just in time for the theatrical release of “Wicked: For Good,” fans will get a chance to own memorabilia from the 1939 original film, “The Wizard of Oz,” and one item is especially witchy.

Heritage Auctions is putting an iconic black hat that Margaret Hamilton wore as the Wicked Witch of the West up for sale. The wool hat is quite large, measuring nearly 14-inches high with a 19.5-inch diameter brim. It also has a 22-inch elastic chin strap worn by Hamilton during flying scenes to keep it secure.

Designed by costume designer Adrian Adolph Greenburg, who went by Gilbert Adrian professionally, the hat was put to use after filming began because the one originally chosen didn't appear scary enough.

“When Dorothy Gale becomes Dorothy of Oz, it's when she puts on the ruby slippers,” said Joe Maddalena, EVP of Heritage Auctions. “When the Wicked Witch becomes the Wicked Witch, she puts on the hat. So it's this transformational moment of the birth of the witch. I think the importance of the hat is just incredible. It's on par with the slippers.”

Heritage will hold the auction Dec. 9 and 10, both online and at its Dallas headquarters.

Also hitting the auction block are a “The Wizard of Oz” book signed by Garland, who also wrote a lengthy inscription. It has autographs by other main cast members, including Toto's actual paw prints. The book was gifted to the daughter of Garland's on-set tutor at the time.




Two different versions of Dorothy's ruby slippers will be auctioned. One, a right-foot shoe worn by Garland during rehearsals, is adorned with crimson-burgundy glass bugle beads. A replica of the ruby slippers made by Western Costume Company for the film's 50th anniversary, will also be for sale. The latter were made using Garland's original shoe form and have red sequins and rhinestone bows. These shoes, said Maddalena, “are as close as you're ever going to get to owning a pair of ruby slippers that weren't screen-used.”

A handwritten letter written by “Oz” author Frank Baum on personal stationary and an organza blouse worn on screen by Garland will also sell. The blouse has a tag with “Judy Garland” handwritten on the label.

Last year, Heritage sold a different pair of ruby slippers from the film for $28 million.

The Senate took the first step to end the government shutdown on Sunday. In a test vote that is the first in a series of required procedural maneuvers, the Senate voted 60-40 to move toward passing compromise legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire Jan. 1.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate took the first step to end the government shutdown on Sunday after a group of moderate Democrats agreed to proceed without a guaranteed extension of health care subsidies, angering many in their caucus who say Americans want them to continue the fight.

In a test vote that is the first in a series of required procedural maneuvers, the Senate voted 60-40 to move toward passing compromise legislation to fund the government and hold a later vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits that expire Jan. 1. Final passage could be several days away if Democrats object and delay the process. 

The Senate took the first step to end the government shutdown on Sunday after a group of moderate Democrats agreed to proceed without a guaranteed extension of health care subsidies, angering many in their caucus who say Americans want them to continue the fight.

The agreement does not guarantee the health care subsidies will be extended, as Democrats have demanded for almost six weeks. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York voted against moving ahead with the package, along with all but eight of his Democratic colleagues. 

A group of three former governors — New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine — broke the six-week stalemate on Sunday when they agreed to vote to advance three bipartisan annual spending bills and extend the rest of government funding until late January in exchange for a mid-December vote on extending the health care tax credits. 

The agreement also includes a reversal of the mass firings of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began on Oct. 1 and would ensure that federal workers receive back pay. 




Senate Majority Leader John Thune quickly endorsed the deal and called an immediate vote to begin the process of approving it as the shutdown continued to disrupt flights nationwide, threaten food assistance for millions of Americans and leave federal workers without pay. 

“The time to act is now,” Thune said. 

Returning to the White House on Sunday evening after attending a football game, President Donald Trump did not say whether he endorsed the deal. But he said, “It looks like we're getting close to the shutdown ending.”

In addition to Shaheen, King and Hassan, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, also voted in favor of moving forward on the agreement. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman and Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen also voted yes. 

The moderates had expected a larger number of Democrats to vote with them as 10-12 Democratic senators had been part of the negotiations. But in the end, only five Democrats switched their votes — the exact number that Republicans needed. King, Cortez Masto and Fetterman had already been voting to open the government since Oct. 1. 

The vote was temporarily delayed on Sunday evening as three conservatives who often criticize spending bills, Republican Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Rick Scott of Florida and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, withheld their votes and huddled with Thune at the back of the chamber. They eventually voted yes after speaking to Trump, Lee said.

Another Republican, Sen John Cornyn of Texas, had to fly back from Texas to deliver the crucial 60th vote.

After Democrats met for over two hours to discuss the proposal, Schumer said he could not “in good faith” support it. 

Schumer, who received blowback from his party in March when he voted to keep the government open, said that Democrats have now “sounded the alarm” on health care. 

“We will not give up the fight,” he said. 

Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, said giving up the fight was a “horrific mistake.” 

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., agreed, saying that in last week's elections people voted overwhelmingly Democratic “to urge Democrats to hold firm.” 

Democrats had voted 14 times not to reopen the government as they demanded the extension of tax credits that make coverage more affordable under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans said they would not negotiate on health care, but GOP leaders have been quietly working with the group of moderates as the contours of an agreement began to emerge. 

The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government — food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills. 

The deal would reinstate federal workers who had received reduction in force, or layoff, notices and reimburse states that spent their own funds to keep federal programs running during the shutdown. It would also protect against future reductions in force through January and guarantee federal workers would be paid once the shutdown is over.

House Democrats swiftly criticized the Senate. 

Texas Rep. Greg Casar, the chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said a deal that doesn't reduce health care costs is a “betrayal” of millions of Americans who are counting on Democrats to fight. 

“Accepting nothing but a pinky promise from Republicans isn't a compromise — it's capitulation,” Casar said in a post on X. “Millions of families would pay the price.”

Rep. Angie Craig of Minnesota posted that “if people believe this is a ‘deal,' I have a bridge to sell you.”

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries blamed Republicans and said Democrats will continue to fight. 

“Donald Trump and the Republican Party own the toxic mess they have created in our country and the American people know it,” Jeffries said. 

It's unclear whether the two parties would be able to find any common ground on the health care subsidies before a promised December vote in the Senate. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he will not commit to bring it up in his chamber. 

Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19-era tax credits as premiums could skyrocket for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies and argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals. 

Other Republicans, including Trump, have used the debate to renew their yearslong criticism of the law and called for it to be scrapped or overhauled. 

Meanwhile, the consequences of the shutdown have been compounding. U.S. airlines canceled more than 2,000 flights on Sunday for the first time since the shutdown began, and there were more than 7,000 flight delays, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks air travel disruptions.

Treasury Secretary Sean Duffy said on CNN's “State of the Union” that air travel ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday will be “reduced to a trickle” if the government doesn't reopen.

At the same time, food aid was delayed for tens of millions of people as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits were caught up in legal battles related to the shutdown. 

And in Washington, home to tens of thousands of federal workers who have gone unpaid, the Capital Area Food Bank said it is providing 8 million more meals ahead of the holidays than it had prepared for this budget year — a nearly 20% increase.

The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating three homicides that took place in the city on Saturday, Nov. 8. (Fox 5 DC/WTTG) 

Washington, D.C., saw three homicides on Saturday night in a mere six-hour time span as President Donald Trump declared victory over what he called a ""crisis"" of crime in the nation's capital.

A teenager and two adults were killed Saturday in three separate incidents that the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is investigating as homicides, officials said. A teenager was shot in a fourth incident, but police have not said if it was a homicide.

The spree is unusual as Trump's crime crackdown in the district has seen a decrease in overall crime.

""We have a very safe city now,"" Trump said last week. ""The country is going to be safe. We do it one at a time.""

DC ARRESTS SURPASS 1,000 AS TRUMP-BACKED CRACKDOWN ENTERS 12TH HOMICIDE-FREE DAY

The Metropolitan Police Department said officers responded to the first shooting just minutes before 3 p.m. in the 1900 block of C Street SE. They found a 17-year-old boy suffering from a gunshot wound to the upper body.

Medics rushed the teen to the hospital, where he died from his injuries, according to MPD. Homicide detectives have since taken over the case.

About four hours later, at around 6:52 p.m., officers reported finding another teen boy who had been shot in the 700 block of Newton Place, Northwest. Police said the teen was found inside a home there, with a gunshot wound to the upper body. Medics tried to save him, but he died at the scene.

Less than two hours later, at around 8:48 p.m., officers responded to a shooting in the 1400 block of 14th Place, Southeast, where they found a woman suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, according to MPD. Homicide detectives are investigating her death.

Police have not released the names of the victims or information regarding any suspects.

HUNDREDS ARRESTED AS TRUMP'S WASHINGTON, DC, CRIME CRACKDOWN HITS FULL STRIDE

The incidents Saturday raised the number of homicides in the last week to five, according to The Washington Post. According to MPD data, as of Nov. 10, there were 122 homicides this year in Washington, D.C. In August, the president deployed more than 2,000 troops to combat crime.

Along with the troop deployment, Trump signed an executive order expanding anti-crime measures, including adding additional prosecutors to focus on violent and property crimes, and directing the transportation secretary to inspect and improve D.C.'s transit services.

Former Syria Special Representative James Jeffrey joins ‘Fox News Live' to discuss the U.S. decision to exempt Hungary from sanctions over its Russian oil and gas purchases, and the upcoming visit of the Syrian president to the White House.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he is prepared to hold another face-to-face meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signaling Moscow's interest in keeping diplomatic channels open even as it refuses to shift its terms for ending the Ukraine war.

The offer was delivered to the state news agency RIA Novosti and first reported by Reuters on Sunday. ""Secretary of State Marco Rubio and I understand the need for regular communication,"" Lavrov said. ""It is important for discussing the Ukrainian issue and promoting the bilateral agenda. That is why we communicate by telephone and are ready to hold face-to-face meetings when necessary.""

The diplomatic movement comes days after a major Russian weapons test that raised tensions further, when President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had conducted a ""successful test of a nuclear-powered underwater torpedo."" Two days later, on Oct. 31, the United States canceled a planned Budapest summit between President Donald Trump and President Putin following Russia's firm stance on hard-line demands regarding Ukraine.

Since early this year, the two sides have held several rounds of talks. On Feb. 18 in Riyadh, Rubio and Lavrov led delegations that agreed to restore normal diplomatic mission operations and set up technical teams. A follow-up meeting on Feb. 27 in Istanbul focused on embassy access, staffing, banking and restoring direct air links.

The pair met again on July 10 in Kuala Lumpur, where Rubio delivered what he called a ""frank"" message conveying Trump's frustration at Russia's lack of flexibility. On Sept. 24, during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Rubio pressed Moscow again to take ""meaningful steps toward a durable resolution,"" according to a State Department readout.

A Russian journalist speaking from Moscow on condition of anonymity told Fox News Digital that the nuclear test should be read as political signaling. ""At the moment, Russia and the U.S. are trying to feel each other out in the diplomatic field. Nuclear test turmoil is a diplomatic lever and nothing more,"" he said. Trump and Putin are ""trying to play Nixon's ‘crazy president' card to see who chickens first, also to test reaction.""

(Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service telegram channel via AP)

He added that the Kremlin remains committed to its objectives in Ukraine. ""The Kremlin still wants to reach the objective of the ‘special military operation' and is going to play it at a steady pace until Ukraine crumbles or something else happens.""

Rumors that Lavrov had fallen out of favor intensified when he missed a major Kremlin meeting. But on Nov. 7, the Kremlin ""dismissed speculation,"" Reuters reported.

The Moscow journalist confirmed the information to Fox News Digital: ""The Kremlin denied these rumors twice. And it says a lot that Lavrov is not in disgrace. In Russia, usually officials in disgrace lose their position before it's even become known to the public."" He added that Lavrov publicly addressed several issues yesterday, ""so he is apparently sitting at the Foreign Ministry chair firmly.""

Lavrov also reiterated Russia's conditions for ending the war, Reuters reported. According to Reuters, he said, ""No one questions the territorial integrity of Russia and the choice of the residents of Crimea, Donbas and Novorossiya,"" and noted that Moscow is waiting for U.S. confirmation that earlier ""Anchorage agreements"" on frozen assets remain in force.

Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett reacts after a federal judge halted the Trump administration's plan to send National Guard troops to Portland and another ordered the reinstatement of SNAP benefits.

As the Trump administration adds federal law enforcement focus to Portland, Oregon, local officials in neighboring areas are pushing back on the Department of Homeland Security and investigating their own police forces for alleged collaboration.

Unrest in the Portland area grabbed President Donald Trump's attention over the summer – and by late September – he announced deployment of troops to the ""war-ravaged"" city – an effort that Trump-appointed Judge Karin Immergut blocked in October.

Washington County, an area home to about 600,000 people immediately west of Portland, declared a state of emergency last week in response to DHS' increased enforcement in the area.

PORTLAND CODIFIES SANCTUARY STATUS, ORDERS CITY POLICE TO FURTHER SEPARATE FROM ICE

The move opens up $200,000 in emergency funding to help community organizations that serve impacted residents, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB).

An immigrations rights group official was one of several residents to complain about ICE ramping up enforcement, telling OPB that her organization was receiving 100 phone calls on the matter daily and that broken glass is ""everywhere"" from ICE officers breaking car windows to detain occupants.

County Commissioner Nafisa Fai told the outlet that residents may benefit from moratoriums on evictions and having their electricity shut off over nonpayment if breadwinners in their family are taken away by ICE.

ICE DIRECTOR SAYS PORTLAND FACILITY FACES VIOLENCE WITH 'LITTLE HELP FROM LOCAL POLICE'

Meanwhile, in nearby Eugene – the state's third-largest city – the police department will reportedly be subject to independent review over allegations that officers aided or coordinated with federal immigration authorities.

The Eugene Police Auditor, an agency independent of the force itself, will be conducting a ""complete and thorough investigation,"" according to Eugene's CBS affiliate, citing an auditor's office official.

The issue arose after residents complained that Eugene police were not following Oregon's sanctuary state laws.

ICE DIRECTOR REVEALS DANGEROUS NIGHTLY ANTIFA 'BATTLE' AS TRUMP PREPARES FEDERAL DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND

A police spokeswoman rejected the claim in comments to the local NPR affiliate.

""Eugene Police Department has nothing to do with immigration, nor with raids [Wednesday],"" said Melinda McLaughlin – adding that images on social media from the events of the week are not Eugene police officers.

After a Eugene-area ICE raid last week, several lawmakers slammed the feds for ""violent detentions"" and allegations the suspects were not given full due process.

Rep. Val Hoyle, D-Ore., Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., state House Speaker Julie Fahey, D-Eugene, and state Senate leader James Manning Jr., D-Eugene, said they were ""alarmed"" by ICE's enforcement actions.

""This was only the most recent in a series of aggressive raids carried out across the state in recent months. We are working together with community leaders and local law enforcement to learn more and ensure that all of our constituents are accounted for,"" they said in a letter signed by several other lawmakers.

""Every Oregonian and every person in the United States, regardless of immigration status, is entitled to the full protections guaranteed by the Constitution.""

J. Michael Waller, a former CIA operative, told Fox News Digital that America risks losing ""everything"" if it allows China to become an AI superpower.

A Chinese consul general in Japan threatened to decapitate the nation's new prime minister over her comments in defense of Taiwan, prompting outrage in Tokyo and underscoring the rising tension between the two regional powers.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office last month, told a parliamentary committee Friday that a Chinese blockade of Taiwan would likely create a ""survival-threatening situation"" for Japan — one that could compel Tokyo to deploy its Self-Defense Forces in response. The democratically governed island sits just 60 miles from Japanese territory.

Xue Jian, the Chinese consul general in Osaka, fired back in a since-deleted X post on Sunday: ""That filthy neck that barged in on its own — I've got no choice but to cut it off without a moment's hesitation. Are you prepared for that?""

Japan's government condemned the statement, with Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara calling it ""extremely inappropriate"" and confirming that Tokyo had lodged a formal protest with Beijing. Kihara said Xue had made ""multiple"" inflammatory remarks in the past and urged China to take disciplinary action.

China instead appeared to defend the diplomat. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters Monday that Xue's words came in response to Takaichi's ""wrongful and dangerous"" comments, which he said misrepresented China's position on Taiwan. Lin accused Japan of ""refusing to face up to its historical responsibilities"" and warned Tokyo not to interfere in ""internal Chinese affairs.""

Takaichi later told reporters her comments were ""hypothetical"" and said she would refrain from making similar remarks in the future.

The episode threatens to strain already fraught relations between Asia's two largest economies. Takaichi, a nationalist known for her hawkish views on China and close ties with Washington, has sought to deepen defense cooperation with the Trump administration. She has pledged to push Japan's long-stagnant defense spending above 1% of GDP and to play a more assertive role in maintaining stability across the Taiwan Strait.

U.S. defense officials have long argued that Japan's participation would be critical in any potential conflict over Taiwan, which Beijing sees as its own.

Japan's chief cabinet secretary Minoru Kihara said that while the intent of the post was ""not entirely clear"" Xue's remarks were ""extremely inappropriate."" He said Xue had made multiple inappropriate statements and Japan has asked Beijing to take action.

Though the post was deleted, China backed up Xue. Foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said in a news conference on Monday his words were in response to Takaichi's ""wrongful and dangerous"" remarks on Taiwan, urging Tokyo to ""take a hard look at its historical responsibilities.""

Takaichi said on Monday her comments were ""hypothetical"" and she would refrain from making them again.

The consulate in Osaka could not immediately be reached for comment.

Fox News' Alexandria Hoff provides details on the ruling and the dissent from Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson

The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not revisit its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, leaving intact the 2015 protections granted to couples in Obergefell v. Hodges.

Justices rejected an appeal brought by Kim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk who was held in contempt after she refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples due to her religious beliefs. 

The Court declined to take up her appeal without explanation and without any noted dissents. 

SUPREME COURT WEIGHS TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE

Though Davis's appeal centered largely on First Amendment issues and questions of religious protection, her lawyers also requested that the Supreme Court consider overturning the 5-4 ruling in Obergefell, or the 2015 decision that granted same-sex couples the constitutional right to marry. 

It is time for a ""for a course correction"" on Obergefell, her lawyers argued.

Davis was briefly jailed in 2015 after she refused to issue the marriage licenses to same-sex couples due to her religious beliefs, prompting a federal judge to hold her in contempt. 

She was also ordered by the court to pay $100,000 in damages to the couple, and to cover their legal fees.

""If ever a case deserved review,"" Davis's lawyers said in their appeal, ""the first individual who was thrown in jail post-Obergefell for seeking accommodation for her religious beliefs should be it.""

Though her appeal was considered a long shot, it had prompted fresh speculation about whether the court's conservative majority might agree to review the seminal case, especially in light of the court's 2022 decision to overturn abortion protections in Roe v. Wade.

Others noted that three of the justices that dissented from the majority in Obergefell — Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts — remain on the court.

Davis's lawyers also hewed closely to language used by Justice Clarence Thomas in their appeal, who used a concurring opinion in 2022 to urge the court to ""reconsider"" gay marriage and other constitutional protections after it overturned Roe v. Wade.

Even so, it takes four votes to get a case onto the docket — a somewhat heavy lift for the court. The decision also comes at a time when justices have agreed to review a number of politically charged cases in their upcoming term.

‘The Five' co-hosts debate the long-term outcomes of recent elections and the ways media and Republicans should be educating audiences about socialism.

As Republicans eagerly look to pin the Democratic Party to New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, two specific races look like early opportunities to do just that: the Michigan Senate primary and Colorado's 8th Congressional District.

In Michigan, Abdul El-Sayed hopes to become the state's next U.S. senator. In Colorado, Manny Rutinel is running to unseat freshman Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo.

On both fronts, the Republican National Committee (RNC) hopes audiences will see a connection to the mayor-elect in New York.

REPUBLICANS PUSH TO MAKE MAMDANI THE NEW FACE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

""Manny Rutinel and Abdul El-Sayed have anchored themselves to Mamdani, thinking he will get them across the finish line. Republicans are watching,"" RNC spokeswoman Delanie Bomar told Fox News Digital.

Republican strategists hope that the efforts to tie socialism to Democrat candidates will diminish their chances outside of New York. For the Democrat candidates themselves, that introduces a question: Will the immediate momentum of the Mamdani brand bring the long-term downsides Republicans are counting on? Or could similarities to Mamdani's recent success help them stand out?

El-Sayed is walking that line carefully. When asked if he would embrace the idea of becoming Michigan's Mamdani, El-Sayed said he would carve out his own image.

""I am the Michigan Abdul,"" he said. ""I always have been. I always will be.""

But like Mamdani, El-Sayed has made affordability — and the role of government — key pieces of his campaign. In addition to calling for lowering housing costs, he's advocated for Medicare for all, opposes corporate tax carve-outs, and he supports tuition-free access to higher education. He expects voters from New York, Michigan and beyond to continue in that direction.

""You're seeing that kind of resonance here in Michigan for sure. And I'm not surprised that you're seeing that in New York, too. Government ought to be available to set an equal playing field for everybody and to offer those basic things that everybody needs and deserves,"" El-Sayed said.  

El-Sayed endorsed Mamdani ahead of the mayoral election last week.

WILL ELECTION DAY 2025 BE REMEMBERED AS THE RISE OF THE SOCIALISTS?

Rutinel, the Democrat challenger in Colorado, hasn't made his policy platform as clear. The first-term state representative doesn't have any positions listed on his website. And besides signing a letter calling for the release of an ICE detainee, he hasn't publicly made statements that would separate him from most of the Democrat Party.

That hasn't stopped the Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) from drawing the Mamdani connection anyway. 

The CLF, an arm of the House Republican fundraising apparatus, highlighted a video posted to Instagram of a Mamdani campaign rally, offering it as proof that Rutinel belongs in the same bucket as Mamdani.

The video briefly shows someone who looks like Rutinel standing behind Mamdani.

""What does the CO-08 race have in common with the NYC Mayoral Race? Democrat Manny Rutinel is campaigning in both,"" CLF pointed out recently in one of its ads.

Rutinel's campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

The office of Evans, the current representative for Colorado's 8th Congressional District, didn't immediately draw a connection to Mamdani but made the case that New York and Colorado have very different electorates. They suggested that an attempt to replicate Mamdani's strategy in Colorado would play out differently in the Centennial State.

""When people tell you who they are, believe them. Democrats have fully endorsed the far-left socialist, extremist base of their party — the same base that's anti-law enforcement and handcuffs work rather than rewarding it. Those policies may sell in New York, but Coloradans aren't buying it,"" a spokesperson for Evans said.

A strategist familiar with the thinking of campaigns in Colorado and Michigan believes that more Democrats may use an apparent similarity to Mamdani to stand out in the short term, especially in the wake of Tuesday's election.

""I think — at least in crowded primaries — many candidates are just thinking they need to get through the primary,"" the strategist said. ""It riles up the base. The base sees Mamdani as the new face of the party. They finally have someone.""

""I just don't think it's going to be helpful in a general election,"" they added.

Bomar, the RNC spokeswoman, said that if more Democrats decide to lean into that connection, Republicans will be waiting.

""Americans want no part of socialism and Mamdani will ultimately sink Democrats' chances around the country,"" Bomar said.

After 14 failed votes and a 40-day-long shutdown, the Senate took its first step toward reopening the government on Sunday, with enough Democrats relenting on their healthcare demands to allow Republicans to overcome a filibuster.

The test vote, which took place during a rare weekend session, came shortly after Senate appropriators put the finishing touches on three full-year bills that would fund Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, and other federal departments. 

The basic framework for a spending deal, attaching the three bills to a short-term extension for the rest of the government, is largely unchanged from what Republicans have been offering for weeks. The legislation does not include the extension of premium Obamacare subsidies Democrats have been demanding in exchange for their votes.

Instead, Republicans will allow a December vote on the subsidies, with no guarantee they can pass Congress or will be signed into law. As another concession, Republicans agreed to reverse thousands of planned layoffs the White House has announced since Oct. 1, when the shutdown first began, and prevent more from happening through January.

Sunday's vote is just the first in a series of procedural hurdles that could draw the process out for days, unless all Democrats drop their objections to the funding plan. A group of centrist Senate Democrats reached a deal with Republicans on Sunday evening to overcome the filibuster's 60-vote threshold, but most of the caucus remained opposed.

Just eight, the bare minimum needed for the measure to advance, voted for the funding bill: Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Angus King (I-ME), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH).

Notably, Durbin, the minority whip, was the only member of Senate Democratic leadership to support the bill. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) voted against, marking a break from March, when he joined centrist Democrats to keep the government open.

Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), a vulnerable Senate Democrat seeking reelection in 2026, also voted “no.” On the GOP side, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) was the lone senator to buck leadership.

The government funding deal represents a long-awaited breakthrough for Republicans and a concrete sign that the government shutdown will end sometime this coming week.

Until now, only a few Senate Democrats were willing to break ranks with their leadership on the Obamacare subsidies, but mounting delays at airports and a lapse in food stamps benefits eventually became too much for more centrist members.

The Federal Aviation Administration required airlines to cut hundreds of flights due to staffing shortages on Friday, while Trump appears to have won a court battle over food stamps, ordering states to halt full payments for November.

Should the legislation ultimately pass the Senate, it would then return to the House, which has been out of session for well over a month. The House has already passed a short-term extension to Nov. 19, but the new funding patch would last until the end of January.

On Sunday afternoon, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and other House Democrats came out against the funding bill, though he criticized Senate Republicans rather than his Democratic counterparts.

Republicans have said they are willing to negotiate a healthcare deal before the end of the year, when the enhanced Obamacare subsidies run out, but their refusal to commit to an extension has been the main stumbling block to reopening the government.

WHERE EVERY SENATE REPUBLICAN STANDS ON TRUMP'S CALL TO END THE FILIBUSTER

On Sunday, a bloc of Democratic senators who voted “yes” defended their decision in light of the prolonged shutdown and Republicans' refusal to negotiate. Republicans have insisted that any funding deal be separate from policy debates.

“The question was, does the shutdown further the goal of achieving some needed support for the extension of the tax credits?” said King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. “Our judgment was that it would not produce that result, and the evidence for that was almost seven weeks of fruitless attempts to make that happen.”

The Senate voted 60-40 to overcome a filibuster on an updated continuing resolution proposed by the GOP, which would end the 40-day government shutdown. Eight Senate Democrats acquiesced to their insistence on including provisions to extend Obamacare subsidies. Later, the Senate adjourned for the evening and will reconvene on Monday at 11 a.m. The Senate is then expected to proceed with a vote to reopen the government on Tuesday, according to reports.

While the bill does not include the Obamacare subsidies, it does include stipulations to reverse the layoffs of federal employees that happened in October. Sens. Dick Durbin (D-IL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Angus King (I-ME), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) were the Democrats who joined the GOP in voting to break the filibuster.

The Democrats who opposed the bill, however, were quite displeased. Many spent weeks clamoring about the importance of reopening the government, with some citing that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients who were not getting their benefits due to the government shutdown were starving. Yet, on Sunday night, they took to social media to voice their displeasure with the proposed bill to end the shutdown. Many of them repeated the same talking points in their messaging, often pushing a class warfare narrative with frequent mentions of billionaires.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he was voting “no” because of the “Republican-made healthcare crisis.”

“America is in the midst of a Republican-made healthcare crisis — a crisis so severe, so urgent, and so devastating for American families that I cannot support a continuing resolution that fails to address it,” Schumer said. “I am voting NO.”

Schumer's colleague from New York, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), echoed his sentiments about healthcare costs.

“I cannot support this deal, which fails to address the needs of 20 million Americans facing skyrocketing healthcare costs,” she said in a post on X.

She then elaborated with a message posted to her account.

“I cannot trust the Republicans to do the right thing, so I don't believe the vote to restore healthcare will be successful,” Gillibrand said in the statement. “Because of this lack of trust, I will not support this deal, which fails to address the needs of 20 million Americans facing skyrocketing healthcare costs, and instead rubber-stamps policies that reward billionaires at the expense of everyone else.”

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said he would not support the bill because it would “double healthcare” costs and cause “50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year.”

SENATE TAKES FIRST STEP TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT, FUELING DEMOCRATIC SPLIT

“I'm voting no on the continuing resolution that would double healthcare premiums for 20 million Americans, kick 15 million people off Medicaid & allow 50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year,” Sanders posted. “All to give $1 trillion in tax breaks for billionaires.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been an outspoken critic of the shutdown and has frequently mentioned healthcare costs resulting from the expiring Obamacare subsidies. She echoed those sentiments on Sunday night, explaining her vote against the bill by claiming the country was in a “healthcare emergency.”

“I will not support a deal that does nothing to make healthcare more affordable,” Warren posted. “We are in a healthcare emergency. A simple one-year extension of these tax credits would cost less than Donald Trump's $40 billion bailout for Argentina. A vote for this bill is a mistake.”

Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said he was also voting against the bill because of healthcare costs that were “hurting the people” in his state.

As I've always said, I will not support a government funding bill that continues to raise our costs, jeopardizes our health care, and hurts the people of my state.I'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for Americans who are counting on us to lower their…

“As I've always said, I will not support a government funding bill that continues to raise our costs, jeopardizes our healthcare, and hurts the people of my state,” Booker said. “I'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for Americans who are counting on us to lower their costs, and address the urgent, and–in too many cases–dire challenges people are facing in our country.”

“I will not let up in this fight,” he added. “I will vote no.”

Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) also mentioned healthcare costs as the reason he voted against the bill. He also promoted the idea that the bill does not help working-class people but only the affluent and wealthy.

“I just voted against this funding bill because healthcare costs are skyrocketing,” Kelly posted on his X account. “The only thing Trump knows how to do is give tax cuts to rich people, while screwing over working Americans.”

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) also cited healthcare costs as the reason for his vote against the bill.

“I'm voting NO on the CR,” Gallego posted. “I have been clear on this from the beginning: I will not turn my back on the 24 million Americans who will see their premiums more than double if we don't extend these tax credits.”

“At a time when prices are already too high, Americans are shopping for health insurance and experiencing such sticker shock that they are being forced to sign up for a crappy, overpriced plan or not signing up for insurance at all,” he added.

Gallego then slammed Republicans for working to reopen the government because the deal agreed to Sunday night pits “working people against each other.”

“It is disgusting that Republicans have put the country in the place where they are pitting working people against each other — a family at a food bank versus a family that relies on the premium tax credits to get good medical care,” Gallego said. “We can and must care about both.”

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) also cited healthcare costs as a reason for her vote against the bill and blamed Republicans for the crisis.

“Lowering costs is the top priority for the American people,” she said. “I voted against this budget bill because it does not prevent health insurance premiums from doubling for so many Americans. The President and Congressional Republicans should have come to the table to work with us to lower these costs. In every other budget impasse or shutdown there were negotiations and compromise with the White House. I am committed to lowering healthcare costs and will do everything I can to get this done.”

WHERE EVERY SENATE REPUBLICAN STANDS ON TRUMP'S CALL TO END THE FILIBUSTER

Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA) also voted against the deal to end the government shutdown after regularly expressing the need to reopen the government. On Sunday night, he said he was voting no because of high healthcare costs and, like his Democratic Senate colleagues, blamed it on Republicans.

I refuse to support a funding bill that fails to address the Republican health care crisis.And make health insurance affordable. The American people clearly understand the stakes and the urgency. We must too. I'm voting no.

The three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled against the Trump administration regarding the distribution of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.

The court denied a request by the Trump administration to block a district court's previous ruling that full SNAP benefits were to be paid to all 42 million recipients during the shutdown. Additionally, the district court found that the government's choice “not to make full SNAP payments was likely arbitrary and capricious.” Moreover, the court ruled that the district court's earlier decision was appropriate insofar as “the overwhelming evidence of widespread harm” from stopping SNAP benefits was more detrimental than the reasons the Trump administration provided to want to stop payments. 

Moreover, the circuit court also issued a scathing criticism of the Trump administration, stating that the issues stemming from the lack of SNAP benefits distribution “could have been avoided.” And it was also critical of the administration's request for a stay to withhold SNAP benefits.

“In reviewing the district court's balancing of the equities, we also cannot ignore the particular events preceding this litigation,” read court documents. “As the district court found, ‘this is a problem that could have been avoided.'”

“The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,” wrote the First Circuit Court. “In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 temporary restraining order after the government had failed to comply with it.”

The court was also critical of the administration's request for a stay to withhold SNAP benefits, claiming that “the government has failed to show it is entitled to the extraordinary relief of a stay. It has not made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits. Nor does it refute the extensive record evidence of the enormous injury to individuals around the country that a stay would cause.” 

WHERE EVERY SENATE REPUBLICAN STANDS ON TRUMP'S CALL TO END THE FILIBUSTER

“We do not take lightly the government's concern that money used to fund November SNAP payments will be unavailable for other important nutrition assistance programs,” read comments by the First Circuit Court. “But we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the overwhelming evidence of widespread harm that a stay would cause right now, by leaving tens of millions of Americans without food as winter approaches, outweighed the potential monetary harm to the government and CNP, months into the future. Thus, we reject the government's stay request as to the order.”

So, the circuit court ruled against the Trump administration's request to stop the distribution of SNAP benefits. However, due to last week's ruling by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the circuit court's ruling was on hold from going into effect for 48 hours, which, at this point, would be late Tuesday night.

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) lamented centrist Senate Democrats' decision to join with Republicans in advancing a funding plan to end the government shutdown, casting it as a “very, very bad” vote.

The Senate was able to move a step closer to ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history, passing the funding bill in a test vote on Sunday, with eight Democrats crossing the aisle. While the legislation still needs to overcome more procedural hurdles in the Senate and then pass the House, it ended a deadlock that has led to delays at airports and a lapse in SNAP benefits.

Despite the progress, Sanders trashed part of his caucus for abandoning their healthcare demands, specifically the expiring Obamacare subsidies. The new framework, while not including an extension of the subsidies, allows a December vote on them.

“Tonight, eight Democrats voted with the Republicans to allow them to go forward on this continuing resolution. And to my mind, this was a very, very bad vote,” he said in a roughly 90-second clip. “What it does, first of all, is it raises healthcare premiums for over 20 million Americans by doubling and in some cases tripling or quadrupling, people can't afford that when we're already paying the highest prices in the world for healthcare. No. 2, it paves the way for 15 million people to be thrown off a Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act.”

He also framed the eight Senate Democrats' votes as essentially bending the knee to President Donald Trump, underscoring widespread gains for the Democratic Party in the 2025 midyear elections last week.

“Just on Tuesday, we had an election all over this country, and what the election showed is that the American people want us to stand up to Trumpism, to his war against working-class people, to his authoritarianism. That is what the American people wanted. But tonight, that is not what happened,” Sanders added.

SENATE TAKES FIRST STEP TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT, FUELING DEMOCRATIC SPLIT

Sanders's public criticism is not necessarily a break from the party he caucuses with. A majority of Senate Democrats voted against advancing the funding bill, though the test vote saw some surprise votes, particularly Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), who was the only member of Senate Democratic leadership to support the bill.

The other seven Democrats who voted for the bill included some who previously voted to end the shutdown, specifically Sens. John Fetterman (D-PA), Angus King (I-ME), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV). They were joined by Sens. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) on Sunday night.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The shutdown was hurting Trump. Ending it helps him.

The conventional wisdom about government shutdowns is that they always fail. Senate Democrats probably assumed as much when they shut down the government. Perhaps they thought they were giving partisan activists something to root for, even fleetingly, before eventually caving.

That was a reasonable, if somewhat cynical, calculation. The odd thing is that the shutdown was actually working for Democrats, but in a way that some Democratic senators did not fully internalize, and which makes their ultimate capitulation tonight much harder to understand.

The reason shutdowns always fail is that the public eventually turns against the party responsible, applying more and more heat until its most vulnerable members feel compelled to give in. Presidents have little reason to give concessions to end shutdowns, because the bulk of the political pain is typically felt by their congressional adversaries.

That did not happen this time. Polls found that the public narrowly but consistently placed the blame on Donald Trump and his allies, not congressional Democrats. The likely reason is that Trump has comported himself unlike any other president, flaunting his impunity in ways both important (refusing to fund programs authorized by Congress) and visible (a unilateral demolition of the East Wing). He hosted a decadent “Great Gatsby” Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago hours before millions of Americans lost food stamps.

Read: Why this shutdown is so dangerous

Trump's approval ratings have tailed off sharply during the shutdown. Indeed, Trump himself attributed the Republican Party's surprisingly dismal performance in Tuesday's elections to the shutdown.

What's more, Democrats' goal during the shutdown was to draw more public attention to health care, one of their strongest issues, and one where Republicans are engineering a social catastrophe. Democrats are demanding an extension of tax credits for people purchasing health insurance on the individual market. That is an issue where they command massive public support.

Republicans were unlikely ever to give in on the tax credits, because their ideological opposition to universal health care is so overwhelming that they would rather suffer defeat than surrender. But that is just the thing: They were taking the hit. Democrats had succeeded in drawing news coverage to health care, and had even baited Republicans into floating more of their toxic and radical ideas for changing the system.

The likeliest way out of the impasse wasn't that Republicans would make concessions on the Affordable Care Act, but rather that they would decide to end the filibuster, changing Senate rules to block minority parties from shutting down the government. Trump has demanded Republican senators do this, and his ask is completely reasonable. It makes no sense for Congress to require a supermajority vote merely to allow the government to stay open.

This outcome would ultimately have been a win for Democrats. The Senate would get fairer and more reasonable rules. Democrats would not find themselves in the unfair position of being asked to supply votes for a government-spending deal Trump feels free to violate at will. And the next time Democrats get full control of government but fewer than 60 Senate votes, they would have an easier time passing their own agenda.

Jonathan Chait: How Trump wants to help Democrats

Yet this may be the very possibility that caused a handful of Senate Democrats to defect. The substantive arguments for the filibuster are terrible, but they appeal to the senatorial ego. Senators in both parties cherish the filibuster as the thing that makes their chamber unique.

Democrats could have held the line on the shutdown, and spent weeks watching Trump's approval ratings fall while war breaks out between the pro-filibuster Republican senators and the president and his loyalists. This would have produced a better and more democratic ultimate outcome.

Holding out would have caused serious pain in the short run. “I think people were saying, ‘We're not going to get what we want,' although we still have a chance,” Senator Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, told reporters. “But in the meantime, a lot of people are being hurt.” If you truly believe that Trump poses an existential threat to the republic, however, this is the kind of ruthless maneuver you would undertake. Trump has already caused, and will continue causing, horrific outcomes for vulnerable Americans.

Democrats may have been more surprised than anybody to discover their shutdown strategy was actually drawing political blood. Their instinct was to withdraw the knife anyway.

Veteran ICE officers know face coverings are a bad look. But they're not coming off anytime soon.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

A few days after President Donald Trump took office, I got an invitation from ICE officials to observe the administration's new “surge operations” in New York City. They told me to show up at 4 a.m. at the downtown federal building where the agency has its holding cells. Officers in body armor huddled in the basement parking garage, then headed to the Bronx in a caravan of unmarked cars.

The trip wasn't particularly remarkable. Over the next few hours, officers made just one arrest. ICE officials were flustered that morning because Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, had shown up to join them, along with a CBS News crew. Noem began posting videos about arresting “dirtbags” before the sun was up. ICE officials had always insisted to reporters that social-media posts or any mention of ongoing operations would blow their cover and put officers in danger. But Noem was new, and eager to look tough, and the officers I talked with mostly just laughed it off. By mid-morning, the ride-along was over.

Looking back at the photos I took that day, one thing stands out. The ICE officers weren't wearing masks.

The face coverings and neck gaiters went up soon after. A mid-February viral video from York, Pennsylvania, showed five officers in masks hauling away a man who begs to call his wife. In March, ICE grabbed the Turkish graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk—whose visa was revoked for co-writing an op-ed about Gaza—and surveillance footage showed her surrounded by agents in plain clothes, some with hoods, who yanked up their masks as they dragged her away.

As Trump's deportation campaign escalated, the masks quickly turned officers and agents into a faceless, impersonal, undifferentiated goon squad. It's a look that has long been associated with authoritarian regimes and secret police, and the basic visual signifiers of American law enforcement—criminals wear masks; cops show their faces—were suddenly inverted. In videos of masked officers that have gone viral since then, it's often hard to tell who is speaking, let alone what agency they belong to. Some of the encounters are so rushed that they look like abductions, not conventional arrests, and activists have started calling the federal agents “kidnappers.”

Face coverings are now a standard accessory for federal immigration enforcement, and a symbol of the mass-deportation campaign that is Trump's top domestic-policy initiative. Veteran ICE officials I spoke with view the use of masks as an unquestionably negative development. But most of them see an evil that is necessary.

The job, under Trump, has changed. Immigration enforcement has traditionally happened more quietly and administratively, in jails or at ICE check-in offices, where the work is more akin to case management. Trump officials ordered officers into the streets and pressured them to meet arrest quotas, while turning the job into a kind of public performance by bringing news cameras and the administration's own film crews to make Department of Homeland Security propaganda videos. Activist groups and protesters record everything too, trailing the agents and officers with cellphone cameras, berating them and broadcasting the ugliest moments. Every encounter carries the risk of a viral interaction and online infamy that could lead to doxxing or something worse.

The masks were a way for officers to opt out—to wall off the political complexities of their work or, for some, the moral ones.

“The excuse I have heard is, ‘I signed up for this, my family didn't,'” one ICE official wrote to me. They described colleagues who say they've been “demonized” by their relatives and neighbors, or who say their children have been taunted in elementary school. The official, who was not authorized to speak with reporters, sympathized with colleagues who wear masks, but acknowledged that masking has an insidious effect on police work.

“People tend to be worse when they can be or think they are anonymous,” the official told me. “You think about what you are doing and how you are doing it when you know a particular use of force can be tied to who did it.”

The face coverings are not mandatory. Most federal agencies do not provide them, and not every officer and agent uses one. In February and March, when masks became more common, ICE leaders discussed whether to restrict their use, according to current and former ICE officials I spoke with. Some officers had grown accustomed to wearing masks and neck gaiters during the pandemic, and officials adopted a permissive approach to their use, leaving it to individual discretion. Officers typically remove the masks when they're speaking to one another away from the cameras, or performing other nonpublic duties, then pull them up once they're making an arrest or see that they're being filmed. “It's part of their uniform now,” another ICE official told me. “It's second nature.”

None of the dozen or so current and former officials I spoke with said they thought the masks would come off anytime soon. Not in the new era of online activism, facial recognition, and anonymous threats. Not with the Trump crackdown escalating and becoming more confrontational.

Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, told CBS News that he wasn't a “proponent of the masks,” but he would allow them if officers thought they would help “keep themselves and their family safe.” Noem said that the masks help officers protect themselves “in dangerous situations,” and that DHS agencies could set guidelines for their use. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the department, told me in an email that federal law-enforcement officers are facing a rash of threats and assaults “including terror attacks, cars being used as weapons, bounties to murder them placed on their heads.”

“That is why our officers wear masks,” McLaughlin wrote. “Protecting their identity is one way to prevent bad actors from targeting their homes and threatening their families.”

In September, three women were charged in California for following an ICE agent home and posting his address on Instagram. Two men in Georgia were indicted by a grand jury last month for threatening to harm an ICE agent in social-media posts that included images of the man and his spouse. And a Mexican man living illegally in Dallas was arrested on October 14 after offering $10,000 for killing ICE agents in posts on TikTok.

But sometimes, the masks are used as tools of intimidation. On Halloween, federal agents in Southern California were photographed heading out to make arrests wearing ghoul masks. When the news site L.A. Taco asked DHS about the costumes, McLaughlin sent a two-word response: “Happy Halloween.”

To speed up immigration arrests and deportations, DHS has pulled in help from the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and other Department of Justice agencies—and those federal agents have adopted masks, too. Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the department, did not respond to questions about department policies regarding face coverings and agency identifiers. “Protecting the safety and security of our federal law enforcement officers ridding our country of dangerous illegal aliens will continue to be a top priority for this Administration,” Baldassarre wrote in a one-sentence response. One ICE official told me that DOJ agents sent to help them seem even more eager to hide their faces. “They mask up even more, because they don't love being out with us,” he told me.

Some of the National Guard forces sent by Trump to protect ICE officers and buildings cover their faces, but the troops patrolling Washington, D.C.—and picking up litter—generally don't wear them. The National Guard does not have a uniform policy governing masks, and a spokesperson for the Guard told me their use can be set by whichever state or federal authority is in charge of their deployment.

The masks, which DHS insists are a means of keeping officers safe, have also served as a rallying point for protest and a spur to confrontation. They “immediately escalate things,” another former ICE official told me, and reinforce an impression that agents and officers are ashamed of what they're doing. Officers and agents with faces covered have been confronted by local residents and protesters who denounce them as “cowards” for hiding their faces.

In Washington, Trump opponents have launched a street-art campaign, plastering the city with posters that say Take off your masks! and Why are you hiding your face? Public servants should face the public. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has not opposed the National Guard troop deployment but has urged federal forces not to wear masks and to clearly identify themselves on city streets.

Democrats have introduced legislation that would bar federal agents from using masks during immigration arrests, but the efforts are mostly symbolic. “The United States is not a dictatorship,” Representative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who introduced the “No Secret Police Act” in June, said in a statement. He called his proposal “commonsense legislation ensuring that our federal government's laws are enforced by identifiable human beings, not anonymous, secret agents of the state.” California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation with the same name. It's due to take effect January 1, but it's unclear how state authorities expect to enforce the law against federal agents and officers.

The legislation demands that federal agents and officers wear uniforms and insignia that clearly identify the agencies they work for. Many of the agents use ballistic vests with generic labeling that says Police or Federal Police. Others say ERO, which stands for Enforcement and Removal Operations—the deportation arm of ICE—but the acronym isn't well known to the public. Veteran officials I spoke with said the lack of clear labels isn't a deliberate attempt to evade responsibility. They offer a more humdrum explanation: bulk orders of protective gear made by different agencies, at different times, without a single standard.

Some ICE officials I spoke with said they would welcome clearer identifiers because they resent being blamed for violent incidents involving U.S. Border Patrol agents. Trump's crackdowns in Los Angeles and Chicago have been led by Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, and many of the viral arrest videos on social media have involved his forces, not ICE officers. The White House signaled a preference for Bovino's tactics last month when the administration started replacing even more ICE leaders at regional offices with Border Patrol commanders. In DHS social-media videos promoting Bovino's commando tactics, he is often the only Border Patrol figure without a mask, a visual effect that enhances his performative role in Trump's campaign.

Read: The hype man of Trump's mass deportations

Border Patrol and ICE tend to have a different approach to immigration enforcement: ICE officers are used to working in U.S. cities and targeting specific individuals they're seeking to arrest. Border Patrol agents work in remote desert and mountain areas where they are trained to see anyone they encounter as a suspected illegal entrant. They don't hesitate to use force on suspects who run or resist arrest. But they've never been deployed to U.S. cities at this scale, hundreds of miles from any border crossing.

Jason Owens, who retired as Border Patrol chief in April, told me that he understands agents' decision to conceal their faces. “I'm having a tough time blaming our folks when I see what the crowds and extremists have been capable of,” Owens told me. He said agents keep patches with their badge numbers clearly visible on their uniforms, and do not use masks with skulls or other “unprofessional markings.”

When I worked as a reporter in Mexico covering the drug war in the early 2010s, the police and soldiers often wore masks, while the criminals went around with their faces showing. The cartels would learn the identities of officers and soldiers, and try to corrupt them. If they refused to take bribes, they were targeted for assassination. This offer was called plata o plomo—“silver or lead.” A bribe or a bullet.

Those who did take the bribes and worked for the traffickers would continue doing so in their police or military uniforms, leaving no way for the public to tell who was who. It became safer to assume the cartels were everywhere. Trust in police, and public institutions more broadly, steadily eroded, allowing lawlessness—or unaccountable, arbitrary assertions of state power—to flourish.

The U.S. does not have a similar crisis of corruption in its law-enforcement agencies, but criminals in the United States have started using masks to impersonate federal officers, making it hard for ordinary citizens to know whether an armed masked man is there to enforce the law or to break it. There have been more cases of ICE impersonators this year than during the past four presidential administrations combined, according to CNN. In June, two masked men wearing vests that said ICE stopped a motorist and robbed him at gunpoint in Delaware. In August, a masked gunman robbed a grocery store in Colorado Springs after flashing a fake ICE badge. Masked men impersonating FBI agents robbed a home in Southern California last month.

Chuck Wexler, the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which works with police agencies to promote best practices, said there has long been a divergence regarding transparency in the way state and local police departments operate compared with the feds. “Why do police officers have their names on their uniforms, and their badge numbers? All of those things have evolved over time because police officers work in the community, and the community pays their salaries,” Wexler told me. “That is what trust and good policing look like.”

When officers are involved in a shooting or another use of force, these departments typically release the name of the officer as a matter of accountability, he added.

Federal forces take orders from the White House, not the cities and communities where they're working. The masks, Wexler said, are partly the product of a wider trust gap brought about by Trump officials claiming to be targeting dangerous criminals—“the worst of the worst.” Instead the public sees agents grabbing people not engaged in any obvious criminal activity: mothers walking children to school, landscapers coming home from work, families in the hallways of courthouses.

Wexler said police departments in some cities are getting 911 calls from community residents reporting the presence of armed masked men in their neighborhoods, hoping local officers can protect them. “I think most people who live in those communities want the worst of the worst deported,” Wexler told me. “If ICE agents were arresting or deporting the worst of the worst, they probably wouldn't have to wear masks.”

The Trump administration is cracking down on Americans' freedom of speech with a new viciousness, but the First Amendment won't go down without a fight.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Early last month, the White House convened a meeting of right-wing influencers for a livestreamed discussion of antifa and the danger they claim it poses. Over the course of the roundtable, President Donald Trump suggested that protests against him had been organized by mysterious funders, who he hinted could soon be in “deep trouble.” He complained about television networks that were biased against him but praised CBS, whose parent company had recently been purchased by a Trump-friendly billionaire. And he touted an executive order that demanded the Justice Department bring charges for burning American flags. “We took the freedom of speech away,” the president said.

Like so many of Trump's pronouncements, this was something of an exaggeration: Flag burning is still protected speech under the First Amendment, per a 1989 Supreme Court decision that Trump has no ability to overturn. But Trump's comment did reflect a deeper truth about his administration's effort to force an abrupt contraction of American civic space.

During the first 10 months of Trump's second term in office, the federal government has cracked down on political expression—often understood as the most protected category of speech—with a persistence and viciousness reminiscent of some of the darkest periods of U.S. history. The administration has pushed for the prosecution of the president's political opponents, fired government employees for taking positions perceived as less than entirely loyal to Trump, and barred certain law firms from working with the government because they displeased the president. It blocked AP reporters from the White House press pool because the wire service refused to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” It has investigated media companies and threatened to withhold merger approvals unless networks get rid of DEI policies; slashed billions of dollars in grants that it characterized as deriving from “immoral” and “illegal” DEI practices; and withheld funding for high-profile universities such as Harvard and Columbia with the goal of forcing their capitulation to the administration's political agenda. Following the murder of the right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, in September, the administration called for the repression of left-leaning political views and revoked the visas of six foreigners who had criticized Kirk online. Months earlier, it snatched up and attempted to deport foreign students studying at U.S. universities who had criticized Israel, deriding them as “pro-Hamas.”

These attacks are dizzying in their variety. But they are best understood in the aggregate, as facets of a single campaign to destroy the American public sphere and rebuild it scrubbed of political opposition. In that respect, Trump's crusade of repression bears a resemblance to the ongoing silencing of dissent in other backsliding democracies around the world, such as Turkey, Hungary, and India. After federal immigration agents grabbed Rumeysa Özturk, a Turkish Ph.D. student at Tufts University, off a Boston-area street—apparently in retaliation for her co-authorship of an op-ed criticizing Israel—a group of Massachusetts members of Congress compared the abduction to the 2020 arrest of a dissident by secret police in Belarus. Cases such as Özturk's, the representatives wrote in The New York Times, bring the country “closer to the authoritarianism we once believed could never take root on American soil.”

Yet the Trump administration's effort to crush dissent is not without American precedent. On a single day in 1920, the Justice Department rounded up thousands of people for deportation because of their supposed Communist sympathies, though many had little or nothing to do with the Communist Party. In Boston, not far from where Özturk was arrested, some “aliens” were handcuffed and chained together while authorities marched them down the street in front of photographers. Those raids were the peak of what is now known as the first Red Scare—a period of paranoia about Communism and anarchism that began around the time of America's entry into World War I. Three decades later, the country plunged into the second Red Scare, a rampage against supposed Communist plots often remembered by the name of its most famous proponent, Republican Senator Joe McCarthy. Accused “reds” were hauled in front of Congress, lost their jobs, and retreated from public life.

Today, the country might be said to be in the midst of a third Red Scare. It is shaped by the legacies of the previous two, in terms of both its substantive anxieties and the techniques of its inquisitors. Our new Red Scare, like the first, is obsessed with immigration and the potential of left-wing political violence—then, anarchists and Communists; today, the imagined, shadowy antifa. Like the second, it is coupled with unease about changing norms regarding gender and sexuality. The anti-Communist fervor of the late 1940s and '50s generated suspicion of women in positions of authority within government and drove thousands of gay and lesbian government employees out of the federal workforce, in what the historian David K. Johnson termed the “Lavender Scare.” Now the Trump administration's anxiety about the erosion of rigid gender roles manifests in its disdain for feminism—early in the administration, agencies removed material on women's achievements from their websites—and in its aggressive hostility toward transgender people, whom the government has pushed out of the armed forces and erased from National Park Service websites. Cam Silver, a political scientist at the City University of New York, described this campaign as a “Sapphire Scare,” after the blue of the transgender-pride flag. “The word ‘woke' now performs the job that ‘communism' did in the 1950s,” Silver told me over email.

In a country that prides itself on independence and freethinking, key pillars of civil society—universities, law firms, businesses—have proved quiescent in the face of a campaign to squelch dissent. The political scientist Steven Levitsky, a prominent scholar of democratic decline, graded the early response of civil society to Trump's onslaught as a “D-minus.” Yet as methods of repression have evolved over the past 70 years, so, too, have methods of resistance. Trump's campaign of repression is therefore in the strange posture of pushing more forcefully to silence dissent than the first and second Red Scares ever did, while also facing far more organized opposition—and a public that sours on the government's efforts the more that Trump doubles down. American civil society is in some ways weaker than many had hoped, but it is also stronger than it once was.

The first and the second Red Scares both drew their power from fear. Although President Woodrow Wilson ultimately was able to deport only a small portion of the noncitizens arrested during the first Red Scare, those numbers don't capture the “intimidation resulting in self-censorship” that spread after the raids, Julia Rose Kraut explained to me; she is a legal historian and the author of Threat of Dissent: A History of Ideological Exclusion and Deportation in the United States. In June 1917, in a precursor to the Trump administration's furor over student protests at Columbia University, three students were prosecuted for printing anti-draft pamphlets. (My great-great-uncle was among them.) Then, as now, government harassment was a warning to others not to make too much noise. Similarly, in the second Red Scare, after a group of prominent screenwriters, producers, and directors—the “Hollywood Ten”—were questioned about suspected Communist sympathies by the House Un-American Activities Committee, the movie industry began quietly paring back film scripts to avoid anything too left-wing.

Contemporary First Amendment law refers to this dynamic as a “chilling effect,” and there is a great deal of it in the United States right now. Testifying in a legal challenge brought by the American Association of University Professors against the Trump administration for its attempted deportations of student protesters, multiple green-card-holding professors said that they had ceased speaking publicly and attending conferences for fear of attracting the administration's attention. In Texas, where several professors and university administrators have been pushed out or otherwise punished following MAGA outrage, some academics say they are anxious about the potential career repercussions of teaching subjects as previously anodyne as the women's suffrage movement and gender-bending comedies by Shakespeare. In Tennessee, a retired police officer spent more than a month in jail after sharing a Facebook meme in response to Charlie Kirk's death. Large law firms are wary of affiliating themselves with politicized causes, lest they be targeted by Trump's wrath—making it more difficult for would-be plaintiffs to secure pro bono legal representation. Chat with a journalist whose work touches on domestic politics, and you will likely hear complaints that many sources are now far less likely to go on the record for any story critical of Trump.

The historians, lawyers, and scholars I spoke with were in marked agreement that the current moment is not just comparable to but even more damaging than previous Red Scares. Within higher education, today's crackdown is “worse than McCarthyism—much worse,” Ellen Schrecker, a historian and the author of No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities, told me. Then, she explained, individual academics were scrutinized and fired for Communist ties. But today, the country is experiencing a “frontal attack on everything that has to do with universities and colleges,” Schrecker said.

This assault on higher education is best understood as a means of destroying a locus of political opposition. With growing political polarization along educational lines, college-educated voters have become more likely to vote for the Democratic Party. Trump's solution is an attempted dismantling of the institutions that helped produce these voters in the first place—and a symbolic attack on institutions of knowledge and expertise that are inherently at odds with Trump's model of governance by know-nothingism.

This overtly partisan cast distinguishes Trump's campaign to crush dissent from America's fits of anti-Communist paranoia in the early and mid-20th century, which were more bipartisan affairs. The House of Representatives twice refused to seat the socialist Victor Berger in Congress by near-unanimous votes in 1919 and 1920, objecting to his anti-war views. Although the second Red Scare is today associated with McCarthy's culture-warring conservatism, a key early step was Democratic President Harry Truman's establishment of a loyalty program to root out “subversive” federal employees. Likewise, although the first and the second Red Scares spiraled out of control, they began as responses to genuine shocks: the Russian Revolution in 1917 followed by a string of anarchist bombings, and the deepening tensions amid the advent of the Cold War in the late '40s. As political violence again grips the country, the Trump administration seems less interested in lowering the temperature and more interested in wielding those threats as an excuse to quiet political opposition.

The government's legal tactics have changed since the first and second Red Scares, in large part because the protections offered by the contemporary First Amendment are far more robust. Today's law of free speech itself evolved “as a reaction to the problems of the McCarthy Era,” the First Amendment scholar Genevieve Lakier recently wrote. For this reason, Trump would have far more difficulty, say, prosecuting Columbia students simply for handing out pamphlets. The evolution likewise explains why the administration has so far struggled to come up with legal tools for attacking antifa—the nonexistent organizational structure of antifa notwithstanding—and why it has relied so heavily on paper-thin allegations of anti-ICE protesters assaulting immigration officers: Criminalizing political activity is out of bounds, full stop.

But at the same time, the Trump administration has proved skilled at exploiting the weak points of First Amendment law—a campaign most visible in the president's attack on pro-Palestinian foreign students, such as Özturk. Although a 1945 precedent establishes that immigrants within the United States enjoy First Amendment protections for freedom of speech and of association, the government's expansive powers of immigration enforcement have left noncitizens far more vulnerable to ideological scrutiny. In this sense, the Trump administration may have gone after noncitizen students with such force in significant part because they made for easy targets. Along similar lines, the Department of Homeland Security recently revoked the visa of Sami Hamdi, a British Muslim political commentator critical of Israel, and detained him for deportation—ostensibly for “supporting terrorism,” an allegation for which the government provided no evidence—while he was in the middle of a U.S. speaking tour.

The administration is also armed with post-9/11 legal precedents that cut into speech protections—even for citizens—on issues that can be framed as relevant to foreign policy or national security. When U.S.-based lawyers and human-rights advocates challenged the administration's sanctions on the International Criminal Court, arguing that Trump had violated their First Amendment rights by barring them from working with the court, the Justice Department pointed to a 2010 Supreme Court decision that allows restrictions on Americans' engagement with designated foreign terrorist organizations. For related reasons, Trump's supporters have toyed with the idea of somehow designating the poorly defined antifa as such a group, a move that could effectively criminalize dissent. (In September, Trump issued an executive order declaring antifa to be a domestic terrorist organization, but this designation has no legal meaning.) The fact that the administration has not yet done so speaks to the factual and legal shakiness of this argument.

The flip side is that political speech unambiguously by Americans, about America, receives strong legal protections. It's here that Trump has come to rely on more indirect methods of pressure—chiefly involving the withholding of money. Universities are far more vulnerable to presidential pressure today than they were during the second Red Scare, thanks to the massive amount of federal funding that the government has poured into higher education over the past 70 years. Trump is now dangling the potential loss of that same funding over schools to get them to bend to his will, and in many cases it is working in his favor. Columbia, Brown, Cornell, and the Universities of Pennsylvania and Virginia have all brokered agreements with the administration requiring various degrees of coordination with the government. The Federal Communications Commission, meanwhile, has leveraged a consolidated media landscape by threatening to withhold merger approvals unless companies pledge fealty to Trump. FCC Chair Brendan Carr approved an $8 billion merger between the media giants Skydance and Paramount, which owns CBS, only after Paramount handed Trump $16 million to settle a baseless lawsuit and Skydance agreed to install a Trump-friendly ombudsman at the network.

Carr's self-appointment as chief censor is a sharp reversal from his previous insistence that “censorship is the authoritarian's dream.” Like many others on the right, he spent President Joe Biden's term in office warning about supposed government repression of conservative ideas. Hypocrisy aside, this recent history has aided litigants who challenge attacks on free expression far more blatant than anything the Biden administration ever dreamed of. In 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that New York regulatory authorities had breached First Amendment protections by threatening and cajoling insurance agencies against doing business with the National Rifle Association. Again and again, judges have pointed to NRA v. Vullo to argue that Trump's bullying of law firms and universities is likely unconstitutional.

Right-wing cries for retaliation following Kirk's murder almost resulted in Vullo's biggest moment yet. After the late-night host Jimmy Kimmel criticized MAGA's response to the assassination, Carr appeared to threaten companies that didn't “take action” on Kimmel. Disney promptly pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live from ABC—a textbook example of the dynamic prohibited by Vullo. Kimmel, arguably, could have sued. Instead, public outrage exploded. Cancellations of subscriptions to Disney's streaming services doubled following a campaign encouraging consumers to abandon the company, according to the data-analytics company Antenna. Just shy of a week later, Disney returned Kimmel to the air. The broadcasters Nexstar and Sinclair, which are both awaiting the FCC's sign-off on acquisitions, initially refused to air the show but allowed it back on after just a few days.

When I spoke with Schrecker about her study of the second Red Scare, she pointed to Kimmel's victory as an indication of the difference between the McCarthy era and today. During McCarthyism, “there was essentially no opposition,” she told me. “People either supported the purges, or else they were too afraid.” One representative anecdote in No Ivory Tower describes a graduate student at the University of Chicago who, during the '50s, was unable to persuade frightened colleagues to sign a petition—not about any politically sensitive topic but for the university to install a vending machine in their laboratory. In contrast, after Disney pulled Kimmel from the air, petitions and calls for boycotts blossomed. The ACLU launched a campaign to “defend free speech,” and hundreds of actors and artists signed on.

Reading No Ivory Tower, I was struck by how little organizations such as the ACLU and the AAUP, the professors' association, did to protect academics from McCarthy's censorship. Today, both organizations have been aggressive in pushing back. The ACLU recently announced that it has filed more than 100 lawsuits against the second Trump administration; in addition to its lawsuit over attempted deportations of foreign students, the AAUP has filed suits against a variety of the administration's efforts to target higher education. Many civic institutions have buckled under pressure, but the ruckus made by the others is far louder than any of the muted pushback against McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee.

The institutions that initially caved have, paradoxically, tended to be bigger and wealthier—Paramount, Columbia University, prominent law firms. Such organizations “are in many instances actually more vulnerable, because they have more pain points—federal grants, licenses, merger approvals—that the Administration can use to exert leverage,” Fabio Bertoni, The New Yorker's general counsel, writes in a reflection on why elite law firms gave in to Trump. To some extent, this is a story about the increased size and role of the federal government in everyday life since the days of the last Red Scare, and what happens when that architecture is turned into a weapon.

But it is also a story about another set of crucial changes in American life since this period: the maturation of litigating organizations such as the ACLU, along with legal and cultural shifts that have made Americans more comfortable with the idea of taking the government to court. In the 1910s and '20s, and even through the '40s and early '50s, the Supreme Court fielded relatively few cases concerning individual rights. This changed with the civil-rights movement and the “rights revolution” of the '60s and '70s, when the Court became far more open to validating such claims. Charles Epp, a professor at the University of Kansas who researches law and social change, has argued that growing civil-liberties organizations became a “support structure” for these judicial shifts—and today, that support structure is the strongest it has ever been. The organizations that emerged from that tradition have been most forceful in responding to Trump's abuses, in many cases by representing individual plaintiffs or smaller groups that lack the vulnerabilities of major institutions. The challenge to Trump's treatment of foreign students, for example, was brought by the AAUP—itself represented by the Knight First Amendment Institute, a newer civil-liberties organization (for whose website I have written in the past)—rather than by universities themselves.

“Civil liberties organizations have vastly more capacity” than they did in the '50s, Epp explained over email, and that growth “helps to explain why the litigation against the Trump initiatives is so much more widespread than in the 1950s and early 1960s.” Sherrilyn Ifill, the former head of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, told me that she understands the work done by these organizations today to be adopting the “template that was created by those who practiced civil-rights law” in the movement's early years, most prominently at the LDF itself. In the mid-20th century, the LDF and other organizations like it pioneered the use of litigation as a means of resisting authoritarianism and racial repression, which intensified during both Red Scares. Litigation against contemporary attacks on democracy follows in that tradition. “Some of the institutions that have caved are simply ones that had never been tested with this kind of challenge,” Ifill said. “But for us, that's kind of baked into the pie.”

The rights revolution helped build a culture that today has led to widespread resistance to Trump's crackdown—grassroots upsets of the sort that led to Kimmel's return and that power both the mass demonstrations such as “No Kings” and the litigating organizations via donations and other support. The internet also helps opponents of the administration find support, connect with one another, and organize protests. Gay and lesbian Americans pushed out of government service during the Lavender Scare had little infrastructure to turn to for support, but the gay-rights movement blossomed in the subsequent decades. Silver, at CUNY, contrasted ongoing litigation and protests about the treatment of transgender Americans with the “silence and shame” of the '50s: “The erasure cannot happen in the dark the way it did before.”

Other hints of opposition have arisen from less predictable quarters. The American right's embrace of free speech as a rallying cry in recent years, drawing on First Amendment law shaped by both the response to McCarthyism and the civil-rights movement, led some Trump supporters to voice discomfort with outright calls to suppress opposing views in the aftermath of Kirk's murder. “I think it is unbelievably dangerous for government to put itself in the position of saying we're going to decide what speech we like and what we don't,” Republican Senator Ted Cruz said on his podcast after Brendan Carr threatened Disney over Kimmel.

Public support for the first Red Scare collapsed after the Justice Department embarrassed itself by issuing dire warnings about a May 1920 violent left-wing uprising that never occurred. The second Red Scare ran out of Communists to harass as the nation's attention shifted toward the civil-rights movement. Today, the third Red Scare is not popular: 57 percent of Americans oppose increased involvement by the federal government in higher education, 61 percent believe that Trump has gone “too far” in pressuring media organizations as a response to unfriendly coverage, and 55 percent strongly or somewhat disapprove of Trump's handling of free-speech issues; on the latter, data showed a 14-point decline even among Republicans from March to September.

The question is what damage will be done anyway. Canceling a Disney+ subscription is the sort of consumerist engagement with politics that's comfortable and familiar for average Americans. Standing up on behalf of individuals and institutions they don't have a consumer's relationship with is a more difficult task. And litigation can carry only some of that weight. The week after Nexstar and Sinclair relented and agreed to allow Kimmel back on air, Judge William Young issued a lengthy ruling in the AAUP's challenge to ideologically motivated deportations, holding that the Trump administration's treatment of noncitizen students violated the First Amendment. Despite his defense of the courts as the “major bulwark of our right to free speech,” the judge worried that litigation would be too “ponderously slow” and “crushingly” expensive to adequately protect free expression. And a court ruling alone will not dispel the fear that Trump has engineered, especially given the White House's willingness to disregard judicial orders.

All the while, civic space in America is more guarded, more cramped, and less free. The effect is not just a professor who chooses not to teach a potentially controversial subject, but also all of the students who don't have a chance to learn, and the scholarship and art they aren't inspired to produce. Even if activists can fight back against Trump's censorship campaign, any eventual accounting of our current moment will likewise need to attend to the careers that were not pursued and the things that were not done and not said. The damage done by this administration exists not just in overt censorship and destruction but also in its negative image, a topography of silence and absences.

AI might soon rob us of the thrill and challenge of cross-cultural conversation.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

When I heard about the “Live Translation” feature of Apple's newly released AirPods, what came to mind was my first night out in Berlin more than 20 years ago. I was just out of college, an American on a research scholarship plunging headlong into German. In the crowded warmth of a smoke-filled bar, amid music, laughter, and the blur of jet lag and alcohol, I tried to keep up with conversations that constantly threatened to outpace me. I pieced together what I could from the fragments I understood, leaning on gesture, tone, facial expression, and context to bridge the gaps. My replies, halting and imprecise, were limited by what I was able to say. What would have flowed effortlessly in English—and what a pair of earbuds could now make frictionless—demanded improvisation and an almost electric alertness.

I remember telling a German literature student about my undergraduate thesis on Paul Celan and only half-following her enthusiastic response, which, I gathered, had something to do with a product for which her home region was famous. How might this relate to the Romanian Jewish poet and Holocaust survivor? Then it struck me, just in time, that she'd misheard my pronunciation of his name as Porzellan. I nodded along at the interesting things she must have been saying about porcelain.

As the night went on, I began to enjoy a peculiar freedom in being cut off from the full range of my native eloquence. Thrown back on reduced resources, I had to reach for blunter, more elemental means of expression. Without the usual layers of tact and verbal finesse—those elaborate structures that so often serve as buffers against self-exposure—I found myself speaking with a rawness that was both humbling and unexpectedly exhilarating.

Later that night, as I lay on my mattress atop the makeshift loft in my sublet, words and snatches of sentences whirled through my head, and with them came a kind of euphoria—the sense of my mind being shunted onto new tracks. Over the following year, I could trace my linguistic reorientation through milestones: my first lovers' quarrel, my first pun, my growing ability to joke and flirt within the rhythms and social codes of German in that particular place and time. These moments weren't just markers of intellectual progress; they signaled a redrawing of my perceptual and emotional boundaries that no automated translation could replicate.

Apple is the sponsor of this year's Super Bowl halftime show, to be headlined by Bad Bunny, the world-famous Puerto Rican musical artist. Conservative politicians, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump, criticized the NFL for choosing a performer who sings almost exclusively in Spanish. When Bad Bunny hosted the Saturday Night Live season premiere last month, he addressed the backlash by delivering part of his monologue in Spanish. Then he told the audience that if they didn't understand what he'd just said, they had four months to learn. The provocation was at once playful and serious—a way of challenging his audience to stretch toward him rather than accommodating them. Bad Bunny and Apple may be partners in the Superbowl, but in a sense they are offering two opposing models of cross-linguistic encounter: One invites people to struggle with another language, to inhabit something unfamiliar; the other sells them the promise of bypassing that effort entirely.

The translation technology itself is astonishing, relying on large language models to all but realize the fantasy of the “Babel fish” from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy—instant communication with anyone, in any language, simply by placing a device in your ear. Yet as people embrace these transformative tools, they risk eroding capacities and experiences that embody values other than seamlessness and efficiency.

As a professional translator, I'm hardly an impartial judge of these trade-offs. My career translating German-language literature grew out of a lifelong preoccupation with languages, literatures, and cultures beyond my own. Spending my days in the space between English and German has given me a deep appreciation for what's required to cross a linguistic divide: the mental recalibration, the negotiation between different ways of structuring the world, the humility and curiosity that come with navigating a foreign context.

My work perpetually puts me back where I was at the start of my year in Berlin: out of my depth. The writers I've gravitated to—Friedrich Hölderlin, Franz Kafka, Daniel Kehlmann—offer no straightforward path from German into English. Translating Kafka's diaries took eight years; they confronted me with a language that mocked any attempt at mastery, looping back on itself, refusing to settle. Translation is less a matter of applying what I already know than of working slowly through uncertainty, allowing myself to be frustrated.

To translate is not simply to transfer meaning but to attend to differences—of culture, time, thought, expression—that evade perfect alignment. I was reminded of this not long ago by a line from Bertolt Brecht, inscribed on a black stone pillar beside his statue outside the Berliner Ensemble theater: Die Veränderbarkeit der Welt besteht auf ihrer Widersprüchlichkeit. The line's phrasing—“The changeability of the world rests on its contradictoriness”—is characteristically German, stringing together conceptually dense nouns. I pondered how I'd translate it, and each version I came up with tipped the balance differently: “The world's capacity for change lies in its contradictory nature.” “The world can change because it is contradictory.” “The world's contradictions make it possible to change it.” Such fine distinctions can't simply be computed; they depend on being felt, weighed, chosen.

It's in these very instances, when experience and intuition are essential, that language-prediction technology falls short. This is especially true in spoken communication. With its hesitations and half-understandings, it draws people into a shared project of meaning-making.

Read: The last frontier of machine translation

When I was living in Berlin, I realized that German offers specific opportunities for collaboration in conversation: Because the verb often comes last, you can set up the subject, object, modifiers, even the prefix, and leave the sentence hanging mid-word for your partner to complete. I'd begin, “Wenn man das System wieder ganz neu um- …” (“If one completely re- … the system”), and falter, my voice and face doing their best to convey what I was groping for. My partner might step in with umstellt (“rearranges”) or umbaut (“rebuilds”) or umdenkt (“rethinks”), and between us the sentence would find its footing. It wasn't relayed fully formed from one of us to the other but took shape only through the exchange itself.

Although one in five people in the U.S. speaks a language other than English at home, studies have found that fewer and fewer Americans learn second languages outside the home. This trend suggests to me that the global dominance of English has diminished the need—and, over time, the desire—for native speakers to expand their linguistic terrain. Accustomed to being understood in most places and situations, they are rarely forced to experience what it means to be on the other side of the language divide. This can breed cultural complacency: the assumption that their perspective is universal because they haven't had to struggle to express themselves in someone else's terms.

While native English speakers might feel like they can afford not to engage with other languages, the wider world continues to pay outsize attention to Anglophone culture. I've seen this asymmetry in my field for a long time. Far more books are translated out of English than into it. The rise of instantaneous AI translation could make drifting into insularity even easier, allowing users to “understand” the world without ever leaving the comfort of their linguistic home.

Of course, this technology won't just alter how we communicate; it also threatens to automate away an entire sector of skilled linguistic labor. Interpreters, translators, language teachers, subtitlers, and other specialists—people whose work relies on finely honed intellectual and creative abilities—now find our professions under mounting pressure from rapid technological change.

In places such as the United Nations, simultaneous interpreters have long worked behind soundproof glass, inconspicuous yet indispensable, enabling multilingual deliberation for people who may scarcely register their presence. The same is true on a much larger scale: Translation work quietly undergirds the infrastructure of global life, including diplomacy, international law, commerce, education, and consumer transactions. The more effective it is, the more it tends to disappear from view. This invisibility sustains the illusion of frictionless communication—an illusion the AirPods' translation feature seeks to make real, even as it is built on generations of accumulated human expertise, creativity, and ingenuity. Translators and interpreters, a largely freelance and economically precarious workforce, are particularly vulnerable to being supplanted by technology.

Douglas Hofstadter: Learn a foreign language before it's too late

In this our sector is hardly alone: Across many fields—copywriting, legal analysis, design—large language models are beginning to replicate tasks that were previously considered the preserve of trained human minds. History offers few encouraging examples of societies responding thoughtfully to such shifts. From textile workers in the Industrial Revolution to assembly-line workers in the age of robotics, once-stable fields have repeatedly lost out to technological innovation, while social policy has lagged far behind. Many more professions than ever may now be facing a similar inflection point.

Technology has always made some kinds of work obsolete. The more insidious danger now is that it will impoverish ways of thinking and relating that once enlarged and enlivened experience, among them the effort of crossing a language barrier. As we face this prospect, the question of what we stand to lose has never been more pressing. The loss may be immense, even if it passes largely unnoticed. If I'd had the new AirPods when I first arrived in Berlin after college, I might have believed that I wasn't missing anything.

Cultural critics have long warned that our media-and-technology ecosystem conditions us to treat language as purely instrumental—a neutral conduit for shuttling information from point A to point B. But anyone who has lived between languages knows it is never only that. Each language carries its own map of the world. What resists smooth transmission isn't an obstacle to communication, but part of its meaning and texture. Automatic-translation technology, by design, filters out that surplus as noise.

As a literary translator, I'm drawn to precisely that which defies easy equivalence: rhythm, play, idiosyncrasy, cultural specificity, the shimmer of ambiguity. My work happens where languages don't line up, where meaning must be reimagined rather than decoded and flattened. What I fear is that people will come to think of language as only what machines can translate, forgetting everything outside that frame. If technology promises to end the language barrier, we should ask: What else will it erase?

On MTV Cribs, celebrities packaged and sold their wealthy lifestyles to the world.

When MTV Cribs premiered 25 years ago, it promised to pull back the curtain on celebrity homes. The series followed in the mold of Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, which aired from the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s and showcased how the wealthy lived. (It wished its viewers “champagne wishes and caviar dreams.”) But MTV's take had a distinctly informal air: A star welcomed viewers at the front door, then leisurely steered them from room to room, their chatter directed toward a Steadicam-secured camera. These extravagant, often eccentric displays involved living-room jacuzzis, shag carpets, and costly collections—of lingerie, limited-edition sneakers, even tropical fish. The tours also featured more ordinary domestic details, such as unmade beds and the half-eaten contents of refrigerators. The goal, as David Sirulnick, one of the show's executive producers, said in a 2002 interview, was to demonstrate that celebrities were “just people like everybody else.”

Sticking to this motto helped Cribs walk the line between being relatable and aspirational—an effort that, 25 years later, in an era of hyper-wealth on television, seems almost quaint. Tales of wish fulfillment functioned accordingly: Usher bought the music producer L. A. Reid's old house, which he'd admired as a child, and Blink-182's Travis Barker described how he had imagined his pool—embellished with caves and a water slide—in his youth. Through these stories, audiences learned to view extravagant dwellings as not just emblems of individual success but portals into a fantasy life. They served as evidence that, with enough hard work and talent, anyone could achieve their own version of the residential American dream. Across 17 seasons and a handful of spin-offs, Cribs introduced a voyeuristic quality to the now-pervasive “lifestyle as entertainment” genre.

Read: Money is ruining television

The show's audience of Millennials, coming of age in an era defined by consumption, learned to take their cues from celebrities. These role models accumulated traditional markers of wealth while also having fun subverting them: In their respective episodes of Cribs, the That '70s Show actor Wilmer Valderrama highlighted red Solo cups and paper plates on display in a china cabinet, and Missy Elliott gestured to her decorative, seminude Greek statues, remarking, “Naked a-s-s all around the house.” The show featured nouveau riche celebrities who proudly referred to themselves as outsiders; the rapper Juelz Santana was still a “hood dude,” and the record producer Master P claimed that he'd come “from the ghetto.”

These scenes were designed for the average young viewer to enjoy, yet their appeal was offset by their unattainability. Even the celebrities themselves hadn't always attained Cribs' vision of the so-called good life. On occasion, the show constructed complete fantasies: Bow Wow and 50 Cent supplemented their car collections with luxury rental vehicles, and the singer JoJo presented her uncle's lake house as her own. On camera, T-Pain and Missy Elliott admitted to staging their homes—with a frosted cake and a colony of goldfish, respectively—several hours before filming. These contrivances became so well known that, in 2009, the All-American Rejects guitarist Nick Wheeler spent much of his appearance mocking them. “I went down to Enterprise and picked up what they had,” he said, standing beside his Mitsubishi and Mazda sedans, before flaunting his notably sparse kitchen. “I didn't just do this for Cribs,” he said, evoking an earlier episode in which Kim Kardashian insisted that the cookies on display in her kitchen were homemade, despite their striking resemblance to a popular prepackaged variety.

If the knowledge that people were watching them brought out the jocular humor in some interviewees, it moved others toward self-defense. Travis Barker brandished security cameras, and Snoop Dogg seemed wary of his neighbor, who he said had called the police to shut down his parties on several occasions. Cribs often glamorized the idea of owning private property, even as it demonstrated the hostility it could inspire. As soon as the cameras entered the home of the Backstreet Boys' AJ McLean, he made a point of closing the front door behind them. “That way, nobody comes in and just starts to sneak around in my house,” he said. Access to the properties on the show was strictly conditional: Viewers were allowed to watch a guided tour, not experience the lifestyle themselves.

Read: When home improvement is self-improvement

The show's true legacy, in some sense, was to fetishize a distinctly anti-social idea of home: individuals treating their space as a fortress against the outside world. The interior design itself frequently underlined this quality. Stars asserted dominion over their kingdom, their names airbrushed on walls (Bow Wow) and etched into marble floors (Missy Elliott). Personalized amenities—game rooms, theaters, gyms, and, in at least a handful of cases, stripper poles—enabled them to detach from the public altogether. “We don't have to go out into the city and have a good time—we bring the party to us,” said Usher in one episode, while gesturing to his municipal-size pool.

The secret of Cribs, though, was that even amid its less relatable moments, the show found a way for viewers to feel included in the fantasy: It taught the audience what to consume as well as why they should, by demonstrating how a person's property—both its literal value and its aesthetic qualities—could define them. Viewers could seek to understand a celebrity's personality by studying their domestic environment. “The subject of house furnishing is more important than is often realized,” said the Cribs companion book, explicitly articulating this connection:

Everyone is free to change his surroundings. Hence the furniture and the decorations of a house, and the condition of the house and grounds, are properly considered as index to the character of its occupants.

The idea of decor-as-disposition lives on in the show's many successors. Architectural Digest's video series Open Door, in particular, sees the rich and famous conduct home tours in a similar fashion to Cribs. Material choices speak loudly, if less ostentatiously: Dining tables are made of reclaimed Venetian planks, and bathtubs are made by Scottish barrel makers. Exclusivity, here, means embracing the bespoke or antique. Exorbitant displays of wealth like those on Cribs are now commonplace. But where the exhibitions on Cribs were charmingly, sometimes garishly, idiosyncratic, today's represent a subtler and often more generic version of taste.

Perhaps this is why, when revisiting Cribs, I found it endearing—a relic of a time when opulence enhanced eccentricity, amplifying one person's particular affinities. Today's lifestyle shows instead hinge on a pristine, editorialized look—as seen on Open Door as well as on real-estate series such as Selling Sunset and HGTV's home-improvement franchises. Even rookie design enthusiasts posting their budget decor lean toward clean homogeneity. And as the divide between public and private life continues to blur, those who once tuned in to watch others parade around in their luxurious homes now want to be watched themselves. Entry into one another's homes is no longer exceptional, but expected.

We've forgotten how radical household appliances are.

If Good News had a patron saint, it would be the Swedish professor of global health Hans Rosling.

A weekly dose of stories chronicling progress around the world.

Rosling, who died in 2017, was a wizard at using data and storytelling to challenge misconceptions around global development and progress. With statistics in hand, Rosling could convince the most determined pessimist that the world was, on balance, getting better. And there's no better example of the Rosling touch than a TED talk he gave in 2010 called “The Magic Washing Machine.”

“Laundry day” used to actually mean an entire day of soaking clothes, heating water, hauling, scrubbing, rinsing, wringing, and hanging. But standing on the stage next to the most basic washing machine you can imagine, Rosling described the day his family first used one. His awed grandmother watched the tumbling drum like a movie as his mother sat down and did something unheard of on laundry day: She read a book.

That's the point. For people of Rosling's mother's generation, a washing machine wasn't just a washing machine, it was a time machine. It created time — time to learn, earn, rest, and parent. And the past century of advances in what we might call household technology have given people — and especially women — the freedom to fill their hours as they wished.

In the US, the household appliance revolution of washing machines, dishwashers, and microwaves — plus the electrification that made them run — cut the burden of housework from something like 60 hours a week at the start of the 20th century to around 28 hours by 1970 and under 20 by 2005. Food work alone went from around 65 minutes a day in 1965 to around 37 minutes a day in 2014.

Because it is women who overwhelmingly did — and still do — all those hours of housework, the appliance transformation represents a big, underappreciated improvement in women's lives in particular. It may be difficult for us to recognize that now, after decades of growing used to these magic machines, but people at the time understood the connection. The pitch was explicit: Kitchens were being redesigned to mimic the efficiency of a factory, and advertisers marketed these appliances as engines of liberation. Some scholars argue that labor-saving appliances, plus the spread of universal plumbing and electrification, was a prerequisite to a world where women now make up nearly half the American workforce.

Though such appliances started off as the province of the rich, prices fell over time, and today, around 85 percent of American households own a washing machine. (As Vox contributing editor Kelsey Piper wrote earlier this year while reflecting on the current trade war, we shouldn't forget the value of cheap goods.) It's fashionable to decry America's convenience culture, and it does come with real environmental and social costs. But if given the choice, few of us, I think, would go back to the days when hand-done laundry took an entire day.

If you want a glimpse of what that would be like, just look at the lives of the roughly four billion people who still wash clothes by hand. They are overwhelmingly concentrated in low-income countries where access to electricity, piped water, and affordable machines is scarce. As a fascinating new report by the Washing Machine Project (TWMP), an NGO founded by the engineer Navjot Sawhney, found, in rich countries, only about 0.4 percent of people wash by hand; in low-income countries, it's around 98 percent.

Hand-washing isn't a quaint throwback; it's a time sink and a health risk, one overwhelmingly borne by women and girls. Time-use data gathered by TWMP in multiple countries is brutal. In Kampala, Uganda, people reported spending an average of 147 minutes per load — nearly 13 hours a week. In refugee communities in the Republic of the Congo, it was 149 minutes per load, with some women spending 20 to 24 hours each week on laundry alone. All that time displaces hours that could be spent in school, on making money, on caregiving, and even just on resting.

Hand-washers in these countries don't just have to do the laundry — often, they need to find the water themselves. In the Ugandan capital of Kampala, hand-washing used about 14 gallons per load. In Mexico, measured use reached 16 to 53 gallons — far more water than might be used for drinking alone. Fetching that water can be dangerous. Surveys in refugee camps in Greece found 35 percent of respondents feared harassment or theft during collection, while those in the Congo named risks from robbery to gender-based violence.

Then, there's the back-breaking nature of the work itself. In a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesvos, 87 percent of people reported physical pain from washing clothes — hands and backs for all, legs for most — plus skin damage and injuries from rough tools.

“The soap was harsh on the skin and nails,” one refugee said. It's not just time that's lost, but physical health.

The magic of the modern washing machine comes not only from the appliance itself but from the clean water, plumbing, and electrification that are commonplace in rich countries. But we can make progress even in desperately low-income regions.

Sawhney's human-powered Divya washer, which works via a hand crank, cuts laundry time and effort in low-resource settings. Field data in Uganda shows average time per wash falling from about 2.5 hours to around 29 minutes — a roughly 80 percent reduction. Over a whole month, laundry time shrank from roughly 13 hours to just over one hour.

You can see the ripple effects of that saved time. In Kenya's Shangilia School, cutting washing time in half freed students for reading, football, chess, and study. Staff reported fewer aches and less stress about water access. In Uganda and Congo, families reported using saved hours for caregiving, and in some households, men began to share laundry duties — a small but telling shift in gender roles. There are economic gains, too. In Kampala, detergent spending dropped from around $63 to $20 per week after adopting the machine — savings that add up in households with annual incomes around $840.

It's easy to dismiss washing machines and dishwashers as mere conveniences, even as things we should feel vaguely guilty about. Convenience, though, is too small a term for machines that have granted us the gift of time. What we do with that time is up to us, but I can think of 4 billion people who would like to have that same choice.

What a president for Gen Alpha might be like.

This story originally appeared in Kids Today, Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions.

What does the president do?

Kids might learn the answer to that question in school, but they also learn it from life — from eavesdropping on grown-ups, from snatches of news on TV or TikTok, from arguments on the playground or on the bus. The people who serve as president during one's childhood necessarily shape one's view of the office; my early conception of American political parties, for example, came largely from Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. And now multiple generations of young people are forming their understanding of the US presidency based on Donald Trump's tenure.

Trump has been either serving as president or seeking the presidency for a decade at this point, and he has approached the job, shall we say, differently than his predecessors. From assuming control over congressionally appropriated funding to posting a video of himself bombing protesters with poop to demolishing the East Wing of the White House, Trump's actions in office have upended previous ideas about what constitutes presidential behavior.

A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North.

To find out how, if at all, Trump's break-stuff approach to the presidency has affected young people's ideas of who the president is and how a head of state should act, I reached out to teachers, students, and experts around the country. What I learned is that while kids don't always understand the Hatch Act or the separation of powers, they do care what the president does. The actions of the person in the Oval Office influence the future that young people want to see, both for themselves and for the country.

There's some evidence that Trump's consolidation of power is affecting how kids and teens growing up right now see the role of the president, with potentially disturbing consequences for the future of checks and balances. At the same time, some young voters who were kids during Trump's first term tell a different story — one of a historically unpopular leader whose time in office pushed them to imagine something different.

Madalyn Probst was 10 years old when Trump was elected for the first time in 2016. Now a 20-year-old Florida college student who volunteers with the state's Democratic Party, she told me that the most important quality a president should have is integrity. “They're supposed to be a public servant,” she said. “I miss knowing that my president knew that.”

A lot of young voters cast their ballots for Trump in 2024, leading some to wonder if growing up during Trump 1.0 had pushed youth to the right. But experts say it's more complicated than that (a complexity that big Democratic wins among youth in 2025 may bear out).

The polarization of politics in the Trump era has affected young people across party lines, educators and political scientists say. Now the next generation of Americans is looking for a candidate they can trust.

“Gen Z and younger voters would be interested in someone that's actually responsive to them,” Alexandria Davis, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University (and Gen Z voter) told me.

Kids start to have some conception of government as early as kindergarten, but really begin to understand politics in middle or high school, Christopher Ojeda, a political science professor at University of California Merced, told me last year. That means a big subset of Gen Z voters came of age politically during the first Trump administration. Now, many Gen Alpha voters, born between 2010 and 2024, are getting their political education during Trump 2.0.

To some degree, the current occupant of the White House is shaping what young people see as presidential — and even what they see as legal. Shari Conditt, a high school government and history teacher in Washington state, asks her students to vote every Tuesday on a question of the day. She asked them recently if federal law allows the president to deploy National Guard troops without state approval, something Trump has tried to do in Illinois.

Two federal courts have ruled that this is not legal, and the issue is currently before the Supreme Court. However, 48.5 percent of Conditt's students voted that the move was permitted by law, while only 24.2 percent said it wasn't. (About 27 percent were unsure.) The result suggests that Trump's vision of the powers of the presidency is influencing teenagers, at least in Conditt's class.

For young people, “being socialized under the Trump presidency kind of sets a new precedent that the executive can effectively do whatever they want,” Davis said.

Growing up in a time of extreme political polarization also means kids and young people may not be learning about bipartisanship. “I understood a world where Obama was the president and trying to get things passed, dealing with a lot of pushback from a Republican Congress,” Davis said.

Today, conservatives control all three branches of government. Kids and teens aren't necessarily learning that those branches can serve as checks on one another, because all three are pretty much moving in lockstep with Trump right now.

In some cases, the polarization of the times is making kids reluctant to even talk about the president. For years, Conditt's students — in a purple congressional district that has elected both Republican and Democratic representatives in the past — would come to class eager to talk about current events, she said. But now, she notices more reluctance. “They're almost hesitant to talk about some things, because they don't want to offend,” Conditt said.

College students may have a deeper sense than younger kids and teens that Trump's presidency, in particular, is abnormal. Among undergraduates Davis teaches at VCU, “there is an understanding that this is not necessarily how these things are supposed to work,” she said.

“When I was really little, people would say they wanted to be president like Barack Obama,” Probst told me. Now, you're more likely to hear, “I want to be president, period,” she said. “The biggest difference is that you can't really see the president as a role model.”

The president is “not a legislator,” Probst added. “They're not supposed to be making laws. They're not supposed to be using the presidency as a whim.”

At the same time, a lot of young people are disillusioned with politics as a whole — not just with Trump. Gen Z voters “largely feel like both parties are not really fighting for them at all,” Davis said. “There is a sense of political alienation that younger voters, but specifically younger voters of color, feel about the political system.”

Any future presidential candidate would need to cut through that sense of alienation in order to win their votes. A lot of Gen Z voters are struggling with very basic economic concerns, Davis said: “Will I be able to get a job and be successful in my life? Will I be able to raise a family?”

They want to see a candidate who can relate to those fears, which might mean someone younger than today's political leaders, who simply haven't faced the same level of economic and global uncertainty as Gen Z.

Among Davis's students, Zohran Mamdani comes up a lot as the kind of candidate they'd like to see in the future. To them, his campaign “always felt close to community. It felt genuine, it felt authentic,” Davis said. “That's not something that they have seen in previous candidates.”

Indeed, 78 percent of 18- to 29-year-old voters supported Mamdani on Tuesday night, according to exit polls, with younger voters helping to drive high turnout. Young voters, especially women, helped propel Democrats to victory across the country.

Trump's gains with Gen Z in 2024, coupled with high-profile examples of young political operatives espousing virulent racism and antisemitism, have led some to wonder if growing up under Trump's first presidency had pushed a generation toward the radical right. But a more complex story is also emerging, one of young people worried for their futures and frustrated with the political process, but potentially eager for something different.

In a spring 2025 Harvard Youth Poll, for example, just 15 percent of Americans under 30 said the country was heading in the right direction, and under a third approved of Trump or either party in Congress. Concerns about the economy pushed many Gen Z voters to support Trump last year, Davis said, but she's seeing that support change as fears over civil rights come to the fore. “Those things that were being considered in 2024 have kind of shifted,” Davis said.

Probst, for her part, would like to see someone like Gov. Andy Beshear of Kentucky run for president. “I think we need to, as a whole, refocus on building the working class back up and lessening wage inequality in the United States,” she said.

Whoever the next president is, however, Probst maintains an idea of what a president should be that is, in some ways, defined in opposition to Trump. “I don't want them making erratic claims or attempting to alienate groups of people using their personal social media,” she said. “You're a figurehead, and you're supposed to represent all Americans, not just those who are convenient to you.”

Children in the Chicago area are being traumatized by ICE patrols and use of tear gas as part of the Trump administration's “Operation Midway Blitz,” teachers and families say. One mother heard her child tell her dolls, “We have to be good or ICE will get us.”

Dozens of Head Start centers, including all centers in Little Rock, Arkansas, have closed thanks to a lack of federal funding during the government shutdown. That means thousands of kids could be missing out on the education, meals, and therapies the centers provide.

American children have long used words like “satnav” and “petrol” thanks to Peppa Pig. Now, more British kids are apparently using Americanisms after watching Netflix and YouTube. Examples include “apartment” and “diaper.”

My older kid is now revisiting old favorite Eerie Elementary, reading independently this time. We are also excited for Broken, the new picture book by X. Fang, who wrote the perfect We Are Definitely Human.

Last month, I wrote about families getting landline phones for their kids. Reader Kate Ellen wrote from Wales to express surprise “because phone companies here are closing down landlines for private customers. We lost ours last year.” Without reliable cell phone service in the countryside, Kate Ellen has taught her kids to use the phone at a nearby nursing home if there's ever an emergency. “It may be because of my generation,” she wrote, “but even if our signal was better, I don't like this change, and I don't feel comfortable not having the landline.”

Can the hormone be an effective treatment for menopause?﻿

If you are a woman of a certain age, there's a new wonder drug that is flooding your feeds: testosterone. The hormone — which both men and women naturally have, but produce less of as they grow older — is being touted as a cure to low libido, low energy, and other symptoms. The Real Housewives are on it. Halle Berry is too. TikTok is obsessed with it.

Testosterone's role in the body helps with bone and muscle development, as well as sexual function. But the Food and Drug Administration has not approved testosterone treatment for women for perimenopause or menopause, so they have to seek it out off-label. However, numerous studies have shown that a low dose of the hormone can improve menopausal women's libido.

But some women are taking testosterone at far higher doses, ones that approach those taken by transgender people, who use hormone replacement therapy to address gender dysphoria. New York Times Magazine writer Susan Dominus spoke to many of them for an article that's taken the internet by storm.

“There were women who told me that they had hit the wall and how much weight they could lift, and suddenly they were breaking through,” Dominus told Today, Explained co-host Noel King. “They were toned. Women were having orgasms for the first time in years and years. One woman told me that her entire relationship to sex changed, that even when she was having sex, she was thinking about the next time they were gonna have sex.”

Dominus spoke to King about the benefits and side effects of testosterone treatment for women, why the FDA has been hesitant to approve it, and the sprawling economy that's formed to provide the hormone.

Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There's much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

As women have less testosterone over time, what starts to happen? What changes?

Well, we're not exactly sure, to be honest. It is one of these situations in which we know what happens when you replenish their testosterone. If you restore women to the levels of testosterone that they had in their 30s when they are actually, let's say, in their 50s, research suggests that it restores some of their libido and other things, such as mood or energy.

And in your article, you very hilariously described what happens when women start taking testosterone. It was inspiring! Tell us what you learned.

So I mean, there's really two very different experiences, right?

In the United States, when women take what is considered — I'm just going to use this colloquially — a “standard” dose of testosterone [to restore their testosterone levels to that of someone in their 30s]…those women report a minimal but meaningful restoration of their libido.

However, there's an entirely different cohort of women who are getting prescribed what are known as pellets [of testosterone that dissolve in the body over a period of months] or they're taking a lot more of the cream than their doctors would advise. And these women are getting into their systems several times the level of testosterone that they ever would've had in their bodies, even as very young women in their 20s. And those women are having unpredictable but fairly dramatic results.

Some women report really intense, almost uncomfortable sex drives. Some women report irritability or even rage. Some women report side effects like having chunks of hair fall out, hair growth on their faces or elsewhere on their bodies where they're not used to having hair grow.

I have seen this on my own Instagram: Contact this company and they'll run a test for you. But insurance doesn't cover it, right?

“I think there are a lot of people who stand to make a lot of money off of these high doses of testosterone because insurance doesn't get involved. They can charge women a lot of money.”

Oh, it's not even FDA-approved for women in any dose. So basically a bunch of medical societies got together and issued a consensus statement in 2019, and they said, Look, we know it's not approved by the FDA for women, but we're going to go out on a limb here and say that the safety data looks pretty good — at least in the short term for postmenopausal women, who are the women who've been studied the most for this. But it's not approved by the FDA even at that level. And so insurance definitely does not cover any of this for women.

I think there are a lot of people who stand to make a lot of money off of these high doses of testosterone because insurance doesn't get involved. They can charge women a lot of money. Sometimes they certainly don't get addicted to it, but they have a hard time walking away from it. And it can cost upwards of easily upwards of a thousand dollars at a time to take these pretty high-dose testosterone pellets, for example.

But it's not the only way women get high testosterone. I saw a job listing on one kind of aesthetic spa that was offering nurses a hundred dollars per shot of testosterone that they gave women in their spa. So the nurse is highly incentivized to provide it. Women are sort of being told, Take our word for it, you're going to love it. Like, go book a hotel for you and your husband this weekend. You're going to be so busy. That's a very hard sell.

And sometimes women love it and sometimes they discover midway through, let's say a pellet, which can take three months to dissolve, that they're miserable. But there's nothing you can do about it once it's been inserted underneath the skin of your buttock.

Why hasn't the FDA approved this as a treatment for women? 

Well, the last time that a drug company got it together and actually did some trials of a testosterone patch was Procter & Gamble. That did show that women were having incrementally more satisfying sexual experiences. Their libidos were restored. But that was right after another study came out, in 2002, that caused a big menopausal hormone therapy scare.

As I understand it, the people in the panel were concerned about cancer risks, breast cancer specifically, and there were even a couple of excess cases in a fairly small sample size. And they just didn't have enough long-term data, is what they said, to endorse it and give it FDA approval.

Now, a lot of feminist followers of medical history have said, Well, that it was not required for testosterone to be approved for men. There was no long-term data for men required. All that the drug companies had to prove back then was that it restored men to the level of testosterone that would make them virile and youthful and strong again, to which other people would then say, right, but they don't get breast cancer and women do, so that's the concern with women.

Perhaps not surprisingly, some of the conversation around this has turned political. You wrote about the parallels between women, often conservative women who are taking testosterone and gender-affirming care for transgender people. Tell me a little bit about what you explored here.

I just thought it was interesting. One of the most influential testosterone influencers is this lovely person named Marcella Hill, who was a member of the Church of Latter Day Saints, and she was still in the church when she started taking really, really high doses of testosterone. According to her, there are these aesthetic and wellness spas offering pellets and high doses of testosterone all over Utah, which is largely a Mormon community.

And I pointed out to her, You were taking so much testosterone that you were approaching the levels that people who are transitioning take. She said, I never really sat and thought about what I even think about that. She'd never really made the connection.

It is just interesting because many, many women across a political spectrum are also on, frankly, you could say, a transitioning spectrum or gender-affirming care spectrum. I think that they feel in a way that testosterone is helping them do gender-affirming care in making them feel more sexual and therefore more wifely, maybe. And maybe a lot of them talk about how it tones their arms and they feel like they look great, but it actually is a hormone that has typically been associated with masculinity. So it just, to me, kicks up all kinds of interesting questions.

Marriott and Sonder have broken up, and guests are bearing the brunt of the fallout.

Hotel operator Marriott International signed a licensing agreement with short-term rental company Sonder in August 2024. On Sunday, Marriott announced that the agreement had been terminated due to ""Sonder's default."" The change canceled guests' current reservations and stopped future bookings.

Marriott guests who had booked accommodations at Sonder properties say they were blindsided by the announcement.

Tim Schaefer, a blogger from New York, told Business Insider he had booked two separate Sonder apartments in New York City for a total of 10 days. But he received cancellation emails from Sonder and Marriott about an hour before his check-in on Sunday.

He said he spoke with Marriott's help desk for an hour, asking for help booking another hotel for himself and his spouse at the same price, but was kept on hold.

""We have a high loyalty status — Platinum Elite — with them. We are not happy,"" Schaefer said.

David Klingbeil, an NYU course instructor who studies luxury and marketing, said that he was halfway through his two-week stay at Sonder Flatiron in New York when he received an email on Sunday afternoon telling him he had to vacate the hotel by 8 a.m. on Monday.

""I didn't believe it when I saw the email, I had to check that this wasn't a phishing attempt or something. Then I saw the articles and posts on X,"" Klingbeil told Business Insider.

Klingbeil said he had to book another hotel at a much higher price.

He said he was a Marriott Bonvoy Gold Elite member and had spent $15,000 with the hotel group this year.

""If I don't see a strong reaction from them, I believe I will never choose Marriott again,"" he said.

The company said online that customers who had booked a Sonder property through Marriott's channels would get a full refund. It added that customers with future reservations would receive an email about the ""potential to rebook at another Marriott Bonvoy property.""

Sonder's stock is down about 87% in the past year, to a $6.8 million market cap. Founded in 2014, the company went public in 2021 through a special-purpose acquisition company. The company had 9,400 live units in its portfolio as of March, according to its earnings report for the first quarter of 2025.

Representatives for Marriott and Sonder did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, to be frank, has been a rather lackluster way to own the market in recent years.

During the last half-decade, it's up 63% while the tech-concentrated cap-weighted index you hear about more often is up 93%. In the last 12 months, the equal-weighted index has risen just 2% while the cap-weighted index is up 12%.

The underperformance has a simple explanation. Tech and tech-adjacent stocks have dominated the market, and since they're the largest by market capitalization, they contribute more to the returns of the cap-weighted index. The equal-weighted index, meanwhile, weights all of its constituents the same.

But with the tech sector and mega-cap stocks selling off this past week, it could finally be the equal-weighted index's time to shine.

Investors this week balked at lofty tech stock valuations and spending on AI — the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is down 5.6% since November 3. The underperformance in tech has dragged down the S&P 500 cap-weighted index by 2.7% in that time.

Meanwhile, the cap-weighted index has fallen just 0.4%.

If investors' retreat from the tech sector continues, the equal-weighted index could be an effective way to hedge downside risk in the cap-weighted strategy, as its performance hinges on the direction of a select few stocks.

""At any point in time you could have a very big drawdown in these stocks, and that would not be unusual because these are volatile stocks,"" Hank Smith, the director & head of investment strategy at The Haverford Trust Company, said about AI-focused mega-cap stocks.

""I don't think a lot of investors understand the risk they're taking buying the S&P 500 index when you consider 10 names in a 500 stock index represent 40% plus of the index,"" he continued. ""Three names represent 25 give or take% of the S&P 500: Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. That is extraordinary concentration.""

In addition to protection from over-concentration, there are reasons to believe the equal-weighted index could outperform the cap-weighted index going forward.

For one, while the equal-weighted index's recent performance has been relatively poor, it has actually outpaced the cap-weighted index by 1.05% on an average annual basis from 1989-2023, according to Invesco.

Smith also said that the equal-weighted index's low valuations also make it an attractive buy. Its 12-month forward PE ratio is around 22, while the S&P 500 cap-weighted index's is around 30. Invesco pointed out earlier this year that relative valuations between the two indexes are about as far apart as they have been in the last 20 years.

Finally, Smith argues that broadening economic growth — which has been largely supported by AI capital expenditures — would also benefit the equal-weighted index.

""If we're correct on our economic outlook, stronger growth would support that broadening out,"" Smith said. ""And that would suggest that maybe over the next 6 to 9 months, you might see better relative performance from the equal-weighted S&P 500.""

Michael Burry has a bone to pick with Alex Karp.

The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame hit back at the Palantir CEO in an X post on Sunday night, after Karp blasted his latest bets as ""batshit crazy"" in a televised interview last week.

""Doesn't surprise me one bit that Alex Karp and his 'ontology' @PalantirTech cannot crack a simple 13F,"" Burry wrote.

""A fundamental principle of any rigorous ontological/epistemological model — whether philosophical or in data science — is recognizing when your information set is insufficient for valid conclusions,"" he added.

Burry's Scion Asset Management revealed last Monday, in a quarterly portfolio disclosure known as a 13F, that at the end of September, it owned bearish put options on 5 million Palantir shares with a notional value of $912 million.

The filing also showed it held puts on 1 million Nvidia shares worth a notional $187 million. But it didn't indicate whether Burry held those short positions through October or early November.

The revelation on the same day as Palantir's third-quarter earnings may have contributed to its stock falling 15% over the next three days, from a record $207 to $175, before ending the week at $178.

On Tuesday morning last week, Karp took aim at Burry on CNBC. ""As far as I can tell, the two companies he's shorting are the ones making all the money, which is super weird — like the idea that chips and ontology is what you want to short is batshit crazy,"" he said.

Ontology, the study of the nature of existence, is also the name of a core feature of Foundry, Palantir's primary enterprise platform for commercial customers.

Karp said it was ""super triggering"" when short sellers ""pick on"" Palantir, as it's doing ""noble work"" by enriching retail investors and supporting military personnel. But their efforts drive him and his team to work harder and ""make them poorer,"" he added.

The boss of the AI-powered data analysis and integration company suggested Burry may have lost money betting against Palantir, and had gone public with his short wager to push down its stock and recoup some of his losses.

Palantir's revenue rose 63% year-on-year to about $1.2 billion last quarter, helping to more than triple its net income to $477 million. The software company projected its full-year revenues would be up about 54% this year at around $4.4 billion.

Its stock has surged roughly 28-fold since the start of 2023, from around $6 per share to $178. That has catapulted the company to a $422 billion market capitalization as of Friday's close, making it more valuable than Costco, Bank of America, or AMD.

Scion and Palantir didn't immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

13F filings only capture a snapshot of a firm's US stock holdings on a single day each quarter, and are published with a six-week lag. They also exclude shares sold short, investments in private and foreign-listed companies, and non-stock assets such as bonds and real estate, meaning they may not paint a full picture of an investor's strategy.

Burry shot to fame after his massive, contrarian bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in author Michael Lewis' book ""The Big Short."" He was portrayed by actor Christian Bale in the movie adaptation.

His recent X posts suggest he's closed out his bet against Palantir since the end of September.

""Fake news! I am not 5'6,"" he posted the day after Scion's filing and Palantir's earnings, along with a photo of himself standing next to Bale, who's around six feet tall. Burry's cryptic message seemed to mean that he's not short — physically or in financial terms.

Fake news! I am not 5'6” (not that there is anything wrong with that). And journalists reporting on 13Fs, none more fake. pic.twitter.com/WIVKAtolxB

Burry has also updated a tease in his X bio, suggesting he'll shed light on his thinking on November 25 instead of in December.

The Scion boss returned to X after a two-year hiatus on October 30 with a coded warning that he believes the AI boom is a bubble, but the only ""winning move"" is to bet neither on nor against it.

He followed that up by posting ""Star Wars"" memes, charts, and book excerpts supporting the idea that the AI boom is an echo of the dot-com bubble, growth could stall, and surging capital investments could lead to an infrastructure glut.

OpenAI is pushing into healthcare — and the AI giant could be poised to reinvent Big Tech's consumer health bets.

Tech behemoths like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft have spent decades working to give consumers control of their health data. Many of their efforts have crashed and burned. But investors and healthcare leaders think OpenAI has the right ingredients to try again.

Sources close to the company told Business Insider that OpenAI is exploring building its own consumer health tools. It's weighing several opportunities, such as creating a personal health assistant or a health data aggregator.

OpenAI's foray into healthcare marks one of its boldest moves, beyond AI infrastructure and into industry-specific software. After transforming how companies build new tech with generative AI, OpenAI is setting its sights on launching its own applications in sectors dominated by legacy enterprise giants — from sales and marketing to law, and perhaps now, medicine.

OpenAI declined to comment for this story.

The company's recent hires reflect big healthcare ambitions. OpenAI tapped Nate Gross, the cofounder of public healthtech company Doximity, to lead its healthcare strategy in June. Two months later, it brought on Instagram's Ashley Alexander as its vice president of health products. At the HLTH conference in October, Gross pointed to OpenAI's vast reach; ChatGPT gets around 800 million active users every week, many of whom come with medical questions.

That scale has healthcare founders and investors watching OpenAI closely for its next move.

""Consumers have historically gone to Google to ask their health questions, and it's clear that they're now starting to shift those questions over to LLMs to capture that knowledge base through a more conversational discovery process,"" said Greg Yap, a partner at Menlo Ventures, which isn't an investor in OpenAI. ""I think OpenAI has a tremendous opportunity in that sector.""

Several investors told Business Insider they think OpenAI could tackle a problem that's tripped up Big Tech for years: the personal health record.

Health data privacy rules and financial incentives keep your health data scattered and siloed across all the doctors you've ever been to. The idea of a personal health record is to pull that information into one place, owned and managed by the patient.

It's a difficult problem to solve, but tech hasn't stopped trying. Should OpenAI choose to build a personal health assistant with consolidated health records, it'll be competing with Alphabet's Verily, which released its own AI-powered personal health record app in October.

OpenAI has mostly stayed quiet about its plans in healthcare. But the company's explosive growth and dominance in foundational AI have some investors worried that the AI giant has a better shot than many previous Big Tech entrants at building transformative healthtech and trampling startup competition.

""Amazon's a great company, but they've been one foot in healthcare, one foot out. Microsoft, kind of the same way. We haven't seen that same type of behavior with OpenAI and Anthropic. It's been pedal all the way down, aggressive, let's look at everything, let's talk with everyone. So I'd say I view them much more as a serious potential threat,"" said Blake Wu, a partner at NEA, which isn't an investor in OpenAI or Anthropic.

Jennifer Yoo, a healthcare regulatory partner at Fenwick & West, says she's seeing many companies using AI to build personal health assistants, often with the hopes of connecting a patient's medical records for tailored support.

But those companies are following a trail blazed by and littered with Big Tech's past health projects.

Microsoft, Google, and Apple have all tried to build personal health records for consumers, with mixed results. Microsoft's HealthVault launched in 2007 but shuttered in 2019 after failing to gain user traction, largely because it required patients to manually upload their health records.

Google's efforts took a similar path — its 2008 health record project died in 2012, only for the company to begin work on an electronic health records search tool a few years later that came under regulatory fire over how Google accessed and handled patient data. Apple still offers a native Health Records feature on iPhones, but that service requires hospitals to sign data-sharing agreements for patients to connect their records to the app.

""Apple's health record, and any of them that rely on us to log into every portal, download and manually share data, that's friction that keeps people from getting value from their own health data,"" Yap said. ""AI suffers from that friction just like anyone else. You can't personalize information if you don't have the data.""

The good news: some of those challenges are beginning to chip away. A recent federal ban on ""information blocking"" prevents hospitals from keeping health data locked up or making it hard for people to access their own records. In practice, however, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT has found that many hospitals still limit what patients can download.

Companies like Health Gorilla and Particle Health have stepped up as intermediaries between health systems and patients, pulling records from multiple sources, cleaning and standardizing the data, and sharing it with third-party apps at the patient's request. Yoo suggested that companies seeking to develop AI health assistants with built-in health records would be wise to partner with an intermediary to avoid the headaches of manually retrieving records.

Consumers, too, are increasingly eager than ever to control their health, including their health data. When OpenAI released GPT-5 in August, CEO Sam Altman said health was one of ChatGPT's top use cases, and bragged that the new model ""can help you understand your healthcare and make decisions on your journey.""

""They're already using ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude for their health questions. I think users are seeing the value of, ""hey, if that also had all my long-term medical records, how much better would the information be for me?"" Yoo said.

OpenAI isn't yet encouraging users to upload their medical data, and it's treading carefully as more users turn to ChatGPT for health information.

Viral posts circulating in early November, including a now-deleted post from prediction markets startup Kalshi, suggested that ChatGPT would no longer provide health advice. It was a misinterpretation of OpenAI's rules. The company's recently updated usage policies tell consumers not to use its products to do a doctor's job, including for diagnosis or treatment, but the policies don't preclude ChatGPT from offering general medical information. OpenAI's health AI research lead said the company hasn't changed its models.

If OpenAI steers clear of handling medical records directly, it could take a different page from Apple's health data playbook. Apple's Healthkit, launched in 2014, collects health and fitness data from third-party apps and wearables like Apple Watches and centralizes that information into its Health app.

OpenAI could partner with other health companies to collect that data. As Gross said during his HLTH panel, ""I think the way that we're going to achieve the greatest amount of good is by a robust ecosystem of partners."" Investors pointed to consumer lab testing companies like Superpower and Function Health as potentially attractive partners for OpenAI's health push.

While some investors are eager for OpenAI to go deep in consumer health, the AI giant is digging into the healthcare sector from multiple angles. Gross's early mandate includes co-creating new healthcare technologies with clinicians and researchers, while Alexander is building healthcare products for clinicians as well as individual consumers. OpenAI is already working with pharma giants like Eli Lilly and Sanofi on drug discovery and development, as well as with healthtech companies like Penda Health on AI-powered clinical decision support. It's also landing ChatGPT enterprise deals and other partnerships with health systems.

Meanwhile, the latest wave of healthcare VC investment has gone straight to AI tools that automate administrative work, especially for clinicians and health systems. OpenAI's provider-facing projects could challenge those bets, too, another sign of AI giants steadily encroaching on startups' territory.

Good morning and welcome to First Trade. The longest-ever US government shutdown appears to be close to a resolution. The market is loving it after a rough week, and stock futures are up.

Rundown

But first, let's take a trip down to Old San Juan.

Market musings

Picture a place where the beaches are plentiful, the sun is usually shining, and the nightlife is bustling. Oh, and did I mention major tax breaks on capital gains earned in the market?

Believe it or not, such a haven exists, and it's completely accessible for all American citizens.

I'm talking about Puerto Rico, which has emerged as a destination for Gen Z and millennial day traders looking to minimize their tax bills while stacking market winnings.

BI's Jennifer Sor dug into the growing trend, which has only gained steam in recent years. An attorney that Jennifer spoke to — who says he counsels hundreds of investors a year about possible moves to Puerto Rico — estimates that the trader influx doubled in 2024.

One investor who moved to Puerto Rico in 2018 — and now uses his sprawling network of lawyers and realtors to ""onboard"" other traders — says activity in 2025 has already surpassed last year's, and has tripled since he first came.

Jennifer also spoke to a 26-year-old crypto trader who moved to Puerto Rico during the pandemic once he recognized the tax-break potential. He says the town where he lives, Palmas Del Mar, is ""mellow"" and that the lifestyle is like ""being on a permanent vacation.""

But it's not necessarily all sunshine and relaxation for new arrivals. Some of the day traders Jennifer interviewed lamented frequent power outages, a lack of clean eating options (since most of the island's food is imported), and no one-day delivery.

Surely the bustling nightlife scene makes up for it? Not quite, Jennifer found. One source characterized the local scene as cliquish, while another said locals can be standoffish, bordering on hostile.

For some, however, the social difficulties are a welcome silver lining. Fewer distractions make it easier to focus on the task at hand: racking up the market gains that they moved to Puerto Rico to protect in the first place.

It's ultimately what you make of it. You can bunker down and focus on trading, or — as one of Jennifer's interview subjects recommends — you can lean into speaking Spanish, network, and explore the island beyond the San Juan city center.

As for me? You definitely won't find me in Puerto Rico slinging stocks and crypto any time soon. I like my same-day Amazon Prime delivery too much. But it's a compelling option that clearly works for many.

Read the full story here.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is fresh off its worst weekly sell-off since the beginning of April, when President Trump's infamous Liberation Day tariffs rocked markets. (See the shaded portion of the chart above.)

One of the main smoking guns was Palantir, which tanked despite universally strong earnings. It served as a microcosm of the main issue that faced the broader market: concern over overextended valuations.

The inflection point for the week can be traced back to comments from Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, who warned of a healthy pullback in the next year or so that will allow traders to reassess.

What are your most burning questions about a possible AI bubble? Write in and let us know at firsttrade@businessinsider.com.

Persistently high US inflation hangs over the above chart like a cloud. While not plotted, it's the driving force behind Bank of America's overall point: President Trump's approval rating (light blue line) has taken a hit in part because consumer prices have stayed so high.

This stands in contrast to the S&P 500 (dark blue line), which — despite sharp selling last week — is still within shouting distance of record highs. The divergence drives home the degree to which Americans are focusing on the inflation staring them in the face, rather than the stock gains passively juicing their 401(k)s.

Take BI's survey about inflation.

In this section, a weekly feature on Mondays, we manage a hypothetical portfolio.

Current stocks: Amazon, JPMorgan, Nvidia, Palantir, Tesla

It finally happened.

I knew that, after we overloaded the First Trade index with high-flying mega-cap tech stocks, we would get nailed eventually. Such a strategy rides high when the market is going up, but gets hit doubly hard on the way down — and that's exactly what transpired.

The presence of Tesla and Nvidia was rough enough. But the proactive addition of Palantir ahead of this week was the real back-breaking move.

The reason was simple: We were banking on a strong earnings report, and a commensurate gain in the stock. After all, Palantir shares were up 165% year-to-date through the prior week. What could go wrong?

Little did we know that the company would crush earnings — and that it wouldn't matter at all. Investors instead elected to rebel against what they see as overextended valuations, and the entire market felt the effects.

When all was said and done, the First Trade index ended the week 4.6% lower, roughly triple the S&P 500's 1.6% loss. After a brief period in the lead, First Trade is now underperforming the benchmark since the start of this project.

Can we turn things around? Should we ditch Palantir, or stick to our guns? Let me know at firsttrade@businessinsider.com (1) which stock you'd remove, and (2) which one you'd replace it with.

Blood, sweat, tears, and great team members.

That's what it takes to launch a brand new hotel, Marriott International's chief commercial officer, John Toomey, told Business Insider.

""The most difficult job for a hotelier is opening a hotel from zero, where you don't have one guest in your hotel,"" Toomey said.

Toomey joined Marriott International in 1996 and has been with the hospitality giant for nearly three decades. In his current role, he oversees over 650 hotels run by Marriott in the Asia Pacific, excluding China.

""When you're starting something from zero, you really feel it,"" Toomey said. ""It takes great leadership. It takes great team members. It takes everybody coming together to make that hotel a success.""

""It's not just the day the hotel opens. It's the six to nine to 12 months leading up to it, from getting the hotel staffing ready to go and selling your heart out,"" he continued.

Toomey said the job gets easier once a hotel chain has secured a foothold in a foreign market and has started to build up branding.

He added that customer loyalty programs such as Marriott Bonvoy have made it easier for hoteliers to expand their presence. As of 2024, Marriott Bonvoy had nearly 228 million members worldwide.

""Now that we have such a deep loyalty program, we are in a better position to open hotels than when I was opening hotels 25 years ago,"" Toomey said.

""I opened the first four hotels we had in India. Opening those was probably a lot more challenging than the nearly 160 hotels we have there now,"" he added.

In June, Kwon Ping Ho, the founder and executive chair of the luxury hotel chain Banyan Group, told Business Insider that ""the worst business to be in is hospitality.""

""It is so management-intensive. It is so time and people-intensive, and it is so vulnerable to event risk,"" Ho said.

Ho said running a hotel chain effectively is all about building a working culture that prioritizes the customer in everything it does.

""You go to a hotel. You forget about the 10 good experiences you have. One screw-up, you will never forget. People are not very forgiving about screw-ups,"" Ho said.

It's not just hospitality. Business leaders across sectors have also talked about how difficult it is to launch a new venture.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, told Khan Academy founder Sal Khan in a 2013 interview that creating companies is not as fun as people think.

""There are periods of fun, and there are periods where it's just awful. Particularly if you are the CEO of the company, you actually have a distillation of all the worst problems in the company,"" Musk said.

""I think you have to feel quite compelled to do it, and have a fairly high pain threshold,"" he added.

Jensen Huang, the founder and CEO of the chip giant Nvidia, said in an October 2023 interview on the ""Acquired"" podcast that ""nobody in their right mind"" would start a company from scratch.

""Building a company and building Nvidia turned out to have been a million times harder than I expected it to be,"" Huang said.

""If we realized the pain and suffering and just how vulnerable you're going to feel, and the challenges that you're going to endure, the embarrassment and the shame, and the list of all the things that go wrong, I don't think anybody would start a company,"" he added.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman privately texted Shivon Zilis, one of Elon Musk's closest confidantes, to ask whether he should post a complimentary message about Musk on X — days before he did just that, according to a newly filed court document.

The message, disclosed in Musk's case against Altman and OpenAI and filed in federal court last Friday, shows Altman reaching out to Zilis on February 9, 2023, seeking advice on whether to publicly praise Musk.

""BTW, good idea for me to tweet something nice about Elon? Have been meaning to do this after he DMd about not being in the photo from the first day of OpenAI. Just about how much I and others look up to him, how critical his early contributions to OpenAI are, etc,"" Altman wrote, according to the document. 

Less than a week later, Altman seemed to enact this, posting on X: ""society underestimates how much it owes elon for raising the collective ambition level at a time when optimism for the future was receding.""

The message sheds light on how Altman tried to repair his relationship with Musk, who had grown increasingly critical of OpenAI — the company the two helped launch in 2015 with a shared mission to develop artificial intelligence for the benefit of humanity.

It suggests that Altman sought to smooth things over by publicly acknowledging Musk's early role in the company. 

Zilis, who reportedly has four children with Musk, has long served as one of Musk's most trusted lieutenants, working as director of operations and special projects at Neuralink. Her communications were produced as evidence by her legal team and entered as Exhibit 35 in the filing.

This message was among dozens of emails, depositions, and text threads submitted by Musk's lawyers to support his argument that OpenAI abandoned its founding mission of developing artificial general intelligence for the benefit of humanity.

Court documents show that years before Altman's conciliatory post on X, he and Musk had already clashed over OpenAI's direction.

Emails from February 2016, shared in the court documents, suggest that Musk was deeply involved in the company's operations — messaging cofounders about meeting regularly and warning that competitors were ""playing the Super Bowl and we are playing the Puppy Bowl.""

But by September 2017, frustration had boiled over.

In one exchange filed as Exhibit 41, Musk said: ""Guys, I've had enough. This is the final straw. Either go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit. I will no longer fund OpenAI until you have made a firm commitment to stay or I'm just being a fool who is essentially providing free funding for you to create a startup.""

Altman responded the next day: ""I remain enthusiastic about the non-profit structure!""

That back-and-forth — Altman placating, Musk erupting — would become a pattern.

Six years later, his text to Zilis reads almost like a reprise of those earlier emails: another private effort to soothe a public feud.

Altman's February 13 post on X was widely interpreted as an olive branch toward Musk, who by then had begun publicly criticizing OpenAI's commercial turn.

However, the newly revealed message suggests that the post was less spontaneous than it appeared — a calculated gesture that was shaped behind the scenes.

The Musk v. Altman filings trace years of strained communication between the two founders. Musk resigned from OpenAI's board in 2018, five years later launching xAI, his own AI company, and repeatedly accusing OpenAI of betraying its nonprofit roots.

Neither Altman, Zilis, nor lawyers for Musk immediately responded to requests for comment on the message. 

The case, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, is ongoing.

The latest filings — including those from the Zilis message — offer a rare glimpse into how two of Silicon Valley's most influential figures navigated, and at times massaged, their uneasy relationship in the high-stakes world of artificial intelligence.

Using money well is a skill. Having this skill means knowing how to invest wisely and maintain a strong savings habit, but it also means you understand how to spend money with intention.

One of the most powerful ways to spend well is to buy back time.

That's what my family did when we decided to hire a house manager. Our top priority is having more time and energy to be fully present with our 4-year-old daughter. We also wanted to devote more time to our financial planning business, which my wife and I run together, rather than managing our household.

Here's how we accomplished both.

Initially, growing the business I founded so that it didn't rely solely on me to operate was the best way to reclaim my time. If I wasn't working in the past, neither was the business.

We now have a larger team, and I've established strict working hours limits. I also have a greater degree of freedom and flexibility.

I eat breakfast and dinner with my family every day because I'm actually home to do that, and I take random Monday afternoons off to take my daughter to events or the playground.

When we looked at how we could buy back my wife's time, we first considered hiring someone in the business to take on some of her workplace responsibilities. We realized two things:

We grew up in working-class families; my mother was a nurse for 40 years, and my wife's father was a firefighter for 30. The idea of having ""household help"" was extremely foreign to us. Honestly, it felt somewhat embarrassing, too. Everyone else could ""do it all;"" why couldn't we?

However, we know that many people who ""do it all"" aren't very happy. Reports of burnout and depression are at extreme highs. Mothers, in particular, are often extremely overwhelmed and overloaded, still shouldering the majority of the housework, even in dual-income families.

Our own numbers — both in terms of where our hours went versus where we wanted them to go, and how much it would cost to change that — didn't lie. They indicated we needed help around the house.

We started by creating a list of everything we felt we could ""shed"" from our household responsibilities. We used that list to create the following job description:

We're seeking a part-time house manager/family assistant with light nanny responsibilities for our family of three. Schedule is flexible and can be built around your preferences. Our ideal candidate is willing to assist with light housework, including laundry and meal preparation, and would be open to helping with our two cats as well. We expect the role to start at 10 hours a week, but there is room to expand it. $25-$30 per hour, dependent on experience.

We are looking for someone who:

Responsibilities and tasks:

Once we had our description, we posted it in local parents' and moms' groups on Facebook. We thought it would be better to find someone familiar in our community than a stranger from somewhere like Care.com. We received eight applications and hired our current house manager for $28 per hour in August.

She's a stay-at-home mom whose own kids reached elementary school, so she had more time in her day and genuinely loved the work we needed help doing. We pay her about $1,200 a month.

There haven't really been any downsides. The only thing is I try to stay out of the kitchen when she's doing meal prep, which can be a slight inconvenience. But we've gotten along very well.

My wife has been able to devote more hours to the work she wants to do in the business and spend more focused, quality time with our daughter without distraction.

Getting this help also gives us leverage. The additional time devoted to our business provides the opportunity to increase our income more than we could save by trying to avoid hiring additional support.

Wealth is about a lot more than what's in your bank account — it's how much autonomy you have; how much you can choose what you do or don't do with the time you have.

Could we save more money by doing everything ourselves? Perhaps we'd have a little more cash on hand, but we'd be extremely depleted in terms of time and energy. Could I have a higher net worth if I devoted all my time to work? Of course, but my life would also be a lot smaller and emptier.

Time, peace, energy, and health are all measures of wealth, alongside money. Arguably, those things are all more valuable than the dollars on my balance sheet.

House Speaker Mike Johnson on Monday called for House members to begin traveling to Washington, D.C., so that they can vote as soon as possible on a Senate deal that would end the longest U.S. government shutdown in history.

Johnson, R-La., spoke to reporters a day after the Senate narrowly approved the first stage of the deal to reopen the government, which shut down on Oct. 1.

To end the shutdown, the House needs to pass any deal that survives Senate votes. President Donald Trump would then have to sign it into law.

Johnson indicated to reporters that he expected votes in the House to occur this week, but he did not state a specific day. He later told the Republican House conference during a call that he would like the vote to occur on Wednesday, although that is contingent on the Senate voting for it completely by then, according to a person familiar with the situation.

The speaker said he would issue an official 36-hour notice before the House votes.

Johnson said, ""There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.""

Johnson has kept the House out of session since it passed a continuing resolution in September to fund the government through mid-November.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R.-S.D., speaking on the Senate flood Monday morning, urged his colleagues to vote as soon as Monday to send the deal to the House.

""Let's not pointlessly drag this bill out,"" Thune said. ""Let's get it done. Get it over to the House so that we can get this government open.""

""I am grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro-bill or anti-bill, not to stand in the way of being able to deliver the coming relief quickly,"" Thune said.

""The American people have suffered for long enough.""

Any one senator can delay voting on the bill for days with procedural hurdles. But a vote can be held quickly if the entire Senate agrees that it should happen.

The Senate deal, forged over the weekend, drew support from seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with Democrats, which, combined with 52 Republican senators' votes, was enough to reach a 60-vote threshold to pass.

The deal does not include what had been the key demand for Democrats: an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits, which are due to expire at the end of December.

But the agreement, for the first time since the shutdown began, includes a guarantee by Republicans of a vote in December on a bill chosen by Democrats to extend those subsidies, which more than 20 million Americans use to reduce the cost of health insurance plans purchased on ACA marketplaces.

The Senate deal would fund the government through the end of January; reverse all shutdown-related layoffs of federal employees; and guarantee that all federal workers will be paid their normal salaries during the shutdown.

The deal also includes provisions for a bipartisan budget process and prevents the White House from using continuing resolutions to fund the government. CRs have been repeatedly used to avoid government shutdown, but are controversial because they frequently avoid lawmakers having to make decisions about long-term funding of the government that a normal budget would resolve.

The deal would also fund, through September, the SNAP program, which helps feed 42 million Americans through food stamps.

Under a federal law passed in 2019, government employees who are furloughed during a shutdown must be paid for the time they were out of work at their standard rate of pay ""at the earliest date possible, regardless of scheduled pay dates.""

In this article

Flight cancellations were again piling up on Monday as air traffic controller shortages, worsened by the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown, snarled air travel coast to coast and President Donald Trump threatened to dock air traffic controllers' pay if they are absent from work.

On Monday, 1,432 of the 25,733 scheduled flights across the country were canceled, around 5.5% ""and growing,"" according to aviation data firm Cirium.

Last week, the Trump administration ordered airlines to cut flights at 40 major U.S. airports starting with 4% reductions last Friday and ramping up to 10% by this coming Friday, Nov. 14.

""All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who didn't take any time off during the shutdown. He said those who don't immediately return to work would be ""docked.""

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, their union, didn't immediately respond to Trump's comments on Monday.

Disruptions over the weekend totaled 18,576 flights delayed and 4,519 canceled, according to FlightAware. Cancellations spilled over from regional, short-haul jets — which the largest U.S. airlines rely on for around half of domestic flights — to mainline flying.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines were each offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up flights, according to company messages seen by CNBC. Such extra pay is common during storms or other disruptions. The airlines didn't immediately comment.

A sign of how severe air travel disruptions have become during the government shutdown: Sunday's 2,631 U.S. flight cancellations, 10% of the day's schedule, marked the fourth-worst day since January 2024, Cirium said.

In comparison, on Friday morning, as Trump administration-mandated flight cuts took effect, cancellations ranked 72nd since the start of last year.

The disruptions that upended the travel plans for hundreds of thousands of travelers forced them to look for alternative transportation. Car rental company Hertz last week reported an increase in one-way demand. There's also been increased demand for private jet flights in recent days, according to the CEO of charter and fractional ownership company Flexjet.

Though the Trump administration order didn't initially require private aviation to cut in the same way as commercial airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday began limiting those flights at a dozen U.S. airports. However, many private jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the National Business Aviation Association.

Air traffic controllers missed their second paycheck of the shutdown on Monday, though they are still required to work. Some of them have taken second jobs to make ends meet, government and union officials have said.

""Now, they must focus on child care instead of traffic flows. Food for their families instead of runway separation,"" Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a news conference on Monday. ""The added stress leads to fatigue, the fatigue has led to the erosion of safety and the increased risk every day that this shutdown drags on.""

The Senate made progress overnight on a deal that could end the shutdown, but it has not yet approved a funding bill.

Daniels said it isn't yet clear how long it would take for controllers to receive back pay for their work. In the shutdown that ended in 2019, it took about 2½ months before the workers were made whole, he said.

The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a call to overturn its landmark decision that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

The justices, without comment, turned away an appeal from Kim Davis, the former Kentucky court clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the high court's 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges.

Davis had been trying to get the court to overturn a lower-court order for her to pay $360,000 in damages and attorney's fees to a couple denied a marriage license.

Her lawyers repeatedly invoked the words of Justice Clarence Thomas, who alone among the nine justices has called for erasing the same-sex marriage ruling.

Thomas was among four dissenting justices in 2015. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are the other dissenters who are on the court today.

Roberts has been silent on the subject since he wrote a dissenting opinion in the case. Alito has continued to criticize the decision, but he said recently he was not advocating that it be overturned.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was not on the court in 2015, has said that there are times when the court should correct mistakes and overturn decisions, as it did in the 2022 case that ended a constitutional right to abortion.

But Barrett has suggested recently that same-sex marriage might be in a different category than abortion because people have relied on the decision when they married and had children.

Human Rights Campaign president Kelley Robinson praised the justices' decision not to intervene. ""The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences,"" Robinson said in a statement.

Davis drew national attention to eastern Kentucky's Rowan County when she turned away same-sex couples, saying her faith prevented her from complying with the high court ruling. She defied court orders to issue the licenses until a federal judge jailed her for contempt of court in September 2015.

She was released after her staff issued the licenses on her behalf but removed her name from the form. The Kentucky legislature later enacted a law removing the names of all county clerks from state marriage licenses.

Davis lost a reelection bid in 2018.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

It's no secret that buying a home is expensive. The average sales price for U.S. homes has hovered around $400,000 since the end of 2021, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  

Most homebuyers looking to cover that cost turn to mortgage lenders, who pore over financial details like salaries, bank balances and retirement accounts to determine how risky it is to lend the money.

That review process has typically excluded crypto assets. But for the roughly 15% of Americans who invest in digital assets, that could soon change.

In June, a directive issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency ordered mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop proposals to consider crypto as an asset in single-family home risk assessments.The director of the agency, Bill Pulte, wrote in a post on X that he ordered the two enterprises to prepare their businesses to count cryptocurrency as an asset for a mortgage. Pulte said the directive came ""after significant studying, and in keeping with President Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world.""

Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, said the process would look similar to how lenders account for stocks and other investments.

""A lender would look at the assets that a potential borrower has, and before, they might have only considered stocks and bonds and those traditional kinds of investments, but now they would consider those less traditional cryptocurrency investments. And it might be a bit difficult for them to assess the riskiness, but I think they're used to assessing the riskiness,"" Fairweather said. ""There are stocks that are even more volatile and risky than some long-standing cryptocurrencies so I think for the lender, it would be pretty easy for them to adapt their framework to incorporate crypto into that.""  

The move from the FHFA found immediate backing from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who introduced a bill to codify the directive into law.  

The directive from the federal lending agency also faced criticism from those who argue backing loans with crypto could add new stress to the home lending market.   In July, a group of Democratic senators sent a letter to Pulte, taking issue with his ""risky proposals"" to allow unconverted crypto assets in mortgage loan underwriting. The senators requested information regarding his directive to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and they expressed concern that crypto is more volatile than traditional assets. They stressed that Congress and the public should better understand the agency's decision-making process to assess the potential risks and benefits to the order and the implications for the housing market. 

Watch the video above to learn why the Trump Administration wants to allow crypto-backed mortgages, and what it could mean for the housing market.

In this article

Visa and Mastercard announced a revised settlement with merchants who accused the card networks of charging too much to accept their credit cards, after a judge rejected an earlier $30 billion accord as inadequate.

Monday's settlement would end 20 years of litigation in which businesses accused Visa, Mastercard and banks of conspiring to violate U.S. antitrust laws, including through the card networks' collection of ""swipe fees.""

But the accord is drawing opposition from merchant groups that say it doesn't address concerns that U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn, New York, whose approval is required, raised in rejecting the earlier settlement in June 2024.

These groups including the National Retail Federation, the largest U.S. retail trade group, and the Merchants Payments Coalition say businesses would still pay too much, including to accept the popular rewards cards that dominate the card market.

""You can't just suddenly tell more than 80% of your card customers you're not going to take their cards,"" Stephanie Martz, the NRF's general counsel, said in an interview. ""You would lose a lot of business.""

Also known as interchange fees, swipe fees totaled $111.2 billion in the United States in 2024, up from $100.8 billion in 2023 and quadruple the level in 2009, the NRF said.

The settlement calls for Visa and Mastercard to lower swipe fees, which are now typically 2% to 2.5%, by 0.1 percentage point for five years.

Merchants would be able to choose whether to accept U.S. cards in specific categories including commercial cards, premium consumer cards including many rewards cards, and standard consumer cards.

Standard consumer rates would be capped for eight years at 1.25%, a more than 25% reduction. Merchants would also get more options to impose surcharges when people pay by card.

The estimated settlement value is unclear, but would likely be larger than $30 billion. Lawyers for merchants supporting the accord did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Visa, based in San Francisco, said the settlement provides merchants of all sizes with meaningful relief, more flexibility and options to control how customers pay them.

Mastercard, based in Purchase, New York, said smaller merchants in particular would benefit from more flexibility, lower costs and simpler rules.

Neither company admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Their shares rose less than 1% in late morning trading.

The $30 billion settlement would have lowered swipe fees by about 0.07 percentage points over five years, and also given merchants more room to impose surcharges.

But in rejecting that accord, Brodie said fees would remain above where they would be absent the antitrust violations, and the $6 billion of annual savings for merchants was ""paltry"" relative to how much Visa and Mastercard could still charge.

She also faulted the accord for sticking merchants with the ""Honor All Cards"" rule requiring that they accept all Visa and Mastercard cards, or none.

Merchants have also long accused Visa and Mastercard of enforcing ""anti-steering"" rules that prevent businesses from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.

The Electronic Payments Coalition, whose members include the card networks and large issuers such as Bank of America, Capital One, Chase and Citibank supports the settlement.

Executive Chairman Richard Hunt said the accord would reduce swipe fees below those contemplated in a Senate bill sponsored by Democrat Richard Durbin of Illinois and Republican Roger Marshall of Kansas, which much of the banking industry opposes.

""You tell me the last time Walmart reduced any of its prices by more than 25%, and kept it for eight years,"" Hunt said in an interview.

Doug Kantor, general counsel of the National Association of Convenience Stores, countered that the settlement doesn't give banks an incentive to lower rates they charge, but lets Visa and Mastercard ""without any limitation"" raise their own.

""Merchants ought to be able to negotiate and get prices set with different banks, but this settlement prohibits that,"" Kantor, also a member of the Merchants Payments Coalition's executive committee, said in an interview.

 BBC News said on Monday the broadcaster had received a letter from U.S. President Donald Trump threatening legal action over the edit of a documentary broadcast a week before the U.S. presidential election.

The BBC has acknowledged the Trump speech edit gave a misleading impression and should have been handled more carefully.

The documentary broadcast last year had spliced together two parts of a Trump speech so he appeared to be encouraging the Capitol Hill riot of January 2021.

Samir Shah, the chairman of the publicly-funded broadcaster, said in an interview with BBC News that it was ""considering"" how to respond to Trump's communication.

When prompted about whether Trump would be suing the BBC, Shah said: ""I do not know that yet, but he's a litigious fellow, so we should be prepared for all outcomes.""

Global stocks rallied Monday as the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown appeared to be drawing to an end.

The U.S. senate has approved the first stage of a bipartisan deal which could bring an end to the shutdown. The deal would fund the government until Jan. 30th next year, and would potentially reverse some of the permanent layoffs of government employees that occurred during the 35-day impasse.

Strategists said a potential end to the shutdown would offer a boost to investors after a week in which AI and tech stock jitters sent global equities into retreat.

Speaking with CNBC's ""Europe Early Edition"" on Monday, Jason Paltrowitz, executive vice president at OTC Markets, said a resolution would be positive, not just in the U.S. but for global markets more broadly.

""I think all news is good news,"" said Paltrowitz. ""I think the market needs to see we're moving past this. I think investors want some surety both for the economy and for their own investment,"" he added.

U.S. stock futures were in positive territory ahead of Monday's opening bell, while European stocks rose on Monday, with the Stoxx 600 gaining 1.4%, and the U.K.'s FTSE 100, Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 all in positive territory.

Edmond de Rothschild Asset management said in a flash commentary that the lingering possibility of negative economic consequences had pushed both sides in Congress to resume talks with a view to compromise.

The airline sector has been a key flashpoint throughout the deadlock. A growing shortage of air traffic controllers as a result of missed paychecks has led to a reduction in the number of flights in recent days.

Fears that thousands flights would be during the Thanksgiving holiday, impacting travel and leisure stocks, now appear to have been allayed. Shares of U.S. airline stocks climbed in pre-market trade on Monday.

Consumer sentiment has also been under scrutiny during the deadlock, as investors have grappled with a data blackout amid a growing unease over the health of the U.S. economy. Investment strategists noted how the unlocking of data reports would ultimately provide greater clarity for markets.

Jonathan Pingle, chief U.S. economist at UBS Investment Bank, said the release of data would help reduce uncertainty for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). He said there would be a raft of data released from August, which is expected to be positive, but may subsequently give way to data that would look ""quite soft"" by comparison.

""The Fed's been stumbling around in this fog and I think markets would like some clarity one way or another,"" Pingle told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

Pingle said the shutdown is a ""huge inconvenience"" and a ""drag on growth."" ""There's a certain amount of cheerleading growing on,"" Pingle said of the news of a potential deal on Capitol Hill. ""Businesses are going to be happy having a functioning government and getting past reports.""

Nick Nelson, global equity strategist at Absolute Strategy Research, said the deal was ""good news"" for markets. Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe,"" he pointed to weaker consumer confidence data last week, noting how the longer the shutdown went on, with people not getting paid, that could ultimately dent consumption.

The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday will ""effectively prohibit business aviation"" at a dozen major U.S. airports, adding to flight restrictions for commercial airlines as air traffic controller shortages snarl travel in the government shutdown, a trade group said.

Last week, the Trump administration ordered U.S. commercial airlines to cut their schedules to ease strains on air traffic controllers who are working without their regular paychecks in the shutdown. Government officials at first didn't curb private flights the same way they did for commercial aviation, though the air traffic controller staffing shortages have slowed travel broadly.

The first commercial airline flight cuts of 4% went into affect on Friday and are set to rise to 10% of flights by this coming Friday.

More than 4,500 commercial flights were canceled over the weekend and over 17,000 were delayed as staffing shortages worsened around the country, according to FlightAware. Aviation industry members applauded the Senate's progress toward ending the shutdown late Sunday, though a solution for the longest-ever such impasse hasn't been finalized.

""Safety is the cornerstone of business aviation, and NBAA is fully committed to ensuring the safety of the NAS,"" said National Business Aviation Association President and CEO Ed Bolen in a statement late Sunday. ""Among the ways we will do that is to ensure business aviation operators have an understanding of these restrictions and their implications.""

Most business jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the NBAA. 

The FAA didn't immediately comment.

Here are the airports included in the new restrictions, according to the NBAA:

DETROIT – Kia on Monday previewed its next-generation Telluride SUV that the company is describing as a ""new benchmark for the brand's design and ambition.""

The first-generation Telluride has been a standout success for the South Korean car brand since it launched in 2019, at many times ranking as one of the most highly in-demand vehicles in the U.S., based on inventory levels. It's a crucial vehicle for the company in the U.S.

Kia said the 2027 Telluride, which is expected to arrive in U.S. showrooms during the first quarter, has a larger, boxier and more modern design overall compared with the current model.

The new front end features a large front grille encompassed by vertical headlamps, while the rear of the vehicle features a sleek design and silhouette reminiscent of a Range Rover.

The company on Monday released images of a Telluride X-Pro model ahead of the three-row midsize SUV's official debut later this month at the Los Angeles Auto Show, where more trims and details of the vehicle will be released.

Sales of the Telluride have increased every year since its launch in 2019, with Kia selling more than 444,000 units in total, according to the company. The vehicle's sales are up 11% year to date through October, according to Kia.

Kia offers the current Telluride in 10 trim levels, with starting pricing between $36,000 and $54,000.

A new version of the Hyundai Palisade, which is a sibling vehicle to the Kia Telluride, was released earlier this year and starts between $39,000 and $55,000, depending on trim.

Huge swathes of cash are flowing from Japan to European tech startups as risk-averse investors favor a more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem, helping to scale the continent's booming deep tech cluster.

While the European startup and venture capital ecosystem has long operated in the shadow of Silicon Valley, it has become fertile ground for Japanese corporates, whose domestic market is younger.  

Japanese investors or venture capital funds who themselves have Japanese investors, known as limited partners, participated in European financing rounds worth more than 33 billion euros ($38 billion) since 2019 when a trade deal between the European Union and Japan came into force, according to research from venture capital fund NordicNinja and data platform Dealroom.   

For the five years leading up to the EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement, investment totaled 5.3 billion euros.

In Europe at that time, ""there was no Japanese capital other than Softbank,"" Tomosaku Sohara, co-founder and managing partner of Japan-Europe VC NordicNinja, told CNBC. NordicNinja, which has 250 million euros of assets under management, is a collaboration between the firm's managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners.

""Softbank was pretty active already at that moment, because they had acquired Finnish gaming company Supercell,"" Sohara said, noting that the acquisition injected life into Finland's startup ecosystem. 

Now, Mitsubishi, Sanden, Yamato Holdings, and Marunouchi Innovation Partners are among those directly backing European tech, per the report, while Japan-linked venture capital firms such as NordicNinja, Byfounders, and Toyota's Woven Capital cut checks to startups on the continent. 

There are over two times more VC-backed startups in Europe than in Japan, per capita, and 4.3 times more unicorns, per the report. 

Japan's appetite for investing was always there, Sohara said. Its multinationals — like many — headed stateside to set up corporate venture capital arms in early 2000, in search of a slice of the action at the time when some of today's largest companies were just being thought up in dorm rooms.  

""Nobody wanted to look at Europe at that moment, but I think that after a couple of years they realized, 'Hey, maybe the U.S. culture is totally different from the Japanese culture,' and they began thinking, 'Hey, maybe we need to look at another region like Europe,'"" Sohara said, adding that the profile of entrepreneurs in Europe, many of whom came from large corporates at the time, was more aligned with Japan. That's in contrast to the young founders coming from Stanford or university research and development departments, he said.

""They have experience at the corporates and also they have a mindset of entrepreneurship. Japan, unfortunately, is lacking the entrepreneurship mindset,"" Sohara added, referring to Europe's founders, many of whom came from Nokia and Skype.

Japanese-linked investors have a penchant for one sector in particular: deep tech, which refers to companies building on top of scientific or engineering innovation. Deep tech and artificial intelligence accounted for 70% of deals made by such investors in Europe in 2024, echoing trends in the broader startup ecosystem as the AI, energy, and defense industries boom.  

The top-funded companies with Japanese participation include the U.K.'s autonomous vehicle startup Wayve, which raised $1.05 billion in an investment round in May 2024, British quantum computing firm Quantinuum, which secured 273 million euros in January 2024, and Spanish quantum firm Multiverse Computing, which saw investors cut it a check of 189 million euros in June 2025. The rounds were backed by Softbank, Mitsui and Toshiba, respectively.  

Such companies, however, typically need a lot of growth capital and industrial experience to scale successfully — two elements that Europe famously lacks.  

""Japanese firms — and they're old, most of them that we're talking about, right — they're just sitting on a pile of money. They've been saving money throughout the last century, and now they're starting to spend it, to try to grow as a large corporate and increase their footprint outside of Japan,"" said Sarah Fleischer, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based battery materials recycling startup Tozero. 

""You see that investment appetite is way stronger than [in] any strategics I've seen here in Germany or in Europe,"" she added. Tozero has raised 14.5 million euros to date and counts NordicNinja, Honda and JGC among its investors.

It's not just about the check. Japanese corporates and industrials have robust manufacturing and automotive know-how, Fleischer and Sohara noted respectively, meaning they are well positioned to plug Europe's knowledge gaps when it comes to scaling large manufacturing projects.

Fleischer added that Japanese firms have long shored up their critical minerals supply chain and long-established trading firms, meaning they know how to secure essential components needed for the energy transition. For Tozero, this is an added plus, Fleischer said, given it's in the business of recovering such materials from spent batteries. 

In the age of political uncertainty amid choppy U.S.-China relations, Japan also acts as a good bridge to the Asian markets, Fleischer said.

Back in Japan, the number of entrepreneurs is ""still very limited,"" Sohara said, as the older generation and ""great talents"" wanted to work for ""a Toyota and Honda or Sony,"" he added, but the younger generation's mindset is beginning to change.  

Europe has also become the home to ambitious would-be founders searching for a tech ecosystem to build their companies in, Sohara said.

However, as collaboration between Europe and Japan scales, language remains a barrier as fluency in English is not widespread in Japan, he added.  

For Fleischer, this also poses challenges. ""There's so much miscommunication and local translation that could ruin a partnership instantly. And there's also some sort of cultural aspect as well, one needs to probably be aware of,"" she said, adding that she recently spent weeks in Japan getting to know her investors face-to-face, ""because that's still the sentiment"" there.  

Decision-making can therefore be slower, the founder said, due to thorough research and preparation. ""They just do their homework,"" Fleischer said, noting that Japanese partners were hands-on in helping the company understand ""how to build our next future commercial plant, potentially starting from Japan and then going worldwide.""

Indeed, ""without the support from NN [NordicNinja] it would have been much more difficult to build the right relationships,"" said Aaike van Vugt, co-founder and CEO of Dutch nanotechnology engineering firm VSParticle.

That's in contrast to perhaps the most well-known Japanese player: Softbank. Softbank is ""totally different"" from traditional Japanese investor cultures, given it is driven by founder Masayoshi Son's decisions rather than operating on a consensus basis, like most Japanese business, Sohara added.  

The venture firm, known for its lofty bets on WeWork and, more recently, chip company Arm, poured huge sums of cash into tech startups amid the 2021 venture capital tech boom, which saw at least one Japanese-linked investor involved in deals worth 11.2 billion euros, per the report. Softbank stood out during this period; it was involved in 22% of deals with Japanese-linked participation in 2021.

Looking forward, Sohara and Fleischer expect greater collaboration between Europe and Japan. However, Japanese investors are expected to participate in rounds worth 3 billion euros in 2025, per the Dealroom and NordicNinja report, representing a dip from last year.  

As many eyes turn to the Middle East for investment, Fleischer said that interest in Japan appears to be ticking up. Anecdotally, ""people reach out to me for intros, which is fun, to meet Japanese corporate LPs,"" she said, noting that this is a new development for her but that it may simply be because she has such investors now. 

""I think it's also politically driven as well in Japan, by the government, to position themselves more geopolitically smartly and make sure that the corporates or the industries grow in certain ecosystems, strengthening their positioning as a country,"" she said.  

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that NordicNinja is a collaboration between its managing partners and Japan's JBIC IG Partners, and to update Tozero's investors.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:cnbc.com","Former Google, Meta executives raise $100 million for high-capacity AI servers startup","https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/10/majestic-labs-meta-google-ai-funding.html","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:00:01 GMT","



Three former Meta and Google silicon executives on Monday announced they've raised a total of $100 million to build technology they say will reduce cloud companies' spend on data center buildouts.

Called Majestic Labs, the startup's co-founders are Ofer Shacham, Sha Rabii and Masumi Reynders, all of whom spent years working together leading silicon products at Meta and Google. Majestic's patent-pending silicon design architecture includes 1,000 times the memory of a typical enterprise-grade server, the co-founders told CNBC.

Majestic develops its entire chip system, much like Nvidia, but each of the startup's servers may replace up to 10 of today's leading racks, they said.

The company closed its $71 million Series A funding round in September, led by Bow Wave Capital. Among its others investors is Lux Capital. Prior to Monday's announcement, the co-founders had been quietly working on the startup since late 2023.

Majestic's funding announcement comes as major tech companies raise their capital expenditures, primarily for data center infrastructure. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon each lifted their guidance for capital expenditures in October, and they collectively expect that number to reach more than $380 billion this year.

While the majority of large language models and AI workloads have relied on Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, more companies are entering the fold. Google last week announced Ironwood, its latest tensor processing unit, or TPUs, which artificial intelligence startup Anthropic plans to use for its Claude model.

However, memory capacity remains a challenge for companies that have large amounts of data to process, which the Majestic co-founders said they hope to address.

""Nvidia makes excellent GPUs and has driven incredible AI innovation,"" Shacham, Majestic's CEO, told CNBC. ""We're not trying to replace GPUs across the board — we're solving for memory-intensive AI workloads where the fixed compute-to-memory ratio becomes a constraint""

Majestic is going after hyperscalers and large companies that run AI models, including those from the financial and pharmaceutical industries, the co-founders said.

The technology underpinning the company includes patent-pending architectures that allow Majestic to collapse multiple racks worth of conventional equipment and memory into a single server. Majestic claims that will allow for a smaller footprint and requires less power and cooling, helping the company's clients reduce their data center costs.

Prototypes of Majestic's box servers will be available for some customers in 2027, and the startup has already begun discussing pre-orders, the co-founders said. Majestic declined to share its clients.

The company has fewer than 50 employees — half of which are based in Tel Aviv, Israel, while the rest are based in Los Altos, California. Majestic said it plans to grow each location and seek additional funding in the coming year. 

The trio met at Google, and together, they helped stand up the team working on Google's TPUs.

""We'd been building AI for DARPA, for Google, for Meta, but suddenly AI became this ubiquitous thing that everybody needs,"" Shacham said. ""Every large company needs AI, and that was a good time for me to say 'How about we go and do that?'""

The first to join the search company was Reynders in 2003, who went to Google as a senior corporate counsel. She's now Majestic's COO and manages the business side of the company.

At Google, her teams were focused on business development and product strategy focused on silicon. Reynders spent 15 years at Google, where she rose to director of product management and silicon.

Rabii, Majestic's president, earned his doctorate from Stanford University, and in 2011, he sold his last chip design company, Arda Technologies, to Google, where he rose to senior director of engineering. Under Rabii, Google launched its video chip Argos, which is used in YouTube's data centers.

Shacham sold his company, Chip Genesis, to Google in August 2013, when Rabii was leading Google's silicon team. Chip Genesis's technology was used broadly across many products including the AI accelerators in Google's Pixel smartphones. At Google, Shacham rose to head of silicon design and implementation for consumer hardware.

The three of them left Google in 2018 for the company then known as Facebook. There, they built the Facebook Agile Silicon Team, known as ""FAST,"" within the company's Reality Labs hardware division. Shacham rose to vice president and head of FAST.

When Meta laid off employees from Reality Labs in 2023, Shacham had to conduct the cuts, he said. At that point, Meta was trying to conserve cash, he said.

""Part of that was layoffs across the organization, and FAST was not excluded from that,"" Shacham said. ""It's not a good place to be, not a good feeling to do.""

The three founded Majestic Labs after brainstorming about the biggest bottleneck problems for silicon and AI.

""We've been friends and colleagues for a long time, so this notion of working together and doing something exciting has always been in the periphery,"" Reynders said.

As Majestic eyes growth and hiring in 2026, the co-founders said they're tapping into their collective of rolodex of the more than 1,500 employees they've worked with at prior companies, including Meta and Google.

""There's that trust they already have with us,"" Rabii said of the former colleagues.

Here are five key things investors need to know to start the trading day:

All eyes were on Capitol Hill last night when the Senate approved the first step of a deal that could end the federal government shutdown. Effects of the 41-day closure escalated in the last week, as the FAA ordered airlines to cancel some flights and as the Trump administration refused to fund food stamps.

Here's the latest:

Stocks are coming off a rough week, with the Nasdaq Composite recording its biggest weekly loss since April. Several well-known tech names including Oracle, Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom weighed down the broader market, raising alarm about the health of the artificial intelligence trade.

But stock futures are higher this morning after the Senate's vote gave traders hope that the end of the shutdown is in sight. It's a light week for economic data and corporate earnings, which CNBC's Sarah Min notes could allow space for some digestion of recent market action.

Startup data provider PitchBook announced this morning that it's launching a new artificial intelligence tool called PitchBook Navigator.

Beginning later this month, subscribers will be able to get insights on market deals and trends by asking the AI assistant questions. PitchBook is also integrating its product with ChatGPT.

As CNBC's Jaures Yip points out, the new AI-powered tool comes amid a boom of interest in private market deals as the valuations of buzzy startups balloon.

Cleveland Guardians pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were indicted for their alleged roles in a sports betting scheme, federal prosecutors said yesterday. Authorities said the pair took bribes to rig bets on pitches thrown during MLB games.

The duo could face up to 20 years in prison if they are found guilty of the highest-offense charges. The MLB placed both players on leave in July as the league conducted an investigation.

It's the latest betting scandal to rock major league sports after the federal government said in an indictment last month that confidential information about NBA players was leaked to bettors.

The Trump administration told the Supreme Court on Monday morning that it still wants a block on a Rhode Island federal judge's order mandating that it pay 42 million Americans their full SNAP benefits for November.

The message came a day after the 1st Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston, for a second time, flatly rejected a request by the Trump administration to stay that order pending its full appeal of the decision.

That judge's order remains temporarily paused as a result of a prior ruling by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.

But Jackson on Monday told the Trump administration to inform the Supreme Court by 11 a.m. ET whether it intends to continue to seek a stay of the order. 

The administration quickly did so, and said it would comply with her directive to file a supplemental brief on the request by 4 p.m. Monday. 

Plaintiffs in the case were told to respond by 8 a.m. on Tuesday.

Separately on Monday, a federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order blocking the Trump administration's memo over the weekend telling states that they had to ""undo"" any full SNAP benefits payments to recipients, or face financial penalties.

The ruling Sunday night by a three-judge panel of the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals came a day after the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued that memo.

And it came hours after the Senate narrowly passed the first step of a bipartisan deal that might reopen the government within days, and fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through next September.

""In reviewing the district court's balancing of the equities, we also cannot ignore the particular events preceding this litigation,"" wrote Circuit Court Judge Julie Rikelman in the panel's decision Sunday. ""As the district court found, 'this is a problem that could have been avoided.'""

""The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,"" Rikelman wrote.

""In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 [temporary restraining order] after the government had failed to comply with it.""

The Trump administration on Oct. 24 broke decades of precedent when it said it would not pay SNAP benefits in November because Congress had not appropriated money for the program, or any other government program, past the date the shutdown began, Oct. 1. Past administrations had paid SNAP benefits in full during other shutdowns.

The administration rejected the idea of using the remaining $4.6 billion in a contingency fund that Congress had specifically allocated to backstop SNAP.

A group of plaintiffs, comprised of nonprofits, local governments, a union and a food retailer, sued the administration in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island seeking a judicial order forcing the administration to use the contingency fund and other pools of money to fully fund SNAP benefits.

Judge Jack McConnell, who is overseeing the case, ordered the administration to make at least partial benefits as soon as possible by tapping the contingency fund, and to investigate if other money could be used.

McConnell on Thursday ordered that the administration pay full benefits, days after the administration told him it would pay only partial benefits — but that it would take some time to do so — and told him that it had ruled out using so-called Section 32 funds.

McConnell ordered that the administration use Section 32 funds to make up the difference between the 65% of benefits the administration planned to pay by using the contingency fund and the full value of the benefits. SNAP benefits cost about $8 billion each month.

The administration then asked the 1st Circuit for a temporary stay of McConnell's order on an emergency basis, which the appeals court rejected Friday.

But the appeals court at the same time also said it was still considering the ""government's motion for a stay pending appeal [of McConnell's order] ... and we intend to issue a decision on that motion as quickly as possible.""

On Friday night, Jackson, acting on a request by the administration, paused McConnell's order from taking effect and told the 1st Circuit to quickly rule on the request for the stay pending appeal.

Jackson's order paused for 48 hours any ruling by the 1st Circuit from taking effect.

Cathie Wood, CEO of ARK Invest, remains confident in Bitcoin‘s (CRYPTO: BTC) future, even in the face of market volatility.

During a podcast, Wood reaffirmed her $1 million price target for the cryptocurrency. She attributed this confidence to the ongoing growth of stablecoins, which recently surpassed $300 billion in total market value.

This surge in stablecoins, she explained, signifies a pivotal moment for the digital asset market, despite the potential for short-term fluctuations in Bitcoin's price.

Wood emphasized that the increasing presence of stablecoins, though potentially dampening Bitcoin's immediate market performance, reflects the strengthening credibility and maturation of the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.

According to the podcast, she pointed out that these developments are crucial for long-term growth and solidify Bitcoin's place as a leading digital asset.

Her $1 million prediction for Bitcoin has remained steadfast, even as the asset's price has experienced downturns, such as falling below $100,000 for the first time since June 2022.

According to Wood, the key drivers behind Bitcoin's growth are both institutional involvement and the development of a more stable macroeconomic environment, with conditions set to improve around mid-December following Federal Reserve updates and new U.S. employment reports.

Wood compared Bitcoin's potential growth to gold's market trajectory, suggesting that Bitcoin could eventually capture a significant portion of gold's market cap. She acknowledged the current pressures in the digital asset market but remains optimistic that these will dissipate as the market stabilizes, potentially leading to a new phase of growth in 2026.

Despite recent challenges, Wood's outlook on Bitcoin continues to be driven by its recognition as “digital gold” and its increasing institutional backing.

She also mentioned her belief that Bitcoin could reach as high as $650,000 by 2030, with the possibility of soaring to $1.5 million under favorable conditions.

Deloitte's #1 Fastest-Growing Software Company Lets Users Earn Money Just by Scrolling — Accredited Investors Can Still Get In at $0.50/Share.

Building a resilient portfolio means thinking beyond a single asset or market trend. Economic cycles shift, sectors rise and fall, and no one investment performs well in every environment. That's why many investors look to diversify with platforms that provide access to real estate, fixed-income opportunities, professional financial guidance, precious metals, and even self-directed retirement accounts. By spreading exposure across multiple asset classes, it becomes easier to manage risk, capture steady returns, and create long-term wealth that isn't tied to the fortunes of just one company or industry.

Backed by Jeff Bezos, Arrived Homes makes real estate investing accessible with a low barrier to entry. Investors can buy fractional shares of single-family rentals and vacation homes starting with as little as $100. This allows everyday investors to diversify into real estate, collect rental income, and build long-term wealth without needing to manage properties directly.

Vinovest lets investors diversify into fine wine — a historically stable, low-volatility asset class that has outperformed the S&P 500 over multiple decades. With professionally managed portfolios, secure storage, and insurance included, users can invest in wine without needing to be experts themselves. Minimums start at $1,000, and investors retain full ownership of their wine, which has the potential to appreciate in value as global demand grows.

For those seeking fixed-income style returns without Wall Street complexity, Worthy Property Bonds offers SEC-qualified, interest-bearing bonds starting at just $10. Investors earn a fixed 7% annual return, with funds deployed to small U.S. businesses. The bonds are fully liquid, meaning you can cash out anytime, making them attractive for conservative investors looking for steady, passive income.

Self-directed investors looking to take greater control of their retirement savings may consider IRA Financial. The platform enables you to use a self-directed IRA or Solo 401(k) to invest in alternative assets such as real estate, private equity, or even crypto. This flexibility empowers retirement savers to go beyond traditional stocks and bonds, building diversified portfolios that align with their long-term wealth strategies.

Moomoo isn't just for trading — it's also one of the most attractive places to park cash. New users can earn a promotional 8.1% APY on uninvested cash, combining a 3.85% base rate with a 4.25% booster once activated. On top of that, eligible new users can also score up to $1,000 in free Nvidia stock—but the real draw here is the ability to earn bank-beating interest rates without having to move into riskier assets.

SoFi gives members access to a wide range of professionally managed alternative funds, covering everything from commodities and private credit to venture capital, hedge funds, and real estate. These funds can provide broader diversification, help smooth out portfolio volatility, and potentially boost total returns over time. Many of the funds have relatively low minimums, making alternative investing accessible.

Instead of charging asset-based fees, the platform offers flat-fee tiers that provide unlimited access to fiduciary advisors along with AI-powered planning tools. Investors can link their accounts without moving assets, while higher-level plans unlock advanced support for taxes, real estate, and multi-generational wealth strategies. This model makes Range especially appealing to high-earning professionals who want holistic advice and predictable pricing.

Block, the payments infrastructure firm led by Jack Dorsey, has enabled Bitcoin payments for 4 million merchants globally using the Square Bitcoin feature of its point-of-sale platform, the firm announced on Monday.

The integration allows merchants to accept Bitcoin at checkout with instant settlement via Bitcoin's Lightning Network, with no fees until 2027. Sellers can automatically convert a portion of their daily card sales into Bitcoin as well. 

“Square Bitcoin is the first fully integrated Bitcoin payments and wallet solution for businesses that will enable sellers to accept Bitcoin payments and automatically convert sales into Bitcoin,” Dorsey wrote in his firm's third-quarter shareholder letter.

The firm initially introduced its Square Bitcoin platform in October and successfully demonstrated merchant acceptance at Compass Coffee, a Washington D.C.-based coffee chain shortly thereafter. 

The launch is part of the Block's initiative to provide sellers with financial optionality and flexibility, the company said, all while bringing Bitcoin into the fold of everyday payments and commerce. 

“We're making Bitcoin payments as seamless as card payments while giving small businesses access to financial management tools that, until now, have been exclusive to the largest corporations,” said Block's Head of Bitcoin Product Miles Suter, in an October statement announcing the product. 

“Through Square and Cash App, we serve both sides of the counter, meaning Square is uniquely positioned to make Bitcoin everyday money, not just a store of value—while also helping sellers future-proof their operations,” he added.

As part of that push, Dorsey has been calling for a de minimis tax exemption on everyday Bitcoin transactions after a legislative effort fell short months ago. In other words, the Block CEO and X (formerly Twitter) co-founder is hoping Americans will not need to report small crypto transactions as capital gains. 

What's Next for Bitcoin if US Government Shutdown Ends?

Dorsey's firm has released other Bitcoin products as well. Last year, it launched a self-custody hardware wallet called BitKey, and its Cash App—a Venmo or PayPal rival—allows users to buy, sell, and transfer Bitcoin. A map of all global merchants that accept Bitcoin, including those using Bitcoin Square, can be found inside Cash App as well. 

Shares of Block (XYZ) are up about 0.5% on Monday, changing hands at $65.80. Bitcoin has gained about 1.7% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $105,456.","{'href': 'https://finance.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Finance'}","cryptocurrency"

Strategy has added more Bitcoin to its balance sheet, continuing its accumulation strategy despite recent market volatility. The company now holds 641,692 BTC, valued at approximately $47.5 billion.

The move reaffirms long-term confidence in Bitcoin's growth potential, but also raises doubts about sustainability.

Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) continues to strengthen its position as the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder.

The company announced the purchase of an additional 487 BTC for approximately $49.9 million, at an average price of $102,557 per coin. With this latest acquisition, Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings have climbed to 641,692 BTC.

https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1987868344494489809?s=20

Strategy's average purchase price across all holdings stands at $74,079 per Bitcoin. This latest figure represents a 26.1% year-to-date BTC yield in 2025.

The company's overall performance highlights its disciplined approach to Bitcoin accumulation.

However, its latest purchase has raised eyebrows, particularly given the broader volatility in Bitcoin's performance.

Bitcoin recently slipped below the $100,000 mark in early November, sparking renewed debate about market volatility and the sustainability of corporate Bitcoin investment strategies.

While some investors viewed the recent correction as a warning sign, Strategy saw it as a buying opportunity.

The company's latest purchase came just days after Michael Saylor set a $150,000 year-end target for Bitcoin, doubling down on the conviction that short-term volatility won't derail the company's long-term strategy.

On Friday, Strategy also raised $770 million through the issuance of its 10% Series A STRE preferred stock, targeting institutional investors seeking stable returns. The funds raised are being used to support further Bitcoin purchases and general corporate operations.

Still, Strategy's latest actions come amid heightened uncertainty, with both Bitcoin and MSTR shares facing steep declines. The company's stock has dropped more than 27% in the past month, closely tracking Bitcoin's retreat from record highs.

Critics contend that the company's fortunes are too closely tied to Bitcoin's price, while supporters view its approach as a strong expression of long-term confidence and value preservation.

Whether Strategy's bold conviction pays off will depend on Bitcoin's recovery trajectory and investor sentiment in the months ahead.

Strategy issued $50 million in preferred stock to fund its latest Bitcoin purchase, leaving common shareholders undiluted as its market cap approached a key threshold, the Bitcoin-buying firm signaled in a blog post on Monday.

The Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company was recently valued at $71 billion, reflecting a 1.06x premium against its $67.8 billion Bitcoin stockpile. The premium, often referred to as mNAV, or multiple-to-net asset value, was close to its smallest in 20 months.

Last week, Strategy sold a combination of preferred shares, which require the world's largest corporate holder of Bitcoin to make dividend payments. The sale was mostly of Strategy's Variable Rate Series A Perpetual Stretch Preferred Stock, at $26 million.

Historically, Strategy has issued common shares to grow its Bitcoin holdings. However, the move has become a less effective way for Strategy to grow the amount of Bitcoin that it owns per share, as mNAV has drifted down from a 2.7x a year ago.

Last week, Strategy added 487 Bitcoin to its corporate coffers. The purchase, valued at $50 million, lifted Strategy's stockpile to nearly 641,700 Bitcoin.

Strategy shares fell 0.3% on Monday to $241, according to Yahoo Finance. Bitcoin changed hands around $105,400, up 2% over the past day, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. In a Myriad prediction market, 

On Saturday, short seller James Chanos said on X that he had unwound a trade, in which he was betting on Strategy's premium to fall. The Wall Street veteran hasn't revealed the position's size or any profits, but Chanos has said that he entered into it around a year ago.

By going long Bitcoin, and shorting Strategy's shares, Chanos wasn't betting against the price of Bitcoin, but rather that Strategy's sky-high mNAV from a year ago was fleeting.

“The premium should continue to compress over time as MSTR continues to issue common equity, but we recommend letting others chase that leg of the trade as MSTR inevitably marches towards a 1.0x mNAV,” a note shared by Chanos on X stated.  

This year, Strategy has tried to adapt its stance on common share issuance to convey discipline. And last month, it went several weeks without issuing common equity.

In a recent note, TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza said Strategy's premium and capital issuance are expected to accelerate in the first half of this year, saying the dynamic would be “consistent with prior cycles.”

Last week, Strategy said that it was expecting $715 million in proceeds from the debut of its first preferred share denominated in euros. The transaction is set to schedule on Thursday, with the product debuting in markets in Luxembourg.

If Strategy plowed those funds into Bitcoin, it would be the company's largest purchase since it spent $2.46 billion on the asset in mid-July. Thomas Perfumo, global economist at crypto exchange Kraken, noted to Decrypt that Strategy's acquisitions have moved markets less.

“Slowing Bitcoin flows are a major factor influencing the market's current direction,” he said on Friday. “Demand from digital asset treasuries like Strategy, that supported crypto prices through the summer, is decelerating.”

Bitcoin jumped past $106,000 for the first time in nearly a week amid multiple reports that the U.S. Senate had reached an agreement to end the 40-day government shutdown, the longest in U.S. history. 

The largest cryptocurrency by market value was recently up more than 4%, according to data provider CoinGecko. Other major digital assets also moved strongly into positive territory with Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization recently trading above $3,600, a more than 7% gain and XRP and Solana, the fourth- and sixth-largest coins, both climbing about 6%. 

The government impasse seemed to weigh increasingly as it extended more than a month, with Bitcoin tumbling below $100,000 on several occasions for the first time since early August. BTC remains more than 15% off its record high above $126,000, set in early October. Ethereum has lost even more ground over the same period as investors veered away from risk-on assets.

Markets have been turbulent in recent weeks as investors fretted not only about the shutdown but other macroeconomic uncertainties. Over the past eight trading days, the 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs have lost more than $2.1 billion in assets, while net outflows for the nine Ethereum funds have totaled $579 million.

Crypto stocks have also taken a battering, with exchange giant Coinbase plunging more than 9% last week and Bitcoin treasury Strategy falling over 8%.

As this story neared publication, Senate Democrats and Republicans had reached a deal to reopen the government, according to reports in Politico, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times. The resolution of the impasse came after a group of moderate Democrats agreed to vote in favor of procedural motions that would fund the government.

Democrats had insisted on extending health subsidies that would make insurance less expensive, although the length of the government shutdown appeared to trump those concerns.

In a Myriad prediction market, users gave a more than 90% chance that the government closure will end before November 15. That figure rose from about 37% over the last 24 hours. Myriad is a unit of Dastan, Decrypt's parent company.

The global crypto market today kicked off the week on a cautiously optimistic note after a subdued weekend of consolidation. Bitcoin BTCUSDT price reclaimed key resistance near $106,000 while Ethereum ETHUSDT price surged past $3,600, fueling renewed interest in the broader crypto market. Trading volumes are picking up across major exchanges as investors position for the week ahead, supported by positive ETF flow data and stable macro sentiment. However, altcoin performance remains uneven, with selective gains in Solana SOLUSDT and Avalanche AVAXUSDT while several mid-caps continue to lag.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Extend Gains



Bitcoin climbed 4.1% in the last 24 hours to hover near $106,034, signaling a steady rebound following last week's range-bound trade. The trading volume increased by over 35%, while the ETF inflows remain passive. Ethereum rose over 7% to around $3,643, outperforming BTC as on-chain activity picked up, and staking inflows continued to trend higher. The ETH/BTC ratio rose slightly, hinting at possible rotation into smart-contract-based assets.

Altcoins Trade Mixed as SOL, DOGE Rise Moderately While XRP Thrives



The altcoin market displayed mixed sentiment, with the Solana SOLUSDT price advancing 6.6% to around $167, supported by rising DeFi volumes and active wallet growth. Avalanche AVAXUSDT and Toncoin TONUSDT also posted modest gains, while Cardano ADAUSDT and Polygon (MATIC) stayed largely flat. XRP and Hyperliquid surged over 7%, while the BNB price just reclaimed levels above $1000. Despite strong showings from select tokens, market breadth remains limited—a sign that capital rotation is still concentrated in the large-cap space.

Top Gainers, Losers, and Volume Leaders

Market Sentiment and Overall Health

Market sentiment indicators remain under fear, while the crypto market cap rises above $3.5 trillion with a decent rise in volume. Bitcoin's dominance sits near 59%, underscoring the concentration of capital in major assets, and the altcoin season index has risen slightly above the Bitcoin-dominant zone to reach 33. However, the future open interest continues to decline, indicating a drop in the momentum as traders are now closing their positions instead of opening new ones.

While broader crypto market health shows tentative improvement, traders are watching whether rising volumes translate into a sustained rally. For now, the tone remains cautiously bullish—driven by BTC stability and selective altcoin strength rather than a full-scale breakout.

Outlook

If Bitcoin maintains support above $105,000 and Ethereum sustains momentum above $3,600, a short-term push toward higher resistance levels appears likely. Analysts expect volatility to remain contained ahead of midweek macro data and potential ETF inflow updates. Broader participation from mid-caps could signal a stronger recovery trend heading into the second half of November.

FAQs

Bitcoin and Ethereum recovered key levels, trading volumes increased, and sentiment improved as investors positioned for the week ahead.

Higher trading volumes, stable macro conditions, and steady ETF flows are supporting Bitcoin's rebound from last week's consolidation.

Ethereum is seeing stronger on-chain activity, higher staking inflows, and mild rotation from BTC into smart-contract assets.

If BTC holds above $105,000 and ETH stays over $3,600, short-term upside is likely, though volatility may stay contained until midweek data arrives.

Bitcoin (BTC) is trading above $106,000 at the time of writing on Monday as the cryptocurrency market broadly recovers following the United States (US) Senate vote to advance a bill likely to end the record-breaking government shutdown.

Altcoins, including Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP), are following in Bitcoin's footsteps, creating new opportunities for investors.

The US Senate has voted to advance a bill that would reopen the government and keep it afloat at least until the end of January amid a record-breaking government shutdown.

Seven Senate Democrats and one independent joined Republicans to advance the bill through a 60-40 procedural vote on Sunday. This is expected to pave the way for full-year funding for an essential food aid program that currently serves over 42 million Americans, as well as for rehiring federal workers laid off during the government shutdown, according to the media platform Baker City Herald.

Riskier assets, including crypto, are showing signs of recovery following Sunday's vote, pointing to improving sentiment. Macroeconomic uncertainty amid the government shutdown has kept Bitcoin significantly suppressed since the October 10 crash. Reopening the US government could further boost risk-on sentiment and bolster recovery in the cryptocurrency market before the end of the year.

Bitcoin is trading marginally above $106,000 at the time of writing on Monday, supported by improving sentiment in the larger crypto market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), at 45 and uptrending on the daily chart, indicates that bullish momentum is increasing.

A sustained uptrend above the $106,000 short-term support may encourage investors to increase their risk exposure, possibly triggering a buy signal from the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator on the same daily chart.

A break above the 200-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $108,028 would affirm the bullish grip, increasing the odds of a Bitcoin price rally above the $110,000 round number resistance.

Ethereum is holding above $3,600 and the 200-day EMA at $3,596 at the time of writing on Monday. The RSI is at 44 after a bullish crossover on the daily chart, which indicates that bullish momentum is rising.

Investors will likely increase their risk exposure if the MACD indicator confirms a buy signal on the same daily chart. Other key levels of interest for traders are the 100-day EMA at 3,886 and the psychological resistance at $4,000.

Meanwhile, retail demand for Ethereum has stabilized, with futures Open Interest (OI) rising to $41 billion on Monday, up from $39 billion the previous day. Such stability is required to improve investor confidence, following a prolonged risk-off sentiment since the October 10 deleveraging event. 

Furthermore, a steady increase in the OI would indicate that investors are ready to return and increase their risk exposure.

As for XRP, bulls are tightening their grip, paving the way for a steady recovery above $2.50. The daily chart showcases a bullish picture, supported by a buy signal from the MACD indicator. Risk-on sentiment is expected to increase with the blue line lifting above the red signal line.

The RSI on the same daily chart remains at 53 and rising, suggesting that bulls have the upper hand. A break above the 50-day EMA at $2.56 and the 100-day EMA at $2.65 would go a long way toward affirming the bullish outlook.

Token launches influence demand and adoption among market participants. Listings on crypto exchanges deepen the liquidity for an asset and add new participants to an asset's network. This is typically bullish for a digital asset. 

A hack is an event in which an attacker captures a large volume of the asset from a DeFi bridge or hot wallet of an exchange or any other crypto platform via exploits, bugs or other methods. The exploiter then transfers these tokens out of the exchange platforms to ultimately sell or swap the assets for other cryptocurrencies or stablecoins. Such events often involve an en masse panic triggering a sell-off in the affected assets.

Macroeconomic events like the US Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates influence crypto assets mainly through the direct impact they have on the US Dollar. An increase in interest rate typically negatively influences Bitcoin and altcoin prices, and vice versa. If the US Dollar index declines, risk assets and associated leverage for trading gets cheaper, in turn driving crypto prices higher.

Halvings are typically considered bullish events as they slash the block reward in half for miners, constricting the supply of the asset. At consistent demand if the supply reduces, the asset's price climbs.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) is battling to hold short-term support at $37.00 at the time of writing on Friday, as a bearish wave sweeps across the cryptocurrency market. The perpetual decentralized exchange (DEX) token has declined from an intraday high of $40.75, reflecting a sticky bearish sentiment.

The crypto market enjoyed a period of upside over the weekend following two consecutive losing weeks. Bitcoin BTC$106,433.16 rose 4% in the past 24 hours and having risen as high as $106,500 is now trading around $106,000 as it attempts to steer itself away from the psychological level of support at $100,000. Ether ETH$3,614.58 added 6.5%.

The altcoin market outperformed bitcoin, with bitcoin dominance falling to 59.1% from the Nov. 5 high of 60.1%. This is a signal that the touted $2,000 tariff dividend payment in the U.S. will serve as a boost to altcoins, as it did during the Covid-era.

Decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols also saw a boost, with total value locked (TVL) rising to  $142.8 billion, according to DeFiLlama data. Starknet Bridge TVL rose 20% to $913 million and Suilend also increased 20%.

The rise in TVL might be attributed to asset appreciation, but since the SUI token is up only 7%, it's more indicative of investors depositing to generate a yield, reflecting confidence in the market.

The global crypto market today kicked off the week on a cautiously optimistic note after a subdued weekend of consolidation. Bitcoin BTCUSDT price reclaimed key resistance near $106,000 while Ethereum ETHUSDT price surged past $3,600, fueling renewed interest in the broader crypto market. Trading volumes are picking up across major exchanges as investors position for the week ahead, supported by positive ETF flow data and stable macro sentiment. However, altcoin performance remains uneven, with selective gains in Solana SOLUSDT and Avalanche AVAXUSDT while several mid-caps continue to lag.

Bitcoin and Ethereum Extend Gains



Bitcoin climbed 4.1% in the last 24 hours to hover near $106,034, signaling a steady rebound following last week's range-bound trade. The trading volume increased by over 35%, while the ETF inflows remain passive. Ethereum rose over 7% to around $3,643, outperforming BTC as on-chain activity picked up, and staking inflows continued to trend higher. The ETH/BTC ratio rose slightly, hinting at possible rotation into smart-contract-based assets.

Altcoins Trade Mixed as SOL, DOGE Rise Moderately While XRP Thrives



The altcoin market displayed mixed sentiment, with the Solana SOLUSDT price advancing 6.6% to around $167, supported by rising DeFi volumes and active wallet growth. Avalanche AVAXUSDT and Toncoin TONUSDT also posted modest gains, while Cardano ADAUSDT and Polygon (MATIC) stayed largely flat. XRP and Hyperliquid surged over 7%, while the BNB price just reclaimed levels above $1000. Despite strong showings from select tokens, market breadth remains limited—a sign that capital rotation is still concentrated in the large-cap space.

Top Gainers, Losers, and Volume Leaders

Market Sentiment and Overall Health

Market sentiment indicators remain under fear, while the crypto market cap rises above $3.5 trillion with a decent rise in volume. Bitcoin's dominance sits near 59%, underscoring the concentration of capital in major assets, and the altcoin season index has risen slightly above the Bitcoin-dominant zone to reach 33. However, the future open interest continues to decline, indicating a drop in the momentum as traders are now closing their positions instead of opening new ones.

While broader crypto market health shows tentative improvement, traders are watching whether rising volumes translate into a sustained rally. For now, the tone remains cautiously bullish—driven by BTC stability and selective altcoin strength rather than a full-scale breakout.

Outlook

If Bitcoin maintains support above $105,000 and Ethereum sustains momentum above $3,600, a short-term push toward higher resistance levels appears likely. Analysts expect volatility to remain contained ahead of midweek macro data and potential ETF inflow updates. Broader participation from mid-caps could signal a stronger recovery trend heading into the second half of November.

FAQs

Bitcoin and Ethereum recovered key levels, trading volumes increased, and sentiment improved as investors positioned for the week ahead.

Higher trading volumes, stable macro conditions, and steady ETF flows are supporting Bitcoin's rebound from last week's consolidation.

Ethereum is seeing stronger on-chain activity, higher staking inflows, and mild rotation from BTC into smart-contract assets.

If BTC holds above $105,000 and ETH stays over $3,600, short-term upside is likely, though volatility may stay contained until midweek data arrives.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=blockchain","Kotani Pay: Can Blockchain Reduce Poverty?","https://borgenproject.org/kotani-pay/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:00:50 GMT","

In many developing countries, people lack access to financial instruments such as mobile banking. These services often require smartphones and the internet, creating a major barrier for low-income communities and limiting participation in the global economy. As a result, cash is often the only option, leaving individuals without secure ways to save or transfer money. According to the World Bank, 51% of adults in sub-Saharan Africa are without a bank account.

Financial inclusion is crucial for poverty alleviation. Services such as blockchain can expand access to financial systems, reduce transaction costs, and provide security and transparency. Innovative platforms such as Kotani Pay, a blockchain-based system that does not require the internet, are bridging the gaps in Africa.

Blockchain is a decentralized and tamper-proof digital ledger recording transactions across a distributed network. It is a technology which provides security and transparency without the need of traditional intermediaries such as banks. This allows faster, cheaper and more efficient transactions without people needing a traditional bank account.

Key benefits of blockchain include:

By reducing these barriers, blockchain can reduce poverty by giving individuals a tool to save, invest, and receive financial support.

Many financial systems are designed assuming users have smartphones, internet access, and identification documents. Throughout Africa, however, millions of people lack these resources, especially in rural areas. Blockchain platforms that adapt to local realities, such as supporting Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) transactions or mobile-money-compatible wallets, can extend financial services to previously excluded populations.

Stablecoins, digital currencies pegged to traditional assets like the U.S. dollar, also reduce the risk of currency fluctuations for low-income individuals, making savings and transfers more predictable. By providing low-cost, accessible financial services, blockchain directly contributes to poverty reduction.

Kotani Pay is a Kenyan startup which brings financial services to those without internet or traditional bank accounts. Kotani Pay is a service that lets users access blockchain and cryptocurrencies via USSD. Using USSD codes, Kotani Pay enables users to:

“We built Kotani Pay to bring financial instruments and services to those who do not have access to the Internet or have the capital and credit standing to open a bank account, thus increasing financial freedom.”

Users can dial a short code on their phone to access a menu where they can convert crypto to fiat, and vice versa. This simplified process enables users to transfer funds between their blockchain and wallet. Kotani Pay uses a stablecoin, Celo Dollars (cUSD), which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, protecting users from the otherwise common volatility of cryptocurrencies.

Because Kotani Pay focuses on helping underserved communities, they correct the typically high fees for cross-border transactions, increasing financial stability for those sending money abroad to their family, or those crossing borders fleeing for safety.

Since its launch, Kotani Pay has reached more than 15,000 beneficiaries, including refugees, gig workers, and rural farmers, UNICEF reports. By providing predictable financial support and easy access to transactions, Kotani Pay helps people start small businesses, save safely, and engage with the economy.

In the fight for financial inclusion, blockchain could reduce poverty more effectively than conventional banking reforms. Blockchain is not the only and sole solution, but it can play a key role in reducing financial exclusion. If Kotani Pay proves successful, the opportunity for scalability is huge. And with that, reduce global poverty. Its main challenge however, is regulation and legislation. With a mission of serving the entire continent, meeting each countries' regulatory requirements has slowed its growth. But it has not halted its mission.

Whether blockchain reduces poverty is down to how effectively governments, innovators, and communities can implement inclusive and affordable solutions. By providing secure, low-cost, and accessible financial tools, blockchain platforms like Kotani Pay are helping African communities participate in the global economy.

The Ninth Circuit ruled NFTs are “goods” protected by trademark law, as they function as digital products and branding tools. This decision could influence future NFT trademark cases.

The firm said it will continue adding more IP lawyers, seeing rising demand in the practice. 

Monte Mann, a partner at Armstrong Teasdale, says that the case presents an uphill battle for plaintiffs counsel, who will have to show that Shkreli took reasonable efforts to maintain the album's secrecy. ""While it's a creative legal theory, the merits here will be decided, they'll be won or lost, in the emails and in the server logs, and in the digital footprints of this music, and if that has been copied and disseminated before this has been paid at auction,” Mann said.

The article explains a split among U.S. courts over whether false advertising claims under the Lanham Act can target intangible misrepresentations, like patent or proprietary claims, or only focus on tangible product features.

The top NFT transaction of the past week is CryptoPunk #8296, which sold for 54.7 $ETH roughly valued at $196,31K. This makes CryptoPunk #8296 the largest NFT sale of the last week. Following closely, CryptoPunk #5361 recorded a high-value purchase of 45 $ETH that worth around $173.60K, while CryptoPunk #5295 secures the third place at 49.9 $ETH valued at $166.37K.

The momentum has extended across multiple unique CryptoPunks, including CryptoPunk #9537 that is selling for 41.5 $ETH valued at $159.90K and CryptoPunk #9498 at 36.8 $ETH for $139.58K. Even the lower-priced entries, such as CryptoPunk #704, #2744, and #2547, remained above the $120K threshold, which reinforce the buyer confidence and long-term collection demand.

These price levels highlight a strong market comeback amid growing institutional interest in NFTs. The data shared by Phoenix, also reflects a broader trend as CryptoPunks NFT collections continue to outperform newer and mid-tier projects, particularly during the market recoveries. Analysts firmly believe the surge is fueled by a mix of uniqueness and the historical significance of CryptoPunks as one of the earliest NFT sets on Ethereum.

With the overall crypto market gaining momentum and Ethereum ($ETH) price is rising, collectors are appeared to be increasingly willing to invest in high-value digital assets. If the current trends persists, CryptoPunks may lead another wave of premium NFT trading. This rising intered in NFT sector signals the renewed confidence in Web3 digital collectibles and long-term on-chain art value.

Coinbase (COIN) is introducing a new token sale platform that aims to reboot public crypto offerings with protections designed to prevent the problems that plagued the 2017-2018 initial coin offering (ICO) boom.



The new platform will host roughly one token sale per month, according to a Monday press release and investors will need to submit purchase requests during a one-week window for each sale. After that, an algorithm will determine how the tokens are distributed, aiming to avoid a first-come, first-served system and instead create what Coinbase describes as a “broad and equitable” allocation.

The initial offering comes next week from layer-1 blockchain startup Monad, said the company.

Token purchases must be made using Circle's (CRCL) stablecoin, USDC, and only users in good standing who have completed identity verification and compliance checks will be able to participate. The platform will be available to users in most global regions, with plans to expand access over time.

In a nod to the failures of past ICOs — which saw billions raised by projects that often had no functioning product or oversight — Coinbase said it has built in several investor-protection mechanisms. For example, project teams and affiliated parties will be blocked from selling any of their tokens for at least six months after the public sale. This restriction applies to both private and exchange-based sales.



Coinbase will also vet projects before allowing them to list, assessing criteria such as user interest, the founding team's track record, and token structure, including how tokens are distributed and how long they are locked up.



ICOs reached a peak in 2017 and 2018, when crypto projects raised billions of dollars by selling tokens directly to the public. While some projects went on to develop functioning networks, many collapsed or were exposed as frauds, drawing scrutiny from regulators and prompting platforms like Coinbase to steer clear of the model.



By automating allocation and enforcing post-sale restrictions, Coinbase's new approach may represent a reset for public token sales, this time with more oversight.

                            The digital euro project has gained crucial support in the EU, but some banks and lawmakers still oppose it. | Credit: Philipp von Ditfurth/picture alliance via Getty Images.                        

As the European Central Bank (ECB) advances its digital currency agenda, opposition to the project is mounting.

With lawmakers and commercial banks among those voicing concerns, the EU's central bank digital currency (CBDC) plans have exposed deep divides over what the future of money should look like.

Digital euro advocates argue that the eurozone needs a retail CBDC to counter the influence of American payment systems.

When the ECB first started evaluating the idea in 2020, Visa and Mastercard created the most immediate backdrop to digital sovereignty debates.

But in 2025, USD stablecoins are increasingly viewed as the more pressing threat.

In the most ambitious version of the digital euro presented by the ECB, offline functionality would rival card systems, while online CBDC payments would compete with stablecoins.

However, in a statement reported  by the Financial Times last week, 14 of Europe's largest banks warned that online digital euro payments would also compete with private sector solutions currently being developed.

“The current design of the retail digital euro largely addresses the same use cases as private solutions, without offering any clear added value for consumers,” firms including Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas, and ING stated.

Separately, a group of Italian banks backed the ECB's plans a few days later, but with the caveat that they should be able to spread the cost of implementation over a longer period, Reuters reported .

ECB board member Piero Cipollone has said  he expects the digital euro's technical infrastructure to be in place within two to three years once a political agreement is reached.

At a meeting in September, Eurozone finance ministers agreed on a governance framework for the CBDC, setting the stage for the Council of the European Union to vote on legislation before the end of next year.

But although member states appear to be on board, the digital euro faces tougher opposition in the European Parliament.

Even if it receives a green light from the Member States, the ECB's digital euro proposal still needs to be approved by the European Parliament.

Compared to the centrist-dominated Council, the EU's lower chamber reflects a much broader range of views.

CBDC skepticism has emerged from both ends of the political spectrum.

Critics of the digital euro can be found among diverse parliamentary alliances, including the Greens and the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group.

Reflecting doubts in parliament, Digital Euro Rapporteur Fernando Navarrete has sided with banks that object to online CBDC payments.

In a recent draft report, a Spanish lawmaker endorsed an offline digital euro system, but argued that the private sector should be given the opportunity to develop its own solution before implementing online payments.

Only in “the absence of a pan-European private sovereign retail payment solution” should the ECB launch an online retail CBDC, he argued.

With a legislative clash looming, gauging where the different parliamentary groups stand on the digital euro is challenging.

Beyond the small number who have been outspoken on the issue, there is no way to know how individual Members of the European Parliament will vote.","{'href': 'https://www.ccn.com', 'title': 'CCN.com'}","cryptocurrency"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=cbdc","What's the Future of CBDC?","https://pintu.co.id/en/news/226678-whats-the-future-of-cbdc","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 05:27:06 GMT","

Jakarta, Pintu News – More than 130 countries, covering nearly 98% of global GDP, are currently developing or testing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). This global initiative signals a major shift towards regulated digital finance. However, the big question that arises is whether CBDCs will replace cryptocurrencies or both can exist simultaneously?

The push for CBDCs is based on three main objectives: faster payments, financial inclusion, and control over digital money. Countries like China with e-CNY, the Eurozone with Digital Euros, Nigeria with eNaira, and the Bahamas with Sand Dollars are already leading the charge. It is estimated that between 2025 to 2028 will be an important turning point as CBDC pilots turn into real launches.

Records from the Atlantic Council's CBDC Tracker show there are 49 active pilots, signaling how quickly governments are moving towards national digital currencies. In the coming years, this transformation is expected to change the way people access and use money, accelerate cross-border transactions and strengthen government efforts to combat financial crime.

While CBDCs and cryptocurrencies may seem similar, they are built on very different foundations. CBDCs are centralized, state-backed, and designed for stability. In contrast, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin  and Ethereum  are decentralized and permissionless, built around the idea of financial freedom. However, some experts see that CBDCs can help crypto adoption by familiarizing people with digital wallets and blockchain payments.

If people start using digital currencies issued by central banks, they may be more open to exploring Bitcoin (BTC) or DeFi later on. However, many in the crypto world are not convinced. While clearer rules may bring legitimacy, CBDCs may also push regulators to implement stricter KYC and AML checks-increasing control at the expense of privacy.

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) found in a 2025 working paper that “more positive central bank CBDC sentiment is associated with a negative impact on cryptocurrency market returns.” Community sentiment also reflects such concerns.

A discussion on Reddit in November showed that most users view CBDCs negatively, mainly due to privacy concerns and fear of state surveillance. However, some voices believe that the two can coexist-CBDC for everyday payments, crypto for investment and self-reliance. This shows that despite concerns, there is still room for both systems to operate in harmony.

Despite the tension, some researchers believe that coexistence is the most practical outcome. Studies show that CBDCs can handle regulated digital cash while crypto continues to serve the role of privacy and global transfers. The real question is no longer whether CBDCs are coming, but whether cryptocurrencies can evolve fast enough to stay relevant in a world where every government wants to participate in blockchain.

				The United States crypto lobby, fresh from several wins stateside, has spied an opportunity to shape the U.K. rulebook on stablecoins. 			

LONDON — Britain's financial watchdogs have been on a crypto journey — with a little help from Donald Trump. 

The Bank of England publishes its long-awaited rules for stablecoin Monday. Two years after the central bank's Governor Andrew Bailey dismissed the virtual currency — a theoretically more stable form of crypto — as “not money,” its rulebook is now expected to get a cautious welcome from an industry that's been lobbying hard for a rethink.

It would mark quite a shift from the U.K. central bank. 

Stablecoins “are not robust and, as currently organized, do not meet the standards we expect of safe money in the financial system,” Bailey told a City of London audience in 2023. 

Now his top officials herald a “fabulous opportunity.” 

The Bank chief's initial position — that he doesn't see stablecoins as a substitute for commercial bank money — has put him at odds with the U.K. Treasury, which is on an all-consuming mission to get the sluggish British economy moving. Chancellor Rachel Reeves wants the U.K. “at the forefront of digital asset innovation.” 

The United States crypto lobby, fresh from several wins stateside, spied an opportunity. Exploiting those divisions — and pointing to a more gung-ho approach from Trump's U.S. — has allowed firms to push for a British regime that more closely aligns with their own. 

Monday could be a very good day at the office. 

Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a real asset, like the dollar, with the largest and best-known offering being Tether. They're seen as a more palatable version of crypto, and are used by investors to buy other cryptocurrencies, or allow cross-border payments. 

The pro-stablecoin camp says their development is necessary to improve payments and overseas transactions for businesses and consumers, particularly as cash usage declines and sending money abroad remains clunky and expensive. If done well, a stablecoin could maintain a reliable store of value and be a viable alternative to cash. 

Those more cautious, including the BoE, warn there are risks for the wider financial system including undermining public confidence in money and payments if something goes wrong. 

And stablecoins are not immune to things going wrong: In 2022, the Terra Luna token lost 99 percent of its value, along with its sister token TerraUSD, a stablecoin which went from being pegged to the dollar on a $1-1 TerraUSDbasis, to being valued at $0.4. Tether also fell during that time to $0.95. 

Other central bankers seem to agree with Bailey's early caution. The Bank for International Settlements, a central bank body, issued a stark warning on stablecoins in June, saying they “fall short” as a form of sound money. 

There are also concerns such coins are used to skirt money-laundering laws, with anti-money laundering watchdog the Financial Action Task Force, warning that most on-chain illicit transactions involved stablecoins.

The EU has tough regulation in place for digital assets. The bloc prioritizes tighter control over the market than the U.S., with stricter rules on capital and operations. 

That's in stark contrast to the U.S., which passed its own stablecoin regulation — the GENIUS act — earlier this year, which is much more industry-friendly. Donald Trump, whose family is building its own crypto empire, has described stablecoins as “perhaps the greatest revolution in financial technology since the birth of the Internet itself.” 

That's put post-Brexit Britain in a bind: align with the EU, the U.S., or go it alone? 

“The U.K. is a bit caught,” a former Bank of England official who now works in digital assets said. They were granted anonymity, like others in this article, to speak freely. “It doesn't have the luxury of completely creating a bespoke regime. It can do, but essentially, no one's going to care.”

For a Labour government intent on deregulating for growth, aligning with the U.S. was immediately a more attractive proposition. 

Warnings came from the City of London, Britain's financial powerhouse, that the government would need to embrace crypto and stablecoin for the U.K. to become a global player. Domestic financial services firms wrote to the government calling for it to align its regime with the U.S., talking up “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to establish the future rules for digital assets.  

“Securities are getting tokenized,” said one former Treasury official, now working in the private sector. “Bank deposits are getting tokenized. If we don't build a regime that is permissive enough [to make the U.K. attractive], then the City's relevance will diminish as a consequence.” 

For the pro-crypto brigade, the BoE has been the main hurdle in achieving a U.S.-style, free-market stablecoin rulebook. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, whose party is currently leading in the polls, accused Bailey of behaving like a “dinosaur. 

“The Bank's really got itself into a twist on this one. From what I understand from people who have been at the Bank, this is coming from the top,” said the former BoE employee quoted above. 

“Andrew Bailey has made it publicly clear for some many months now that he is sceptical about the two new alternative forms of money, which is stablecoins and central bank digital currencies,” said a financial services firm CEO. 

In recent weeks, however, Bailey and his colleagues have softened their rhetoric as well as indicating a relaxed policy is forthcoming. 

Sarah Breeden, Bailey's deputy governor for financial stability, has repeatedly said any limits on stablecoin will be temporary, and recent reports suggest there will be carve-outs for certain firms. Other BoE officials have also backed away from tougher rules on the assets which must be used to underpin the value of a stablecoin. 

A second former BoE employee, who now works in the fintech industry, said Bailey was “under a huge amount of pressure, from the government and the industry. He is worried about looking like he is just anti-innovation.” 

The BoE declined to comment. The Treasury did not respond to a request for comment.US interest 

A state visit by Trump to the U.K. this fall appeared to help shift the debate.  

In late September, the Trump administration and the British government agreed to explore ways to collaborate on digital asset rules. 

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Reeves announced that financial regulators and officials from the U.S. and U.K. would convene a “Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future.” 

During Trump's visit, Bessent held a financial services roundtable in London with key figures from industry. “There was a steady slate of crypto attendees there, and the discussion predominantly focused on stablecoins,” said the former Treasury official. 

“Rachel Reeves met Scott Bessent and seems to have been told, actually, we'd like you to be much more supportive of … digital assets,” the financial services CEO added.  

The U.K. Treasury has been “pretty proactive” in taking meetings with crypto firms and traditional finance firms interested in crypto, in the New York consulate and British embassy in Washington, added the former Treasury official.  

The BoE too met with the crypto industry and U.S. politicians, with Breeden at the helm of discussions while she was in the U.S. in October for IMF-World Bank meetings, in an effort to better understand U.S. stablecoin rules. 

Last month saw a major olive branch. 

A Bailey-penned op-ed in the Financial Times saw the Bank chief recognize stablecoins' “potential in driving innovation in payments systems both at home and across borders.”  

Going further still, Breeden told a crypto conference just this month that synchronization between the U.S. and the U.K. on stablecoin marks a “fabulous opportunity.” 

She has heavily indicated there will be more than a slight American influence when she announces the proposals on Nov. 10. “It's a fabulous opportunity, to reengineer the financial system with these new technologies,” Breeden told the Nov. 5 crypto conference. 

“I think a lot of people have observed that it was the U.S. crypto firms that really pushed the dial on getting political will, whereas British firms haven't been able to secure that,” the former Treasury official said.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged before the election to put tech giants on the hook for fraud.

The Bank of England has softened its position on proposed new forms of digital money that supporters say could benefit consumers making cross-border payments and reduce processing costs for merchants.

The Bank issued new proposals that should make it easier for authorised firms to issue so-called systemic stablecoins — digital currencies backed by sterling, pegged at a one-to-one rate.

In a departure from its previous position, it said it was now considering a “backstop” arrangement under which it would lend money to issuers of sterling stablecoins if they got into trouble because of financial shocks.

Officials said it would be the only central bank in the world using its lender-of-last-resort status to support stablecoin issuers in times of crisis.

In other changes to its original position on stablecoins, it would now allow issuers to hold as much as 60 per cent of their backing assets in income-generating short-term gilts, rather than sterling deposited with the Bank, and for start-up stablecoins, the figure would initially be raised as high as 95 per cent.

However, it stuck with previous announcements that it favoured curbs on people holding too much in stablecoins. The limit would stay at £20,000 per coin for individuals and £10 million for businesses, with exemptions for large retailers handling large volumes of transactions.

The Bank has previously been accused of being a dinosaur when it comes to innovative stablecoins and falling behind the US, which has engaged in a flurry of rule changes to hasten their arrival. With this move, both the UK and US will set out their regimes in 2026.

• Business live — latest news as it happens

Systemic stablecoins divide opinion, with critics arguing they could destabilise the traditional banking system in the event of a major bank getting into trouble and raise the cost of credit, including for mortgages. 

They have also come under fire for the risk they could rapidly be taken up by organised crime to get round money-laundering rules and help fraudsters.

On the plus side, they could significantly speed up money transfers and bring down the cost, because transactions would take place instantaneously and at any time. They also promise greater functionality, sometimes described as “money with instructions attached”.

The Bank said its new proposals marked a significant step in “preparing for a future where new forms of digital money may be widely used for payments alongside existing ones, offering valuable choice for the public”.

Sarah Breeden, deputy governor for financial stability, said: “Today's proposals mark a pivotal step towards implementing the UK's stablecoin regime next year. Our objective remains to support innovation and build trust in this emerging form of money. We've listened carefully to feedback and amended our proposals.”

The UK's shift marks a widening gap with the Bank for International Settlements, known as the “central bank of central banks”, which has warned that stablecoins are a form of “unsound money with real societal costs”.

The Bank of England now favours what it calls “a multi-money ecosystem” in which traditional cash, bank deposits and stablecoins are equally trusted and seen as interchangeable by business and consumers.

Mainstream payment firms including Western Union and Visa have announced plans for stablecoins in the US in recent weeks.

Charles Kerrigan, a partner at the law firm CMS, described the Bank move as “a huge win for crypto”.

He added: “Nevertheless, the commercial banks will continue to lean hard on the tiller to avoid stablecoins eating their business models, and they are more influential in the UK than any crypto firm is going to be for some time yet.”

Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, who has been campaigning for a more relaxed regime for stablecoins, said: “I was hoping after my meeting with Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, that he would finally get with the times and recognise that stablecoins are now a major part of the modern, 21st century economic system. But no, a £20,000 limit on individual consumer ownership is what he is sticking to. He is keeping the City in the dark ages.”

Separately, the Bank and the Treasury appear to have cooled on plans for a central bank digital currency, dubbed Britcoin.

Oops, something went wrong

The Bank of England has partly softened proposals for ownership restrictions on UK stablecoins as it pushes forwards with new rules for the cryptocurrency.

On Monday, the central bank said it is planning to temporarily impose caps on holdings of stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged directly to traditional assets such as real currency.

The plans indicate that individuals will be limited to owning up to £20,000 in UK stablecoins that are considered systemically important.

It said most businesses would have a limit of up to £10 million.

The Bank of England has been assessing the potential opportunities and risks linked to digital currencies over the past year.

Last month, Governor Andrew Bailey said the UK should “reap the benefits” of stablecoins as part of the country's financial system and said it would be “wrong” to be against them as a matter of principle.

In a new consultation document, the Bank said it is “preparing for a future where new forms of digital money may be widely used for payments alongside existing ones, offering valuable choice for the public”.

It said its proposed limits would include allowing stablecoin issuers to have as much as 60% of the backing assets in short-term government debt.

The Bank said it is also considering central bank liquidity arrangements to “support systemic stablecoin issuers in times of stress”.

Sarah Breeden, deputy governor for Financial Stability at the Bank, said: “Our objective remains to support innovation and build trust in this emerging form of money.

“We've listened carefully to feedback and amended our proposals for achieving this, including on how stablecoin issuers interact with the Bank of England.

“These proposals are fit for a future where stablecoins play a meaningful role in payments, giving the industry the clarity it needs to plan with confidence.”

                            Why SWIFT and Ripple Are Really Competing for Institutional Legitimacy, Not Technology | Credit: Veronica Cestari /CCN

                        


Key Takeaways

The main issue between Ripple and SWIFT lies in a simple question: how global money moves. 

Ripple enables real-time settlements through blockchain-based technology that transfers value between digital wallets across its RippleNet network. This process removes the need for multiple intermediaries and minimizes the capital that banks must hold in pre-funded accounts.

SWIFT, by contrast, coordinates cross-border payments through its global messaging infrastructure used  by more than 11,000 financial institutions and in more than 200 countries and territories. It does not move money directly but sends secure payment instructions through applications that connect participating banks' internal systems.

Their competition is about which one financial institution can rely on to support global finance. 

Ripple introduces transparency and near instant settlement, while SWIFT maintains its strength through regulatory integration, trust, and decades of operational stability.

This article explains how the rivalry extends beyond technology to the deeper questions of credibility, regulatory alignment, and liquidity efficiency, showing why institutional trust continues to shape the future of global payments.

Because SWIFT and Ripple provide fundamentally different services, the question almost answers itself. SWIFT manages the messaging layer that instructs payments between banks, while Ripple handles the actual movement of value across its blockchain network.

They address related parts of the same problem, which raises the question of whether they can work together or must remain competitors.

Both systems are scaling rapidly, but their growth underscores different strengths: SWIFT's reach and compliance depth contrast with Ripple's agility and expanding use of blockchain for liquidity management. This divergence sets the stage for technical convergence under shared standards like ISO 20022.

In 2025, SWIFT also began testing blockchain integrations such as its Linea pilot with ConsenSys, signaling its intent to modernize settlement infrastructure while maintaining regulatory oversight.

In short, SWIFT and Ripple operate in the same ecosystem but from different angles. SWIFT evolves within the established banking framework, while Ripple continues to innovate outside it. Their coexistence may depend on how interoperability between the two systems develops in the years ahead.

As global finance moves toward unified messaging and settlement standards, ISO 20022 has emerged as the shared framework linking traditional payment systems and blockchain networks. 

It creates a structured language for financial data, allowing legacy institutions and new technologies to communicate seamlessly.

This shift is making interoperability between SWIFT and Ripple increasingly practical. SWIFT's migration to ISO 20022 and Ripple's early compliance with the standard establish a foundation where both can operate within the same ecosystem while maintaining their distinct functions.

Some key points are the following:

In short, ISO 20022 acts as the bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based networks. It enables data interoperability, reduces friction in cross-border transactions, and lays the groundwork for a future where SWIFT and Ripple can coexist within a unified payment infrastructure.

Ripple's DLT is technically faster. However, the debate runs deeper than transaction speed. Ripple's distributed-ledger technology enables quick processing, but institutions weigh other factors before adopting a system at scale. As a result, trust and reliability remain the true battleground.

While Ripple challenges traditional inefficiencies, SWIFT's institutional network still defines trust in global finance.

The market is projected  to reach $320.73 billion by 2030, growing at a 7.1% CAGR from 2025, driven by e-commerce and ISO 20022 adoption.

The competition between SWIFT and Ripple is unlikely to produce a single winner. Instead, the future of global payments is heading toward a segmented model where both systems serve different markets and transaction types.

In this hybrid future, SWIFT maintains its role as the backbone of institutional finance, while Ripple grows as a complementary network that addresses liquidity constraints and near-instant payments. 

The dividing line will not be technological capability but rather institutional purpose with both systems coexisting in a global architecture that prioritizes interoperability.

The rivalry between SWIFT and Ripple has become a driver of innovation rather than conflict. SWIFT maintains its position as the backbone of institutional finance, trusted for security, governance, and global reliability. 

Ripple, meanwhile, advances a more agile model powered by distributed-ledger technology, removing the inefficiencies of pre-funded cross-border accounts. 

The adoption of ISO 20022 unites both systems under a single data framework, allowing greater efficiency and communication across networks. Global payments are moving toward collaboration, where legacy infrastructure and blockchain technology work together to create a faster, more transparent, and resilient financial ecosystem.

The Singju Post

The Singju Post

While the crypto market continues to grow and proliferate worldwide, investors, teachers and political analysts have become increasingly interested in comprehending its price dynamics. During speeches and conferences, professionals strive to unwrap crypto volatility's regularities and digital asset dynamics-determining forces.

Cryptocurrency education has transitioned from really niche, specialty online forums to big conferences and scholarly seminars. Experts now devote entire sessions to explaining how market dynamics, human behavior and technology influence value. Understanding crypto prices requires translating technical data into clear, relatable insights that empower your learners to grasp the movement of this rapidly growing asset class.

Whenever you discuss digital assets, you need to start with volatility, the crypto market's heartbeat. Unlike traditional securities that transact in long-tested paradigms, digital coins interact in an environment that is still growing. Their decentralized nature, global 7/24 trade cycle and dynamic regulation ensure that price variations remain more volatile than those of other markets.

With existing Binance data of “over 9,510 cryptocurrencies with a total market cap of $4,215.22,” there is a wide asset scope, increasing volatility due to the uneven liquidity distribution. It's largely concentrated in Bitcoin and Ethereum, with tiny altcoins subject to huge changes from even small transactions.

Educators in the classroom routinely indicate that volatility, although difficult, is not necessarily bad. It is an expression of innovation, investor attitudes and the rate at which new technologies are being implemented internationally. For students, knowing that volatility is just an expression of the growth phase of their market is an important point that breeds patience and a long-view mindset, not alarm.

For the majority of pitches, professionals point to market size and liquidity as the core of price stability. While the cryptocurrency market is significant, it remains smaller than regular currency or stock markets.

When describing this phenomenon, speakers will refer to comparisons with real-world markets. To use an analogy, if you sell a billion dollars' worth of gold, it would barely affect the price of gold. If you place an equivalently-sized trade in cryptocurrency, however, it could swing prices wildly in minutes.

This helps students and audiences understand that liquidity gaps contribute to sharp movements. Professors also refer to the involvement of trading bots and algorithms, wherein volatility in seasons of market strain or swift momentum may increase. Here, the intention is not to shock but to put in perspective. They reveal that such movements result from a dynamic financial system and not signals of volatility.

Cryptocurrency specialists who work in education face challenges. Most notably, converting tech data into ideas that the masses can understand. There is so much technical data in the blockchain space, from market state and total value taken (TVL) to hash rates and token circulations, that converting these digits to narratives enables audiences to perceive trends instead of randomness.

For instance, when presenters discuss 58.5% Bitcoin dominance, they don't read off of numbers, rather, they contextualize it as an expression of faith in the oldest and most established cryptocurrency versus newer, higher-risk substitutes. This framing helps newcomers connect data to meaning, in turn this fosters a deeper understanding of how capital flows through the ecosystem.

By using charts, pictures and comparisons, presenters make the technical aspects of blockchain less mysterious. It's not about simplifying too much, it's about making dynamics in the market accessible and basis in real-world sense. Even professors team up with data visualization designers in order to create live dashboard monitoring the performance and sentiment in real time, conveying abstract economics in living, interactive narrative.

Human psychology is responsible for influencing digital asset behavior in an essential role. When you give educational talks, this often emerges as a focal point, the way excitement, fear and speculation can drive sudden market movements.

Price spikes, for instance, may not necessarily result from technological innovation or institutional uptake. At times, they're ignited by narratives on social media, calls from thought leaders, or viral community trends. On the other hand, sudden drops result from regulatory pronouncements or global confusion.

This interplay of value and emotion itself makes for a feedback loop.Educators encourage audiences to see that while crypto represents cutting-edge technology, it is still subject to human behavior. Grasping market psychology is therefor just as important as comprehending blockchain itself. By revealing the emotional motivators behind data, presenters provide audiences with interpretative tools to gauge volatility more thoughtfully and less frantically.

Educational presenters are increasingly turning to visual instruments (graphs, dashboards and real-time data feeds) in order to render volatility's abstract nature concrete. Platforms that show actual-time price discrepancies enable members of the audience to see markets respond to breaking stories or world events.

Educators show students interactive charts, so they see how Bitcoin's price, for instance, reacts to changes in market sentiment or liquidity. When put in visuals, the lightning-fast changes that characterize crypto trading start to make more sense. Students get to actually see the market's rhythm; its surges, corrections and stabilization.

Such visualization not only facilitates more understanding but also introduces clarity to an otherwise darkly criticized market for its obscurity. For policymaker and student alike, witnessing the data in real-time closes the gap from speculation to insight. It reinforces that beneath the noise, markets move in accordance with recognizable patterns and principles.

Numbers alone do not engage, stories do. That's why effective presenters craft stories from the numbers, converting raw data into commonplace understanding.

For example, instead of just demonstrating that Ethereum is worth $4,488.98 USD, speakers could place it in Ethereum's larger context; from experimental smart contract platform to decentralized finance bedrock. When put in context like that, numbers make sense and audiences connect market value to technological advancements.

These narrative styles make the presentation interesting and memorable. They enable the masses to understand that these digital currencies are not mere numbers in abstraction but manifestations of innovation, experimenting and maturing trust in decentralized economies.

Economists condense blockchain economics to its essence by emphasizing fundamentals of scarcity, utility and network participation. With these three rules, much of the value in digital assets is explained.

When audiences understand that Bitcoin's supply is capped or that Ethereum's demand rises as more applications are built on its network, they begin to see why value fluctuates. Economic principles are familiar, even if technology is not.

Many speakers also cite institutional developments as markers of maturity. As Binance Research notes, “The total crypto market cap lost more than US300B this week, falling to US$3.7T towards the end of the week. Riskier assets like altcoins fell the most, with Ethereum falling over 13% and Solana by 20%. BNB fell only by ~3% while BTC slipped ~6%.” Such data-driven context reinforces to your audience the message that crypto behaves as a real, responsive market, not a speculative bubble detached from fundamentals.

Most effective presenters interactivity gives to the education of cryptocurrency. They ask questions, poll their audience and employ simulations to demonstrate key principles. They induce critical thinking and fill in the gap that separates technical competence from popular understanding.

Live participation also humanizes a subject that may otherwise be abstract. By turning lectures into discussions, educators create a space where curiosity and skepticism can coexist. The outcome is not persuasion, but understanding, a recognition of how innovation, volatility, and global participation intersect in shaping the crypto ecosystem.

Several professionals indicate that demographics of audiences also shift. Presentations once filled with early adopters now see policymakers, designers and entrepreneurs who seek to know how blockchain might transform industries. Such audience diversification highlights crypto's widening application beyond the domain of money.

Another prominent theme in teaching sessions is regulation; an aspect that usually decides the state of crypto on the world map. Speakers discuss the role policies play in forming liquidity, innovation and investor sentiment without touching on political reviews.

Recent  Binance Research has emphasized the fact. “The CFTC's push to evaluate tokenized collateral and stablecoins for derivatives markets highlights a clear regulatory shift toward embracing blockchain-based financial infrastructure. This move could unlock 24/7 liquidity, lower systemic risk and pave the way for broader digital asset adoption.”

Educators use such statements to demonstrate that the conversation around crypto is maturing. Instead of fighting off supervision, the sector is now collaborating with the regulators to develop sustainable regimes. Speakers stress that innovators and the regulators must collaborate in order to earn trust and guaranteed long-term survival for the technology.

The conclusion most educators reach is that volatility, while often misunderstood, is part of the crypto market's growing pains. Volatility is an indication of active feedback, experimenting and constant adjusting. 

By introducing such facts in learning settings, professionals make market volatility less mystifying. They affirm that learning and not speculation, is the path to survival in this age of digital frontier. Ultimately, the end of these presentations isn't to forecast market destinations but to provide understanding. With technology and money more and more connected, it's this type of education that frees up human imagination to look beyond the headlines and get its hands on the models that are defining the future of global value exchange.

bitcoin ripple ethereum ether crypto cryptocurrency aml amlt fraud theft scam coinfirm

For over a century, trusted institutions, including central and commercial banks, have been managing money. They print money, set interest rates, process payments and safeguard savings. As a result, this system has become ingrained in people's daily lives. That's why people go to the bank when they want a loan, to a payment provider when they want to transfer money abroad and to a broker when they want to invest.

However, this reliance on third parties could soon change because the rise of digital assets has opened the door to an alternative. While much of the attention was initially on cryptocurrency prices, people are quickly changing their perspectives about these assets. In fact, you may actually be surprised to learn that, according to Acropolium, over eight in ten top public companies now use blockchain technology to improve their operations.

In the finance sector, things are no different. Data from Cognitive Market Research shows the global blockchain finance market could expand from $22.4 billion in 2025 to $194.015 billion by 2033. This is because infrastructures like decentralized finance (DeFi) are quickly changing how people transact and access their funds.

Another point of interest, according to Projective Group, 78% of businesses intend to invest in real-time payments within the next few years. Modern consumers are fast-paced and do not expect their funds to be delayed. Testlio says providing such frustrating experiences can reduce conversion rates by up to 20%.

Such statistics explain why businesses are welcoming crypto-based technologies. Agreeing with this trend, David Princay, President at Binance Research, says, “We continue to see strong interest in crypto from institutional investors and corporate treasuries (and even from sovereign wealth funds), and naturally their primary interest is in Bitcoin as the most established cryptoasset.”

Crypto-based technologies like DeFi are attractive because they don't require third parties to complete transactions. Remember, these third parties often cause payment delays by lengthening the approval processes. However, since DeFi eliminates all that, it ensures consumers can receive their money in no time.

Mark you: Grand View Research predicts that the global real-time payment market will jump from $17.6 billion to $123.3 billion by 2030. This means the world is shifting to these payment options, and not adjusting could negatively affect your company's competitiveness. This provides good grounds for DeFi's further reception.

The blockchain industry is already working hard to meet the growing need for secure interactions. In a recent statement, Nils Andersen-Röed, the Global Head of FIU at Binance, said, “At Binance, we are committed to fostering a maturing crypto ecosystem where innovation, regulation, and security work hand in hand. Joining the T3+ initiative reflects our dedication to proactive collaboration with industry partners and law enforcement to combat illicit activity in real time.”

The increasing number of stakeholders working hard to improve security makes the crypto space attractive to investors. This partly explains why decentralized finance activities have been increasing. Of course, with the growing number of online attacks, people don't want to transact in an insecure environment. And that's why, for a long time, people have been depositing funds; they trust banks to safeguard them.

But instances like the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank raise the question of whether these traditional systems are really trustworthy. And that's where decentralized finance comes into play. It works by replacing institutional trust with mathematical trust using smart contracts, which are auditable and governed by a transparent code. So, instead of trusting a bank not to misuse your deposits, you trust that a piece of code will execute exactly as written.

Well, that's not to mean DeFi is without risks. Decentralized finance protocols YTD 2025 losses exceed $1.1B, reports theblock.co. The key difference with DeFi is visibility. Unlike traditional finance, where risks are often hidden until it's too late, this technology ensures anyone can inspect the contract logic.

Consider an experience where a farmer in rural Africa can secure a loan without needing any paperwork. Such experiences can really be handy for many people, especially the unbanked. As much as the world has made significant strides in terms of financial inclusion, there is much more work to be done.

A recent World Bank report revealed that ~1.4 billion unbanked (2024 est.). That's a large number for an organization seeking global influence. And only relying on traditional payment options already disqualifies you from effectively targeting this unbanked population.

Thanks to DeFi technology, you can now get ahead of these challenges. All that consumers will need to access your services is a smartphone and a good internet connection. Besides widening your reach, DeFi could help show your commitment to innovation, which may lead to a better brand reputation.

As customer acquisition and retention costs increase, organizations are turning to more efficient technologies to maintain relevance. DeFi, for instance, helps address the growing need for inclusive, fast and secure payments. Given that these needs are non-negotiable, more businesses should welcome decentralized finance, explaining why it will likely be the future of money.

The cryptocurrency market lit up on Sunday, with social media erupting in cheers as users hoped for new bull runs in bitcoin BTC$105,760.87 and tokens like XRP and DOGE fueled by stimulus checks, following President Donald Trump's announcement of a tariff dividend for low-income Americans on Truth Social.

But the reality, as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later clarified, is more complicated.

Bessent explained that the President's tariff dividend might be delivered through the tax cuts from his major economic policy bill earlier this year.

""The $2,000 dividend could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways. It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda — no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security – deductibility on auto loans,"" Bessent told ABC's This Week when asked by Trump's social media post.

These indirect measures, as mentioned by Bessent, may not trigger the same immediate surge in bitcoin, altcoins, or consumer spending as direct stimulus checks typically do. That's because checks provide quick, tangible cash inflows that can rapidly boost demand, while tax cuts tend to distribute benefits more gradually.

It's the case of a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush — the certainty of direct cash inflow generally carries more immediate market impact than the uncertain promise of indirect measures.

Bessent's clarification followed euphoric assumption that the announced dividend would come in the form of stimulus checks, drawing parallels to the COVID-era payments that were closely linked to unprecedented rallies in cryptocurrencies – particularly altcoins.

The narrative lifted market valuations. Bitcoin BTC$105,760.87 rallied from roughly $103,000 to $105,000 on Sunday, extending gains to over $106,500 at one point during Monday's Asian hours.

The leading cryptocurrency has gained 4% in the past 24 hours, with altcoins such as XRP, WLFI, PUMP, UNI, and ZEC rising 8% to 25%, respectively. The CoinDesk 20 Index has gained over 5% to 3,469 points. The rally, however, stalled at around 8:00AM UTC.

It's also worth noting that drawing parallels with 2021 doesn't quite hold up. Back then, inflation was well below the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and interest rates were pinned near zero, both factors encouraging increased risk-taking and market exuberance. Today, rates stand around 4% following recent cuts, and inflation remains at least a full percentage point above the Fed's target.

This raises a crucial question: whether recipients of the tariff dividend—whether through direct payments or indirect measures like tax cuts—will channel those funds into crypto trading or opt to save them instead.

Bitcoin BTC$105,760.87 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) just saw their third-largest weekly outflow on record, even as Wall Street deepens its crypto bets.

More than $1.2 billion exited spot Bitcoin funds last week, joined by $508 million from Ethereum products, while Solana ETFs drew $137 million in new money, according to data curated by SoSoValue.

The outflows came even as bitcoin rebounded 4.4 % in 24 hours to $106,172 and Ethereum gained 7.2 % to $3,617, recovering part of their losses from the U.S. government shutdown and macro uncertainty.

Market observers argue the drawdown in BTC's price reflects position-trimming after one of the strongest inflow streaks since early 2024, rather than outright capitulation.

As CoinDesk previously reported, liquidity indicators such as the SOFR-EFFR spread have tightened sharply from their late-October highs, signaling easing financial conditions. The dollar index's rally has stalled, and borrowing from the Federal Reserve's standing repo facility has dropped to zero. Taken together, these factors support renewed risk-taking in financial markets. 

Wall Street's interest in crypto remains intense. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF continues to lead inflows for the year, while Fidelity and VanEck have expanded their spot product lines. Yet most of that institutional participation still happens off-chain.

As Annabelle Huang of Altius Labs wrote recently in a CoinDesk op-ed, crypto's largest investors continue to buy exposure through ETFs rather than directly on-chain, as they are not yet confident that the infrastructure meets Wall Street standards of reliability, keeping the market's liquidity and transparency potential only partially realized.

In a note to CoinDesk, market maker Enflux wrote the shift reflects a broader evolution in crypto itself, as speculative trading gives way to professional infrastructure and mainstream financial integration.

“When the Fed injects, Bitcoin rallies; when yields twitch, it falls,” the firm said. “The dream of decoupling is gone for now, and what's left of the market will either professionalize or disappear.”

Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies extended gains Monday as traders digested U.S. President Donald Trump's latest economic proposal of a $2,000 “tariff dividend” for every American, funded by import duties.

The plan, unveiled on Truth Social, boosted risk appetite even as some questioned its feasibility and potential inflationary fallout.

“A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,” the post said, adding that those opposed to tariffs are “FOOLS!” The rhetoric arrives as Washington's fiscal debates reheat ahead of 2026 budget talks.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said earlier this year that tariff revenues would be used to pay down the national debt, which now stands near $38 trillion, though Trump's latest comments suggest a populist tilt toward direct cash transfers.

While the proposal is unlikely to materialize without congressional approval, markets read it as a fresh injection of fiscal looseness. The idea of direct household payments, even hypothetical, revived the same risk-on reflex that drove digital assets during the pandemic-era stimulus rounds.

Bitcoin BTC$105,734.71 rose 4.6% over 24 hours to $106,440, while Ether ETH$3,539.43 gained 6.1% to $3,618, data from CoinGecko shows. XRP led majors with an 8.5% daily jump to $2.48, and Solana SOL$167.72 added 6.1% to $167.96.

Overall crypto market capitalization climbed to about $3.5 trillion, with roughly $113 billion in 24-hour volumes in an unusually high figure for Sunday trading.

XRP's market-beating rally came on the heels of Canary Capital's third pre-effective S-1 amendment for its proposed Canary XRP ETF, which would list on Nasdaq under the ticker XRPC.

The trust will hold XRP in custody with Gemini and BitGo, benchmarked to the CoinDesk XRP CCIXber 60m New York Rate.

Whether the “tariff dividend” becomes law or just another campaign talking point, traders appear happy to front-run the liquidity narrative once again.

Why Do Only Some People with Schizophrenia Hear Voices?

New research aims to tease out what exactly is happening in the brains of people with schizophrenia who have auditory hallucinations

By Hannah Seo edited by Lauren J. Young

Hearing imaginary voices is a common but mysterious feature in schizophrenia. Up to 80 percent of people with the disease experience auditory hallucinations—hearing voices or other sounds when there are none. Now new research has gotten us closer to unraveling the brain mechanisms behind this phenomenon.

Experts have long thought auditory hallucinations arise from a person perceiving their inner thoughts or speech as real voices coming from the outside world. When people without schizophrenia speak or prepare to speak, the brain region that plans movements suppresses signals in the auditory cortex. This helps people distinguish their own speech from external sounds. Researchers have thought this mechanism could apply to healthy people's inner speech as well—though that has been difficult to study and verify. Dysfunction in the activity between these brain regions might lead to hearing voices.

In a study published last month in Schizophrenia Bulletin, researchers demonstrated that inner speech indeed suppressed the brain's auditory cortex in adults without schizophrenia. But for people with the condition and similar ones who had auditory hallucinations, inner speech boosted the auditory cortex's response.

“The hard thing with studying inner speech is that it's inherently private,” says Thomas Whitford, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of New South Wales in Australia and co-lead author of the study.

To eavesdrop on that inner speech, Whitford and his team used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity in people with conditions on the schizophrenia spectrum, including participants who heard voices and those who did not (but may have in the past), and participants who didn't have such conditions. The researchers prompted the participants to imagine saying a specific syllable, either “bah” or “bee,” without actually moving their mouth. At the same time, a sound played through headphones worn by the participants that either matched or mismatched the sound they were told to imagine they were speaking. As a control condition, participants were sometimes told not to imagine anything and to simply listen to the sounds with their headphones.

Simultaneously hearing and mentally producing a sound dampened the auditory cortex's response in adults without schizophrenia compared with only listening to it without thinking of saying anything. The effect was strongest when the sound these participants heard on their headphones matched the one they imagined. By contrast, participants with schizophrenia who had auditory hallucinations experienced the opposite effect: when the two sounds matched, their brain response was even stronger. The results for people with schizophrenia who did not currently hear voices were in between the two other groups. Whitford suggests this may be a sign that these participants had the potential to hallucinate.

This paper builds on previous research by neuroscientist Xing Tian of New York University Shanghai and his colleagues. Tian's team has conducted numerous studies on teasing apart mechanisms in the brain's motor and auditory regions, including mapping abnormal signals that could lead to confusion between inner and external sounds.

Whitford and his colleagues' new research helps clarify one possible mechanism for schizophrenia's auditory hallucinations, says Albert Powers, a psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine, who wasn't involved in the study. But further investigation is needed to see whether this pattern of brain activity contributes to all the different sound-based hallucinations people with schizophrenia might experience, he says.

Nevertheless, this research is “really quite clever,” especially because these internal mechanisms are difficult to test experimentally, says Mahesh Menon, a psychologist and co-head of the Schizophrenia Program at the University of British Columbia, who also wasn't involved in the paper. Menon adds that the new findings could be valuable for understanding how similar psychotic symptoms occur.

Powers emphasizes that having auditory hallucinations doesn't always indicate severe schizophrenia and that having a severe case of the condition doesn't necessarily mean that a person will experience hallucinations. Disentangling the various pathways in the brain that could drive these hallucinations may lead to new and novel treatment options, and “this paper helps to get us there,” he says. Whitford hopes his team's EEG test could eventually be used to assess someone's risk of developing psychotic symptoms and hallucinations. That predictive ability, he says, would be the “holy grail” that could help direct people toward early preventive treatment.

Scientists See ‘Eureka' Moments in Mathematicians' Chalkboard Writings

Researchers spot the “tipping point” before mathematicians' moments of discovery

By Matthew Hutson edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

Thomas Fuchs

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

If you want to know when mathematicians are about to have a breakthrough, you don't need to look inside their heads. Just watch their movements at a chalkboard.

“I've always been super intrigued by this tension between how abstract and conceptual mathematics is, on the one hand, and then just how physical the actual activity of mathematics is,” says Tyler Marghetis, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Merced. He wondered whether he could use the “manual labor” of math to deduce what was happening in someone's mind. In a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Marghetis and his co-authors borrowed theoretical tools from other fields to show it's possible.

Complex systems sometimes abruptly change state. It can happen when metals become magnetic, when algae overtake a pond or when a horse goes from a walk to a trot. Often a period of instability precedes the tipping point. Some neuroimaging suggests that such a change also happens in the process of insight—when the brain is stuck in a rut, wobbles and then finds the right track. This study illustrates that process at work.

The researchers recorded six mathematicians at chalkboards as they each spent about 40 minutes working on two math proofs and thinking aloud. Observers made a note each time a solver shifted attention to other parts of the board by writing, erasing or pointing at equations, diagrams, or other inscriptions. In this way, the mathematician and chalkboard together acted as what cognitive scientists would call one extended and semiobservable mind. The researchers also recorded exclamations of insight (“I see!”). By analyzing the data, they found that the places attention shifted to became significantly more unpredictable in the two minutes before a eureka moment. It's unclear where that unpredictability originated: Either a bubbling idea led solvers to connect puzzle pieces across the board, or solvers had grown frustrated and decided to physically forage for new connections, which sparked a solution. Perhaps it was a mixture of both.

“I think it's a fun paper,” says Santa Fe Institute physicist and mathematician Cristopher Moore, who studies complex systems and was not involved in the study. “I only wish it helped me figure out how to have more insights,” he adds with a laugh. He'd like to see the study's statistical approach combined with deep interviews “to build up a rich corpus of what mathematicians were thinking at the time.”

Georgetown University psychologist Shadab Tabatabaeian, the paper's lead author, imagines a “cool application” of their method: someday computer interfaces that track mouse or eye movements might know when not to disturb someone on the brink of a breakthrough or when to toss a new idea their way.

Former NFL quarterback Tom Brady recently announced that he cloned his pet dog. The reveal sparked a discussion around the economics and ethics of the practice.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In 1996, scientists in Scotland introduced the world to the first clone mammal—a sheep named Dolly. The immensity of this scientific achievement was clear—Dolly captured the attention of the world and even earned her creator, developmental biologist Ian Wilmut, a knighthood. But the moment also ushered in a cascade of moral questions. Two decades after this historic event, a majority of Americans remained skeptical of animal cloning, according to Pew Research poll in 2017, and that sentiment still holds in 2025, according to a Gallup poll.

Of course, debating the ethics of cloning sheep is one thing, but what about our beloved furry family members? This question came to a head in 2005, when South Korean researchers finally succeeded in cloning a canine, an Afghan hound. Fast-forward two decades, and the pet cloning business is now in full swing—and due to the laborious cloning process, it almost exclusively caters to the super-rich. Cloning a dog costs an average of $50,000 (though, for you cat lovers out there, felines are 50 percent cheaper). When considering cloning your favorite pooch or, say, buying that much-needed family SUV, most people will opt for the latter. 

Most… but not all.

Earlier this week, Colossal Biosciences—the company that claims to have brought dire wolves back from extinction (a claim that has been hotly debated by scientists)—announced their acquisition of Viagen, one of the leading pet cloning companies. Accompanying the announcement, former NFL quarterback Tom Brady stated that Colossal had cloned his dog, Lua, who died in 2023, to produce his new pooch, Junie. 

“[Colossal] gave my family a second chance with a clone of our beloved dog” Brady said, according to The Guardian. “[I'm] excited how Colossal and Viagen's tech together can help both families losing their beloved pets while helping to save endangered species.”

While Brady isn't the first celebrity to choose the cloning route—Barbara Streisand revealed in 2018 that two of her three dogs (Miss Scarlet and Miss Violet) were cloned from a deceased pet—there are several reasons why critics question the practice of cloning.

The first is simply a numbers game. While cloning or using other forms of synthetic biology to save endangered species is in itself an intense subject of debate (as highlighted by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, or IUCN), dogs are famously not endangered—far from it. More than 300,000 dogs were euthanized in 2024 in the U.S. alone, with some three million dogs entering shelters. 

Because Brady's Junie is similar to Lua in genetics only, they likely won't have identical personalities—in other words, they'll be different dogs. Critics would likely argue that the money required to clone the pup could instead have been used to support existing dogs without homes through donations to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) or a local shelter. 

Even if every existing dog in the world magically had a happy and healthy home, the process of creating these clones comes with some pretty serious implications. When those South Korean researchers created the world's first clone dog in 2005, they required the use of 1,095 eggs and 122 adult dogs before they succeeded. According to a more recent 2022 study that analyzed 1,000 clone dogs, only two percent of cloning attempts produced a living puppy. The methodology has drawn criticism for its reliance on these surrogate animals.

Cloning itself isn't necessarily an inherent evil. For example, scientists have worked tirelessly to clone the critically endangered black-footed ferret in an effort to increase the gene pool and ultimately bring the species back from the brink, and it's an effort that's been largely successful. 

But as Brady himself says, Junie is “not a scientific experiment, but part of our family.” Animal advocates, on the other hand, say that the same cannot be said for the unseen animals that made Junie possible.

Known as near-infrared photothermal therapy, this light-based treatment promises to cause less damage to healthy cells than chemotherapy.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Chemotherapy is our most effective tool at fighting many forms of cancer, but due to its mostly indiscriminate nature, healthy tissues are often caught in the crossfire between these radiative drugs and cancer cells. Scientists have made remarkable progress trying to limit the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy—even looking to the biology of extremophiles like tardigrades for inspiration—while others have investigated ways to fight cancer through different means entirely. 

It's this second strategy that's become the sole focus of one team of researchers at the University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin) and the University of Porto in Portugal. In a new paper published in the journal ACS Nano, the team provides details of a cancer-fighting treatment known as near-infrared photothermal therapy, which relies on light and nanomaterials—specifically, tin-based two-dimensional nanoflakes, or SnOx (Sn is tin on the periodic table)—to essentially serve a fatal dose of heat via lasers to cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched. 

“Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible,” Jean Anne Incorvia, a co-author of the study from UT Austin, said in a press statement. “With the combination of LED light and SnOx nanoflakes, we've developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched.”

According to Wired, the system relies on near-infrared LEDs (NIR-LEDs) that emit light at 810 nanometers, which is the same wavelength that scientists use for photobiomodulation, used to stimulate cellular and healing processes. Once a sample is irradiated, the tiny nanoflakes get to work infiltrating cancerous cells, absorbing light, and transferring that light into heat to eventually destroy the cell. 

Preliminary results when tested with human cells show that the treatment killed up to 92 percent of skin cancer cells and 50 percent of colorectal cancer cells—all while protecting healthy cells in the process. The entire system only costs $530 and can irradiate 24 samples at a time, meaning that near-infrared photothermal therapy could also be an affordable therapeutic option.

“Our ultimate goal is to make this technology available to patients everywhere, especially places where access to specialized equipment is limited, with fewer side effects and lower cost,” Artur Pinto, a co-author of the study from the University of Porto, said in a press statement. “For skin cancers in particular, we envision that one day, treatment could move from the hospital to the patient's home. A portable device could be placed on the skin after surgery to irradiate and destroy any remaining cancer cells, reducing the risk of recurrence.”

The authors admit that there's more work to do. For one, they hope to explore more catalyst materials and improve efficiency while moving this treatment through more clinical trials. Today, cancer remains the second-leading cause of death worldwide, but it looks like a new light-based ally is ready to enter the fight.

Paleolithic tools found at the Namorotukunan site in Kenya suggest that early Homo species kept their technology going even through natural disasters.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The remote Namorotukunan archaeological site in Kenya's Turkana Basin can be punishingly hot and arid, with Lake Turkana offering the only relief for a passing zebra or gazelle. It was not, however, always this parched. Around 2.75 million years ago, the region was once covered by wetlands, which dried up into seemingly endless miles of grassland and desert. And somehow, despite the dramatic changes in climate, human ancestors managed to survive there for hundreds of thousands of years. 

Namorotukunan has revealed more about how our hominin predecessors adapted to sometimes drastic climate shifts in climate. Stone tools found at the site, once inhabited by the Oldowan civilization of Lower Paleolithic Africa, show a period of technological evolution spanning some 300,000 years from 2.75 to 2.4 million years ago (this is one of the rare Oldowan sites over 2.6 million years old). Susana Carvalho—a researcher from the Department of Science at Gorongosa National Park in Sofala, Mozambique—wanted to see how ancient toolmakers weathered the paleoenvironment.

“Detailed knowledge of environmental patterns within this region allows us to explore the interplay between periods of environmental change and the presence of an early Oldowan techno-complex that first evolved in the late Pliocene, and emphasizes temporal continuity throughout the Early Pleistocene, in eastern Africa,” she said in a study recently published in the journal Nature Communications. 

Hominins are thought to have begun making tools over 3 million years ago, and other East African sites have turned up Oldowan artifacts that represent the most ancient systematic tool production system. The oldest evidence of toolmaking shows that percussive technology, meaning the pounding, grinding, or flaking of stone into objects such as spear points and blades. Many of the tools found at Namorotukunan had been flaked to create sharp edges. In the Koobi Fora formation of sedimentary rock, where the Turkana Basin lies, artifacts have been discovered in what were once the beds of paleorivers that intertwined with each other. 

Sometime between 3.6 and 3.4 million years ago, a volcanic eruption reshaped the landscape around Namorotukunan, and a humid floodplain formed in its aftermath. Fossils of palms and sedges from before 2.8 million years ago suggest a high water level in the region. From 2.8 to 2.7 million years ago, paleorivers transformed the landscape as the climate became drier. Wildfires swept across Turkana Basin, leaving behind microcharcoals from the vegetation they burned, while shrubs and grasses replaced plants that needed more water to thrive. 2.2 million years ago, the paleolake that was a precursor to Lake Turkana flooded, receded, and flooded again. Then, the entire expanse gradually went from submerged to nearly desiccated.

Hominins who lived at Namorotukunan persevered in making these tools through all sorts of weather changes and natural disasters. They apparently preferred certain types of rock, such as basalt, and later chalcedony and jasper. These stones fracture consistently, making them easier to work with and showing that these ancient people understood the mechanical properties of rocks to some extent. Morphological features of the tools they manufactured indicate that they had a grasp on some aspects of stone knapping—the craft of striking stones to shape them—which echoes  the level of technological advancement at other early Oldowan sites. 

The levels of rock in which artifacts were found helped give Carvalho and her team an idea as to which time period they were from. Most were found in rock strata made of sands and gravels which have long since fossilized, and while there has been some damage to these tools over the eons, their razor-thin edges were preserved. Also unearthed at the site were animal bones that show butchery marks most likely made by these same tools. 

“As these shifts impacted different parts of Africa separately, it is likely that such selective pressures on tool use impacted different populations at different times,” said Carvalho. “This period of aridification played a role in shaping the ecological context in which the behaviors of our human ancestors evolved.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Fingerprints Vanish from Fired Bullets. Scientists Can Now Identify Them Anyway.","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a69257899/bullet-fingerprints/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:30:00 GMT","

Long thought to be impossible, fingerprinting bullets is now possible thanks to a new electrochemical process that makes hidden ridges visible in seconds.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

In October of 1904, the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department became the first in the nation to create a fingerprint bureau (inspired in part by the policing challenges of the 1904 World's Fair). And in the ensuing 120 years, not only has the crime-fighting technique spread far and wide, but it has improved in both reliability and accuracy, and is now even incorporating artificial intelligence in an attempt to learn more about human fingerprints themselves. 

However, all of that time, scientists haven't cracked arguably the most important problem facing fingerprinting: You can't pull prints off of bullet casings. Because of the intense temperatures, gas, and friction applied to a bullet when fired, biological residue (read: fingerprints) typically doesn't survive the process. If crime scene investigators could somehow lift prints off these littered casings... well, that'd be quite the smoking gun. 

A new study led by scientists at Maynooth University in Ireland might be making impressive headway on that very idea. As reported in the journal Forensic Chemistry, authors Colm McKeever and Eithne Dempsey wrote that a new electrochemical technique can draw chemicals to the surface of the casing when a low voltage is applied, filling tiny gaps between fingerprint ridges almost instantly. 

“Using the burnt material that remains on the surface of the casing as a stencil, we can deposit specific materials in between the gaps, allowing for the visualization,” McKeever said in a press statement. “Currently, the best case of forensic analysis of ammunition casings is to match it to the gun that fired it. But we hope a method like this could match it back to the actual person who loaded the gun.”

The team tested this next-gen fingerprinting technique on brass, as it's the most widely used material for bullet casings (certain aluminum alloys and even steel are used in some cases), and found that this electrochemical process even worked on samples as old as 16 months. But the best part may be that at the heart of this technology is a device known as a potentiostat (which is what controls the voltage), and it can be as small as a mobile phone, meaning that future kits could be compact enough to carry into the field. 

“With this method, we have turned the ammunition casing into an electrode, allowing us to drive chemical reactions at the surface of the casing,” McKeever said in a press statement.

The authors note that this study is only a proof-of-principle first phase in visualizing fingerprints on challenging surfaces. Further work will need to be done to shore up the technique's accuracy before it's exported around the world as a crime-fighting tool (time well spent, considering conventional fingerprinting doesn't exactly have a sterling success record). The team hopes that this process could also be applied to other metallic surfaces, including knives, coins, and other types of firearms. 

For more than a century, bullet casings have only informed law enforcement about the gun used in a crime.  But this new research presents a major possibility that, someday soon, they could provide much more than that.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Vitamin D3 breakthrough halves risk of second heart attack","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251110021043.htm","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:46:57 GMT","

A new study from Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City reports that a personalized vitamin D3 treatment plan for patients who have suffered a heart attack can greatly reduce their chances of another one.

In a large randomized clinical trial, researchers found that managing patients' vitamin D levels through a ""target-to-treat"" approach -- where blood levels were monitored and dosages were adjusted to reach an optimal range -- cut the likelihood of a second heart attack by 50%.

The findings were presented on Nov. 9 at the 2025 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in New Orleans.

Encouraging Early Results from Intermountain Researchers

These results are very encouraging, said Heidi May, PhD, cardiovascular epidemiologist at Intermountain Health and the study's principal investigator. ""We observed no adverse outcomes when giving patients higher doses of vitamin D3 supplementation, and to significantly reduce the risk of another heart attack, which are exciting results,"" said Dr. May. ""We're excited with these results but know we have further work to do to validate these findings.""

According to researchers, the results carry global importance, as between one-half and two-thirds of people worldwide have low levels of vitamin D.

In the past, most individuals received sufficient vitamin D through sunlight exposure. Today, with lifestyle changes and medical advice aimed at reducing skin cancer risk, people spend less time in the sun and must rely more on dietary supplements such as vitamin D3 to maintain healthy levels.

From Observation to Precision Treatment

Low vitamin D levels have long been linked to poor cardiovascular outcomes in observational studies. However, earlier clinical trials that provided standard supplementation doses failed to show measurable reductions in heart disease risk. Intermountain scientists wanted to test a different idea: rather than giving everyone the same dose, what if supplementation was adjusted to reach a specific, healthy vitamin D level?

""Previous studies just gave patients supplementation without regularly checking blood levels of vitamin D to determine what supplementation achieved,"" said Dr. May. ""With more targeted treatment, when we checked exactly how supplementation was working and made adjustments, we found that patients had their risk of another heart attack cut in half.""

Inside the TARGET-D Clinical Trial

The Intermountain study, called the TARGET-D trial, ran from April 2017 to May 2023 and included 630 patients who had suffered a heart attack within a month of enrolling. Participants were followed until March 2025 to monitor cardiovascular outcomes.

Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: one received no vitamin D management, and the other underwent active, targeted vitamin D3 treatment.

The goal for the treatment group was to raise blood vitamin D levels to above 40 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). At the start, 85% of participants had vitamin D3 levels below that threshold (<40 ng/mL).

Dosing, Monitoring, and Results

More than half of the patients receiving targeted therapy required an initial dose of 5,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D3, compared to typical supplement recommendations of 600-800 IU.

Vitamin D blood levels were checked annually for those maintaining healthy levels. Patients with lower levels were tested every three months and had their dosage adjusted until reaching the 40 ng/mL target. Afterward, their levels were monitored once a year.

Researchers tracked major cardiac events (MACE), including heart attacks, strokes, heart failure hospitalizations, or deaths. Out of 630 participants, 107 experienced such events. While there was no significant difference in the overall risk of MACE between the two groups, the chance of having a second heart attack was cut in half among those receiving targeted vitamin D treatment.

Next Steps for Heart and Vitamin D Research

Researchers plan to expand their work with a larger clinical trial to confirm and build upon these findings.

A larger study group will allow us to more fully evaluate whether targeted vitamin D management can reduce not only repeat heart attacks but also other forms of cardiovascular disease, said Dr. May.

The idea that our universe might be nothing more than an elaborate computer simulation has been a favorite theme in science fiction for decades. Yet new research from UBC Okanagan suggests that not only is this concept implausible -- it is mathematically impossible.

Dr. Mir Faizal, an Adjunct Professor at UBC Okanagan's Irving K. Barber Faculty of Science, and his collaborators, Drs. Lawrence M. Krauss, Arshid Shabir, and Francesco Marino, have shown that the underlying fabric of reality operates in a way no computer could ever replicate.

Their study, published in the Journal of Holography Applications in Physics, doesn't just dispute the idea of a simulated universe like The Matrix. It goes further, demonstrating that the cosmos itself is built upon a kind of understanding that lies outside the reach of any algorithm.

The Simulation Hypothesis Meets Mathematics

""It has been suggested that the universe could be simulated. If such a simulation were possible, the simulated universe could itself give rise to life, which in turn might create its own simulation. This recursive possibility makes it seem highly unlikely that our universe is the original one, rather than a simulation nested within another simulation,"" says Dr. Faizal. ""This idea was once thought to lie beyond the reach of scientific inquiry. However, our recent research has demonstrated that it can, in fact, be scientifically addressed.""

The team's findings rest on the evolving understanding of what reality truly is. Physics has moved far beyond Isaac Newton's view of solid objects moving through space. Einstein's theory of relativity replaced that classical model, and quantum mechanics transformed it yet again. Now, at the forefront of theoretical physics, quantum gravity proposes that even space and time are not fundamental elements. Instead, they arise from something deeper -- pure information.

The Hidden Realm Beneath Reality

Physicists describe this informational layer as a ""Platonic realm,"" a mathematical foundation more real than the physical world we perceive. According to the new research, it is from this realm that space and time themselves emerge.

However, the scientists demonstrated that even this information-based structure cannot fully describe reality through computation alone. By applying advanced mathematical principles, including Gödel's incompleteness theorem, they proved that any consistent and complete model of existence requires what they call ""non-algorithmic understanding.""

To grasp this idea, imagine how a computer works -- it follows a set of defined instructions step by step. Yet, some truths exist that cannot be reached by following any sequence of logical operations. These are known as ""Gödelian truths,"" and while they are real, they cannot be proven using computation.

Where Computation Fails

Consider the statement, ""This true statement is not provable."" If it were provable, it would be false, contradicting logic. If it cannot be proven, then it is true, which means any logical system attempting to prove it is incomplete. In either case, computation alone falls short.

""We have demonstrated that it is impossible to describe all aspects of physical reality using a computational theory of quantum gravity,"" says Dr. Faizal. ""Therefore, no physically complete and consistent theory of everything can be derived from computation alone. Rather, it requires a non-algorithmic understanding, which is more fundamental than the computational laws of quantum gravity and therefore more fundamental than spacetime itself.""

Why the Universe Cannot Be Simulated

If the underlying rules of the Platonic realm seem similar to those governing a computer simulation, could that realm itself be simulated? The answer, according to the researchers, is no.

""Drawing on mathematical theorems related to incompleteness and indefinability, we demonstrate that a fully consistent and complete description of reality cannot be achieved through computation alone,"" explains Dr. Faizal. ""It requires non-algorithmic understanding, which by definition is beyond algorithmic computation and therefore cannot be simulated. Hence, this universe cannot be a simulation.""

Co-author Dr. Lawrence M. Krauss notes that the implications of this finding extend deep into the foundations of physics. ""The fundamental laws of physics cannot be contained within space and time, because they generate them. It has long been hoped, however, that a truly fundamental theory of everything could eventually describe all physical phenomena through computations grounded in these laws. Yet we have demonstrated that this is not possible. A complete and consistent description of reality requires something deeper -- a form of understanding known as non-algorithmic understanding.""

Reality Beyond Algorithms

As Dr. Faizal summarizes, ""Any simulation is inherently algorithmic -- it must follow programmed rules. But since the fundamental level of reality is based on non-algorithmic understanding, the universe cannot be, and could never be, a simulation.""

For years, the simulation hypothesis was regarded as untestable, confined to the realms of philosophy and speculative fiction. This new research, however, anchors it firmly in mathematical and physical theory -- delivering what may be the final, definitive answer to one of science's most intriguing questions.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","A hidden breathing problem may be behind chronic fatigue's crushing exhaustion","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/11/251110021041.htm","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 10:49:07 GMT","

Chronic fatigue syndrome leaves many people completely drained of energy and struggling to think clearly, and their symptoms often worsen after mental or physical exertion -- a reaction known as post-exertional malaise. Researchers studying shortness of breath in people with chronic fatigue have now found that these patients are much more likely to experience dysfunctional breathing. This irregular breathing pattern may be linked to dysautonomia, a disorder involving abnormal nerve control of blood vessels and muscles. By focusing treatment on these breathing irregularities, scientists believe it may be possible to ease some of the debilitating symptoms.

""Nearly half of our chronic fatigue subjects had some disorder of breathing -- a totally unappreciated issue, probably involved in making symptoms worse,"" said Dr. Benjamin Natelson of the Icahn School of Medicine, senior author of the study published in Frontiers in Medicine. ""Identifying these abnormalities will lead researchers to new strategies to treat them, with the ultimate goal of reducing symptoms.""

Breathe easy

The study included 57 people diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and 25 healthy individuals of similar age and activity level. All participants completed two days of cardiopulmonary exercise tests. During these sessions, the researchers monitored heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen uptake efficiency, blood oxygen saturation, and how much effort participants used to breathe. They also analyzed breathing rate and patterns to detect signs of hyperventilation and dysfunctional breathing.

Dysfunctional breathing is often seen in asthma patients, but it can develop for many different reasons. Typical features include frequent deep sighs, rapid breathing, forceful exhalation from the abdomen, or chest breathing without proper diaphragm use, which prevents the lungs from fully expanding. It can also involve a lack of coordination between chest and abdominal movements, meaning the muscles that support breathing are no longer working smoothly together.

""While we know the symptoms generated by hyperventilation, we remain unsure what symptoms may be worse with dysfunctional breathing,"" said Dr. Donna Mancini of the Icahn School of Medicine, first author of the study. ""But we are sure patients can have dysfunctional breathing without being aware of it. Dysfunctional breathing can occur in a resting state.""

Catching your breath

Results showed that people with chronic fatigue syndrome took in roughly the same amount of oxygen as the control group -- their peak VO2 max was similar. However, 71% of the chronic fatigue group showed breathing abnormalities, such as hyperventilation, dysfunctional breathing, or both.

Almost half of the chronic fatigue participants breathed irregularly during the tests, compared to only four people in the control group. About one-third of the fatigue patients hyperventilated, while just one person in the control group did. Nine patients had both hyperventilation and dysfunctional breathing, a combination not seen in any of the controls.

Both of these breathing disorders can produce symptoms similar to those of chronic fatigue, including dizziness, difficulty concentrating, shortness of breath, and exhaustion. When both occur together, they can also cause chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, and (unsurprisingly) anxiety. The researchers believe that these breathing problems may worsen the effects of chronic fatigue or even play a direct role in post-exertional malaise.

""Possibly dysautonomia could trigger more rapid and irregular breathing,"" said Mancini. ""It is well known that chronic fatigue syndrome patients often have dysautonomia in the form of orthostatic intolerance, which means you feel worse when upright and not moving. This raises the heart rate and leads to hyperventilation.""

Pulmonary physiotherapy?

These findings suggest that addressing dysfunctional breathing could help relieve some symptoms of chronic fatigue. The researchers plan to continue investigating how dysfunctional breathing and hyperventilation interact. Although more studies are needed before any official treatments are recommended, they already have several promising ideas.

""Breathing exercises via yoga could potentially help, or gentle physical conditioning where breath control is important, as with swimming,"" suggested Natelson. ""Or biofeedback, with assessment of breathing while encouraging gentle continuous breath use. If a patient is hyperventilating, this can be seen by a device that measures exhaled CO2. If this value is low, then the patient can try to reduce the depth of breathing to raise it to more normal values.""

In the 17th century, Christiaan Huygens and Giovanni Cassini focused their telescopes on Saturn and realized its bright bands were not solid features. Instead, they identified immense, separate rings formed from innumerable nested arcs.

Centuries later, NASA's Cassini-Huygens (Cassini) mission pushed that exploration forward. Starting in 2005, it returned striking images that reshaped scientists' understanding of Saturn. Among the most dramatic findings were the towering geysers on the icy moon Enceladus that hurled debris into space and produced a faint sub-ring around the planet.

New Simulations: How Much Ice Escapes Enceladus

Recent supercomputer simulations from the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), built on data from the Cassini spacecraft, refined estimates of how much ice Enceladus loses to space. The results support planning for future robotic exploration and deepen insight into conditions beneath the moon's surface, which could be suitable for life.

""The mass flow rates from Enceladus are between 20 to 40 percent lower than what you find in the scientific literature,"" said Arnaud Mahieux, a senior researcher at the Royal Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy and an affiliate of the UT Austin Department of Aerospace Engineering & Engineering Mechanics.

Modeling the Plumes: DSMC Approach and Progress

Mahieux is the corresponding author of a computational study of Enceladus published August 2025 in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets. In this work, he and collaborators created Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) models to better characterize the structure and behavior of the enormous plumes of water vapor and icy grains expelled from vents at the surface of Enceladus.

The study extends earlier research from 2019 led by Mahieux that first applied DSMC models to deduce the starting conditions for the plumes, including vent size, the ratio of water vapor to ice grains, temperature, and exit speed.

""DSMC simulations are very expensive,"" Mahieux said. ""We used TACC supercomputers back in 2015 to obtain the parameterizations to reduce computation time from 48 hours then to just a few milliseconds now.""

Using these mathematical parameterizations and Cassini's in-situ measurements as it flew through the plumes, the team calculated plume density and velocity for Enceladus's cryovolcanic activity.

""The main finding of our new study is that for 100 cryovolcanic sources, we could constrain the mass flow rates and other parameters that were not derived before, such as the temperature at which the material was exiting. This is a big step forward in understanding what's happening on Enceladus,"" Mahieux said.

A Small World With Powerful Jets

Enceladus spans only 313 miles across, and its weak gravity cannot fully retain the icy jets that erupt from its vents. The DSMC models account for this. Earlier techniques treated the physics and gas dynamics less rigorously than the DSMC method. What Enceladus does is akin to a volcano hurling lava into space -- except the ejecta are plumes of water vapor and ice.

The simulations track gas behavior at the microscopic level as particles move, collide, and exchange energy, much like marbles striking one another. They simulate several millions of molecules on microsecond time steps. The DSMC approach also enables calculations at lower, more realistic pressures than before, with longer travel times between collisions.

David Goldstein, UT Austin professor and study co-author, led development in 2011 of the DSMC code called Planet. TACC provided Goldstein with allocations on the Lonestar6 and Stampede3 systems through The University of Texas Research cyberinfrastructure portal, which supports researchers at all 14 UT system institutions.

""TACC systems have a wonderful architecture that offer a lot of flexibility,"" Mahieux said. ""If we're using the DSMC code on just a laptop, we could only simulate tiny domains. Thanks to TACC, we can simulate from the surface of Enceladus up to 10 kilometers of altitude, where the plumes expand into space.""

Ocean Worlds Beyond the Snow Line

Saturn lies beyond the solar system's ""snow line,"" along with other giant planets that host icy moons, including Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune.

""There is an ocean of liquid water under these 'big balls of ice,'"" Mahieux said. ""These are many other worlds, besides the Earth, which have a liquid ocean. The plumes at Enceladus open a window to the underground conditions.""

What's Next: Missions and the Search for Life

NASA and the European Space Agency are preparing mission concepts to revisit Enceladus that extend beyond brief flybys. Plans include landing on the surface and drilling through the ice to sample the underlying ocean in a search for signs of life beneath miles of ice. By analyzing the plume material, scientists can assess subsurface conditions without penetrating the crust.

""Supercomputers can give us answers to questions we couldn't dream of asking even 10 or 15 years ago,"" Mahieux said. ""We can now get much closer to simulating what nature is doing.""

A research team led by Professor Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. and the University of Tsukuba, has created an innovative cancer treatment that works without relying on the immune system. The new approach uses a unique microbial partnership known as AUN, forming the foundation of an immune-independent bacterial therapy.

The concept of bacterial cancer therapy dates back to 1868, when German physician Busch reported that a cancer patient deliberately infected with bacteria later experienced remission. In 1893, Dr. William Coley further advanced this idea by developing bacterial-based treatments, paving the way for modern immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cell therapies.

While these treatments have transformed cancer care, they share a major drawback: they depend heavily on the immune system. For patients whose immunity is weakened by chemotherapy or radiotherapy, such therapies often fail to work effectively.

AUN: Two Bacteria in Perfect Balance

The newly developed AUN therapy directly overcomes this limitation. It is made up of two naturally occurring bacterial species:

Together, these bacteria act in harmony to destroy cancer cells in both animal and human models. Remarkably, they succeed even when immune function is impaired. AUN has shown strong compatibility with the human body and few side effects, including suppression of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), a potentially dangerous immune reaction.

How AUN Works to Eliminate Tumors

The AUN consortium achieves its tumor-fighting power through a series of coordinated mechanisms:

Harmony Between Opposites

UN-gyo only becomes active and beneficial when paired with A-gyo, serving as a regulator that curbs harmful bacterial activity while increasing their cancer-killing precision. This mutual cooperation embodies the Japanese concept of ""AUN,"" symbolizing balance and harmony between opposites. It is this finely tuned relationship that gives the therapy its exceptional results, achieving what traditional immune-dependent treatments could not.

Toward Clinical Trials and a New Era in Cancer Therapy

""We are preparing to launch a startup to advance this technology and hope to begin clinical trials within six years,"" explained Professor Miyako. ""A new chapter in bacteria-based cancer therapy -- pursued for over 150 years -- is finally beginning.""

This groundbreaking method marks a turning point for cancer patients with weakened immune systems. It offers a long-sought option where conventional immunotherapies fall short, signaling the arrival of truly immune-independent cancer treatment.

The findings have been published in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

The rapidly increasing demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models requires extensive server installation with sustainability implications in terms of the compound energy–water–climate impacts. Here we show that the deployment of AI servers across the United States could generate an annual water footprint ranging from 731 to 1,125 million m3 and additional annual carbon emissions from 24 to 44 Mt CO2-equivalent between 2024 and 2030, depending on the scale of expansion. Other factors, such as industry efficiency initiatives, grid decarbonization rates and the spatial distribution of server locations within the United States, drive deep uncertainties in the estimated water and carbon footprints. We show that the AI server industry is unlikely to meet its net-zero aspirations by 2030 without substantial reliance on highly uncertain carbon offset and water restoration mechanisms. Although best practices may reduce emissions and water footprints by up to 73% and 86%, respectively, their effectiveness is constrained by current energy infrastructure limitations. These findings underscore the urgency of accelerating the energy transition and point to the need for AI companies to harness the clean energy potential of Midwestern states. Coordinating efforts of private actors and regulatory interventions would ensure the competitive and sustainable development of the AI sector.

The accelerating deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) servers is being fuelled by the growing demand for generative AI applications, ignited by milestones such as the release of ChatGPT in 20221. Projections signal even greater impact, exemplified by the recent Blackwell platform, which analysts herald as a new Moore's Law era2. Pronouncements from influential AI industry figures3 on both demand and supply sides are seen as transformative shifts for the entire data-centre industry. Whereas AI has been employed in various fields to advance sustainability4,5, the remarkable energy requirements of AI itself raise concerns regarding not only energy provisioning challenges6 but also water scarcity and climate change issues stemming from the energy–water–climate nexus of AI data centres1,7,8. However, the holistic energy–water–climate implications of AI computing are largely unknown, constrained by untransparent industry reports and limited data.

The climate impact of AI servers will stem primarily from their operations (Scopes 1 and 2)9 and supply-chain activities (Scope 3), including manufacturing and end-of-life treatment10,11. The Scope 2 emissions from indirect energy purchases are expected to constitute a substantial portion and indicate a high dependency on the increase of AI server energy consumption. According to the International Energy Agency12, 0.6% of global total carbon emissions comes from the data centres and data transmission networks due to their electricity consumption. The industry energy consumption could double by 2026, motivated by AI and other sectors13, threatening decarbonization targets under the Paris Agreement14,15, which include a 53% reduction in data-centre emissions by 2030 and net-zero goals for the AI sector. Further, growing AI server energy consumption implies an increasing water footprint through Scope 1 (direct cooling) and Scope 2 (indirect procurement) water use8,16. Centralized installation in water-stressed regions may perturb local water balance and threaten supply for millions17,18.

Previous research has developed bottom-up and top-down methods to assess energy–water–carbon outcomes of servers19,20,21, but these approaches face challenges with the rise of AI servers. Top-down approaches based on activity indices, such as data traffic and computing instances, fail to accurately represent AI-driven workloads22,23. Detailed bottom-up approaches suffer from limited data availability and lack of industry insight7. Assumptions valid for traditional collocation centres often fail for AI data centres, which differ in installation and operation24. Recent studies have explored computing task-based analyses to better quantify AI-related energy and resource consumption, providing insights but lacking systematic policy guidance25,26. Two notable contributions are the 2024 data-centre report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory27 and the 2025 Energy and AI Report by the International Energy Agency28, which present scenarios estimating US and global data-centre energy use under highly uncertain AI growth. Although use of confidential commercial data may limit reproducibility, they offer important benchmarks. Our study extends this foundation by (1) developing an open-source, bottleneck-based modelling approach with comprehensive uncertainty analysis; (2) systematically assessing energy, water and carbon impacts, incorporating dynamic interactions with local energy systems; and (3) proposing actionable mitigation strategies for potential net-zero trajectories across different AI server deployment scenarios.

Here we analyse the combined energy–water–climate impact of operational AI servers in the United States between 2024 and 2030, balancing importance and future uncertainties and addressing a series of fundamental questions. (1) What are the magnitude and spatiotemporal distributions of energy consumption, water footprint and climate impact from AI server deployment? We address this using temporal projection models and regional frameworks, assuming deployment mirrors current large-scale AI data-centre patterns. (2) What are the prospects for near-term net-zero pathways? We evaluate this by analysing best- and worst-case scenarios of key drivers, including industry efficiency improvements, server location distribution and grid decarbonization. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections.

This section provides a base depiction of the AI servers' energy, water, and carbon impacts in the United States, emphasizing the spatiotemporal characteristics of the system. Figure 1a shows the projected cumulative AI server installations in the United States from 2024 to 2030 under five scenarios: low demand, low power, mid-case, high application and high demand. The mid-case serves as the base scenario, while the low and high demand set projection bounds. Low power assumes server efficiency gains, and high application accounts for increased adoption driven by efficiency. Figure 1b illustrates the state-level allocation of AI servers, showing power usage effectiveness (PUE), projected grid carbon intensity (carbon emissions per unit of electricity), water usage effectiveness (WUE) and projected grid water intensity (water footprint per unit of electricity) for each state. Southern states such as Florida exhibit higher PUE and WUE than northern states such as Washington, reflecting climate impacts. Moreover, the grid factors demonstrate notable sensitivity to location, implying the importance of the local grid for the AI servers' environmental impacts. Figure 1c–g shows energy, water and carbon results. Figure 1c illustrates AI server energy predominates over infrastructure energy. Figure 1d indicates indirect water footprint contributes 71% of total, with direct use at 29%. Annual estimates of energy consumption, water footprint and carbon emissions of AI servers from 2024 to 2030 under each scenario are presented in Fig. 1e–g. Even the lowest scenarios outline a considerable increase in the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers. The highest scenario yields the highest environmental impact, largely surpassing previous forecasts for the entire US data-centre market18,29, underscoring the environmental risks of unchecked AI server expansion.

The United States is selected as the research region because of its dominant position in the global AI market. The research period is selected as 2024–2030, generated from a trade-off between importance and uncertainty. Projection of the AI server accumulative capacity in the United States is the initial step, which was generated on the basis of the forecast of AI chip manufacture capacity, AI server specifications and AI server adoption pattern. In addition, we assume the AI data centre will align with current AI company large-scale data-centre allocation ratios, presented in detail in Supplementary Fig. 5. The PUE and WUE values are derived by a hybrid statistical and thermodynamics-based model30. Supplementary Table 3 lists all model inputs, and the applied values are calculated as the average of the best and worst practices. In addition, projected grid factors are calculated on the basis of the Regional Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model31 by involving the projected data-centre load data and adopting regulations such as the Inflation Reduction Act. The step-by-step calculation process of the projection is summarized in Methods and sections 1–4 of Supplementary Information. Important uncertainties, such as PUE and WUE estimation, technology advancements, the spatial distribution of AI server allocation and grid development patterns, and sensitivity analysis of key parameters will be discussed in the following sections.

Over the past decade, efficiency gains in the data-centre industry have stabilized environmental costs despite a doubling of computing instances20. This section examines the existing potential for further improvements through system optimization and technology adoption. Figure 2a,b illustrates the achievable PUE and WUE values of AI data centres in each state. The best-practice scenario suggests notable reduction potential: over 7% PUE reduction and over 85% WUE reduction, despite the high efficiency of AI data centres compared with the industry averages (PUE 1.58, WUE 1.8). The worst-practice scenario underscores the risk of neglecting efficiency efforts. The effects of achievable PUE and WUE values are further depicted in Fig. 2c,d, showcasing the corresponding influences on the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers. PUE reduction yields over 7% reductions in total energy consumption and carbon emissions. WUE reduction efforts result in over a 29% reduction in the total water footprint. Moreover, it is evident that PUE and WUE efforts can align with each other, as observed in WUE improvement results. Figure 2e delves into the potential impact of adopting advanced technologies within AI data centres, focusing on advanced liquid cooling (ALC) and server utilization optimization (SUO) adoption. The results show that the best ALC adoption can reduce about 1.7% of energy consumption, 2.4% of water footprint and 1.6% of carbon emissions of AI servers by 2030. For SUO, the best-case scenario, representing total adoption by 2030, results in a 5.5% reduction in all footprint values, while the worst-case scenario, representing frozen adoption, leads to a 7.3% increase by 2030. The energy–water–carbon impacts of AI servers from 2024 to 2030 following the mid-case scenario through the worst, base and best industry practices are further presented in Fig. 2f–h. The maximum reductions of energy, water and carbon drawn from the existing potential are about 12%, 32% and 11%, respectively. These findings underscore the considerable impact of industry efforts on the environmental cost of AI servers.

Source data

Base values of PUE and WUE are calculated by averaging the best and worst practices due to the lack of cooling specifications. The worst and best values are derived by solving the corresponding optimization problem with constrained operational parameters. Specifically, the best PUE is achieved mainly by extending the free cooling period through input air set-points adjustment and enhancing facility energy efficiency. WUE is improved by reducing windage and concentration water loss, adopting air-side economizers and enabling more free cooling. The model is based on previous works30, with relevant parameters detailed in section 3 of Supplementary Information. The best, base and worst practices for ALC and SUO adoption are developed from existing studies and market reports, with assumptions and calculations outlined in Methods. ALC adoption is evaluated through the increased immersion cooling in AI data centres, while SUO improvements focus on raising the active server ratio. Importantly, the advancement in AI hardware could reduce energy, water and carbon footprints by improving energy efficiency, as seen in Nvidia's future chip structures Blackwell and Rubin. However, these gains may be offset by the rebound effect. The uncertainties of the hardware evolution and market dynamics are discussed in the definition of the scenarios, as detailed in section 1 of Supplementary Information.

The location of data centres critically shapes their environmental impact18,32. This section presents a detailed projection of how AI server spatial distribution may influence the environmental consequences of rapid US expansion. Figure 3a,b presents the top 25%, 50% and 75% locations with the lowest projected water footprint and carbon emissions per unit of server energy. Figure 3c presents the locations with combined lowest water and carbon factors. These allocation strategies are conducted on a grid balancing-area level. Specifically, the ReEDS model is deployed to calculate the grid factors of each balancing area under different projection scenarios. Figure 3d shows that Texas plays a vital role by possessing the most balancing areas with the top 25%, 50% and 75% water and carbon factors. The other western and southern states, including Montana, Louisiana, Idaho and New Mexico, also take a large portion of areas under the combined strategies due to widely leveraged local renewables. West Coast states, such as California, Oregon and Washington, as well as New England states, are suitable for carbon reduction but also lead to higher water footprints. The primary driver behind is the adoption of hydropower, which consumes large volumes of water through evaporation, as detailed in Supplementary Fig. 6. With more hydropower applied in the grid, the Scope 2 water usage of AI servers could dramatically increase when installed in such locations. Figure 3e–g depicts the total energy consumption, water footprint and carbon emissions changes of AI servers under the 25%, 50% and 75% spatial distribution scenarios. The base scenario is applied to all simulations to identify solely the influences of spatial distribution. Installing AI servers in the top water-oriented locations results in large reductions of both water and carbon footprints. Conversely, the carbon-oriented strategies lead to higher water footprints due to the hydropower application on the West Coast and New England states. Moreover, Fig. 3f shows that the water and carbon footprints can be concurrently reduced following a combined allocations strategy.

Source data

To project the potential risks and benefits behind future AI server deployment, Fig. 3h,i illustrates the current water scarcity and renewable energy potential of each state. The top ten states grappling with severe water scarcity issues are California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Washington, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Oregon and Montana, which are concentrated primarily in the western United States. Large adoption of hydropower leads to increased unit energy–water footprint in several states such as Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, exacerbating the water scarcity issue. In addition, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota are identified as the top ten states with abundant renewable energy potentials. Combined with the water- and carbon- oriented strategies, Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota, situated in the Midwestern United States, emerge as optimal candidates for AI server installation, considering both water scarcity concerns and future decarbonization efforts.

This section analyses how future grid development will affect AI server environmental impacts. Figure 4a,b illustrates the modifications of grid carbon and water factors of each state under low renewable energy cost (LRC, best-practice) and high renewable energy cost (HRC, worst-practice) scenarios, compared with the base scenario. These scenarios, extracted from the predefined cases of the ReEDS model31,33, represent the highest and lowest levels of renewable energy penetration, respectively. The resulting total carbon emissions and water footprint of AI servers are depicted in Fig. 4c,d. The HRC scenario indicates a 20% increase in carbon emissions alongside a 2.0% increase in water footprint, while the LRC scenario suggests an over 15% reduction in carbon emissions accompanied by a 2.5% of water footprint reduction. The carbon emissions of AI servers are shown to be heavily influenced by the grid decarbonization pattern, indicating both considerable reduction potential and associated risks.

Source data

Figure 4e details changes in AI server carbon emissions and water footprints by state under LRC and HRC scenarios. The development pattern, including renewable energy penetration levels and sources, notably impacts the resulting footprints of each state. States such as Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Tennessee show marked sensitivity to renewable cost scenarios. In addition, the Pacific states, including California, Oregon and Washington, which achieved a low grid carbon factor, slow their hydropower adoption pace under the LRC scenario, avoiding exacerbating their water scarcity issues with additional AI server installations. The wind and solar resources, which have no water consumption while generating, are further adopted in the LRC scenario to reduce carbon emissions, meanwhile alleviating the severe water scarcity challenges in these states. The presented results suggest that the impacts of grid decarbonization patterns on the environmental costs of AI servers are evident not only over time but also in the spatial variations observed among different US states. These results connect to the importance of ambitious green electricity policies in US states, which potentially could further reduce carbon emissions in our scenarios.

Building on the preceding analysis of environmental costs, efficiency, spatial distribution and grid decarbonization, this section evaluates water and carbon net-zero pathways for US AI servers. Figure 5a presents the pathways from 2024 to 2030 to achieve net-zero carbon emissions and a net-zero water footprint of AI servers under the mid-case scenario. Figure 5b presents residual emissions and water footprints across different scenarios and practices. The 2030 target aligns with major AI data-centre operator goals14,34,35. The top and bottom 25% of locations are used to create the best and worst cases for spatial distribution. The best and worst grid development practices are modelled under LRC and HRC scenarios, respectively. These practices form the upper and lower bounds, although better solutions can be obtained through extra policies and actions beyond current considerations.

a, The contributions of each influential factor to the water footprint and carbon emissions of AI servers with best and worst practices under the mid-case scenario. The total contributions of each factor from 2024 to 2030 are also listed. The curves above the 0 level indicate the increase of carbon emissions and water footprint, while the curves below represent the reductions. The grey area represents the residual footprints that need to be reduced. b, Presentation of the capacity of residual carbon emissions and water footprints to attain net-zero targets under different temporal scenarios for each year spanning from 2024 to 2030, under both best- and worst-practice scenarios. Specifically, the top and bottom 25% of locations are used to create the best and worst cases for spatial distribution. The best grid development practice is modelled under the LRC scenario, and the worst is modelled under the HRC scenario.

Source data

The best and worst distribution patterns of AI server deployment lead to a 49% reduction and a 90% increase in carbon emissions, and a 52% reduction and a 354% increase in water footprints, respectively. Optimistic grid decarbonization provides a further 13% reduction in carbon, while the worst case results in a 23% increase. Industry efficiency efforts are critical for water sustainability, offering over 32% reduction in water footprint under best practices. Notably, combined best practices cut residual emissions and water footprints by 73% and 86%, respectively, indicating a feasible pathway to net zero. Under the mid-case, best industry, spatial and grid scenarios each reduces over 21 Mt, 25 Mt and 92 Mt of carbon from a base of 186 Mt due to AI server installation. The best practices produce about 11 Mt residual carbon emissions by 2030, requiring 28 GW of wind or 43 GW of solar to fully offset36. With over 13 GW of AI company renewables already claimed37, residual emissions could remain manageable with further expansion. However, achieving this best-case scenario could be extremely challenging, particularly due to the facility constraints in deploying AI servers at optimal locations and the difficulty in reaching ideal energy and water efficiency levels within AI data centres. Conversely, the worst practices pose a risk of unachievable net-zero pathways, signifying 71 Mt annual residual carbon emissions and over 5,224 million m3 annual residual water usage by 2030 under the low-demand scenario. Such an environmental cost is nearly impossible to be fully compensated during a short period.

Projected net-zero pathways could be further influenced by other uncertainties. Figure 6 presents a sensitivity analysis of key factors: server lifetime, AI server manufacturing capacity, US allocation ratio, server idle and maximum power ratios, and training/inference distributions. Low, applied and high values of each parameter are listed in the figure; left and right halves present the effects of lower and higher values, respectively. Changes in these factors result in up to 40% variations in energy consumption, which are closely mirrored by corresponding shifts in water footprint and carbon emissions. Unmodelled uncertainties can largely be reflected by modifying these simulation factors. For example, innovations such as DeepSeek can lead to low power requirements for AI computing tasks, which then may result in a rebound effect incorporating more AI applications. This statement may imply larger chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) manufacturing capacity due to expanding applications as well as longer lifetime and smaller training/job ratio due to more inference-based usage. As Fig. 6 indicates, the study's key conclusions could remain robust unless future uncertainties greatly exceed modelled ranges. The modelling approach used in this study enables future revisions with more available data. The sensitivity analysis aims to capture the potential uncertainties inherent to this problem, offering insights into the magnitude of their influence on projection.

Investment in AI servers is accelerating, as seen in projects such as the $500 billion Stargate3. While AI advancement is a key priority, our study highlights its environmental impact. To mitigate these risks, we identify that concentrating AI server deployment in Midwestern states—Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota—is optimal, given their abundant renewables, low water scarcity and favourable projected unit water and carbon intensities. These states possess substantial untapped wind and solar resources, enabling robust green power portfolios and reducing competition with other sectors. Their lower water stress also helps ease public concerns and reduces the need for costly water-saving measures. However, several implementation challenges must be acknowledged. Texas, crucial to the optimal strategy, may need to support an additional 74–178 TWh of AI server demand, possibly exceeding its current total renewable generation of 139 TWh (ref. 38). This scale-up would require substantial investment in new renewable capacity and transmission infrastructure, which is already constrained by existing congestion39. Meanwhile, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota currently host minimal data-centre capacity, indicating that most of their existing internet infrastructure may support only residential or standard industrial applications. This raises potential connectivity and security concerns for high-performance AI services. Enabling AI-grade infrastructure in these regions will require broadband and security upgrades, with associated emissions and capital costs increasing the expense of the optimal strategy. These challenges underscore the complexity of sustainable siting decisions and highlight the need for strategic coordination to ensure that AI investments support both technological leadership and long-term sustainability goals.

Expanding AI servers in the suggested regions may be further obstructed by public health concerns and other impacts on local sustainable development. Operational demands and construction of supporting facilities could generate air and water pollution through fossil fuel use, substantial water consumption and large-scale construction and transportation. To address these issues while managing economic costs, we recommend that AI companies engage in public–private partnerships with local governments. Such partnerships could alleviate governmental budget pressures, create local jobs and mitigate health concerns by funding green power upgrades and monitoring systems, such as tracking PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less) levels, through combined AI investment and regulation. For the governments, implementing tax exemptions on a related facility could incentivize a win–win development process, and it is essential to ensure transparent accountability within public–private partnerships to prevent privatized gains at public cost. Beyond environmental benefits, these measures could stimulate local economic growth, as evidenced in Virginia40. This discussion outlines policy recommendations for both industry and legislative stakeholders that balance economic and environmental impacts. They also emphasize energy market adaptations as AI-driven hyperscale loads challenge utilities‘ ‘duty to serve'. Requirements to connect large data centres could lead to server collocation with energy generation, but as shown in this study, these choices should not crowd out renewable investments to decarbonize the economy. Finally, the effectiveness of the recommended policy may be influenced by broader political and economic factors beyond the scope of this study.

The challenges associated with the optimal spatial distribution of AI servers introduce substantial uncertainties to the projected reductions of 73% and 86% in carbon and water footprints, respectively, under best-practice scenarios. These challenges are unlikely to be offset by improvements in efficiency or decarbonization efforts beyond what has already been considered. Our best-case scenario for industry efficiency approaches the physical limits of AI data centres. Moreover, projections from the US Energy Information Administration offer limited support for additional grid decarbonization compared with the considered best case41. These constraints suggest that, without additional interventions, AI data centres are likely to generate substantial environmental impacts in the coming years. Consequently, AI companies are expected to continue investing in the offset mechanisms, including power purchase agreement, carbon removal and water restoration, reaching an unprecedented level of reliance on them to accomplish their net-zero aspirations by 2030. Nevertheless, severe concerns could be raised regarding the complexity of securing long-term contracts and providing convincing reduction credits9,42, especially bearing in mind the considerable capacity that would be needed. We argue that AI companies should shift to a more transparent approach by closely cooperating with third-party verification groups, service providers and governmental agencies. Such collaboration could reduce uncertainties through better integration of social resources and serve as a model for other electrified sectors.

Emerging high-efficiency technologies in hardware and software, exemplified by DeepSeek43, may fundamentally transform AI server supply and demand. As reflected in the study's five scenarios, these innovations may cause deviations of up to 393 million m3 in water footprints and 20 MtCO2-equivalent in emissions between minimum and maximum impact cases, underscoring the need for tailored managements. While efficiency gains may reduce cost per computing task, they risk a rebound effect, where lower costs increase total application volume. This dynamic, as reflected by the high-application scenario, may amplify total demand and complicate AI's environmental trajectory. To address these uncertainties, we recommend government agencies work with industry to establish real-time monitoring systems, enabling timely alerts and proactive measures before considerable environmental impacts occur. Moreover, the potential increase in total computing jobs poses both challenges and opportunities, calling for ongoing enhancements in energy and water efficiency through system optimization and adoption of strategies such as SUO and ALC to manage the added workload complexity and flexibility. Therefore, we also suggest the data-centre industry establish AI-specific benchmarks for energy, water and carbon performance, which is crucial for continuous operational efficiency gains.

The methodology framework of this study aims to achieve two goals: (1) draft the energy–water–climate impacts of AI servers in the United States from 2024 to 2030 to handle the massive concerns about AI developments, and (2) identify the best and worst practices of each influencing factor to scheme the net-zero pathways for realizing water and climate targets set for 2030. Compared with many previous climate pathway studies, which often extend predictions to 2050 for better integrating climate goals, this study focuses on the period from 2024 to 2030 due to the great uncertainties surrounding the future of AI applications and hardware development. For assessing these uncertainties, scenario-based projections are first constructed to obtain potential capacity-increasing patterns of AI servers. Technology dynamics, such as SUO and ALC adoption, are defined with best, base and worst scenarios, and a similar method is employed to capture the impact of grid decarbonization and spatial distribution. The utilized models and data required during the calculation process are illustrated in the following sections. More details on model assumptions and data generation are provided in sections 1–4 of Supplementary Information.

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the data used in this study. Historical DGX (Nvidia's high-performance AI server line) parameters were sourced from official documentation, and future scenarios were projected on the basis of historical configurations and current industry forecasts. To attain the units of AI servers, we collected the most updated industrial report data for projecting the future manufacturing capacity of CoWoS technology, which is the bottleneck for top-tier AI server production. The data resources of the preceding process have been introduced and validated in section 1 of Supplementary Information. AI server electricity usage was assessed using recent experimental data on maximum power44,45, idle power44,46 and utilization rate46,47,48,49, derived from existing AI server systems. PUE and WUE values for AI data centres across different locations were calculated using operational data from previous studies30,50 and industrial resources51, combined with the collected average climate data for each state52. The allocation ratios of AI servers to each state were determined on the basis of configurations of existing and planned AI data centres, which are collected from reports of major AI companies in the United States, as data resources detailed in section 2 of Supplementary Information. In addition, projections for grid carbon and water factors were derived from the ReEDS model31, using its default scenario data33. All datasets employed in this study are publicly available, with most originating from well-established sources. A key uncertainty lies in estimating the number of manufactured AI server units, as official supply-chain reports remain largely opaque. To maintain transparency and ensure reproducibility, we rely on the best available industry reports rather than commercial sources such as International Data Cooperation data53, which are not granted for open access and would limit future validation despite their potential to provide better estimates. The validations of applied data are further detailed in sections 1 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

The energy consumption of AI servers is projected to be driven predominantly by top-tier models designed for large-scale generative AI computing6,7. This trend is attributed to their substantial power requirements and the increasing number of units being deployed. In this study, we estimate the power capacity of these high-performance AI servers by examining a critical manufacturing bottleneck: the CoWoS process54. This process, which is controlled nearly exclusively by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, serves as a key determinant of the manufacturing capacity for AI servers in recent years55. Our analysis uses forecast data and projection assumptions of the CoWoS process to estimate total production capacity. Other factors are integral to translating this capacity into the power capacity of AI servers: the CoWoS size of AI chips, which determines how many chips can be produced by each wafer; the rated power of future AI servers, which reflects the power demand per unit; and the adoption patterns of AI servers, which dictate the mix of various server types over time. The values of these factors are derived mainly from the DGX systems produced by Nvidia, which is the dominant product for the top-tier AI server markets56.

Considering the influencing factors for the total AI server capacity shipments and existing uncertainties, we generate distinct scenarios as follows:

Mid-case scenario: the CoWoS capacity is projected to slightly increase after 2026, consistent with the growth rate in 2023. Under this scenario, AI servers' rated power is expected to have a linear relationship with the anticipated die size increase while adoption patterns remain aligned with current trajectory.

Low-demand scenario: characterized by lower CoWoS capacity growth and lower AI server rated power compared with the mid-case scenario, this reflects a scenario of lower overall demand for AI servers.

Low-power scenario: maintains the same assumptions as the mid-case scenario but with lower AI server rated power, representing efficiency gains in AI hardware and software development.

High-application scenario: assumes lower AI server rated power alongside high CoWoS capacity, capturing the potential rebound effect where efficiency gains drive increased AI workload deployment.

High-demand scenario: features higher CoWoS capacity expansion, higher AI server rated power and higher adoption of new servers compared with the mid-case scenario, reflecting a scenario of strong AI server demand.

Based on the assumptions and scenarios outlined, the annual projections for top-tier AI server shipments and their average rated power are calculated as follows:

where \({N}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) and \({\bar{P}}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) represent the annually projected shipments and average rated power of the top-tier AI servers. \({R}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) is the ratio of CoWoS capacity allocated to top-tier AI servers and is set as 40% for 2022, 40.7% for 2023, 48.5% for 2024 and 54.3% for 2025, according to industry reports57,58. For years beyond 2025, this ratio is assumed to remain constant at the 2025 value due to a lack of further data. The sensitivity analysis regarding this value is provided in Fig. 6. \({C}_{\mathrm{CoWoS}}\) is the projected CoWoS capacity within each scenario. \({N}_{\mathrm{GPU}}\) is the number of graphic processor units (GPUs) per server and is set as 8, reflecting the configuration of most commonly used AI server systems59. In addition, \({R}_{i}\), \({n}_{i}\) and \({P}_{i}\) represent the projected adoption ratio, units yield per CoWoS wafer and rated power of the ith type of chip at each year, respectively. The details of the projections and related data resources are provided in section 1 of Supplementary Information, Supplementary Figs. 1–4 and Supplementary Table 1.

The applied AI server electricity usage model is a utilization-based approach initially derived from CPU (central processing unit)-dominant servers60 and can be written as the following:

The preceding model assumes the total server power has a linear relationship with the processor utilization rate u. While this relationship has been well validated for CPU machines, its application to GPU utilization is less established except for a few cases61. However, several recent studies have shown a strong correlation between GPU utilization and overall server power consumption when dealing with AI workloads44,46, indicating that GPUs are the dominant contributors to energy use in AI servers45. Although systematic experimental validation specific to GPUs is still limited, the consistency of findings across various case studies supports the assumption that the linear relationship applies here as well. The maximum power \({P}_{\max }\) and idle power \({P}_{\mathrm{idle}}\) are generated on the basis of the recent DGX system experimental results, and their values are set as 23% and 88% of the server rated power, respectively44,46. The sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the uncertainty, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Moreover, the GPU processor utilization \(u\) is calculated as the following:

where \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) represent the average processor utilization of active GPUs and the ratio of active GPUs to total GPUs, respectively. Note that the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) commonly have higher values during training compared with inference62. Specifically, we use currently available AI traces, including Philly trace47, Helios trace46, PAI trace48 and Acme trace49, to determine the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) for training and inference tasks. These traces provide comprehensive analyses on the relationship between GPU utilization rate and job characteristics. Based on the data provided in these works, the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) is set as 50% and 90% for inference and training, respectively. Moreover, the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) values are further determined on the basis of recent experimental studies44. The values are set as 50% and 80% for inference and training, respectively. Therefore, the processor utilization rates for inference and training in this work are set as 25% and 72%, respectively. Following the previous works63,64, our base estimations assume 30% of computing capacity for training and 70% for inference. A detailed sensitivity analysis on the impact of these utilization rate settings is provided in Fig. 6.

This study employs a state-level allocation method to evaluate the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers. To capture the current and future distributions of AI server capacity, we compiled data of current and in-construction large-scale data centres belonging to major purchasers of top-tier AI servers, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, AWS, XAI and Tesla. The analysis incorporates the location, building area and construction year of each data centre to calculate the state-level distribution of server capacity by annually aggregating the total building area for each state. On the basis of our calculations, no major changes in spatial distribution are projected between 2024 and 2030, even with the anticipated addition of new data centres. Therefore, we assume the current spatial distribution will remain constant from 2024 to 2030 to account for uncertainties in directly integrating the projected contributions of in-construction data centres. Further details on the methodology and spatial distribution results are provided in section 2 of Supplementary Information.

For each state, the actual energy consumption can be derived from the server electricity usage and the PUE value of AI data centres. Meanwhile, the water footprint and carbon emissions should be analysed across three scopes. Scope 1 encompasses the on-site water footprint, calculated on the basis of on-site WUE (shortened as WUE in this work) and on-site carbon emissions (typically negligible for data centres18). Scope 2 includes off-site water footprint and carbon emissions, which are contingent on the local grid power supply portfolio. Scope 3, representing embodied water footprint and carbon emissions during facility manufacturing, lies beyond the spatial scope of this study. A regional PUE and WUE model, following the idea in previous research30,50, is applied to estimate the PUE and WUE values of AI data centres in different states. This hybrid model integrates thermodynamics and statistical data to generate estimations on the basis of local climate data. Specifically, we collected the average climate data of each state between 2024 and 2030 from an existing climate model52, which is then employed in calculating the PUE and WUE values of each state. Considering that the specific cooling settings for AI data centres are unknown, the base values are calculated by averaging the worst and best cases. The model parameters are detailed in Supplementary Table 2. Subsequently, the Scope 2 water footprint and carbon emissions are calculated on the basis of the grid water and carbon factors derived from the ReEDS model31. This approach also allows us to incorporate the projected data-centre load data, which can further interact with the grid system through services such as demand response. The validation of the ReEDS model results by using current high-resolution data is presented in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8, and the related discussion is presented in section 4 of Supplementary Information. Optimization and analytical techniques are employed to determine optimal parameters during the simulation to generate the best and worst practices concerning industrial efficiency efforts, spatial distributions and grid decarbonization. Moreover, the water scarcity and remaining renewable energy potential data of each state are computed on the basis of the calculated environmental cost and standard data from previous literature18,65. The preceding calculation process depends mainly on previously established approaches, and its integration into our framework is further discussed in sections 3 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

There are substantial uncertainties inherent in projecting the evolution of AI servers. Our analysis presents a range of scenarios based on current data to evaluate the impacts of data-centre operational efficiency, spatial distribution and grid development. However, several key uncertainties remain an unmodelled field for this work. For a better understanding of our study and to outline future research directions, these uncertainties are categorized as follows:

Model and algorithm innovations: the model and algorithm breakthroughs in the AI industry could fundamentally alter computing requirements.

Supply-chain uncertainties: the complex production process of AI servers may reveal new bottlenecks beyond the current CoWoS technology, leading to varying expansion patterns.

Hardware and facility evolutions: continued improvements in AI computing hardware and data-centre efficiency may substantially affect the environmental impact of these servers.

Out-of-scope factors: there are other major contributors that are out of the scope of this study and would be critical to the process, such as market forces and geopolitical influences.

The impacts of these factors are multifaceted and challenging to model with existing data. For example, while the recent release of DeepSeek has been interpreted as reducing the energy demands of AI servers, it may also trigger a rebound effect by spurring increased AI computing activity, ultimately resulting in higher overall energy, water and carbon footprints43. However, no fresh data have become available to simulate this complex process, based on our best knowledge when drafting. To further assess the influence of unpredictable uncertainties, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on key factors, including manufacturing capacities for AI servers, US allocation ratios, server lifetimes, idle and maximum power ratios and training/inference distributions. As shown in Fig. 6, our findings suggest that the key conclusions of this study are expected to remain robust as long as the impact of future uncertainties does not notable exceed the ranges considered. Given the highly dynamic nature of AI evolution, our modelling approach allows for future revisions as more data become available on potential shifts in industry trends.

Iron deficiency and anaemia affect two billion people globally. Iron fortification can help to treat anaemia, but most current fortificants are limited by low absorption and/or poor sensory properties. Here we introduce oat protein nanofibrils (OatNF) carrying ultrasmall iron nanoparticles that are engineered to carry iron in ferrous or ferric form. In a prospective cross-over stable-isotope absorption trial in young iron-deficient women (n = 52), OatNF reduced with sodium ascorbate carried mainly ferrous iron and showed high fractional absorption with water and with polyphenol-rich food, showing 1.76- and 1.65-fold higher absorption, respectively, compared with ferrous sulfate. When sodium hydroxide was used as the reducing agent, OatNF carried mainly ferric iron, which was also well absorbed and featured good sensory properties in reactive food matrices. OatNF hybrids offer a plant-based strategy for delivering highly bioavailable iron for food fortification.

The worldwide prevalence of anaemia across all age groups is 24.3% (95% uncertainty interval 23.9–24.7), affecting approximately 1.92 billion people1,2,3,4. Dietary iron deficiency is the leading cause of anaemia-related years lived with disability, with a rate of 422.4 years lived with disability (95% uncertainty interval 286.1–612.9) per 100,000 population1. To reduce anaemia, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends use of ferrous iron salts for fortification of most foods5, but most iron fortificants remain poorly effective due to low bioavailability and poor sensory performance2,3,6,7,8,9. Therefore, developing a robust technology capable to deliver highly bioavailable iron in foods without causing negative sensory effects is still highly sought after8,10,11. For example, although the WHO has set a global nutrition target to reduce anaemia prevalence by 50% among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) by 2030 (ref. 12), the global prevalence of anaemia in this group of women remains stubbornly high, at 30% (27–33%)13. Symptoms of anaemia in women include fatigue, weakness, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, pallor and headache8.

The recommended daily iron intake for young women is 18 mg (ref. 14), but this high requirement is most often not met through diet alone. To address this, iron fortification of staple foods is the recommended strategy to increase iron intake among young women5,6. The WHO recommends use of ferrous iron salts for fortification of most foods, with ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) considered the gold standard due to its high bioavailability and low cost5. However, incorporating ferrous iron into many foods is challenging because it typically causes undesirable sensory changes5. Furthermore, iron added to food is often poorly absorbed because of inhibitory compounds, particularly polyphenols and phytic acid6. Low iron absorption from fortificants also results in large amounts of unabsorbed luminal iron that may provoke gut inflammation and dysbiosis15,16. Finally, high amounts of absorbed iron may generate non-transferrin-bound iron, which may be pro-oxidant and toxic. To partially address this, compounds such as sodium iron EDTA (NaFeEDTA) have been developed, offering better absorption compared with ferrous salts when used in food matrices with inhibitory compounds5. In addition, ferrous bisglycinate is an aminochelated iron fortificant with proven efficacy in specific applications such as milk, but the WHO does not recommend it for large-scale food fortification owing to its high cost and sensory issues in foods6. Thus, despite these advances, finding a method to deliver highly bioavailable iron in foods without causing negative sensory effects is still highly sought after, and remains both a major challenge and a key area of research.

Here, we introduce oat protein nanofibrils (OatNF) carrying ultrasmall iron nanoparticles as a promising strategy to provide highly bioavailable iron with enhanced sensory performance in foods and beverages. We show that, when sodium ascorbate (SA) is used as a reducing agent of iron salt precursors in the presence of OatNF, subnanometre nanoparticles of ferrous iron form on the surface of the OatNF (OatNF-SA-Fe), producing hybrids with superior iron delivery features. OatNF exhibited strong iron-binding, reducing and stabilizing properties during the synthesis of OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids, resulting in exceptional ferrous iron stability.

In a prospective cross-over study in iron-deficient Thai women (n = 52), we used erythrocyte incorporation of oral stable iron isotopes17 to quantify the iron absorption and bioavailability from OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids. Each iron compound provided a dose of 4 mg of elemental iron in both the water and meal conditions; this dose was selected as it is representative of typical fortification levels. Absorption from the hybrids was quantified when given with water alone and with a highly inhibitory polyphenol-rich meal, and compared with FeSO4.

The OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids were highly absorbed, with a geometric mean absorption rate of 46.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 38.9–55.0%) when administered with water, 76% higher than absorption from FeSO4, which had an absorption rate of 26.3% (95% CI 21.4–32.4%). Similarly, when administered with a polyphenol-rich meal, the iron absorption from the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids was 65% greater than from FeSO4. We infer that the combination of OatNF and SA (at a 2:1 molar ratio to iron) enhances iron absorption, probably due to their reducing and stabilizing effects, as well as the relatively high content of glutamine in the OatNF. This conclusion is further supported by experiments using NaOH-reduced hybrids (OatNF-NaOH-Fe), which, in contrast to the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids, contain high ferric iron content. These hybrids were also well absorbed and achieved 77% and 75% bioavailability compared with FeSO4 when administered with water and a polyphenol-rich meal, respectively. In addition, the OatNF-Fe hybrids demonstrated excellent organoleptic qualities, showing minimal sensory impact when added to common foods and beverages.

These findings build on our previous research, in which we first proposed the use of nanosized iron as an iron fortification strategy18 and showed that nanosized ferric phosphate is well absorbed in both mice and humans19. Yet, in those studies, iron bioavailability remained lower than that of FeSO4, and, in humans, achieved only 72% relative bioavailability to FeSO4. We also demonstrated the high bioavailability of iron nanoparticle–milk-derived protein nanofibrils in rats20 and confirmed the safety of food amyloid fibrils as nutritional ingredients through in vitro and in vivo assessments21. Although these nanofibril studies were limited to mouse models and used animal-derived proteins, they provide the foundation for the present work, in which iron bioavailability in humans reached 176% relative to FeSO4. Given the above, we believe that the plant-based OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids introduced in this work may offer a breakthrough strategy for effective delivery of highly absorbed iron in fortified foods and beverages and may contribute to the mitigation of iron deficiency and anaemia on a global scale.

The preparation process of the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid is shown in Fig. 1a. Initially, oat globulin (OG), the primary oat protein, was extracted from oat flake powder and then incubated to fabricate OG nanofibrils under acidic conditions (pH 2) and heat treatment22. The colloidal dispersion of OG nanofibril was subsequently mixed with iron chloride and SA, yielding a translucent dispersion of iron–nanofibril (OatNF-SA-Fe) hybrids.

The illustration of monomeric OG is based on UniProt P12615. b, Cryo-electron microscopy images of oat nanofibril and OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids before and after iron nanoparticle synthesis. c, HAADF-STEM image of the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, where the bright dots anchored and necklace-aligned (arrow) along OatNF correspond to the heavier atomic number of iron in the hybrid. d, EDS elemental mapping images of the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids, showing distributions of carbon (C), oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) and the corresponding dark field (DF) HAADF-STEM image. The overlay of the HAADF-STEM image and Fe elemental map confirms the accumulation of iron along the oat nanofibrils.

Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) images (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a) revealed that iron nanoparticles formed and were anchored onto the surface of OG nanofibrils. This iron decoration was more evident using high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). Numerous bright dots are visible along the oat nanofibrils, representing iron particles. These are attributed to atomic number contrast between iron and the amino acid elements in the protein nanofibrils. Given the observed diameter of 4–10 nm for the OatNF, these iron particles were estimated to be at most 1 nm or less in size. This nanoscale size is probably due to ascorbate-mediated iron chelation that prevents iron aggregation into large complexes23. Remarkably, these subnanometre particles aligned along the fibrils (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1b). The presence and distribution of iron on these nanoparticles are further validated by elemental mapping using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Fig. 1c). The overlay of the Fe elemental map and the corresponding HAADF-STEM image demonstrated the iron conformation in these subnanometre particles along the surface of OatNF.

To prove the role of SA–Fe chelation in forming subnanometre iron particles, we conducted a control study by mixing OatNF with FeCl3 and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Cryo-TEM and HAADF-TEM images (Supplementary Fig. 2) showed the formation of iron nanoparticles with sizes in the tens of nanometres, consistent with our previous study24. These particles were significantly larger than those in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, indicating that NaOH-reduced iron tended to aggregate into large complexes before nucleating on the OatNF surface and forming the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also confirmed SA–iron chelation during the formation of iron particles in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid.

The morphological and chemo-physical characterization of the iron complex in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid was carried out to evaluate the conversion rate of Fe(III) into Fe(II). Three complementary methodologies were used to assess this conversion across different length scales.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the chemical state of OatNF-SA-Fe. Figure 2a shows the XPS Fe 2p spectrum of the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid peaking at 710 and 715 eV. Remarkably, the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3c) indicates the absence of Fe–O bonds, associated with iron oxides, iron hydroxides and oxygen ligands. Aside from Na and Cl, no other contamination was found in OatNF-SA-Fe compound (Supplementary Fig. 3a) indicating that iron is primarily present as non-oxide Fe(II) and Fe(III) species. Fitting of the Fe 2p region (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 3c) revealed a remarkably high amount (~91 ± 5%) of bioavailable Fe (II) in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid. This high conversion rate is attributed to the subnanometre iron particles anchored on the OatNF surface that can be easily reduced by protein nanofibrils20. By contrast, the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid showed larger iron complexes on the fibril surface (Supplementary Fig. 2c), and its O 1s spectra (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 3d) indicated a clear Fe–O feature. Fitting of the Fe 2p region (Supplementary Fig. 3d), based on peak constraints25, indicates that approximately 30–40% of the iron is present as Fe(II), with the remaining 60–70% as Fe(III), consistent with our previous study24.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with STEM provides microscale insights into the Fe valence state in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid. The EELS spectrum at Fe L2,3 edges (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 4p) displayed two peaks corresponding to L3 and L2 edges with a line separation of 13.2 eV. The Fe L3 edge exhibited two subpeaks: a main peak at 709 eV and a minor shoulder at 711 eV, corresponding to ferrous and ferric content, respectively26,27. The EELS L3/L2 intensity ratio28 is related to the Fe valence state (Fe3+/∑Fe)26,29, revealing only 11.7% total iron in the ferric state (Fe³⁺). The HAADF-STEM images (Fig. 2d) demonstrated that rich iron complexes were well aligned along the OatNF surface, onfirming specific OatNF–iron chelation that probably facilitates the reduction of subnanometre iron complexes to a high ferrous content.

The iron valence state was further investigated using a bulk colorimetric assay. Dispersions with varying SA-to-Fe ratios (Fig. 2e) appeared yellow when FeCl3 was in excess, mahogany with excess SA due to the formation of large insoluble complexes30 and translucent at an SA-to-Fe ratio of approximately 2:1. We applied colorimetric assay to measure the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio (Supplementary Fig. 4a–e), indicating that extreme SA-to-Fe ratios resulted in low Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios due to SA–Fe chelation or SA depletion. Remarkably, the optimized SA-to-Fe ratio of 2:1 achieved a high Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio of 5.6:1 (85% Fe2+). We further investigated the ferric and ferrous content via colorimetric assay using ferrozine and ammonium thiocyanate (Supplementary Fig. 4f–o), confirming the high ferrous content in OatNF-SA-Fe dispersion.

The synthesis of the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid is illustrated in Fig. 2g. An appropriate SA concentration enables mild SA–iron chelation23 forming subnanometre iron particles that bind to OatNF. The alignment of subnanometre particles (Figs. 1c,d and 2d and Supplementary Fig. 1b) suggests specific iron-binding sites on the OatNF surface. These sites are probably the carboxyl groups of glutamic and aspartic acids31,32, which are abundant in OG (Supplementary Fig. 4q), forming stable tridentate iron complexes32,33. Subsequently these immobilized iron particles are reduced by amino acids on the nanofibril surface, including cysteine, tryptophan and especially tyrosine20, which is abundant in oat protein. Figure 2g also highlights the amyloid-forming fragments (Ala–Val–Try–Val–Phe–Asp) in oat protein, illustrating that aspartic acid facilitates iron binding and tyrosine contributes to iron reduction. This chelation–binding–reduction process achieves a 90% ferric-to-ferrous conversion. Furthermore, OatNF exhibits strong antioxidant activities, effectively stabilizing and preserving bioavailable ferrous complexes. The freeze-dried OatNF-SA-Fe retained a high ferrous content after 1 month of air exposure (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 3e), demonstrating its exceptional long-term stability for practical applications in the iron fortification of foods.

The safety of OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids is supported by extensive literature and recent findings. Hilty et al.18 demonstrated that nanosized iron as a food ingredient is safe, reporting no adverse effects in mice. Baumgartner et al.19 further confirmed its safety and high bioavailability in a clinical trial involving iron-deficient anaemic women.

Iron–protein nanofibril hybrid materials have also been shown to be safe. Shen et al.20 provided strong evidence that iron oxide nanofibril hybrids fully dissolve during digestion, both in vitro and in vivo. Using small-angle neutron scattering with contrast matching, they showed that the iron nanoparticles completely dissolve in the stomach. Histological analysis in mice fed iron nanofibrils revealed no accumulation or uptake of intact nanoparticles—an important finding that indicates these particles do not persist in the body or pose a risk of organ toxicity. Xu et al.21 further demonstrated, through both cell culture and animal models, that protein nanofibrils are biocompatible and do not induce adverse effects. While earlier studies focused on milk- and egg-derived nanofibrils, this study uses OG nanofibrils and iron nanoparticles synthesized via a slightly modified reduction process. To address the impact of these modifications, we conducted an in vitro digestion study using the standardized INFOGEST protocol34 (Supplementary Fig. 5). The results align with previous findings by Xu et al.21 and Shen et al.20 where oat nanofibrils were substantially degraded in the gastric phase due to pepsin hydrolysis and were completely digested during the intestinal phase, as observed by Xu et al.21. The iron nanoparticles, consistent with Shen et al.20, were fully dissolved in the stomach phase, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy. In conclusion, the cumulative evidence from prior studies18,19,20,21, together with new digestion data based on the INFOGEST protocol (Supplementary Fig. 5), supports the safety profile of both OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids.

We next assessed the sensory performance of the OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids compared with several commercial compounds when added to three food and beverage matrices (water, apple juice and cow's milk yogurt 1.1% fat). To quantify their sensory impact, we first measured the colour changes induced by the various iron compounds 2 h after their addition to the three matrices. All compounds were added to the food and beverages at a fortification level of 2.5 mg Fe per 100 g of matrix. As our comparators to the OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe compounds, we chose ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate, the two main iron compounds recommended by the WHO for the iron fortification of foods5. These iron compounds, although highly bioavailable, often cause colour and/or flavour changes in foods. As our ‘negative' comparators, we chose ferric pyrophosphate and ferrous bisglycinate, relatively non-reactive iron compounds used to fortify some foods that are particularly colour sensitive.

The changes in colour are shown in Fig. 3a. When added to apple juice or plain yogurt, all compounds induced colour changes that were either below or only slightly above the method's detection limit. These changes were not visible to the naked eye. In water, by contrast, all compounds except ferric pyrophosphate, a water-insoluble inert compound, produced detectable colour changes. In this matrix, ferrous sulfate induced the most pronounced colour change, followed by OatNF-SA-Fe and ferrous bisglycinate, and then OatNF-NaOH-Fe and ferrous fumarate. The colour changes observed with ferrous sulfate and OatNF-SA-Fe, both soluble forms of iron, are probably due to the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) at neutral pH in the presence of oxygen, leading to the formation of suspended reddish ferric hydroxide. OatNF-NaOH-Fe produced notably better results than ferrous sulfate, OatNF-SA-Fe and ferrous bisglycinate. The colour changes associated with ferrous fumarate and ferrous bisglycinate can be explained by their intrinsic colour and solubility: ferrous bisglycinate, being highly soluble, yields a dark brown-green solution, whereas the poorly soluble ferrous fumarate results in a light-reddish solution. The absence of visible colour changes in apple juice and yogurt can be attributed to the low pH of these matrices (approximately pH 3 for apple juice and 4-4.5 for yogurt), which protects against oxidation, as well as to masking effects from the inherent colour or opacity of the matrices.

a, The colour change impact of OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids compared with four commonly used iron fortificants: ferrous sulfate, ferric pyrophosphate, ferrous fumarate and ferrous bisglycinate after their addition to bottled drinking water, apple juice and plain yogurt, 2 h after mixing. N = 3 replicates. The data are shown as mean values ± s.d. Data were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each matrix, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. b, The sensory performance of OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids in water, apple juice and yogurt compared with various commercial iron fortificants: ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferric pyrophosphate and ferrous bisglycinate.

We then moved to investigate sensory performance of the various compounds by a group of trained panellists. To disentangle the colour change effects from the sensory perception, the study was run under red light except for yogurt, thus masking colour changes. We first attempted to quantitatively evaluate metallic taste as a discriminant on a linear scale, but the results did not show significant differences at the level of 2.5 mg of iron, indicating that the sensory impact of all the various compounds at a fortification level of 2.5 mg iron per serving is not significant when colour changes are made undetectable under red light. We then assessed whether changes (positive or negative) were detectable compared with the reference compound using the R-Index method. The number of panellists was 15 for water and 16 for both apple juice and yogurt. Therefore, the number of comparisons in the pooled data was 30 for water and 32 for apple juice and yogurt. Under the null hypothesis (no difference), the expected R-Index is 50 (random guessing) and the threshold was set so that the probability of observing an R-Index this high (or higher) by chance was < 5% (one-sided, P < 0.05). Thus, for water, the critical value was 61.9; for apple juice and yogurt, the critical value was 61.6.

The results are shown in Fig. 3b. As expected, the R-Index values for ferrous fumarate and ferrous sulfate were consistently higher than cut-off in all three matrices, with the only exception being ferrous sulfate in yogurt. The R-Index values for ferric pyrophosphate and ferrous bisglycinate were lower in all matrices, with ferrous bisglycinate in yogurt approaching the critical R-Index value for a significant difference. The two study compounds showed intermediate results. The OatNF-SA was sensorially noticeable in water and apple juice and was not clearly differentiated from the reference sample in yogurt. The OatNF-NaOH could sensorially be perceived differently from the reference in water but was well masked in both apple juice and yogurt.

We conducted a prospective, cross-over study in young iron-deficient women in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand, a region in Southeast Asia where women are at high risk of iron deficiency anaemia1. To measure iron absorption from the different iron compounds, we used a multiple iron stable isotope technique, allowing each participant to serve as her own control. The method is based on the incorporation of isotopic labels into erythrocytes 2 weeks after oral administration17.

As shown in Fig. 4a, the 37-day study was designed so that each participant received six different dietary conditions. The three iron compounds tested were: (1) 57Fe-labelled OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, (2) 58Fe-labelled OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid and (3) 54Fe-labelled ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) as the reference compound. Each dose contained 4 mg of elemental iron, and all compounds were intrinsically labelled with stable isotopes during synthesis. The compounds were administered either in water or, to provide a polyphenol-rich inhibitory food matrix, mixed into açai puree with honey (Fig. 4b,c). The primary outcome was fractional iron absorption (FIA), and the prespecified comparisons were both hybrids versus FeSO4 in each of the two matrices.

During the screening phase, women aged 18–45 years with serum ferritin (SF) concentrations <50 µg l−1 (n = 52) were recruited. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Methods. The baseline characteristics of the participants are presented in Supplementary Table 1. Eligible participants received the three iron compounds with water on study days 1, 3 and 5. After a 14-day period to allow the iron isotopes to incorporate into erythrocytes, we collected venous blood samples to assess iron absorption from the first three conditions. Participants then received a second round of conditions, with the three iron compounds administered mixed into polyphenol-rich açai puree with honey on study days 19, 21 and 23. The order of the conditions was randomized for each participant for each block using a Python script. The sequences were generated so that each isotope was used only once in each block. Assignment was not masked. After another 14 days, we again collected venous blood samples to measure iron absorption from the final three conditions. In total, 312 measures of iron absorption were conducted across the 52 participants.

Figure 4d shows iron absorption from the three compounds in water. Geometric mean FIA from FeSO4 was 26.3% (95% CI 21.4–32.4%). The OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid was remarkably better absorbed than FeSO4, exhibiting a high FIA of 46.2% (95% CI 38.9–55.0%). Notably, iron from the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid was 76% better absorbed (that is, 1.76 times) than iron from FeSO4, which is fully water soluble and considered the reference compound for iron absorption. This finding may be due to the very large specific surface area of the subnanometre-sized ferrous iron in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, which enables rapid dissolution at gastric and duodenal pH during digestion, allowing greater uptake by the divalent metal transporter (DMT)-1 (ref. 18). In addition, the SA (at a 2:1 molar ratio to iron) probably enhances iron absorption, due to its reducing effect35. The OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid showed a geometric mean FIA of 20.3% (16.1–25.7%). This corresponds to 77% relative bioavailability compared with FeSO4 (that is, 0.77 times) which is considered a moderate-to-high iron bioavailability value for potential iron fortificants5. In contrast to the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, up to 60% of the iron in the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid is in the ferric form (Supplementary Fig. 3d), and this includes very poorly water-soluble iron hydroxide and iron oxides, which typically exhibit absorption rates of <5% relative to FeSO4(ref. 5). The high absorption of the subnanometre-sized ferric iron in the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid is also probably due to its very large specific surface area enabling rapid dissolution at low gastric pH, as previously demonstrated for non-hybrid subnanometre-sized iron oxides and phosphates18. Finally, the presence of OatNF may have contributed to the high FIA of both hybrids due to the high glutamine content in oat protein, accounting for up to 13% of the amino acid content (Supplementary Fig. 4q). Glutamine has previously been shown to enhance iron absorption in vivo36.

Dietary polyphenols strongly inhibit iron absorption by forming unabsorbable complexes with iron in the gut lumen37,38. Previous studies have reported reductions in iron absorption from foods and supplements due to polyphenols ranging from 40% to 90% (refs. 37,38,39,40,41). Our findings agree with these studies: the polyphenol-rich açai puree meal reduced iron absorption (Fig. 4e) from the three iron compounds by approximately 70% compared with the water condition. However, absorption from the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids remained high at 13.4% (95% CI 9.8–18.3%), which was 65% higher than absorption from FeSO4, which was 8.1% (95% CI 6.1–10.6%). The higher absorption from the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids may be partly attributed to the presence of SA in the hybrids, as ascorbic acid is known to reduce the inhibitory effects of polyphenols on iron absorption42. This suggests that the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid remains highly bioavailable even when incorporated into polyphenol-rich foods, underscoring its potential as an effective iron fortificant. Figure 4f and Supplementary Fig. 5 show the relative bioavailability of OatNF-SA-Fe, OatNF-NaOH-Fe and FeSO4 when administered with water and with açai puree, normalized for each individual participant.

We introduce in this work a previously unexplored protein–iron nanoparticle hybrid system based on OatNF carrying ultrasmall iron nanoparticles. The synthesis can be tailored to produce either ferrous or ferric iron nanoparticles, depending on the choice of reducing agent used. When using SA, OatNF carries stabilized ferrous iron that is remarkably well absorbed in humans, with a mean fractional absorption of 46% in water—76% higher bioavailability compared with FeSO4, the reference compound. When using NaOH, OatNF carry mainly ferric iron, which is still well absorbed and shows superior sensory performance in reactive food matrices. Based on these results, we interpret the main role of oat nanofibrils to be the stabilization of Fe(II) in the formulation. The OatNF-NaOH-Fe control is particularly informative: by renormalizing the clinical iron absorption in Fig. 4a to the total Fe(II) present at the start, we find absorption efficiencies of 26.3% (54Fe), ~51% (57Fe) and ~58% (58Fe). This clearly demonstrates that protein nanofibrils effectively preserve Fe(II), independent of its starting concentration. By contrast, the primary function of SA appears to be enhancing the initial Fe(II) content, rather than affecting its preservation or absorption directly. Nonetheless, both ascorbate reduction of ferric iron in the gut lumen and increased enterocyte ascorbate43 may further contribute to the high bioavailability observed for OatNF-SA-Fe.

OatNF exhibit several key advantages as an iron delivery platform for human nutrition: (1) This oat-based formulation is suitable for all populations, even those with plant-based diets, which typically have both inadequate iron intake and low bioavailability44,45. (2) OatNF provide efficient binding sites for subnanometre iron particles. This binding and alignment is probably due to the intrinsic protein affinity to form supramolecular complexes46,47. Our results clearly demonstrate that the exceptional bioavailability of iron observed in the OatNF-SA diet is due to the role of protein nanofibrils. Indeed, as evident from the analysis in both solid and dispersion by XPS and colorimetric assays, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Figs. 4i,n), the initial amount of Fe(II) in the oat hybrids and iron sulfate is essentially identical. Therefore, the superior iron bioavailability observed for OatNF-SA hybrids can only be attributed to the differing fate of Fe(II) during digestion and absorption. (3) OatNF contain abundant reducing amino acids20 and a high content of antioxidant peptides48,49 that are capable of stabilizing subnanometre ferrous iron nanoparticles in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids even during long storage (Fig. 2h). (4) the presence of OatNF nanofibrils maintains iron in a colloidally stable state, preventing aggregation and preserving bioavailability. (5) Because of their high solubility in water, acceptable organoleptic sensory features and pleasant oat flavour and aroma, OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids may be efficient iron fortificants for a wide variety of beverage and food matrices.

The digestion and absorptive pathway of OatNF hybrids remains uncertain. Based on our INFOGEST experiment results, both oat nanofibril formulations underwent substantial degradation during gastric digestion due to pepsin hydrolysis, followed by complete digestion during the intestinal phase. We thus hypothesize that the iron released from the digested protein fibrils—whether in ferric or ferrous form—primarily enters the common non-haem iron pool in the stomach and duodenum. Ferric iron is then probably reduced by duodenal cytochrome b (DcytB), a ferric reductase located on the apical surface of enterocytes, or by ascorbic acid in the case of the OatNF-SA-Fe formulation6. The resulting ferrous iron is probably absorbed through the conventional divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) pathway, along with any iron already present in the ferrous form. Given the complete digestion and dissolution observed in the INFOGEST experiment, and consistent with previous work by Shen et al.20, it is unlikely that intact OatNF hybrids are taken up via endocytosis, although we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that trace amounts may be absorbed this way. It is also possible—although less likely—that a small portion of iron remains bound to amino acids or peptide fragments after digestion rather than fully solubilizing. These iron–amino acid complexes, similar to aminochelated iron, could be absorbed through an alternative pathway50. However, this pathway remains speculative. For example, a study using DMT1-knockout Caco-2 cells51 found no iron uptake from ferrous bisglycinate, casting doubt on the physiological relevance of this mechanism.

In summary, we developed a food-grade oat protein nanofibril-based iron compound for beverage and food fortification that delivers iron with exceptionally high bioavailability. This study demonstrates the potential of protein–iron nanoparticle hybrid systems for effective iron absorption in humans. In iron-deficient women, a key target group for iron fortification, the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid demonstrated exceptional FIA. The geometric mean absorption was 46.2% when administered with water and 13.4% when given with a polyphenol-rich food matrix, achieving very high values of bioavailability corresponding to 176% and 165% those of FeSO4. Moreover, the OatNF hybrids exhibited sensory performance equal to or better than FeSO4 in fortified foods and beverages. These results make OatNF hybrids an innovative and highly effective approach to iron delivery in nutritional applications, which could contribute to reducing the global burden of iron deficiency and anaemia.

The following materials were used: oat flour (Hafermehl grob, SWISSMILL), n-hexane (LiChrosolv, CAS-No: 110-54-3, Merck KGaA), NaOH (BioXtra, ≥98%, pellets, CAS-No: 1310-73-2, Sigma-Aldrich), NaCl (≥99.5%, CAS-No: 7647-14-5, Sigma-Aldrich), extracted oat protein, HCl (1.09057, CAS-No: 7647-01-0, Sigma-Aldrich, Reagent European Pharmacopoeia Standard), FeCl3, SA (Sigma-Aldrich 134-03-2; Reagent European Pharmacopoeia Standard), NaOH (1.09137, CAS-No: 1310-73-2, Sigma-Aldrich, Reagent European Pharmacopoeia Standard), hydrogen peroxide 30% (1.07298, CAS-No: 7722-84-1, Sigma-Aldrich, Suprapur) and 54Fe-, 57Fe- and 58Fe-enriched elemental iron powders (Chemgas). All reagents were of European Pharmacopoeia reagent grade. All steps were carried out with food-grade equipment in the pilot plant/food laboratory under food-grade conditions.

The oat protein extraction followed our previous protocol22. We also improved the protocol to enhance the yield while maintaining the same nanofibril quality. In brief, oat flour was defatted with n-hexane (1:3 w/v) three times for 1 h, centrifuged at 5,000g for 15 min and air-dried for 24 h. The defatted powder was then dispersed in 1 M NaCl pH 10 (1:10 w/v) and gently stirred for 2 h at 20 °C before centrifugation (7,000g, 15 min, 20 °C). The protein-rich supernatant was diluted with Milli-Q water (1:6.66 v/v) and left 12 h at 4 °C without agitation to precipitate the dissolved OGs. After centrifugation (7,000g, 15 min, 20 °C), the pellet was resuspended in Milli-Q water and dialysed (molecular weight cut-off: 6–8 kDa, Spectra/Por RC membrane, Spectrum Laboratories) against Milli-Q water for 24 h to remove the salt. The dialysed sample was collected, frozen and subsequently freeze-dried to obtain the OG powder.

To fabricate OG nanofibril, extracted OG was first dissolved in Milli-Q water (pH 2) at 2 wt%. After stirring 5 min in ambient conditions, the solution pH was readjusted to pH 2. The dissolved protein solution was then incubated at 90 °C in an oil/water bath for 18 h while stirring at 350 rpm.

For OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, the freshly prepared OG nanofibril solution (2 wt%) was first mixed with MQ water and FeCl3 solution (0.3 M). Then, the freshly dissolved SA (3 M) was added drop by drop, followed by a gentle mixing of the dispersion. The final dispersion reached FeCl3 at 100 mM and SA at 200 mM. For samples for clinical studies, the iron concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Dispersion with 4 mg iron was loaded in each Eppendorf and freeze-dried. The Eppendorf was then filled with N2, which was subsequently replaced with argon before shipping for clinical studies.

For the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid, the freshly prepared OG nanofibril solution (2 wt%) was first mixed with MQ water and FeCl3 solution (0.3 M) and vortexed for 30 s. The dispersion was then carefully adjusted to pH 7 by adding NaOH (7.5 M) droplet by droplet. The final dispersion contained FeCl3 at 100 mM. For samples for clinical studies, the iron concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Dispersion with 4 mg iron was loaded in each Eppendorf, frozen and stored with dry ice before shipping for clinical studies.

In clinical study, FeCl3 solutions were prepared by dissolution of 57Fe and 58Fe elemental powders in stochiometric amounts of 6 M HCl, followed by oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) with equimolar amounts of 30% hydrogen peroxide.

For STEM imaging and analytical analyses, an aliquot of samples (5 μl) was deposited on 2-nm carbon-coated lacey grids (Quantifoil, D) pretreated by glow discharge (Pelco easyGlow) for 2 min to ensure the optimal material distribution. The excess fluid was removed with filter paper, and the grids were washed three times with distilled water and air-dried.

The ambient temperature STEM measurements were performed using TFS Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and JEOL JEM-F200 (JEOL) instruments both operated at 200 kV and a double Cs-corrected JEOL JEM-ARM300F GrandARM ‘Vortex' (JEOL) instrument operated at 300 kV. All instruments equipped with cold-emission FEG sources were used in a scanning TEM mode. For imaging, the HAADF and circular bright-field detectors were used on all three instruments. A STEM probe with a diameter of approximately 0.25 nm was used (condenser aperture 70 μm, convergence angle 10.5 mrad). STEM illumination and acquisition parameters were chosen such that the low-angle annular dark field STEM and circular bright-field STEM detectors yielded the diffraction contrast information, whereas the HAADF-STEM detector provided the prominent atomic number contrast from the same probe position.

The materials elemental content and its distribution in the specimens were assessed by EDS measurements using TFS Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with the SuperX EDS module using the Esprit I package for the evaluation and analyses of spectrum images. The corresponding STEM probe size was set to about 0.25 nm (convergence angle 10.5 mrad, condenser aperture 70 mm), providing the high-resolution imaging and simultaneously yielding sufficient electron probe current for high X-ray count rates. The EDS STEM elemental maps were produced and evaluated using the Esprit I software of the module.

The hybridization states of Fe in the compounds were assessed using EELS modules of both JEOL instruments GrandARM (JEOL) and JEM-F200 (JEOL). The GIF Quantum ER EELS spectrometer on the GrandARM and the Gatan Continuum S EELS spectrometer on the JEM-F200 enabled acquisition of EEL spectra in dual EELS mode. The studies were carried out using 5–7 mA of the emission current and energy dispersion of 0.15 eV per channel to include both, O-K and Fe-L23 edges in the spectra.

Cryo-TEM samples were prepared in a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 22 °C and 100 % humidity. Three microlitres of sample were added on hydrophylized lacey carbon-coated copper grids (EMS), and the grids were plunge frozen into a mixture of liquid ethane and propane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The vitrified grids were clipped into AutoGrid sample carriers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for automated loading.

The sample morphology was verified using cryo-TEM to assess potential electron-beam-induced material damage. The data acquisition was carried out on a TFS Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV of acceleration voltage and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS Energy Filter (GIF) and a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector (Ametek Pleasanton). The imaging of the vitrified materials on a cryo-stage constantly kept at 80 K was performed in an energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) operation mode using the TFS EPU software and K2 camera in a linear mode.

XPS measurement was performed in a PHI Quantera system. Dried samples were pressed into In foil before measurement and measured at a pressure of 10−9–10−8 torr. The monochromatic Al Kα radiation was generated from an electron beam (24.8 W) with a 100 μm spot size. Charge neutralization was performed using a low-energy electron source. Peak fitting of photoelectron features was performed in Casa XPS using Voigt profiles with GL ratios of 40 following Tougaard background subtraction for the Fe 2p region and Shirley background subtraction for all other cases. For Fe 2p fitting, we used the approach described by A. P. Grosvenor et al. to constrain the relative peak positions25. Relative peak areas between main and satellite peaks were fixed between each analysed Fe 2pspectrum. Furthermore, the full width at half maximum was fixed to be identical between each main peak and its corresponding satellite peak. Binding energy was referenced to the single N 1s feature located at 499.7 eV, based on literature values for amide bonds52, using this peak as the internal charge reference.

Colour change measurements were performed by adding amounts of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, ferric pyrophosphate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous bisglycinate (all food grade, obtained from Dr. Paul Lohmann, Emmerthal, Germany), OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids, containing 2.5 mg of Fe to either 100 ml of bottled water and apple juice or 100 g of plain yogurt 1.1% fat. All products were from the M-Budget line and were purchased at the Migros supermarket chain, Zurich, Switzerland. All fortified beverages and foods were prepared in triplicate.

Colour change was measured after 2 h of standing at room temperature and compared with beverages or foods without added iron compounds. Absolute colour change (ΔE*ab) was determined using a spectral photometer (Chroma Meter CR-410, Konica-Minolta) in the Hunter Lab colour system, calculated as follows:

where ΔL* (lightness), Δa* and Δb* (chromaticity coordinates) correspond to the difference between the sample (with added compound) and the not fortified matrix.

The SPSS statistical programming environment (IBM SPSS Software, Version 28) and Microsoft Office EXCEL 2016 (Microsoft) were used for the data analysis. Comparisons were done using two-sided paired t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The participants were recruited from among the staff and students of the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Sixteen participants, with an average age of 25.9 years (median age 24), volunteered to participate in the study. By signing a consent form, they confirmed that they had no food allergies or intolerances and would follow the tasting protocol during all sessions. The study was approved by the ETH Zurich ethics committee (25 ETHICS-166).

All samples were prepared hygienically on the morning of the tasting sessions. Commercial samples of bottled still water, cow's milk yogurt 1.1% fat and regular apple juice, all from the M-Budget line (Migros supermarket, Zurich, Switzerland), were used as matrices to test the sensory impact of different iron compounds. Four food-grade commercial iron compounds (ferrous sulfate, ferric pyrophosphate, ferrous bisglycinate and ferrous fumarate, all obtained from Dr. Paul Lohmann, Emmerthal, Germany) and the two comparators (OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe) were mixed at a concentration of 2.5 mg Fe per 100 g in a 100-g matrix. Two centilitres of the mixed samples were transferred to 4-cl cups. Ferrous fumarate and ferric pyrophosphate were insoluble in water and apple juice; OatNF-NaOH-Fe was only partially soluble. Therefore, all liquids had to be stirred by the panellists before tasting and were served at room temperature under red light to avoid colour bias. The yogurt samples were stored at 4 °C until the tasting session and were served with small spoons. All cups were labelled with three-digit codes, and the samples were presented to the panellists in a balanced design. The testing room temperature was about 22 °C.

All participants attended a training session. This included an introduction to the tasting protocol and familiarization with different matrices containing a selection of iron compounds, as well as the evaluation methods. Iron sulfate was considered a standard compound because it is used as a reference in sensory training (ISO 8586 (ref. 53)). Panellists were instructed to take a sip, evaluate the sample and spit it out again, followed by neutralizing their palate with water and crackers. Liquid samples had to be stirred. The yogurt samples were served with small spoons. The training block included a descriptive task to get a consensus on the attribute metallic as well as a ranking test. The panellists ranked four samples with increasing concentrations of iron sulfate in water (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg per 100 ml water), using the attribute ‘metallic'. The panellists were given feedback about their performance and were allowed to retaste the samples. The same concentrations were rated on a 100-unit line scale with respect to the metallic attribute, including selected compounds. For data collection, the concentration was restricted to 2.5 mg Fe per 100 g of matrix. Based on the pretests and training results, multiple difference testing was decided upon, as differences with only 2.5 mg of iron were found to be minimal and difficult to be rated on line scales. All six compounds were tested in their respective matrices and presented in blocks of seven samples. The bland matrix was presented as a reference. Panellists had to evaluate whether a sample was the same as the reference and whether they were confident in their decision (four levels: R sure, R unsure, not R unsure and not R sure). The panellists tested all samples in duplicate, including the reference, for a total of 14 samples per matrix. The tastings were conducted on two consecutive days. Results were pooled, and the R-Index was calculated54. The tables of Bi and O'Mahony55 were used to test for significance (P = 0.05, one-sided).

The study was a single-centre, prospective cross-over stable isotope trial, conducted at the Institute of Nutrition of Mahidol University, in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. The study protocol is available from the Mahidol University Central Institutional Review Board (MU-CIRB), the study investigators, and online at ClinicalTrials.gov (ID no. NCT05826899). All participants provided written informed consent before any study procedure took place.

The study was conducted in Thailand, and the female participants (n = 52) were recruited among students and staff of Mahidol University in the Bangkok metropolitan area. To minimize biological and environmental confounding of FIA, we enrolled non-pregnant, non-lactating women aged 18–45 years with SF <50 µg l−1 and haemoglobin (Hb) ≥12 g dl−1, and excluded participants with inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) >5 mg l−1), thalassaemia, recent blood loss/transfusion, chronic disease, tobacco use, recent antibiotic or supplement use, and chronic medications (except oral contraceptives). Body mass index and weight limits were applied to reduce interindividual variability in iron kinetics and dosing per body mass. These eligibility criteria were chosen to strengthen internal validity by removing known modifiers of iron absorption. Data on ethnicity and socio-economic status were not collected. Although recruitment from a university population may limit generalizability to other Thai women, it is unlikely to have introduced systematic bias in the physiological measurement of iron absorption. The recruitment inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) female; (2) age 18–45 years; (3) SF <50 µg l−1; (4) body mass index 18.5–24.9 kg m−2; (5) weight <70 kg; (6) signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) anaemia (defined as Hb <12 g dl−1); (2) presence of thalassaemia; (3) inflammation (defined as CRP >5 mg l−1); (4) cigarette smoking; (5) chronic digestive, renal and/or metabolic disease; (6) chronic medications (except for oral contraceptives); (7) use of vitamin, mineral and pre- and/or probiotic supplements in the previous 2 weeks; (8) blood transfusion, blood donation or important blood loss in the previous 4 months; (9) history of difficulties with blood sampling; (10) antibiotic treatment in the previous 4 weeks; (11) pregnancy (tested in serum at screening); (12) lactation in the previous 6 weeks; (13) prior participation in a study using stable isotopes or participation in any clinical study in the previous 30 days; (14) unable to comply with study protocol.

During screening, about 2 weeks before the start of the study, we collected a venipuncture sample (6 ml) for the determination of Hb, SF, CRP, thalassaemia and pregnancy. Body weight and height were recorded, and an interview was conducted to assess inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible women were invited to participate in the study.

Each participant received 3 intrinsically labelled Fe compounds, each administered twice in two study phases: (1) 4 mg Fe as OatNF-SA-57Fe hybrid, (2) 4 mg Fe as OatNF-NaOH-58Fe hybrid and (3) 4 mg Fe as 54FeSO4. During the first phase, we administered the compounds on days 1, 3 and 5, diluted in 100 ml reverse osmosis purified water, along with 240 ml purified water as a drink. During the second phase of the study (days 19, 21 and 23), the same labelled compounds were readministered with identical amounts of water, accompanied with 30 g açai puree (The Rainforest Company) sweetened with 5 g honey (Doi Kham brand by Royal Doi Kham Food Products). The order of administration of each compound was randomized for each phase of the study using a Python code. The administrations took place between 7:00 and 9:00 after an overnight fast.

We collected venous blood samples (6 ml) on days 1 (baseline), 19 (phase 1) and 37 (phase 2) to determine Hb, SF, CRP and erythrocyte isotopic composition. Body weight was measured on the same days.

Hb, SF and CRP concentrations were measured at the National Healthcare Systems (NHealth) in Bangkok, Thailand, using an automated haematology analyser (Sysmex), a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. Anaemia was defined as Hb <120 g l−1. Iron deficiency was defined as SF <30 μg l−1, and inflammation was described as CRP >5 mg l−1. Whole blood aliquots were sent on dry ice to ETH Zurich, where their iron isotopic composition was measured in duplicate by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry56 (Neptune, Thermo Fisher Scientific).

We based our power calculation on data from our previous iron absorption study that administered submicrometre-sized ferric phosphate to young women in Thailand19. In that study, the standard deviation observed between the differences of the logs of the FIA was 0.223. To resolve a difference of 30% in FIA with a power of 80% and a 5% error rate, we estimated the sample size to be 44 participants. To account for a 20% participant drop-out, we recruited 52 participants.

FIA from the iron supplements was calculated based on the shift of the iron isotopic ratios in the collected whole blood samples, using the principles of isotopic dilution and assuming 80% incorporation of the absorbed iron into the erythrocytes17. Circulating iron in the body was estimated based on blood volume, derived from body height and weight, and Hb concentration17.

The SPSS statistical programming environment (IBM SPSS Software, Version 28) and Microsoft Office EXCEL 2016 (Microsoft) were used for data analysis. Data were examined for normality by use of the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data were reported as the mean (s.d.), and non-normally distributed data were reported as the median (interquartile range). Comparisons were done using two-sided paired t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

The protocol of the clinical study was approved by the Ethical Board of Mahidol University and was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (ID no. NCT05826899). All participants provided written informed consent before any study procedure took place. Mahidol University Central Institutional Review Board (MU-CIRB) is in full compliance with International Guidelines for Human Research Protection such as the Declaration of Helsinki, The Belmont Report, CIOMS Guidelines and the International Conference on Harmonization in Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP. Certificate No. COA No. MU-CIRB 2°023/024.2802). The protocol for the sensory study was approved by the ETH Ethics Commission (no. 25ETHICS-166) and the Zurich Cantonal Ethical Commission (Req-2025-00599).

The editing of organic molecules through single-atom modification is an enabling capability for medicinal chemistry. Although several examples of single-atom insertions into the carbon–carbon double bonds of unsaturated aromatic ring systems have been reported, heteroatom insertions into chemically inert carbon–carbon single bonds are comparatively rare. Here we report a photochemical strategy for the formal migration of oxygen atoms into carbon–carbon single bonds. This protocol is based on the ability of copper(II) salts to induce photochemical homolytic cleavage of carbon–carbon bonds adjacent to alcohols and to mediate oxidative coupling reactions of the resulting organoradical intermediates. Application of this method to cyclic alcohol substrates results in oxygen atom insertions into saturated carbocyclic rings, and its extension to linear alcohol substrates enables atomic permutation of hydroxymethyl functionalities into methyl ethers.

Oxidative functionalization reactions are crucial in synthetic chemistry because of their ability to introduce polar functional groups into molecules. The presence of these groups, their identity and their position profoundly alter both the physiochemical properties of bioactive compounds and their affinity towards their biological targets. Most oxidation reactions, however, introduce new polar groups only on the molecular periphery (Fig. 1a)1,2. Only a handful of robust reactions are known that insert heteroatoms into the carbon framework of an organic molecule. Classical examples include the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation3, which inserts an oxygen atom into the C–C bond of a ketone, the Beckmann rearrangement4, which is an analogous nitrogen atom insertion reaction, and the Hock process, which converts cumene to the corresponding phenol5. Such single-heteroatom insertion reactions constitute a subset of a class of transformations known as ‘skeletal editing', which are valued in drug discovery for enabling the rapid preparation of scaffold-modified analogues without lengthy de novo synthesis6,7. Many recent reports have described new strategies to convert C(sp2)-rich arenes into heterocycles via single-atom insertion (Fig. 1b)8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. However, in contrast, reactions that effect heteroatom insertion into fully saturated C–C bonds are quite rare18,19,20,21.

One reason for the difficulty of oxidizing saturated C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds is the relative inertness of these highly directional bonds towards exogenous chemical reactants. Common industrial alkane reformation reactions, for example, require forcing conditions, are relatively unselective for one C–C bond among many in a complex structure, and are intolerant of the high degree of functionalization common in pharmaceutical compounds22. An alternative strategy to trigger selective reactions of C–C bonds under milder conditions exploits the reactivity of functional groups already present on a molecule of interest. For example, installation of directing groups can increase the reactivity of specific C–C bonds towards transition-metal catalysts. However, the directing groups most commonly used for this strategy require the presence of a C(sp2)-hybridized functionality and have not yet been utilized in heteroatom insertion reactions, to the best of our knowledge23. Recent developments in photochemistry have provided an alternative approach to selective C–C bond cleavage that leverages the high reactivity of alkoxy radicals. Knowles has pioneered the use of photocatalytic proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) to convert native alcohol functionalities into alkoxy radicals24, while Zuo has similarly pioneered methods utilizing ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) photochemistry25,26 to homolyse the metal–oxygen bonds of in situ-generated metal alkoxides27. The high reactivity of the resulting oxygen-centred radical intermediates can provide a strong driving force for the β-scission of adjacent C–C bonds at ambient temperature.

We imagined that LMCT photochemistry could provide an ideal entry into the oxidative functionalization of saturated C–C bonds, for three reasons. First, a variety of metal alkoxides have been demonstrated to undergo LMCT photoactivation and subsequent β-scission; these reactions occur under mild and operationally convenient conditions, and the selectivity of the bond cleavage is well understood and highly predictable. Second, because the LMCT generation of alkoxy radicals is a unimolecular process, this activation mode avoids the application of the deeply oxidizing potentials required for outer-sphere single-electron oxidation of alcohols and thus is readily tolerant of the oxidatively sensitive functional groups common in pharmaceutical chemistry. Finally, our laboratory, among others, has shown that the Cu(II) and Fe(III) salts used in LMCT photoactivation can subsequently promote oxidative coupling reactions with diverse nucleophilic partners to forge a range of carbon–heteroatom bonds, also with high functional-group compatibility28,29,30,31.

These features suggested the reaction design outlined in Fig. 1c. The in situ reaction of a saturated cycloalkanol with an appropriate redox-active first-row transition metal would result in a photoactive metal alkoxide. LMCT photoactivation would generate an alkoxy radical that is poised to undergo rapid β-scission. We imagined that metal-mediated oxidative radical coupling with the liberated carbonyl group might generate an oxocarbenium ion, which could readily be trapped with an exogenous nucleophile. Overall, this reaction would constitute a one-step protocol for the selective oxidative migration of an alcohol into a saturated carbocyclic ring. Very recently, a conceptually similar β-scission and oxidative cyclization sequence was reported using electrochemical generation of an alkoxy radical32. However, consistent with the deeply oxidizing potentials required for direct alcohol oxidation, this reaction utilized a highly positive applied potential (+2.1 V versus saturated calomel electrode), and the demonstrated functional-group compatibility of the electrochemical process was correspondingly somewhat modest.

An empirical optimization campaign resulted in the identification of the reaction conditions shown in Fig. 2a. Under optimized conditions, cycloalkanol 1 is converted smoothly to ring-expanded tetrahydropyran 3 upon irradiation with 427-nm light in the presence of 2.5 equiv. of Cu(OTf)2, 3.0 equiv. of pyridine, 5.0 equiv. of isobutyronitrile (iPrCN) and 3.0 equiv. of EtOH (2) as a convenient, inexpensive nucleophilic trapping agent. The identity of the Cu(II) reagent proved to be important, as substitutions for Cu(OTf)2 afforded only trace product (Fig. 2a, entry 2). Alterations to the base and solvent led to diminished, albeit synthetically appreciable yields (entries 3 and 4). Consistent with our previous studies of oxidative LMCT photochemistry25, exclusion of the weakly coordinating iPrCN ligand results in a decrease in reactivity (entry 5). We believe the nitrile ligand improves the solubility of Cu(OTf)2 and remains bound to Cu(II) in the photoactive complex (details are provided in Supplementary section I). The reaction scaled well, with only a negligible loss of yield observed when run at a 1.00 mmol scale (entry 6). In the absence of either Cu(OTf)2 or light, no product is generated, supporting the hypothesis that this reaction proceeds through a Cu-mediated photochemical process (entries 7 and 8). Finally, we also investigated a catalytic variant of this transformation. Optimal catalytic conditions, however, required highly reactive N-fluoro-2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate (NFTPT) as the terminal oxidant; the lower yields and higher costs associated with this organic oxidant render the use of stoichiometric Cu(OTf)2 more attractive in this case (Supplementary Section B).

The acetal functionality embedded in the oxidized product is an attractive linchpin for further manipulation. The ethoxy substituent can be tracelessly deleted by Lewis acid-mediated silane reduction, revealing the trivial product of formal oxygen atom migration into the ring (4). Similarly, other classical Lewis or Brønsted acid-mediated diversification reactions were successful, including hydrolysis (5), allylation (6), alkylation (7) and cyanation (8), affording the corresponding products in high yields with good to excellent diastereoselectivity (Fig. 2b).

Figure 2c summarizes studies exploring the scope of this transformation with respect to the cycloalkanol. To facilitate analysis of the products, in most cases the oxidative insertion reaction was followed by hydride reduction of the acetal. Notably, the Cu salts are easily removed by aqueous work-up, and no chromatographic purification is necessary between the steps, highlighting the operational simplicity of this telescoped reaction sequence. Assay yields (AY) were reported for previously reported compounds that were potentially volatile. Cyclopentanols featuring electron-poor (9), electron-rich (10), o-substituted (11) and p-substituted (12) arenes were all tolerated in good yields. Arenes with vinyl (13) and allylic substitution (14) afforded products without evidence of the respective 5-endo-trig or 5-exo-trig radical cyclization by-products. 2-Phenylcyclobutanol was smoothly transformed to tetrahydrofuran 15, showcasing the O-insertion into a smaller ring scaffold. Both α-amino (16) and allylic (17) substrates were also effectively converted to product; however, cyclopentanols lacking a radical-stabilizing group failed to react, indicating the need for electronic stabilization in the β-scission and oxidative cyclization events. To study the regioselectivity of the β-scission, we utilized substrates that have two sites of potential radical stabilization. In each case we observed highly regioselective bond scission, favouring cleavage and functionalization at benzylic sites over oxygen- and nitrogen-stabilized positions (18,19). Finally, as skeletal editing reactions are most impactful in the context of late-stage functionalizations, we utilized our reaction conditions to synthesize oestrone derivative 20 and the oxo-analogue of a known NK1 receptor antagonist (21)33.

In our preliminary studies, ethanol was selected as an arbitrary and inexpensive trap for the electrophilic oxocarbenium intermediate. However, the facility by which diverse nucleophiles add to oxocarbenium cations suggested that variation of the trapping reagent could offer a strategy to elaborate the ring-expanded heterocycles with valuable functionalities in a single step (Fig. 2d). Using only 1.0 equiv. of exogenous nucleophile, the oxocarbenium was readily functionalized with electron-rich (22), electron-poor (23) and alkyl (24) sulfonamides in good to excellent yields and diastereoselectivities. The complex sulfonamide celecoxib was also installed in high yields (25), demonstrating the tolerance of this reaction towards the N-heterocycles commonly found in pharmaceutical compounds. Benzyl carbamate was incorporated in good yield and diastereoselectivity (26), despite its comparatively lower nucleophilicity, as was a more complex alcohol (27), showing that the oxocarbenium can be directly trapped by a range of nucleophiles. Smaller ring sizes were also readily elaborated with N-nucleophiles, furnishing amide-trapped tetrahydrofuran product 28. Substrates functionalized with substituted arenes (29), vinyl groups (30) and α-amino functionalities (31) were also readily ring-expanded in good yields.

To gain insight into the mechanism, we sought experimental and computational evidence for the key LMCT activation, β-scission and oxidative cyclization steps of the reaction cascade. To support the involvement of an LMCT event, we conducted a UV–vis study probing the formation of the proposed photoactive complex (Fig. 3a). Solutions of Cu(OTf)2 and pyridine were prepared and titrated with cyclopentanol 1. As the concentration of 1 is increased, we observe a bathochromic shift of the absorbance into the visible region, supporting the generation of a photoactive complex that involves 1 as a ligand. Notably, features assigned as LMCT transitions in the UV–vis spectra of previously reported Cu(II) alkoxide species also appear in this range34.

To better understand the β-scission event, we questioned whether ring-opening of the alkoxy radical might be reversible, in analogy to recent observations on the LMCT-promoted stereochemical isomerization of similar cycloalkanols35. Stereochemically pure cis and trans isomers of 2-phenylcyclopentanol (1 and cis-1) were prepared and subjected to the conditions for oxidative migration (Fig. 3b). In this experiment, both substrates converged to the same diastereomer with similar yields and product ratios, supporting the formation of an achiral intermediate in which the stereochemical information of the initial state is lost. More importantly, the unreacted starting materials retain their original configuration without loss of fidelity. We infer from these results that the ring-opening process is irreversible under these conditions.

Finally, we imagined two mechanistic possibilities for formation of the oxocarbenium intermediate: radical cyclization to generate an α-oxy radical that can be oxidized by Cu(II) to afford the oxocarbenium (Fig. 3c, pathway A) or direct Cu(II)-mediated oxidation of the benzylic radical to its corresponding carbocation before cyclization of the aldehyde (Fig. 3c, pathway B). To probe this question, we performed a computational analysis comparing the relative energies of the two reaction pathways. All structures were optimized and minima confirmed on the potential energy surface using B3LYP with the 6-31G(d) basis set, and a polarizable continuum model for dichloromethane was used. All calculations were performed with Gaussian 1636. DFT calculations concluded that the radical cyclization onto the aldehyde would have a transition state (TS1) of 22.6 kcal mol−1 and be endergonic by 7.8 kcal mol−1. A high activation energy would result in substantially longer reaction times than those observed in our experiments, and the lack of evidence for intramolecular reactions with appropriately positioned alkenes (Fig. 2c, 13 and 14) requires that the lifetime of the radical must be short. In contrast, the cationic cyclization was calculated to be exergonic by 10.4 kcal mol−1, with a minimal barrier for the cyclization step (3.0 kcal mol−1, TS2), consistent with rapid cyclization upon oxidation of the radical. Because Cu(II) salts are known to oxidize organoradicals at diffusion-controlled rates37, we propose that pathway B is probably the dominant mechanism for product formation.

Together, the spectroscopic, experimental and computational evidence supports the mechanistic proposal outlined in Fig. 1c: in situ self-assembly of a photoactive Cu(II) alkoxide species enables a visible-light-promoted LMCT transition. This results in dissociative homolysis to generate a high-energy alkoxy radical, which induces an irreversible β-scission of the adjacent C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond. The ring-opened organoradical species is rapidly oxidized by Cu(II), and ensuing oxidative cyclization of the aldehyde followed by trapping of the oxocarbenium intermediate affords the oxygen migration product.

Much of the recent interest in heteroatom insertion reactions has focused on transformations of ring systems. Novel methods for molecular editing of acyclic substructures could be equally enabling in medicinal chemistry, but of the few examples reported so far38,39,40, there has been only one isolated example of a heteroatom insertion into a C(sp3)–C(sp3) bond41. We imagined that the oxidation of C–C bonds in acyclic alcohols could be accomplished using a mechanistic logic similar to that described above to provide a complementary synthetic outcome (Fig. 4a). In a linear alcohol, LMCT-promoted β-scission results in the liberation of formaldehyde as a small-molecule by-product. Although the Cu(II)-mediated oxidative cyclization of the tethered aldehydes was facile, trapping of this liberated aldehyde presents a more formidable challenge. In the presence of an exogenous nucleophilic reaction partner, however, metal-mediated oxidative coupling of the resulting organoradical species would lead to formation of a new carbon–heteroatom bond.

Right: reaction optimization for oxygen insertion into saturated acyclic scaffolds. b, Select scope examples for methanol trapping. c, Scope examples for trapping with larger alkyl alcohols. All reactions were run at the 0.30 mmol scale, prepared in a nitrogen-filled glovebox, and irradiated with two 427-nm Kessil lamps with a cooling fan. Diastereomeric ratios were determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy analysis of the crude mixture using CH2Br2 as an internal standard. aAlcohol substrate (1.0 equiv.), MeOH (10.0 equiv.), Cu(OTf)2 (2.5 equiv.), pyridine (3.0 equiv.), MeCN (15.0 equiv.) and CH2Cl2 (0.1 M) for 48 h bAlcohol substrate (1.0 equiv.), MeOH (20.0 equiv.), FeCl3 (5.0 equiv.), DMAP (6.0 equiv.) and MeCN (0.05 M) for 48 h cAlcohol substrate (1.0 equiv.), corresponding alcohol coupling partner (5.0 equiv.), Cu(OTf)2 (2.5 equiv.), pyridine (3.0 equiv.), MeCN (15.0 equiv.) and CH2Cl2 (0.1 M) for 48 h. dAlcohol substrate (1.0 equiv.), corresponding alcohol coupling partner (8.0 equiv.), Cu(OTf)2 (4.0 equiv.), pyridine (4.8 equiv.), MeCN (24.0 equiv.) and CH2Cl2 (0.1 M) for 48 h. DMAP, 4-dimethylaminopyridine.

We became particularly interested in the case where the trapping nucleophile would be methanol. The product of this reaction would be a positional isomer of the starting alcohol. Overall, one might consider this transformation a novel type of molecular edit in which the order of the atoms in a functional group is exchanged, but the molecular constitution is preserved. Such a transformation would be a functional-group permutation42 that would enable the polarity and hydrogen-bonding ability of a bioactive molecule to be altered with only a minimal perturbation of its shape and steric profile.

Reaction optimization showed that conditions akin to those of the cyclic skeletal editing reaction could be utilized to convert 2-phenylethanol (32) to the isomeric methyl ether (34) in good yield (Fig. 4a, entry 1). The reaction was similarly sensitive to Cu(II) and base identity (entries 2 and 3), and a change in the nitrile additive and its stoichiometry proved to have a beneficial effect on reactivity (entry 4). Control experiments again showed that the reaction does not proceed in the absence of light or Cu(II), which suggested that a similar LMCT mechanism initiates the reaction (entries 5 and 6). Once optimized conditions were developed, we turned our attention to the scope of the reaction. The electronics of the arene radical-stabilizing group had a modest influence on the reaction outcome, with electron-poor (35) and electron-rich (36) arenes providing comparable yields. Aryl bromides (37) and aryl chlorides (38) were tolerated with different substitution patterns on the arene. Secondary (39) and tertiary (40) substitution of the benzylic position was tolerated, as was a thiophene stabilizing group (41). A tetrahydroisoquinoline-derived substrate (42) reacted smoothly in this reaction, as did more complex alcohols derived from flurbiprofen (43) and fenoprofen (44). A switch in metal oxidant from Cu(II) to Fe(III) enabled the high-yielding coupling of amine-stabilized substrates including oxazolidine- (45), pyrrolidine- (46) and morpholine- (47) containing substrates. Finally, benzimidazole product 48 was obtained in moderate yield, showcasing the method's ability to tolerate N-heterocycles. We imagined that this novel transformation might be most obvious when applied to hydroxymethyl substituents, but the formal positional isomerization of more complex acyclic alcohols is also feasible. For example, secondary alcohol substrates could be trapped with EtOH (49) and n-pentanol (50). Ring-containing benzyl alcohol (51) and cyclohexylmethanol (52) gave similar yields. Cyclic and acyclic tertiary alcohols could also be employed, furnishing oxygen-inserted products (53–56) in good yields.

In summary, we have developed an approach towards skeletal editing through the selective functionalization of saturated carbon–carbon bonds. The LMCT strategy for alcohol activation enables native functionalities commonly found in pharmaceutical lead compounds to be exploited as triggers for formal oxygen atom migration. These reactions occur without the use of strongly oxidizing photoredox catalysts or the application of deeply oxidizing redox potentials, and the tolerance for oxidatively sensitive functional groups is high. This new method thus enables the rapid preparation of cyclic and acyclic ethers from elaborated alcohol substrates and adds important new capability to the growing library of skeletal editing methods. Moreover, this study demonstrates that LMCT activation is ideally poised to address selectivity and reactivity challenges associated with the functionalization of C(sp3)–C(sp3) bonds and could thus provide an alternative entry into the design of new atom-insertion reactions.

An oven-dried 8-ml vial equipped with a stir bar was placed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The vial was charged with Cu(OTf)2 (181 mg, 0.50 mmol, 2.5 equiv.), iPrCN (89.8 μl, 1.00 mmol, 5.0 equiv.), pyridine (48.3 μl, 0.60 mmol, 3.0 equiv.) and cycloalkanol (0.20 mmol, 1.0 equiv.). The reaction components were diluted with anhydrous CH2Cl2 (2 ml, 0.1 M), and EtOH (35.0 μl, 0.60 mmol, 3.0 equiv.) was added. The vial was capped and taken out of the glovebox, then placed in front of two 427-nm Kessil lamps and a fan for cooling. The reaction was irradiated for 16 h. On completion, the reaction was diluted with EtOAc, and the organic layer was washed with NH4Cl and NaHCO3 before being dried by Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude mixture was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to afford the pure product.

Nataliya Shakhovska hopes to develop strong connections with European institutions.Credit: Nataliya Shakhovska

One of Ukraine's largest universities inaugurated its first female rector in May. Now, Nataliya Shakhovska is steering Lviv Polytechnic National University's 35,000 students and 2,500 academic staff members through the fourth year of the Russian invasion, on top of her research on artificial intelligence.

Global geopolitics should not stall science — 5 ways to push back

Shakhovska told Nature how she keeps going and how she's trying to build up her university to be ‘the best in Europe'.

This is incredible. It signals that leadership can and should reflect academic diversity and that the most important criterion is qualification, not gender. And it is a trend across Ukraine. In the past year, women have also won leadership elections at the Kyiv Aviation Institute and the Vasyl Stefanyk Carpathian National University in Ivano-Frankivsk.

In our society, mothers and women have strong roles. The war is a crisis and maybe there is a feeling that a woman can protect us.

Yes, I believe in the transformative power of ambition. Moreover, Ukrainian universities have long been underestimated. Our intellectual resilience, especially in times of crisis, is extraordinary. In my mind, the best university is the one that is the best place for people. We're not just talking about rankings but about the feeling that ‘I like to spend my time here, not only for work or education, but also because this is a good place for me'.

‘Education is possible in any situation' — what I've learnt from teaching in Kyiv amid a war

‘Education is possible in any situation' — what I've learnt from teaching in Kyiv amid a war

Brain drain is a problem in Ukraine. That's why it is important to show our young people that they can and must stay in the country, not only for education but also for their future careers and to rebuild it.

We need sustained investment in research infrastructure. We need new laboratories and — importantly — deeper international partnerships. We need a culture that rewards innovation and inter-disciplinary thinking. But above all, we need to trust it's possible, and act accordingly.

The event was not just about the damaging of labs and classrooms: those can be rebuilt. It was about the emotional trauma to students and staff members. And it was about the mobilization of students and staff. Our community understands that we must rebuild, we must continue our work, we must continue our studying. Universities are not only the buildings: they are first of all the people.

We are replacing all of the damaged windows. We have raised funds from our partner companies to repair our labs. And for our community, we organized a psychological-support group for students and academics.

We have had to think about a trauma- informed educational model. We are a huge university and it is difficult to know whether any particular student is affected by trauma. We have a psychological-support centre for our students. It is busy all the time.

We are also holding a lot of motivational lectures — about new possibilities and time management — and meetings with successful people, not only Ukrainian professors, but also international ones. We organize workshops and courses on non-academic topics for students.

I think these measures are working. Our academic staff members are highly motivated: they want to create something new.

Conventional education is about lectures, about labs, about practical issues. But having to deal with trauma as well as problems such as access to electricity and materials, it is important that we have a flexible model for our students and staff members.

The future of universities

The future of universities

That's why we first reviewed our educational facilities. We are currently focusing on opening co-working zones where students and staff members can spend their free time and do their work, and on 24-hour lab access for everyone. In the AI department, students can now access the lab at any time.

And we try to organize ways for our staff members to connect with our international partners. This is one of the most important parts of our strategy. And it is not about emergency support. It is about long-term integration into European research frameworks. This is, I think, the most important innovation.

Because our economy is working on post-war recovery scenarios, we are having a radical reorganization of research agendas to support this. It is not about publishing papers: we are helping to rebuild the country. We have a renewed sense of purpose.

The most important thing for Ukraine now is the development of technologies, for example, drone systems and energy resilience. For instance, one project is upcycling bomb-damaged concrete into high-quality concrete for reconstruction. It's funded by the UK government's InnovateUkraine programme; our engineers have trained using equipment from the University of Leeds, and a mobile rubble-processing line has begun trials near Kyiv. The benefits include carbon dioxide savings, lower construction costs and simpler logistics for reconstruction.

Assessing the sustainability of plastic chemical recycling requires realistic feedstocks and catalysts designed within sustainability-led frameworks (Plastic-to-X). We link catalyst design and systems analysis to study hydrogenolysis of high-density polyethylene (virgin and bottle caps; Mw = 100–200 kDa). We report Ru–Ni alloy nanoparticles (3–4 nm) supported on titania that yield up to 55% liquid C6–C45 products under optimized conditions, whereas monometallic Ru produces virtually no liquids  Operando spectroscopy and simulations reveal structure sensitivity: backbone scission follows dehydrogenation and hydrogenation cycles at defective alloy sites formed in situ. Integrating these mechanistic insights with life cycle and techno-economic analyses indicates profitable processing of plastic caps over the optimal catalyst (2.5 wt% Ru, 5 wt% Ni) with substantially lower CO2 emissions even when using green H2. Furthermore, within the Plastic-to-X framework, we identify a minimum average chain length threshold of C11 for product distributions as a  critical design  metric to reconcile environmental and economic objectives.

Polyolefins, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP), are by far the largest contributors to plastic pollution, with an annual production rate equal to 350 Mt1. Collected goods are nowadays mechanically recycled into other plastic products with widespread applications delimited by regulations2 or culture3. Efforts to develop chemical routes−now handling < 1% of all plastic waste−are on the rise since they can produce monomers, fuels, chemicals, or materials, opening up other markets while contributing to sustainability4,5,6. Among these routes often applied to other complex feedstocks like biomass7, catalytic hydrogenolysis generates alkane streams (in contrast to hydrocracking, which also produces olefins and aromatics8) at mild conditions (200–300 °C, 10–30 bar H2), making it suitable for the production of gases, fuels, or lubricants9.

After approximately half a decade of development10, polyolefin hydrogenolysis now requires more coordinated efforts from catalyst to process scales to determine conditions for environmental and economic sustainability11,12. A key aspect to consider is the influence of using green hydrogen, which is known to impose economic constraints to other environmentally benign processes13,14,15. Another factor is the potential to access many different product distributions, suggesting a large impact variability across scenarios that has led to a lack of clear target products; an issue that can be summarized as the Plastic-to-X question. Within this complexity, however, liquid range alkanes (C6–C45) may be preferred since they require less hydrogen than gases and currently offer more attractive prices16. This valuable direction aligns with seminal analyses using model polyethylenes (average molecular weight Mw < 100 kDa)16,17. Comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) focused on realistic waste streams can be used to identify environmentally preferred routes5,15,18,19,20,21. In the context of plastics, it has been shown that extending the material's lifetime via chemical recycling can lead to notable emission reductions in the plastics sector at the expense of higher costs when compared to the current fossil-based linear system22,23,24. Thus, pinpointing Plastic-to-X routes that satisfy the economy-environment nexus is relevant to guiding catalyst design.

Supported monometallic ruthenium catalysts are considered reference materials for the hydrogenolysis of model polyolefins, particularly PP25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 and LDPE30,34,35,36,37,38,39, and serve as a benchmark for the less studied HDPE40. With these reports revealing key mechanistic features, realistic feedstocks must now be prioritized to demonstrate the viability of this technology. Recent studies have shown that titania-supported ultrafine Ru nanoparticles exhibit high activity for commercial-grade HDPE (Mw = 200 kDa) and for plastic caps made from it; however, they favor methane formation41. This lack of selectivity control emanates from ruthenium's intrinsic high activity to promote terminal C–C scission (demethylation, yielding methane) versus the desirable secondary-secondary C–C scission (backbone scission, yielding progressively shorter multicarbon products)28,35.

The addition of a second metal to form atomically controlled bimetallic structures42,43 with enhanced selectivity is a strategy that has proven successful in other processes involving hydrocarbons, such as hydrorefining of acetylene into ethylene44, propane dehydrogenation45, or ethylene epoxidation46. Recent works centered on model LDPE (Mw = 4 kDa, equivalent to ca. C150) have indeed observed reduced demethylation over a Ru-Co single atom alloy47 and Ru-Pt systems48,49. Nickel also shows promise as a ruthenium modifier owing to its low carbon footprint50 and higher preference for backbone scission in the hydrogenolysis of short alkanes51,52,53 and hydrocracking of HDPE54,55,56,57,58 or LDPE59. Nonetheless, Ni displays low activity in monometallic form thereby exhibiting complementary features to Ru. A recent model LDPE hydrogenolysis study using silica-supported Ru-Ni nanoparticles has signaled a reduction in the demethylation degree compared to monometallic Ru, though the lack of synthesis-structure-performance relations precludes its extrapolation to other plastics and catalyst architectures 60. In this regard, the adoption of advanced characterization techniques such as operando spectroscopy may represent a suitable step forward toward enhanced understanding in this field. Following this emerging approach, we integrate catalyst design with system-level analysis to investigate catalyst composition, structure, and performance for HDPE hydrogenolysis. We first develop titania-supported RuNi alloys nanoparticles (ca. 5 nm), yielding up to 16% liquid products under standardized conditions, compared to null for monometallic Ru, and rationalize their operation via operando monitoring of alloy formation coupled to experimental and simulation studies. Further optimization of operating conditions resulted in up to 55% liquid yield for the RuNi catalyst. Bridging these findings with life cycle and techno-economic analyses, we predict environmentally and economically sustainable processing of plastic caps even using green hydrogen. Furthermore, extending this analysis to the Plastic-to-X concept revealed a minimum average chain length threshold of C11 for hydrocarbon products to reconcile economic and environmental demands. Overall, this work highlights how studies aiming at the development of emerging catalytic technologies can largely benefit from a holistic approach.

We devised a sequential impregnation method depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1 and described in detail in the Methods section to synthesize titania-supported nanoparticles with varying ruthenium and nickel content (XRuYNi, where X and Y stand for the wt% of Ru and Ni, respectively). Briefly, YNi catalysts (Y = 0–15 wt%) were first prepared by impregnation of the Ni precursor on TiO2 (anatase), followed by thermal treatment in flowing N2 and reduction in H2. The second impregnation added ruthenium (X = 0–2.5 wt%) to reach the final XRuYNi systems. In the first stage of this study, these catalysts were used to promote hydrogenolysis of commercial-grade HDPE with average molecular weight Mw = 100 kDa (HDPE100) to identify performance trends, and later of the more widely used HDPE200 and plastic caps (Supplementary Table 1). Experiments were performed in a parallel reactor setup and product quantification was possible via gas chromatography, as described in the Methods section and depicted in Supplementary Figs. 2, 3.

First tests explored the reactivity of XRu and YNi catalysts separately. Monometallic XRu displayed very high conversion (defined as C1-C45 yield), promoting almost exclusively gaseous products even at reduced reaction times of 0.5 h (gray symbols in Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2). These results align with the high activity and tendency of Ru to promote terminal cleavage41. On the other hand, YNi displayed low activity with a tendency to promote liquid products. Variable Ni contents (Y = 0–15 wt%) and reduction temperatures (573–873 K) enabled a matrix of YNi catalysts with particle sizes between 6 and 20 nm where Ni(111) and NiO(111) facets predominated (Supplementary Figs. 5, 6). Following previous reports using nickel catalysts for other polyolefins54,57,59, catalytic tests revealed very modest conversions even at high Ni contents (e.g., < 10% C1-C45 yield on 15Ni), as reflected in Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3. Despite the low activity, selectivity toward liquid products (measured as the percentage of the converted fraction into the C6-C45 range) could reach values over 90% (e.g., 5Ni reduced at 573 K, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3) and conversion peaked for 5Ni catalysts reduced at 723 K (Supplementary Fig. 8). These results reinforce that monometallic Ni catalysts tend to favor liquid products within their modest activity.

More details can be found in the Methods section and metal distributions in Fig. 2. Reaction conditions: P(H2) = 20 bar, T = 523 K, stirring rate = 750 rpm, t = 0.5 h (XRu) or 4 h (XRuYNi), catalyst/plastic = 0.1, feedstock = HDPE100. d Product distributions obtained from different feedstocks (1 = HDPE100, 2 = HDPE200, 3 = caps) over 2.5 Ru and 2.5Ru5Ni catalysts under optimized conditions. Numerical values and reaction conditions are provided in Supplementary Tables 2, 5, 6, 9.

The second stage focused on determining reactivity patterns within the XRuYNi family (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 2). Figure 1a discloses that activity increases with X (Ru content), with catalysts containing 3 and 5 wt% Ni showing similar trends and superior to the 10 wt% case. Conversion and liquid yield were the two main criteria for catalyst selection, leading to the catalysts with 2.5 wt% Ru content being chosen for further analysis. Within this group, 3 and 5 wt% Ni content showed high conversion (80% to C1-C45, with 9 and 16% to C6-C45, respectively, Supplementary Table 2), giving a first indication of the enhancing effect of Ni on the production of liquids. When displaying conversion against liquid yield (Fig. 1b), the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst was chosen for further investigations as it attained the highest activity out of the XRuYNi materials and the highest liquid yield in the 2.5RuYNi group (83% yield to C1-C45, with 16% to C6-C45), clearly departing from the catalytic behavior of 2.5Ru (97% yield to C1-C5, 3% to C6-C45 after 0.5 h).

The first indication of the need for a close interaction between nickel and ruthenium to achieve high liquid yields came after obtaining exclusively gaseous products over physical mixtures with similar Ru and Ni contents (Supplementary Fig. 9 and Supplementary Table 4). After these experiments, alternative synthesis routes were applied to prepare catalysts with 2.5 wt% Ru and 5 wt% Ni, targeting other catalyst structures. These routes are sequential impregnation in the reverse order (first Ru and then Ni) and flame spray pyrolysis, a method proven to achieve controlled dispersion of metals on oxides (Supplementary Fig. 1)61,62. Figure 1c discloses that 2.5Ru5Niinv (inverse impregnation) gave  only 5% liquid yield (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 5 for other compositions following the same trend), whereas 2.5Ru5NiFSP (flame spray pyrolysis) was almost inactive.

These results revealed structural sensitivity, as evidenced by themicroscopy analysis contained in Fig. 2. The structure of the as-prepared 2.5Ru5Ni system consisted of well-dispersed nanoparticles (3-4 nm on average, Supplementary Fig. 11 for a larger field of view), resembling that of 2.5Ru (Supplementary Fig. 12), with Ru and Ni showing a high degree of co-location (Fig. 2a, b). Catalysts did not exhibit noticeable morphological changes after reaction, suggesting structural stability (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 13, 14 for other compositions). On the other hand, 2.5Ru5Niinv presented a less intimate contact between metals, with aggregates ranging from dozens of nanometers (Fig. 2e) to nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. 15). In contrast, 2.5Ru5NiFSP displayed an uneven metal dispersion where nickel was highly dispersed while ruthenium formed aggregates of varying sizes (ca. 10–100 nm, Fig. 2f). The structural sensitivity of the reaction was evident from these results, recommending 2.5Ru5Ni as reference material for further exploration. Overall, these results underscore the relevance of matching scalable synthetic methods with optimal catalyst structure, since the simplicity and capacity of a synthesis route is a cornerstone feature for its industial feasibility63.

We then proceeded to an initial optimization of reaction conditions to maximize the yield to liquid products on the reference 2.5Ru5Ni by varying reaction time, temperature, hydrogen pressure, stirring rate, and catalyst-to-plastic ratio (Supplementary Fig. 16 and Supplementary Table 6). The maximum liquid yield obtained from these experiments was close to 55% for certain combinations of reaction conditions. Among them, T = 538 K, t = 6 h, P(H2) = 20 bar, stirring rate = 750 rpm, catalyst-to-plastic ratio = 0.1 were chosen due to the simultaneous high conversion (> 90%) and the mentioned high fraction of liquids, demonstrating the relevance of reaction engineering in this process. A parallel optimization for 2.5Ru using lower catalyst amounts resulted in a maximum liquid yield of ca. 25% at 85% conversion (Supplementary Fig. 17 and Supplementary Table 7). The role of Ni as promoter toward liquid products was reinforced when comparing the 2.5Ru and 2.5Ru5Ni catalysts at similar conversion levels, with 2.5Rsu5Ni still showing improved liquid yields (Supplementary Fig. 18). Consecutive tests were performed over 2.5Ru5Ni under optimized conditions to check for reusability (Supplementary Fig. 19a and Supplementary Table 8). While the catalyst remained active, the conversion and liquid yields decreased slightly. This may be due to residual carbon material contributing to the measured catalyst mass (Supplementary Fig. 19b), resulting in the actual amount of catalyst in the reactor being lower. These results suggest that 2.5Ru5Ni can be reused, although further improvements to the recycling procedure are necessary.

Results for hydrogenolysis of virgin HDPE with larger molecular weight (HDPE200) and post-consumer plastic waste (caps) over 2.5Ru5Ni and 2.5Ru using optimized conditions are presented in Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 9. 2.5Ru5Ni displayed a higher liquid yield for HDPE200 and plastic caps than 2.5Ru while maintaining high activity. Hence, the ability of 2.5Ru5Ni to process various HDPE feedstocks warrants a deeper investigation into its catalyst structure.

In view of the distinctive feature of co-location of Ni and Ru over 2.5Ru5Ni compared to the other materials with similar composition (Fig. 2), characterization efforts probed the potential formation of RuNi alloys in XRuYNi systems. Textural characterization indicated similar surface areas and pore volumes for the set of XRuYNi catalysts under study (Supplementary Table 10). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of as-prepared and used 2.5Ru5Ni did not show reflections corresponding to Ru nor Ni phases, suggesting low crystallinity or small crystallite size (Supplementary Fig. 20). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of 2.5RuYNi materials after reaction revealed the predominance of oxidic Ru and Ni phases, likely due to exposure to air (Supplementary Fig. 21). Elemental analysis disclosed Ni/Ru ratios slightly higher than theoretical ones, suggesting these materials have Ni-rich surfaces. Notably, 2.5Ru5Ni and 2.5Ru5Niinv exhibited similar values (4.8 and 4.3, respectively), pointing to a modest influence of the synthesis method on surface composition (Supplementary Table 11).

For a detailed phase investigation, the fast Fourier transforms (FFT) of micrographs taken from different domains of used samples were analyzed (Fig. 3a). Electron diffraction patterns compatible with the (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) reflections of the reference Ni1Ru1 as model for hexagonal closed-packed structure (hcp, with d-spacing 2.26, 2.10, 1.99, 1.54, and 1.30 Å, respectively) could be identified. Additional analysis also supported domains with Ni-rich alloys with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure (Ni0.8Ru0.2 taken as a reference) through the identification of reflections matching the (111), (200), and (220) planes with corresponding d-spacing of 2.07, 1.79, and 1.27 Å. These results provided the first support for RuNi alloys formation but required additional evidence due to the existence of other possible crystalline species with similar structures. For instance, metallic Ru hcp shows d-spacing values of identified planes close to those for the Ni1Ru1 alloy (e.g., d-spacing 2.33 vs. 2.26 Å for the (111) plane). Metallic Ni and Ni-rich hcp alloys also suffer from similar constraints (e.g., d-spacing 2.05 vs. 2.07 Å for the (101) plane). Precise identification of alloy compositions thus requires further characterization efforts. Red colored regions in Fig. 3b indicate the possible location of alloys considering these limitations. A more detailed analysis of the images revealed an unidentified semicrystalline phase (yellow colored) that could be assigned to partial amorphization of the TiO2 support at the surface (raw and additional images in Supplementary Fig. 22). D and G bands typical of coke formation (1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively) were absent in Raman spectra for the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst, with the spectra measured before and after reaction showing close resemblance (Supplementary Fig. 23).

Reaction conditions: P(H2) = 20 bar, T = 523 K, catalyst/plastic = 1, feedstock = HDPE100. The subscripts x and y indicate relative metal content.

A second evidence for the existence of RuNi alloys was provided by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) applied to CO adsorption after H2 reduction of 2.5Ru, 2.5Ru5Ni, and 5Ni (Fig. 3b). The monometallic nickel catalyst showed bands at 2053 cm−1 (linear configuration), 1920 cm−1 (bridge), and 1856 cm−1 (hollow)64,65. The 2.5Ru surface displayed a band centered at 1981 cm−1 to which linear, bridging, and three-folded configurations contribute66,67. Distinctive bands were observed for the bimetallic material, which displayed a first band associated with linear bonding on Ni (with a tail suggesting the contribution from metallic Ru), as well as with a new band centered at ca. 1870 cm−1. These results indicate the emergence of new adsorption sites in 2.5Ru5Ni or modulated electronic structure of Ru/Ni species after alloying, leading to a distinctive interaction with carbon monoxide.

With previous evidence strongly hinting to the formation of alloyed RuNi phases, operando characterization for the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst revealed the dynamics of alloy formation and its stability under operation. Normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra for the Ru K-edge (Fig. 3c) demonstrated progressive reduction until reaching a stable metallic character after 0.5 h, as revealed by the lower whiteline intensity and the pre-edge shift to lower energies. Results for the Ni K-edge (Supplementary Fig. 24) mimicked this behavior, disclosing Ni in a mainly metallic but partially oxidized form, which seems to be favored by the strong interaction with TiO2. The time evolution of the Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for the Ru K-edge (Fig. 3d) reveals that alloy formation starts during the temperature ramp (transition from Fresh to 0.0 h) and continues for the first 0.5 h of the reaction (from 0.0 h to 0.5 h), as suggested by the Ru-Ni contribution at ca. 2 Angstrom. After this, the alloying process is completed, and the signal remains stable. XANES and EXAFS analysis for the 2.5Ru catalyst displayed only the reduction of the initial oxide phase without the peak at ca. 2 Angstrom, confirming this interpretation (Supplementary Fig. 25). Complementary results obtained by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD, Fig. 3e and Supplementary Fig. 26) indicated the restructuring and alloy formation within the same period through the gradual shift of Ru reflections over time, also suggesting restructuring into slightly larger nanoparticles or with higher crystallinity prior to the reaction. Statistical analysis of microscopy images of the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst before and after the reaction exhibited a shift from 3 to 4 nm as the average particle size (Supplementary Fig. 27). These results highlight the value of adapting advanced characterization techniques readily explored in other thermocatalytic reactions to the more experimentally challenging three-phase hydrogenolysis of polyolefin waste.

Complementary analyses for 2.5RuYNi catalysts after reaction added a deeper understanding of their chemical environment (Supplementary Figs. 28, 29). XANES spectra of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts confirmed their predominant metallic character with some minor contribution from oxidic phases (Supplementary Fig. 28). EXAFS spectra at the Ni and Ru K-edge for monometallic systems were consistent with a coordination number (CN) of 9.5 for Ni−Ni in the 5Ni catalyst, and 3.5 for Ru−Ru in the 2.5Ru catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 29 and Supplementary Table 12), coherent with the presence of metallic species68. The spectra from 2.5RuYNi catalysts showed the consistent presence of a peak at ca. 2.2 Å (Ni-Ru) in the Ni K-edge with CNNi−Ru = 1.1 and a peak at ca. 1.9 Å (Ru-Ni) in the Ru K-edge with CNRu−Ni = 2.1, suggesting the formation of alloys (Supplementary Fig. 29). However, these low values indicate a limited Ru-Ni interaction, leading to alloys in the form of clusters or small nanoparticles rather than by dissolution of one phase into the other. The CNRu−Ni increased with the Ni content, suggesting a larger population of Ru alloying with Ni. Taking CNRu−Ni as a proxy for the abundance of alloyed sites, we could correlate liquid yield and CNRu−Ni (Supplementary Fig. 30), revealing that increasing CNRu−Ni leads to higher liquid yields. The decreasing trend observed for 2.5Ru10Ni may be attributed to the presence of poorly active Ni nanoparticles that interfere with the exposure of active Ru sites, as revealed by the emergence of Ni-Ni bonds (Supplementary Table 12). This correlation supports the catalytic role of alloyed sites.

Herein, we explore temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) simulations to probe the cleavage of C–C bonds over monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, aiming to rationalize their distinct catalytic behavior. Heptane is used as a surrogate for HDPE to compare scission of terminal C–C bonds (yielding C1 + C6) and internal ones (yielding C3 + C4 or C2 + C5). As heptane and HDPE possess distinct physical properties, these results may not fully represent the initial stages of the reaction. Nevertheless, heptane is one of the HDPE hydrogenolysis products, allowing these experiments to provide an understanding of the latest stages of the reaction and possible reasons for the different selectivity obtained from Ru and RuNi systems.

TPSR experiments consisted of saturating the catalyst surface with heptane and dosing hydrogen while a temperature ramp was applied (more details in the Methods section). Product formation was continuously monitored by mass spectrometry, with the results displayed in Fig. 4a–c and Supplementary Fig. 31. For the 2.5Ru system, such an approach provided an onset temperature of 383 K for methane formation, while no evolution of propane as a proxy for multicarbon products could be observed to any appreciable extent. This result suggests the intrinsic tendency of monometallic Ru catalysts to promote terminal cleavage, in line with product distributions obtained from HDPE (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2). TPSR experiments over 5Ni yielded a parallel evolution of methane and propane starting at higher temperatures (onset 505 K). These insights are also aligned with the lower activity and larger selectivity to liquid products from HDPE (Supplementary Table 3). In contrast to the monometallic systems, 2.5Ru5Ni promoted the early evolution of propane (onset 393 K) over methane (onset 450 K), with other XRuYNi catalysts also featuring this behavior (Supplementary Fig. 31). A control experiment over a physical mixture of 2.5Ru and 5Ni showed results similar to 2.5Ru, confirming the unique behavior of bimetallic catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 32). This experimental indication of a distinctive mechanistic pathway over XRuYNi prompted the exploration of alloyed phases using density functional theory (DFT, PBE + D2) to assess reaction paths associated with C–C and C–H cleavage of heptane.

Dashed circles indicate species from which hydrogenation into final products occurs. Additional information is provided in Supplementary Figs. 33–36. Ru: blue, Ni: brown.

Based on microscopy characterization and the lack of discernible reflections in XRD analyses (Supplementary Figs. 6, 20, 22), we employed models of defective surfaces including steps and kinks of the Ni(211) termination and defective Ru and RuNi(0001) (Supplementary Figs. 33, 34) to assess reaction paths associated with C–C and C–H cleavage of heptane (Fig. 4d–f, detailed mechanisms and analysis on other surfaces in Supplementary Figs. 35, 36). These defective structures may be transient and thus challenging to identify via experimental characterization techniques, with previous theoretical studies already pointing to their formation under reaction conditions comparable to those found in this reaction69,70,71,72. C–C cleavage on flat or stepped pristine Ru, RuNi, and Ni surfaces was found to be less favored than on defective sites (Supplementary Tables 13, 14). A common feature of all studied defective surfaces is the favored dehydrogenation of heptane over the C–C cleavage due to smaller activation energies (Ea) for C–H breaking. From the thermodynamic standpoint, the reaction energy (ΔE) for C–H bond cleavage and formation lies between − 0.28 and 0.28 eV for the three models Supplementary Fig. 35. This suggests that heptane molecules can readily undergo fast and multiple dehydrogenation and hydrogenation cycles under reaction conditions.

Another commonality among surfaces is the favored cleavage of terminal C–C bonds over the internal scission prior to heptane dehydrogenation. However, when considering the formation of an allyl group by two concomitant dehydrogenations of C7 leading to C7**, the internal C–C scission into C3** + C4 is favored over the terminal C–C cleavage of C7 (C1 + C6) on Ni and particularly on RuNi. In turn, the internal C–C scission is favored on RuNi over Ni, which is in line with TPSR results disclosing that the formation of propane occurs at lower temperatures (Fig. 4a–c). Once the C3** and C4 fragments are formed, C4 is dehydrogenated and C3** is hydrogenated to carry out further C–C cleavages, eventually leading to the formation of C1 products. In contrast, the formation of C3** is unfavorable on Ru due to its high activation energy (Ea = 2.29 eV, Supplementary Fig. 35). Therefore, the preferential cleavage of internal C–C bonds observed in the RuNi and Ni (to a lesser extent) systems is attributed to the stabilization of allyl groups. This mechanism encompassing allylic intermediates may have been elusive in previous mechanistic studies due to the use of shorter reactant surrogates51. Thus, there is a need to revise mechanisms previously proposed for alloys and Ni-containing systems have relied on experimental observations, reaxFF molecular dynamics simulations, or stochastic modeling without providing atomic-level insights (Supplementary Table 15)49,54,60,73,74,75,76.

Overall, our model describes how the Ru system performs heptane hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, followed by successive terminal C–C scissions of C7 and saturated C7-n fragments. These terminal cleavages are favored over any of the internal scission pathways. On the other hand, Ni-containing systems, and particularly the RuNi model, promote the internal C-C scission of heptane via the formation of allyl groups, which can be further cleaved and hydrogenated to form C1 products. Alternative models of RuNi systems exhibit behaviors reminiscent of Ru and Ni (Supplementary Fig. 36), which point to tight structure-performance relationships, in line with the experimental results (Figs. 1, 2).

In a previously-reported screening of metal oxides for hydrogenolysis of polypropylene, titania showed the most marked synergistic effect with Ru, hinting to the possibility of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) besides the promotional effect of Ni33. The electron transfer from TiO2 to the Ru phase has been identified as a likely factor for enhanced selectivity to liquid products in low-density polyethylene hydrogenolysis, though operando characterization would be required to confirm this effect77,78. Additional simulations investigated the structural consequences of SMSI between metals and titania, leading to partial coverage of the Ru surface in view of the semicrystalline phase observed on some regions of the catalyst (Fig. 3a). Our results disclosed an adsorption energy (Eads) of heptane on the anatase TiO2 support used (Eads = – 0.68 eV) which is comparable to its adsorption on metallic Ru, RuNi and Ni surfaces (Eads = − 0.81 to − 0.88 eV). However, the active sites for heptane hydrogenolysis are located on the metal nanoparticles since both internal and terminal C–C cleavage are endothermic on anatase TiO2. These results suggest that TiO2 could facilitate hydrocarbon adsorption and thus promote cleavage on the metallic sites if the Ru-TiO2 interface is preserved. In this regard, adsorption of reactants could stabilize the titania phase and hinder its migration onto the Ru surface, hindering the formation of SMSI architectures.

Previous analysis has focused on how catalyst structure influences C–C cleavage mechanisms in order to explain the differences in hydrogenolysis behavior. Nevertheless, the nature of the HDPE and the presence of additives may play a key role in influencing performance. Different results were observed in Fig. 1d for hydrogenolysis of HDPE100, HDPE200 and caps over the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst, showing that the processing of caps was most challenging. In contrast to virgin HDPE100 and HDPE200 polymer pellets, the plastics used in consumer goods also contain additives (e.g., colorants, stabilizers, flame retardants, plasticizers or slip agents for processing, among others). The exact composition of these materials is generally a trade secret, including additives among several thousands of reported compounds79. Hence, a preliminary study was performed using HDPE caps of different colors to explore the influence of additives (Supplementary Table 9). Clear caps showed the highest activity and liquid yield (66% yield to C1-C45, with 42% to C6-C45) over the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst. Other colors displayed variable performance, with conversion to C1-C45 between 24% and 57% and more modest liquid yields ( < 10%). Similar trends were observed over the 2.5Ru catalyst (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 9), suggesting that the performance variations originate from the different additives. These results highlight the importance of developing catalysts with enhanced robustness toward the diverse compositions of consumer-grade plastics.

DFT simulations were used to provide a first assessment of the interaction between additives and the catalyst surfaces. Herein, we evaluated the interaction of long-chain amides often added to bottle caps as slip agents80. When considering the adsorption of a surrogate molecule (butyramide) on defective surfaces of Ru, RuNi, and Ni, butyramide binds more strongly to the active sites than heptane (Supplementary Table 16). This indicates that the presence of such additives may have a profound effect on catalyst performance for hydrogenolysis reactions due to active site poisoning or preferential reaction, potentially leading to byproducts such as ammonia that could interact with the catalyst surface41.

The selectivity control achieved toward liquid products on XRuYNi catalysts led to a detailed analysis of a potential plant for processing 20 t h−1 of plastic caps using green hydrogen. Environmental and economic assessments were based on the plant layout in Fig. 5a, which includes catalyst regeneration and product separation to reach the product distribution obtained with 2.5Ru5Ni (Fig. 1d, see Supplementary Fig. 37 for a version with labeled unit operations according to the detailed description provided in the Methods section). Green hydrogen from water electrolysis powered by either off-shore wind or solar power was chosen as a case study, together with the fossil case based on steam methane reforming. The reference business-as-usual (BAU) equivalent consists of a multi-product system which accounts for the fossil-based production of the respective hydrocarbon products as well as the production and end-of-life of HDPE plastic caps.

Breakdowns are available in Supplementary Tables 17–22.

Producing liquid fuels via HDPE hydrogenolysis implies that fossil carbon contained in polymers serves two sequential functions (i.e., virgin plastics and liquid fuels). Compared to the BAU case, which requires fossil carbon to satisfy both markets in parallel, the studied system deploys less fossil feedstock at the production level and embeds less overall end-of-life emissions. Extending the lifetime of the waste polymer via hydrogenolysis delays the carbon release to the atmosphere, thus implying a lower global warming potential (GWP) in a cradle-to-grave scope (Fig. 5b)23. The computation of the GWP for the three cases (fossil, wind, solar) revealed that the fossil hydrogen scenario almost matched the impact of the BAU, while renewable options are more advantageous, with wind yielding ca. 17% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Table 17). In all cases, the larger contributors to carbon footprint were the conventional production of ethylene (67–75%), required for HDPE synthesis and based on naphtha steam cracking, followed by catalyst manufacturing (ca. 22%) due to mining and extraction as represented by Sankey diagrams in Fig. 5c and in Supplementary Fig. 38 for the case of BAU (see Supplementary Table 18 for a detailed breakdown). Hydrogen accounted for a reduced share of the carbon footprint, ranging from 11% (fossil) to 2% (wind). Interestingly, the corresponding techno-economic assessments providing total annualized cost of production (TAC, Fig. 5d and Supplementary Tables 19–22) predicted a favorable outcome from the fossil-free alternatives if products are sold at market price, with expected margin for profit ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 $ per kilogram of product (equivalent to 15–25% over the market price, where the composition of one kilogram of product would reflect the C1-C45 fractions obtained from the hydrogenolysis process). We noticed that, in contrast to other sustainable reactions burdened by the high fractional cost of green hydrogen13,14,15,81,82,83, green hydrogen accounted for less than 30% of the total cost for the solar and wind options. Instead, the collection and processing of plastic caps was the major cost contributor (waste HDPE is a trading commodity in Europe, hence the elevated price). This result points to the economic suitability of hydrogenolysis and the use of renewablegreen hydrogen, providing the first example of an environmentally and economically sustainable route for chemical recycling of polyolefins via hydrogenolysis.

Moreover, a sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the cost of hydrogen and waste HDPE separately by 25% would still lead to a positive profit when considering the average selling price for hydrocarbons in 2019 (Supplementary Fig. 39). Additionally, in periods of geopolitical uncertainty, the market price for hydrocarbons could undergo drastic variations—for example, the global average price of natural gas, gasoline, and diesel sharply increased in 2022 as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict—which could lead to even larger profits for the chemical recycling case, even when all OPEX parameters are set at their upper bound (Supplementary Fig. 39 and Supplementary Tables 23, 24). Similar sensitivity analysis for the GWP followed the same trend, predicting environmental gains under almost all possible scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 40 and Supplementary Tables 25, 26). Nonetheless, LCA and TEA have limitations that stem from assumptions and modeling choices. As the catalyst material greatly impacts both the hydrogenolysis cost and GWP, identifying more durable catalysts with low deactivation rates is essential for making hydrocarbon production even more sustainable and economically viable (Supplementary Table 27).

The confirmed sustainability of HDPE waste hydrogenolysis for this product distribution leaves the question of which other product portfolios would also enable environmental and economic sustainability, raising the Plastic-to-X question. We tackled this challenge by assessing the GWP and economic margin for a series of 19 randomly generated product distributions, taking the BAU as reference system (Supplementary Table 28). To mimic the series character of this reaction, the distributions followed a lognormal form when gaseous products were more abundant, and a Gaussian distribution when liquid products were predominant (examples in Fig. 6a). The set of distributions were selected to span a variety of average chain lengths since this parameter later served as a descriptor for identifying main trends. The GWP and economic margin results can be found in Fig. 6b–d for the three considered sources of hydrogen (numerical values in Supplementary Tables 29–31). Since hydrogen consumption increases as the average chain length of the products decreases, an inverse relation between GWP and chain length was to be expected, as reflected in Fig. 6b–d. Calculations show that hydrogenolysis using wind hydrogen always displays environmental gains versus BAU, whereas solar hydrogen requires an estimated minimum chain length of C5 to this end, a threshold that rises to C10 for fossil hydrogen.

a Examples of randomly generated product distributions based on lognormal (top) and Gaussian (bottom) distributions with indication of their average chain lengths (Supplementary Table 28 for all distributions). Evaluation of hydrogenolysis of plastic caps using hydrogen with either (b) fossil, c wind, or (d) solar origin, showing the gain in GWP compared to the equivalent BAU process (squares) and the margin for profit (circles) per kilogram of total C1–C45 products versus the average chain length of the randomly generated product distributions (see details in the Methods section). The primary y-axis (left-hand side) quantifies the GWP gains obtained by switching from BAU operation to the hydrogenolysis process that generates the same product portfolio. A positive gain indicates that we reduce the GWP of end-products relative to their BAU respective. The secondary y-axis (right-hand side) indicates the margin for profit obtained with the respective process. This unit quantifies the difference between the revenues obtained by selling the different products at market price and the cost of production. Negative values indicate that the cost of production is higher than the achievable revenues, while a positive margin translates to the potential profit obtained through the corresponding process. Minimum average chain lengths to achieve positive GWP gains and profit are indicated. For example, in the case of solar hydrogen, both environmental and economic feasibilities are achieved for chains longer than C11. Breakdowns are available in Supplementary Tables 29–31.

The economic analysis disclosed higher breakeven average chain lengths than for the GWP evaluations, with a consistent threshold of C10-C11 across wind, solar and fossil options. Since sustainability encompasses both environmental and economic dimensions, we can thus provide a first guideline describing how hydrogenolysis of HDPE requires average chain lengths at least in the upper range of the gasoline fraction (C6-C12), regardless of the type of hydrogen used. A more detailed analysis of Fig. 6b–d shows a strong dependence on the average chain length at small values due to the sharp increase in market price from low-value gases (C1-C5) to light and heavy liquid fractions (Supplementary Table 19). This also leads to the plateau in GWP gains and economic margin observed at large average chain lengths, where the motor oil fraction contribution dominates. Overall, these results can guide catalyst design and reaction engineering efforts by establishing performance targets.

In this study, we perform an integrated investigation encompassing catalyst design and systems engineering for the hydrogenolysis of realistic HDPE waste. We first impart selectivity control by developing alloyed RuNi nanoparticles (3-4 nm on average) supported on titania, yielding up to 55% liquid yields, compared to null for monometallic Ru, and with 2.5 wt% Ru and 5 wt% Ni as optimal composition. Operando studies disclosed the formation dynamics of Ru-Ni alloys upon exposure to operating conditions, highlighting the need to incorporate advanced characterization techniques used inother fields in thermocatalysis to chemical recycling of plastics. Experimental and simulation efforts disclosed performance-structure sensitivity in these bimetallic catalysts and their intrinsic ability to promote internal (based on allylic intermediates) vs. terminal C–C bond cleavage through a mediating dehydrogenation-hydrogenation cycle. When bridging these insights with environmental and techno-economic analyses, the sustainability of this technology for processing plastic caps using green hydrogen emerged. Furthermore, the contextualization into the Plastic-to-X framework revealed that product distributions with an average chain length in the upper range of the gasoline fraction (C6-C12) or larger allow uniting environmental and economic feasibility. This work highlights the sustainability potential of polyolefin hydrogenolysis and represents a guideline for future catalyst design efforts.

Commercially available titanium oxide (anatase, Sigma Aldrich) was calcined in static air (5 h, 773 K, 5 K min−1) prior to its use as support during the synthesis. All catalysts were prepared by dry impregnation and sieved to < 0.2 mm particle size before use. For the monometallic Ni and Ru catalysts, only one supported metal is stated when referring to the catalyst. Bimetallic catalysts are denoted as XRuYNi, XRuYNiinv, or XRuYNiFSP depending on the method used for preparation (Supplementary Fig. 1). The content of each metal is reported in front of the respective metal as a percentage by mass (X wt% Ru and Y wt% Ni).

In a typical procedure, 0.500 g of titania was dry impregnated with 0.855 cm3 ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate (Ru(NO)(NO3)x(OH)y, x + y = 3) in diluted HNO3 (0.015 g cm−3, Sigma Aldrich) to obtain 2.5 wt% ruthenium content. The mixture was stirred (353 K, air) with a magnetic stirring bar to evaporate the solvent. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (1 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1).

Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in distilled water to prepare a 0.5 g cm−3 precursor solution (0.1 g cm−3 Ni concentration). Typically, 0.500 g of titania was dry impregnated with 0.153 cm3 (3 wt% Ni), 0.261 cm3 (5 wt% Ni) or 0.550 cm3 (10 wt% Ni) precursor solution to obtain the desired metal content. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (3 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1) and subsequently reduced under flowing hydrogen (5% hydrogen in argon, 3 h, 723 K, 5 K min−1).

0.500 g of the monometallic Ni catalyst was dry impregnated with 0.855 cm3 ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate (Ru(NO)(NO3)x(OH)y, x + y = 3) in diluted HNO3 (0.015 g cm−3, Sigma Aldrich) to obtain 2.5 wt% ruthenium content. The mixture was stirred (353 K, air) with a magnetic stirring bar to evaporate the solvent. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (1 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1).

Typically, 0.500 g of the monometallic Ru catalyst was dry impregnated with 0.153 cm3 (3 wt% Ni), 0.261 cm3 (5 wt% Ni) or 0.550 cm3 (10 wt% Ni) precursor solution to obtain the desired metal content. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (1 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1).

2.5Ru5NiFSP with nominal Ru and Ni contents of 2.5 wt% and 5 wt% was prepared by flame spray pyrolysis by pumping the mixture of precursors in the desired molar ratios for Ru (Ru(III)acetylacetonate, ABCR, 99%), Ni (Ni(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, STREM Chemicals), and TiOx (2-ethylhexanoate, ABCR, 6.4 wt% Ti) through a 0.4 mm needle at a flow rate of 6.0 cm3 min−1 and nebulized by a 6.0 L min−1 flow of oxygen at 1.5 bar. The mist was ignited by a supporting flame generated using 2.4 L min−1 of oxygen and 1.2 L min−1 of methane. Such particle-generating flames reach average flame temperatures of 2500–3000 K, with very fast cooling rates (ca. 106 K s−1). The resulting mixed-metal oxidic nanoparticles were collected on a glass fiber filter (GF/A-6) and used without further treatment.

High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was carried out on a double-corrected microscope JEM-ARM300F (GrandARM, JEOL) operated at an acceleration potential of 300 kV (electron gun: cold-field emitter; ΔE ≈ 0.35 eV). In addition, HAADF-STEM and EDX analyses were also conducted using an FEI Titan Themis transmission electron microscope, equipped with a probe aberration corrector and a SuperX EDX system, operated at 300 kV. Catalyst powder was dispersed in ethanol onto a perforated carbon foil supported on a copper TEM grid.

Nitrogen physisorption at 77 K was carried out using a Micromeritics TriStar II analyzer. Prior to the measurements, samples of ca. 0.1 g were degassed at 473 K under vacuum (10 Pa) for 12 h. The specific surface area (SBET) was estimated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, while the total pore volume (Vpore) was obtained at a relative pressure p/p0 = 0.98.

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was performed on a Rigaku ZSX Primus IV spectrometer equipped with a 4 kW Rh source and LiF (200), Ge, PET, and RX26 analyzing crystal detectors.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer with a D/teX Ultra 250 detector using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) and operating in the Bragg-Brentano geometry. Data was acquired in the 20–80° 2θ range with an angular step size of 0.025° and a counting time of 1.5 s per step.

Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Horiba: LabRAM HR Evolution UV-VIS-NIR confocal Raman system comprising a 325 nm HeCd laser with 2.5 mW power, a 40 × objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.95 (Nikon PlanApo), and a fiber-coupled grating spectrometer (1800 lines per mm). Spectra were collected in a single run with 60 s acquisition time.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted with a Physical Electronics Quantera SXM spectrometer. Monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) generated by an electron beam (15 kV and 49.3 W) was used to irradiate the samples with a spot size of 200 μm. The finely ground samples were pressed into indium foil (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and then mounted onto the holder. During the measurement, electron and ion neutralizers were operated simultaneously to suppress undesired sample charging. High-resolution spectra were obtained by using pass energies of 55 eV while the C 1 s signal at 284.8 eV was used for calibration. CasaXPS (Casa Software Ltd.) was used for all calculations, and relative sensitivity factors used for quantification were taken from the instrument. All spectra were deconvoluted into Gaussian-Lorentzian components with the application of the Shirley background.

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was conducted at the Swiss-Norwegian beamlines (SNBL, BM31) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The X-ray beam was collimated using a double-crystal liquid nitrogen-cooled Si(111) monochromator84. A transmission geometry configuration was used for the analysis under ex situ conditions, using a one-element Si SDD detector with Peltier cooling. For the absolute energy calibration for XAS measurements, metallic Ni and Ru foils were measured. Finely ground samples were mixed with cellulose binder, pressed into a pellet, and then mounted onto the holder. Scanning was performed for both Ni (between 8230 and 9320 eV) and Ru edges (between 22020 and 23100 eV), and the step size was set to 0.5 eV, with a scan duration of 150 s. The beam size was set to 3 × 0.2 mm (horizontal × vertical). The resulting spectra were energy calibrated, background corrected, and normalized using the Athena program from the Demeter software suite85. k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were fitted in the optimal k- and R-windows using the Artemis program. An amplitude reduction factor (S02) of 0.81 and 0.85 were determined for Ni and Ru, respectively, using Ni, NiO, Ru, and RuO2 foils.

Operando XAS and XRD experiments were performed at the same beam station, following this procedure: (i) the catalyst was mixed with HDPE100 in a 1:1 mass ratio and loaded in the quartz capillary with diameter of 1.5 mm, (ii) the sample was placed on the sample holder and flushed with pure H2 and pressurized to 20 bar, (iii) measurements were performed at room temperature (RT) for the fresh catalyst, (iv) heated to 523 K with 5 K min−1 and maintained for 2 h, (v) the system was naturally cooled down to RT and measurements were performed for the used catalyst. XRD data were collected with a Pilatus3 X CdTe 2 M low background detector using a LaB6(111) channel-cut monochromator, set at a wavelength of 0.319162 Å (ca. 39 keV). Averaging procedures and azimuthal integration were performed with the pyFAI software using NIST LaB6 powder as a standard. XRD data were averaged over 60 s.

Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) measurements were conducted with a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. Signals were acquired with pre-equipped thermal conductivity detectors and an attached Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320 O mass spectrometer with Quadera software. Prior to measurements, samples of ca. 70 mg were saturated with 0.5 mL n-C7H16 and dried (293 K, 3 h, air) to remove weakly adsorbed heptane. In the subsequent surface reaction experiment, diluted hydrogen gas (5 vol% hydrogen in nitrogen) was dosed by a set of Bronkhorst digital mass flow controllers while applying a heating ramp (313 K to 1073 K, 10 K min−1). The effluent stream of the instrument was monitored online via the Quadera software to analyze the evolution of the reactants (H2 and n-C7H16) and C1-C7 products.

Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy upon CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) was performed using a Bruker Invenio S Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The as-prepared catalyst (ca. 15 mg) was first dried in the cell and purged with He (20 cm3 min−1) for 0.5 h at 473 K to remove impurities. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was exposed to CO (10% CO in He) for 1 h to achieve a CO-saturated surface. The sample was then flushed with He for 1 h to remove all remaining gas phase and physiosorbed CO. Spectra were continuously monitored and collected every 0.5 min. 

The catalysts were tested in a parallel pressurized batch reactor set−up (BuchiGlasUster, Switzerland) consisting of three 50 cm3 stainless steel reactors (Supplementary Fig. 2). Each reactor was equipped with an electrical heating jacket, active cooling unit (chilled water system), mechanical stirring, temperature/pressure control systems and gas sampling lines (connected to pure hydrogen and nitrogen). Typically, 0.5 g of polyethylene pellets (Mw ~ 100 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.05 g of catalyst were added to a glass inset, and the combined weight was recorded. The inset was then placed inside the reactor. Prior to starting the experiment, the reactor was flushed with nitrogen and hydrogen before being pressurized with hydrogen to the desired pressure (20 bar, unless stated otherwise). The reaction parameters and individual steps were programmed into the SYSTAG Flexsys software before starting the experiment, and during the reaction, instantaneous measurements of the temperature, pressure and stirring torque were recorded to monitor the experimental conditions. The reaction mixture was heated and mechanically stirred for a set reaction time after having reached the set temperature (523 K, 750 rpm and 4 h, respectively, unless otherwise specified). Subsequently, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature with circulating chilled water.

For experiments involving the optimization of reaction conditions, the temperature, pressure, stirring rate and reaction time were set directly in the SYSTAG Flexsys program. Each set of conditions was tested in separate experiments. Different catalyst-to-plastic ratios were achieved by varying the amount of catalyst (0.025 g or 0.05 g) while keeping the HDPE amount constant (0.5 g).

Catalyst reusability was evaluated for the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst at optimized reaction conditions. As described above, each experiment was performed with 0.5 g of polyethylene pellets (Mw ~ 100 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.05 g of catalyst. Approximately 0.03–0.04 g of catalyst could be recovered (20–40% loss) in each experiment, such that several experiments were performed to collect enough used catalyst for subsequent runs (i.e., three experiments for run 1, catalysts recovered and combined, two experiments for run 2). After reaction, the liquid and solid products remaining inside the inset were dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), sonicated (303 K, 0.5 h) and centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 rpm (4430 × g). Part of the liquid was filtered using a syringe for analysis with GC − FID, while the remaining liquid was decanted to recover the catalyst. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (6 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in static air (2 h, 673 K, 5 K min−1) to restore accessibility to active sites, which had been reduced by carbon deposits and/or structural changes. The treated catalysts were sieved to < 0.2 mm particle size before use.

The gaseous products were collected from the headspace of the reactor by connecting a sampling cylinder and analyzed using a gas chromatographer (HP Agilent 6890 GC) equipped with an Agilent J&W PoraPlot Q column (25 m × 0.53 mm × 20 μm) and flame ionization detector (FID) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). H2 was used as the carrier gas, and a heating ramp (308 K to 573 K, 5 K min−1) was applied while the inlet and FID were held at fixed temperatures of 573 K and 473 K, respectively. GC − FID calibration for C1 to C5 products was performed using a standard refinery mixture bottle (Agilent P/N: 5080–8755, Agilent Technologies Inc.) and following a procedure reported elsewhere86. Typically, the mixture bottle was connected to the GC inlet, and the line was flushed for two minutes to remove any residual gases. The sample was analyzed three independent times using the same GC method, and the response factors of each gas were calculated based on their concentrations and the corresponding peak areas in the FID chromatogram.

After each experiment, the glass inset was removed from the reactor and weighed to determine the total amount of gas formed (mgas). Equation (1) gives the yield of each gas (Ci), where Ai is the GC − FID peak integration of a paraffin with i carbon atoms and m0 is the initial mass of plastic used in the reaction. Yields are reported for methane (C1) and other gases (C2-C5).

The liquid and solid products remaining inside the inset were dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), sonicated (303 K, 30 min) and filtered using a syringe before analysis with GC − FID. Samples were analyzed in an HP Agilent 6890 GC (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) equipped with an HP DB-5 HT column (15 m × 0.25 mm × 0.10 μm). A 1 μL aliquot of the sample was injected and a heating ramp was applied (313 K to 648 K, 4 K min−1), while the FID was held at a fixed temperature of 613 K. Initial and final hold times were set at 2 and 10 min, respectively. GC − FID calibration was performed using a certified reference mixture of C7 − C40 n-alkanes in hexane (1 mg cm−3, Sigma-Aldrich) and extrapolated up to C45 owing to the similar response factor of C25-C40 compounds in the motor oil range87. A blank run using only dichloromethane (DCM) was performed prior to each measurement to clean the column. The baseline shift observed in the second half of the program is attributed to the column bleed Supplementary Fig. 3b.

The liquid yields were quantified using MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA). The baseline was found to be approximated well by the msbackadj function, tightly following the baseline of the measurement. A baseline fit was performed for each measurement due to the instrumental drift. For product quantification, the baseline function was subtracted from the signal, and trapezoidal integration was performed on the resulting signal. Calculations were performed on a mass basis, such that Eq. (2) gives the yield of a certain liquid fraction (Ci-Cj) for paraffins with i-j carbon atoms, where Ai-j is the peak integration area across the i-j range, RFi-j is the corresponding response factor, VDCM is the solvent volume used for dilution (50 mL), and m0 is the initial mass of plastic used in the reaction (500 mg).

Equation (2) quantified yields for C6-C12, C13-C20 and C21-C45 products (Supplementary Fig. 3b). Separate areas were obtained across the time ranges [1.45, 14.7], [14.7, 33.7] and [33.7, 80] (in minutes) to consider the gasoline, diesel and motor oil contributions, respectively. Response factors of 0.2796, 0.2186 and 0.1174 mg mL–1 area–1 were used for gasoline, diesel and motor oil, respectively.

Remaining C46+ hydrocarbons and solid products could not be characterized quantitatively through GC − FID due to the maximum temperature settings on the column and were thus considered as solid residue, as shown in Eq. (3). This includes long-chain waxes as well as (unreacted) polyethylene.

Overall, conversion refers to the yield of products in the C1–C45 range and selectivity refers to the fraction of each product within the C1-C45 range, always relative to the starting amount of polyethylene used in the reaction.

Density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.4.4). 88,89. The density functional of choice was Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)90 supplemented with Grimme's D2 dispersion approach and our reparametrized values for metals91,92. Valence electrons were described with planewaves with a kinetic cut-off energy of 450 eV, while inner electrons were represented with projector augmented-wave (PAW) core potentials93,94. We used the Monkhorst-Pack method to generate a \(\Gamma\)-centered mesh with a reciprocal grid size narrower than 0.041 Å−1 to sample the Brillouin Zone95. Spin polarization was included in all simulations involving Ni due to the magnetic character of this element. Inpust and outputs for all DFT simulations can be found online in the ioChem-BD repository (Data Availability section)96,97.

Lattice parameters for different bulk models of Ni, Ru, and RuNi materials were optimized with a kinetic energy cut-off of 800 eV. The energy required for a Ni atom to change from face-centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures is 0.03 eV per atom, while Ru requires 0.12 eV per atom for the reverse transformation. This suggests that Ni may adopt a hcp structure when alloyed with Ru. We used a RuNi bulk from the hexagonal crystal system and space group 187 according to the Materials Project database98.

Based on the optimized bulk materials Ni-fcc, Ru-hcp, and RuNi, different slab models were built to represent the catalysts under study (Supplementary Figs. 33, 34) containing steps and kinks due to the small size of the metal nanoparticles (Fig. 2)99. We employed a p(2 × 6) slab with 18 atomic layers of the Ni(211) facet and p(6 × 6) slabs with 6 atomic layers of the (0001) surfaces of Ru and RuNi (considering both Ni- and Ru-terminated models, as shown by RuNi, RuNi-b, RuNi-c, and RuNi-d). Half of the atomic layers (the outermost ones) were allowed to relax, while the bottommost layers were fixed to their bulk positions. Moreover, a vacuum region of 15 Å was added between slabs and a dipole correction along the z axes was included100. In the case of Ru and RuNi models, only half of the atoms in the outermost layer of the (0001) termination were included to represent a stepped surface. These models were employed to assess key steps for the hydrogenolysis of heptane as a surrogate for HDPE, as displayed in TPSR experiments (Fig. 4a–c). The heptane molecule in the gas phase and clean surfaces were used as thermodynamic sinks. The climbing image nudged-elastic band (CI-NEB)101 was employed to locate the transition states, and their nature was confirmed by computing numerical frequencies with a step size of ± 0.015 Å.

HDPE hydrogenolysis was assessed based on real experimental data on conversion and selectivity of the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst. Aspen Plus v12 was used with the PENG-ROB property method, which deploys the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state and is suitable for non- or mildly polar mixtures containing hydrocarbons and light gases102. Bottle caps were modeled as a polyolefin mimicking consumer-grade polymers with a molecular weight of 200 kDa and an average input flow of 20 t h−1, following assumptions by Salah et al.103.

The process flowsheet is included in Fig. 5a of the main text and Supplementary Fig. 37 and considers current experimental results for conversion and selectivity and detailed downstream separation blocks. A 5% catalyst loss was assumed after ten consecutive runs. (Supplementary Table 27). HDPE (25 °C, 1.013 bar) and hydrogen (40 °C, 20 bar) are fed to the process in stoichiometric amounts before being mixed (M1) and heated to reaction conditions (250 °C) in H1. The reactor (R1) was modeled with the RStoic reactor block. It operates at 250 °C and 20 bar, with the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst enabling the conversion and selectivity described in Supplementary Table 3 for the same conditions. The outlet stream is cooled down to 40 °C (C1) and depressurized to 1.013 bar (V1) before passing through a filter in the presence of n-hexane to regenerate the catalyst, which is recycled into the reactor (R1). The product mixture, which also comprises the used solvent and the unreacted raw materials, is sent to the downstream processing section of the process. To recover the liquid fraction in the filtered stream, the latter undergoes a flash separation, before being recompressed to 25 bar (via the pump P1 for the liquid stream and the compressor K1 for the vapor phase). The excess hydrogen, still present in the compressed stream, is recovered in a pressure swing adsorption unit (PSA). The remaining streams are mixed (M3) and cooled down to 40 °C (C2). The five hydrogenolysis products, i.e., methane, light gases, gasoline, diesel, and motor oil, are separated with high molar purity in six distillation columns (D1–D6), modeled with the DSTWU column model. The unconverted fraction of HDPE is recovered in the reboiler of column D6 and recycled into the reactor. The solvent used to regenerate the catalyst (n-hexane) is recovered in the condenser of column D4, recycled into the mixer M2 and then fed to the catalyst filter. Due to losses in the process, mainly in the recovery of products, a make-up of n-hexane is necessary. Heat integration was performed with Aspen Energy Analyzer v12 to design the corresponding heat exchange network integrating hot and cold process streams.

To assess the economic and environmental potential of implementing hydrogenolysis of polyolefins at an industrial scale, a techno-economic and environmental assessment was carried out using the model described above. Mass and energy balance data were obtained from the corresponding simulation to calculate the cost and build the life cycle inventories (LCI).

The techno-economic assessment (TEA) considered the total annualized cost (TAC) of producing the end-product portfolio and was calculated based on the cost factors and correlations in Sinnott and Towler104. The variable operating cost (VOC) includes the costs of raw materials, electricity, utilities and waste treatment operations, whilst the TAC is calculated as a function of the VOC, the fixed operating cost (FOC) and the annualized capital cost (ACC, Supplementary Table 32), as shown in Eq. (4) below. The used values for parameters a, b, and n can be found in Supplementary Table 33 for each equipment type104.

The ACC was computed considering a plant lifetime of 25 years and a 10% interest rate. Both the FOC and ACC were derived from the capital expenditures (CAPEX), which were calculated using cost correlations from Chapter 6 in Sinnott and Towler104. The CAPEX corresponds to the purchased equipment cost (C) multiplied by the installation factor, where the purchased equipment cost is calculated following Eq. (5) based on a sizing factor (S) and parameters (a and b) that are specific to each equipment unit.

The inside battery limits cost (ISBL) is then calculated based on the purchasing cost (C) and typical installation factors for “fluids-solids” processes, according to the framework described by Sinnott and Towler104 of all plant equipment ( j = 1,…, M) following Eq. (6) below. These factors account for piping ( fp = 0.6), equipment material ( fm = 1 for carbon steel and 1.3 for 304 stainless steel), equipment erection ( fer = 0.5), electrical installation ( fel = 0.2), instrumentation and control (fi = 0.3), civil engineering services ( fc = 0.3), structure and building services ( fs = 0.2), and lagging and paint services ( fl = 0.1). Here we consider that all equipment is made of carbon steel except for the reactor R1 and the PSA unit, which are made of 304 stainless steel as they involve H2.

The total fixed capital cost (FCC) is then estimated from the ISBL to account for offsites (OS), design and engineering (D&E) and contingency (X) as shown in Eq. (7) below104.

The annualized capital cost (ACC) is then calculated from the FCC and the annual capital charge ratio (ACCR), which in turn corresponds to the fraction that must be paid out each year to fully repay the capital investment cost, including principal and accumulated interest (i) over the plant lifetime (n). Both these units are calculated following Eqs. (8) and (9) below, and according to the variables described in Supplementary Table 32.

Finally, the FOC is determined from the ISBL, FCC and cost of labor (CL), following the approach described by Sinnott and Towler104. It comprises expenses linked to operating labor (CL), supervision ( fsup = 0.25), salary overheads ( fso = 0.6), maintenance ( fmt = 0.05), property taxes and insurance ( fti = 0.02), rent of land ( frl = 0.02), environmental charges ( fec = 0.01), and general plant overheads (fpo = 0.65). It is calculated following Eq. (10) below. The CL corresponds to four operators (three shift positions plus one operator for the solid catalyst regeneration section) with an average salary of USD 60'000 per person.

All values of the TEA are expressed in USD 2022. Cost data was adapted to the selected year with the Chemical Engineering plant cost index (CEPCI) whenever not directly available. The CAPEX results are displayed in Supplementary Table 34 and the cost parameters used in the VOC are displayed in Supplementary Table 35.

The LCA followed the methodology described in the ISO 14040/14044 standards105,106 with the Ecoinvent 3.8 database107 as background system and the outputs of the process simulations as foreground data. The global warming potential (GWP) of the different scenarios was calculated with the IPCC 2021 method for climate change which accounts for greenhouse gas emissions (including hydrogen and biogenic CO2) as well as short-lived climate forces for a 100-year timespan. The calculations were carried out in Brightway v2.4.3108. The assessment aims to evaluate the life cycle impacts linked to the production, consumption and end-of-life of one kilogram of end-product obtained, in a cradle-to-grave scope. Thus, the life cycle inventories (LCI) were defined for multi-product systems that account for the production and end-of-life of HDPE as well as the production and consumption of a portfolio of petrochemicals that substitute the products of hydrogenolysis in the global market. For the hydrogenolysis scenarios, the LCIs of the different end products consider the complete life cycle of HDPE, which includes the extraction of raw materials, the HDPE production steps, use phase, waste collection and sorting, chemical recycling via hydrogenolysis, and the end-of-life of the hydrogenolysis products. The latter is direct combustion for all hydrogenolysis products, given that they are used as fuels or products that are present in combustion engines (motor oil). The business-as-usual (BAU) equivalent consists of a multi-product system which accounts for the fossil-based production of the respective hydrocarbon products, as well as the production and end-of-life of HDPE (here, it was assumed that 30% of the waste polymer is incinerated and 70% landfilled). Supplementary Tables 36–38 contain the LCI data used in the LCA calculations.

The techno-economic and environmental assessments were systematically repeated for a series of hypothetical product distributions at the outlet of the hydrogenolysis reactor (R1 in Supplementary Fig. 37). This analysis was carried out to identify possible catalysts that would enable a margin for profit while reducing the environmental burden generated by the analogous BAU system.

The framework consists of five steps executed in series. First, 19 hypothetical product distributions (ten normal and nine lognormal) were randomly generated based on inferred parameters, which ensure a feasible range for the products, i.e., all distributions were truncated between C1 and C50, the means were sampled between C1 and C40, and the standard deviations could range between ±2 and ±13 carbon atoms. In the second step, the conversion data for the hypothetical catalysts was derived from the obtained histograms and plugged into the RStoic reactor (R1) iteratively before each adapted simulation was run. The columns were adjusted to still meet the product specifications while yielding different amounts of them. More precisely, the distillation columns were activated or deactivated (by-passed) considering the specific product distributions in each case (i.e., the absence of methane at the outlet of R1 implied that D1 was by-passed). All columns operated following the same specifications as in the 2.5Ru5Ni case, considering a 0.999 recovery of the corresponding light key component and a 0.001 recovery of the heavy key component in the condenser; total condensers with liquid distillates were assumed. Only active columns were considered in the CAPEX and OPEX calculations for the different cases. In the third step, the heat exchanger network for each adapted flowsheet was then derived with Aspen Energy Analyzer v12.

The CAPEX, OPEX, and TAC were calculated based on the mass and energy flows, following the described TEA methodology. Finally, the LCA was performed and the results of each product distribution were compared to their analogous BAU system, which corresponds to the conventional production of the issued product portfolio (i.e., C1, C2-C5, C6-C12, C13-C20, C21-C45) in the respective amounts as obtained in the reactor that follows the hypothetical product distributions, as well as the production and end-of-life of HDPE.

The Santana Group in Northeast Brazil has yielded a remarkable discovery: the first filter-feeding pterosaur from the tropics, named Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. This new taxon provides key insights into the evolutionary history and ecological diversity of Ctenochasmatidae, a clade known for its specialized feeding adaptations. Bakiribu exhibits extremely elongated jaws and dense, brush-like tooth rows, similar to Pterodaustro but distinct in tooth cross-section and spacing. Paleohistological analysis of the teeth revealed well-preserved dentine and pulp cavities. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Bakiribu as the sister taxon to Pterodaustro, forming a clade more closely related to Ctenochasma than to Gegepterus, which is reinterpreted as a non-ctenochasmatine. Regarding some specific traits such as tooth density, elongation, and count, Bakiribu is intermediate between Ctenochasma and Pterodaustro, thus partially bridging a key evolutionary gap within Ctenochasmatinae. Taphonomic features support the interpretation of the fossil assemblage as a regurgitalite. This discovery brings crucial data for understanding biogeographic dispersal and ecological specialization within Ctenochasmatinae during the Early Cretaceous, and offers rare evidence of predator-prey interactions in the Romualdo Formation paleoecosystem. Together, these findings further underscore the importance of the Araripe Basin as a window into the Early Cretaceous biodiversity.

The Araripe Basin in Northeast Brazil has long been recognized as a valuable site for paleontological research1,2,3,4, yielding numerous significant fossil discoveries from the Cretaceous Period across a wide diversity of taxonomic groups. Among these, the Santana Group stands out for its exceptional fossil preservation, providing valuable information about the morphology, ecology, and evolution of several clades, especially pterosaurs5,6,7,8,9. It has provided dozens of both toothed (ornithocheiriforms) and toothless (azhdarchoids) ornithocheiroid taxa, and hundreds of specimens overall10,11.

Despite over five decades of pterosaur studies in this unit, no archaeopterodactyloid taxa had been formally documented from this unit until now12. Here, we present the first archaeopterodactyloid from the Santana Group, based on a very distinctive specimen from the Romualdo Formation.

Ctenochasmatidae is a clade of pterodactyloid pterosaurs, which thrived during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Recent discoveries have shed light on the diversity and ecological adaptations of this group, particularly through the examination of new fossil specimens from various geographic regions and geological periods13,14. These pterosaurs exhibit a remarkable evolutionary trajectory, characterized by diverse morphological adaptations and a broad geographical distribution. Recent discoveries from China, South America, and Europe have significantly enhanced our understanding of their ecology and highlighted the dynamic evolutionary history of this lineage15,16,17.

Ctenochasmatids thrived mostly from the Late Jurassic to the Barremian but declined progressively towards the late Early Cretaceous. Little is known about the later taxa and how the lineages moved and diversified between Laurasia and Gondwana. Indeed, the only Gondwanan ctenochasmatid taxa known from before this study are: the ctenochasmatine Pterodaustro guinazui, from the Albian of the San Luis province, Argentina, and the gnathosaurine Tacuadactylus luciae, from the Upper Jurassic of Uruguay; with other ambiguous material from Argentina and Chile as well18,19,20,21,22.

Within Ctenochasmatidae, the subclade Ctenochasmatinae is distinguished by elongated snouts and numerous fine teeth, adaptations associated with their unique feeding strategies. The evolutionary trajectory of this group has been illuminated by discoveries such as Liaodactylus primus, from the Upper Jurassic of western Liaoning, China14, which demonstrates a notable ecological transition from fish-catching to filter-feeding within the clade. An extreme morphology can be found in the ctenochasmatine Pterodaustro guinazui, which exhibits a thousand hyper-elongated baleen-like teeth on the lower jaw13,23,24. The extreme morphology of Pterodaustro indicates a hyper-specialization towards filter-feeding23. To account for the distinctiveness of this form, the clade Pterodaustrini was defined by Andres et al. 25 as the “most inclusive clade containing Pterodaustro but not Ctenochasma”, and includes Beipiaopterus, Gegepterus, and Pterodaustro according to recent works26,27,28.

Here we describe Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov., a new pterodaustrinin pterosaur from the late Aptian-early Albian Romualdo Formation of the Araripe Basin, Northeast Brazil. This taxon exhibits a mosaic of traits shared with both South American and European relatives, contributing to our understanding of their evolutionary history and paleobiogeography from a low-latitude Gondwanan context.

The material described here comprises one part and its counterpart of a typical calcareous concretion from the Romualdo Formation, Araripe Basin, Northeast Brazil (Fig. 1). The concretion contains two individuals of the new pterosaur species, along with four fossil fish (likely Tharrhias). The material was originally housed in the paleontology collection of the Museu Câmara Cascudo (MCC) at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Natal, Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil, under catalog numbers MCC1271.1-V and MCC1271.2-V. The specimen had been stored in the museum's collection for many years without formal identification, kept among other fossils originating from the Araripe region, unfortunately, without precise provenance and date of collection.

Upon identifying this material as a new species, we contacted the director of the Museu de Paleontologia Plácido Cidade Nuvens (MPSC) in Santana do Cariri, Ceará state, Brazil, and facilitated an agreement to transfer one-half of the concretion (MCC 1271.2-V) to their collection. This initiative aimed to support the preservation of significant specimens (such as holotypes) within their region of origin, contributing to local development. Consequently, part of the material is still housed at the Museu Câmara Cascudo (MCC 1271.1-V), while the other part is currently deposited at the Museu de Paleontologia Plácido Cidade Nuvens under a new register number, MPSC R 7312 (originally MCC 1271.2-V).

A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships of the new species herein analyzed within Ctenochasmatidae. For this purpose, we have utilized as a basis a previous phylogenetic matrix26, with the inclusion of the species herein described, and revised codifications for the ctenochasmatids Ctenochasma elegans, Gegepterus changi, and Beipiaopterus chenianus (see Supplementary Material). The analysis was conducted under maximum parsimony, using the software TNT 1.529. The analysis was divided into two steps, following the same protocol as previous works26. New Technology Search (default parameters) was used for the first step, with random seed = 0. Subsequently, a Traditional Search swap was performed using trees from RAM (using TBR, 10000 replications, collapsing trees after search). All characters were treated with equal weight. A TNT file (in txt format) containing the data matrix, ready for analysis execution in TNT, is available as supplementary information.

We sampled a portion of a tooth row from one of the halves of the calcareous concretion using an electronic Dremel® saw. The cut was perpendicular to the tooth axis and did not reach any cranial bone. We applied PaleoBOND® penetrant stabilizer to improve sample resistance. It was embedded into Araldite 2020® epoxy resin. The sample was later ground to a thickness of approximately 60 μm. It was photographed on an Olympus BX53M petrographic microscope with both parallel and crossed nicols, with the lambda compensator. We followed Cerda & Codorniú13 for tooth description. We followed Terra et al30. for carbonate rock classification.

Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov.

Overview of the concretion containing the remains of Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. (holotype and paratype) and four associated fishes. A, Part (MCC 1271.1-V). B, Counterpart (MPSC 7312). C and D, Schematic drawings of MCC 1271.1-V and MPSC 7312, respectively. Scale bar equals 50 mm.

Etymology. The generic epithet comes from bakiribú (Kariri word for ‘comb'), in allusion to the typical comb-like dentition of ctenochasmatids. The specific epithet comes from waridzá (Kariri word for ‘mouth'). Together, the binomial name not only highlights the distinctive dental morphology of the taxon but also honors the cultural heritage of the Kariri people, Indigenous inhabitants of the region where the fossil was discovered.

Holotype. MCC 1271-Va/MPSC 7312a (Figs. 2 and 3A and B), a partial rostrum. Based on position and orientation, fragments b, c, and d most likely belong to the same individual (Fig. 3B).

Paratype. MCC 1271-Ve/MPSC 7312e (Figs. 2 and 3A and C), a distinct partial rostrum. Fragments f and g are tentatively regarded as part of the same individual (Fig. 3C).

 Horizon and Locality. This fossil was preserved in a calcareous concretion of the Romualdo Formation, Araripe Basin, Northeast Brazil. This unit is late Aptian-early Albian in relative age31. The precise locality of this concretion is unknown, but the Romualdo Formation outcrops east-west along the Araripe Plateau between the states of Pernambuco, Ceará, and Piauí1,2.

Diagnosis. Ctenochasmatine pterosaur with the following combination of features, including autapomorphies (marked with an asterisk): jaws extremely elongate (estimated rostral index of ~ 12–16); teeth closely packed together (interdental gaps under tooth diameter); high tooth density (17.6 teeth/cm); high tooth count (between 110 and 142 per jaw, per side, as preserved; total estimate = between 440 and 568); teeth long and slender (elongation index surpassing 1:60); acrodont-like tooth implantation on both jaws*; and tooth crowns subquadrangular in cross-section*.

Reconstruction of the type specimens of Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. A, close view of MCC 1271.1-V (main part). B, simplified schematic reconstruction of the holotype based on fragments a, b, c, and d. C, simplified schematic reconstruction of holotype based on fragments e, f, and g. Scale bar equals 10 mm.

Description. The material comprises a large number of dentate jaw sections jumbled together, lying close to four fish specimens. An indeterminate metatarsal and an indeterminate pedal phalanx are also present, as are some indeterminate bone fragments.

It is difficult to determine the anatomical position of most jaw sections. However, four jaw fragments preserve the tip (Fig. 3). The preservation of four jaw tips suggests the presence of at least two specimens, which together would account for two upper and two lower jaws. The three best-preserved jaw fragments (MPSC 7312a, c, and e) all preserve a slightly expanded tip, with fragments a and c being of similar size, and both slightly more expanded than fragment b (Fig. 3A). The fourth jaw tip (fragment f) comprises a smaller fragment, not so well-preserved. We accordingly interpret the larger tips (a and e; Fig. 4A-D) as upper jaws and the less-expanded tips (c and f) as lower jaws, based on the proportions seen in Ctenochasma elegans SMNS 81,803, wherein the upper jaw tip is slightly more expanded than the lower one32. Based on their close position and similar orientation, we tentatively interpret fragments a and b as belonging to a single individual (herein elected as the holotype; Fig. 3B). Fragment e, which represents a second upper jaw tip (and therefore a second individual), is chosen as a paratype. Fragment f is tentatively identified as belonging to the same individual as fragment e (Fig. 3C).

Details of MCC 1271.1-V (main part) and respective schematic drawings. A and B, fragment e (paratype), a rostrum. C and D, fragment a (holotype), a rostrum. E and F, fragment d (holotype?), a partial dentary symphysis. Scale bars equal 10 mm.

The jaw sections are all elongated and dorsoventrally compressed, as is typical of ctenochasmatines. Most jaw sections are almost straight in orientation. Still, one fragmentary mid-section is slightly upcurved (Fig. 4E, F), indicating the presence of a slight upturn along the rostrum, similar to the condition seen in Gegepterus changi33.

The jaw sections exhibit an extensive comb-like dentition, comprising a high number of slender, curved teeth. The teeth are oriented anterolaterally in the coronal plane and lateroventrally in the transverse plane. The teeth are quite closely packed together (interdental gaps are inferior to tooth diameter; see Fig. 4E, F), behind only those of Pterodaustro guinazui in which the teeth actually contact each other13. Preserved tooth density equals 17.6 teeth/cm. Estimated total skull length ranges from 9 to 12 cm (simple scaling based on Ctenochasma and Pterodaustro, respectively; see Tables S1-S3). The estimated total tooth count per jaw, per side ranges from 110 to 140 (see Tables S1-S3).

The jaw sections lack alveoli, and the teeth seem to be attached to the bone in an acrodont-like style (Fig. 4E, F). This is similar to the condition seen in the upper teeth of Pterodaustro guinazui, and unlike other pterosaurs23,33. Still, Bakiribu differs from Pterodaustro in that such acrodont-like implantation is present on both jaws, rather than only on the upper jaw as in Pterodaustro (23,33). The base of the teeth is slightly expanded, in a petiolate-like style (Fig. 4E, F). Presumably, the teeth were attached to the jaws through connective tissue, as has been proposed for the upper teeth of Pterodaustro guinazui (23,33).

In cross-section, tooth crowns are subquadrangular in shape, uniquely among ctenochasmatids (see Fig. 5). In other ctenochasmatids, tooth crowns are nearly circular, as in the ctenochasmatines Gegepterus changi, Ctenochasma elegans, and Pterodaustro guinazui13,32,33, as well as other ctenochasmatids such as Balaenognathus maeuseri, Pterofiltrus qiui, and Feilongus youngi; or elliptical, such as in the gnathosaurines Tacuadactylus luciae and Lusognathus almadrava15,16.

The thin section showed a tooth row preserved in a calcareous concretion with moderate taphonomic artifacts (Fig. 5). There is no evidence of lithostatic compression. The concretion comprises a wackestone supported by ostracodes and foraminifera (Fig. 6). Foraminifera are less abundant and zoned at the same layer as the pterosaurs and fish. Diagenetic micrite and calcite slightly damaged the specimen. Nonetheless, dentine was preserved, and general tooth morphology could be assessed. The tooth outline is subrounded to subquadrangular in transversal view. The interdental space is short. The pulp cavity has been preserved.

Our search produced 27 most parsimonious trees, with 2191 steps each. The strict consensus tree (Fig. 7) has a consistency index of 0.355 and a retention index of 0.802. Bakiribu was recovered as the sister species of Pterodaustro guinazui in the strict consensus (Fig. 7), this relationship being supported by 5 synapomorphies: character 197(2), mandible main axis upturned; character 253(1), dentition extension surpassing 70% of jaw length; character 258(1) mesial teeth nearly touching (spacing under half of alveolar diameter); character 280(3), mesial tooth elongation surpassing 60 times width; and character 305(1), absence of upper alveoli.

Before this study, the Pterodaustrini (sensu Andres et al25.) were thought to comprise three taxa: Pterodaustro guinazui, known from hundreds of specimens from the Albian Lagarcito Formation of Argentina23,34; Gegepterus changi, known from two specimens (including skulls) from the Barremian-Aptian Yixian Formation of China33; and Beipiaopterus chenianus, known from a single specimen (lacking a skull) from the same formation (see26,28). Morphological features supporting the close affinities of Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi included an upturned rostrum and mandibular tips, a craniomandibular articulation posterior to the center of the orbit, an ascending process of the jugal anterodorsally inclined, and cheek alveoli set in grooves26,28.

However, the current study does not find support for these features as synapomorphies of a clade joining Pterodaustro and Gegepterus to the exclusion of Ctenochasma. An upturned rostrum and mandibular tips, a craniomandibular articulation posterior to the center of the orbit, and an ascending process of the jugal anterodorsally inclined are all features that can be seen in Ctenochasma elegans32; moreover, the craniomandibular articulation actually lies beneath the anterior, not posterior, half of the orbit in Gegepterus. The last two features can be seen in Ctenochasma taqueti as well35,36. Furthermore, the groove that houses the teeth of Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi are not quite equivalent. The alveolar groove that is present in the lower jaw of Pterodaustro guinazui represents, in fact, a series of confluent alveoli, wherein each tooth contacts each other and no interdental gaps separate each tooth/alveoli (= aulacodonty; 13). This is distinct from the condition seen in Gegepterus changi, which is not aulacodont. In this form, the alveoli are individualized and separated by interdental gaps, though placed in a shallow lateral groove that runs along the dentigerous margin33. In other words, the lower alveoli of Pterodaustro guinazui are the groove itself, rather than being set in a groove as is the case with Gegepterus changi. It is thus clear that the grooves seen in the jaws of Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi do not correspond, and should not be coded as such.

Following coding corrections about the aforementioned features, we presently recover Pterodaustro (and Bakiribu) as closer to Ctenochasma than to Gegepterus, which is recovered as a non-ctenochasmatine (Fig. 8). The relationship between Ctenochasma and Pterodaustrini (= Pterodaustro + Bakiribu), to the exclusion of Gegepterus, is supported by: characters 34(1), jaw anterior region with subparallel lateral margins; and 151(1), craniomandibular joint located below the posterior half of the orbit. Moreover, Pterodaustro and Ctenochasma share several features that are absent in Gegepterus, such as: character 257(1), tooth spacing approximately even along jaws; 264(2), mesial teeth long axis sigmoidal; character 265(1), all tooth crowns procumbent; and character 281(2), mesial teeth elongation surpassing 20 times width.

Gegepterus and Beipiaopterus are herein reinterpreted as closer relatives of Forfexopterus and related taxa (Elanodactylus and moganopterines) than to ctenochasmatines such as Pterodaustro (Fig. 8). Gegepterus and Beipiaopterus share with Forfexopterus characters 382(1), coracoid distal end with distinct cotyles; and 489(1), fourth wing phalanx with an expanded distal tip. Beipiaopterus further shares with Elanodactylus and Forfexopterus characters 483(1), third wing phalanx subequal or longer than the first; and 484(1), third wing phalanx subequal or longer than the second (unknown in Gegepterus).

Of note regarding Beipiaopterus is its fourth wing phalanx, previously misinterpreted as a third one - notice the curvature and expanded tip37 that render it indistinguishable from the fourth phalanges of Gegepterus and Forfexopterus (see33,38). It is presumable that the oddly hyperelongated element previously interpreted as a first phalanx actually represents phalanges 1 plus 2, with their articulation obliterated by breakage on the slab (see37).

Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. shares with Pterodaustro guinauzi the very dense brush-like tooth row. Notwithstanding, the interdental space in Bakiribu (Fig. 5.E) is twice as wide as in Pterodaustro (Fig. 5.F), without teeth contacting each other in a row. Teeth in Bakiribu are also slightly quadrangular in cross-section compared to the “pencil-like” circular shape seen in Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi, as well as non-pterodaustrinin ctenochasmatids such as Ctenochasma SMNS 81,80332, Balaenognathus maeuseri NKMB P2011-63339, Feilongus youngi IVPP V1253940, Huanhepterus quingyangensis IVPP V 907041, Moganopterus zhuiana HGM 41HIII-041942, and Pterofiltrus qiui IVPP V1233943. Tooth cross-section, quantity, and size remained plesiomorphic in ctenochasmatids relative to Pterodaustro and Bakiribu, which present numerous, dense brush-like tooth rows of extreme elongation.

In certain ways, the dentition of Bakiribu is anatomically intermediate between the older Ctenochasma and the younger Pterodaustro, thereby showcasing an evolutionary transition within ctenochasmatines throughout space and time. More specifically, Bakiribu is intermediate between these forms in elongation, density, and count of the filamentous teeth; in these regards, values for Bakiribu are all higher than in Ctenochasma but lower than in Pterodaustro (Table S1).

Despite the less dense tooth row in Bakiribu compared to Pterodaustro, it featured filamentous teeth on both the upper and lower jaws. This unprecedented high density of filamentous teeth on both jaws might have rendered Bakiribu enhanced, unique filtering capabilities.

The pterosaurs and fish were preserved within a wackestone concretion rich in non-oriented ostracodes and foraminifera, similar to other Romualdo Formation concretions3,44. The co-occurrence of densely packed, semi-articulated, and fragmented pterosaur bones (predominantly aligned in subparallel orientation) together with a cluster of similarly aligned fish supports the interpretation of the assemblage as a regurgitalite, a mass of indigestible material expelled orally by a predator45.

An alternative explanation is the floating carcass model, which posits that buoyant carcasses disarticulate through soft tissue decay before sinking (e.g.,46,47). However, this scenario fails to account for the observed bone breakage and the consistent alignment of elements. Regarding the alignment, the low-energy depositional setting of the Romualdo Formation would not facilitate hydraulic reorientation, and the absence of bone abrasion further indicates minimal post-mortem transport following decomposition.

The configuration of the fish within the concretion adds critical taphonomic context. Their uniform orientation mirrors a feeding behavior commonly observed in extant piscivorous vertebrates, particularly birds. Most piscivorous birds typically ingest their prey whole, head-first. Swallowing fish head-first minimizes the risk of injury from backward-facing spines and fins while facilitating smoother passage down the predator's throat, reducing resistance and the likelihood of choking48,49,50. The tightly clustered arrangement of the fish, in close association with the pterosaur bones, further supports the regurgitalite scenario. Orally expelled material is often embedded in mucus envelopes that maintain cohesion during egestion, which also prevents the dispersion of skeletal elements and preserves their relative positioning within the mass51,52.

The type of association observed in the concretion, combined with its mode of preservation, is unusual for the Romualdo Formation (see Saraiva et al.44). When considered alongside the taphonomic evidence above, these features strongly support the interpretation of the fossil as a regurgitated mass.

There is no clear macroscopic evidence of digestive corrosion on the bones or scales. This suggests that the material was expelled shortly after ingestion, before significant chemical alteration in hard tissues could take place. Digestive etching is more characteristic of cololites and coprolites53, though it has been occasionally reported in regurgitalites (e.g.,54). Degrees of digestive modification within a single regurgitate can vary substantially: modern and fossil analogues document pellets containing minimally digested, sometimes nearly complete elements and/or articulated skeleton subsets, depending on prey type/size and short gastric residence prior to egestion53,55,56,57.

Fracturing of the pterosaur bones most likely occurred during ingestion, as a result of mechanical processing by the predator. The absence of associated soft tissues is consistent with the hard-part bias of regurgitalites, produced by preferential digestion of soft tissues, and may have been compounded by post-burial alteration. Syntheses on bromatolites and regurgitates emphasise these preservational filters, which parsimoniously explain the association of nearly complete fish (likely more recently ingested) with mostly defleshed, fractured pterosaur rostra and teeth (ingested earlier) in our material58,59.

Based on the spatial arrangement of the remains, it is plausible that the predator consumed the pterosaurs first, followed by the fish, and subsequently regurgitated a portion of the ingested mass, likely in response to mechanical discomfort or obstruction caused by pterosaur skeletal elements. Regurgitalites commonly record only a subset of the stomach contents, rather than the complete dietary inventory58,59. Consistent with this, studies of modern predators show that regurgitation often occurs without full gastric evacuation60. This framework explains the association of nearly complete fish with disarticulated and fractured pterosaur cranial elements in our specimen.

Among potential predators in the Romualdo Formation paleoecosystem, spinosaurid dinosaurs and ornithocheiriform pterosaurs stand out as likely candidates, given their piscivorous adaptations and documented presence in the region61,62,63. Notably, direct evidence of pterosaur consumption by spinosaurids, a spinosaurid tooth embedded in an ornithocheiriform cervical vertebra, has been reported from the same formation64.

Although large ornithocheiriforms are also present in the Romualdo Formation, their likely limited stomach volume may have precluded ingestion of such a substantial mass of bone and fish, with the possible exception of Tropeognathus mesembrinus, which reached wingspans exceeding 8 m65. Considering body size, feeding ecology, and existing evidence of pterosaur consumption, spinosaurids emerge as the most plausible producers of the regurgitalite described here, providing additional information on the group's dietary behavior and trophic interactions.

Ctenochasmatids are well-represented in other Lower Cretaceous deposits, most particularly in the Jehol Group of China, as well as the Lagarcito Formation in Argentina66. The previous absence of ctenochasmatid remains in the Romualdo Formation, allied to the regurgitalite nature of the present discovery, suggests that the overall absence of ctenochasmatids in the Romualdo Formation may be attributed to environmental factors. It is plausible that the specimens described here are allochthonous, having been consumed by a large predator in a different environment and subsequently regurgitated within the Romualdo Formation depositional area, which comprises coastal to pelagic paleoenvironments (e.g.,3; Fig. 8).

Ctenochasmatids are overall associated with calm waters, such as lacustrine and lagoonal environments, being rare in fluvial deposits (e.g.,67) and seemingly absent from non-lagoonal marine environments until now. The Barremian-Aptian Yixian Formation, from China, where several ctenochasmatid species have been discovered (e.g., Gegepterus, Gladocephaloideus, Pterofiltrus), is characterized by lacustrine deposits, as well as the Aptian-Albian Lagarcito and Jiufotang formations, in Argentina and China, where respectively Pterodaustro and Forfexopterus were found. In turn, the Solnhofen Limestone beds (Upper Jurassic of Germany), from where Ctenochasma and Gnathosaurus stem, is mostly represented by calm lagoonal paleoenvironments68,69,70. Thus, ctenochasmatids are typically associated with calm water environments, which supports the allochthonous hypothesis.

Artistic reconstruction of the filter-feeding pterosaur Barikibu waridza gen et sp. nov. in the Early Cretaceous Romualdo Formation environment. The spinosaurid in the background represents the putative predator that produced the regurgitalite described herein. Author: Julio Lacerda.

Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. represents the first unequivocal record of a ctenochasmatid pterosaur from the tropical latitudes of Gondwana and the first archaeopterodactyloid documented in the Romualdo Formation. Its unique combination of anatomical traits—particularly its very elongated jaws, dense dentition with long and slender teeth, subquadrangular crowns in cross-section, and acrodont-like tooth implantation in both jaws—sheds new light on the evolutionary trajectory of filter-feeding pterosaurs.

The exceptional preservation of the specimen within a regurgitalite, alongside head-aligned fish remains, provides rare direct evidence of trophic interactions in the Early Cretaceous Araripe paleoecosystem.

This discovery not only fills a paleobiogeographic gap in the distribution of Ctenochasmatinae but also underscores the significance of understudied, long-held museum specimens for revealing key evolutionary and paleoecological insights. Bakiribu adds to the growing evidence that the Araripe Basin serves as a critical window into Early Cretaceous biodiversity, ecological complexity, and continental-scale faunal exchanges.

More evidence has emerged to support the natural origin of comet 3I/Atlas. After several weeks of conspiracy theories, social media debates, and speculation on popular podcasts such as Joe Rogan's, this interstellar object is still a comet. The most recent confirmation came from an observatory in South Africa that detected the first radio signal from 3I/Atlas.

But how? A radio signal? That would have to confirm the object is technlogical in nature, wouldn't it? The thing is, this isn't a radio signal like a transmission emitted by a spacecraft. It's instead a radio frequency pattern detected by MeerKAT, a radio telescope composed of 64 antennas—each with a diameter of 13.5 meters—operated by the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory. And what did it detect? ""OH absorption was detected on the 1665 MHz and 1667 MHz lines,"" according to the researchers.

What MeerKAT specifically detected were lines of radio absorption by hydroxyl radicals, that is, OH molecules, a pattern that would be consistent with typical comet activity. The lines appear as absorption because 3I/Atlas was very close to the sun and the observing geometry favors absorption over emission. This is the phenomenon explained in WIRED a few days ago when the controversy about non-gravitational acceleration arose: When comets reach their closest point to the sun, they sublimate ice into space and receive a greater amount of radiation. This also causes them to alter their trajectory.

The hydroxyl radical (OH) can absorb or emit radiation at specific frequencies (such as the 1665 and 1667 MHz lines) due to transitions in its energy levels. These OH spectral lines have been detected in nebulae, comets, and star-forming regions. OH helps astronomers map the star- and water-born regions of the universe because it can ""glow"" brightly at radio frequencies under certain conditions.

The detection was possible on October 24, five days before 3I/Atlas reached its closest point to the sun. MeerKAT attempted to detect radio signals earlier, on September 20 and 28, although it was unsuccessful. “Five weeks ago, I encouraged radio observatories like MeerKAT to search for radio emission from 3I/ATLAS given that the arrival direction of 3I/ATLAS coincided to within 9 degrees with the arrival direction of the Wow! Signal detected in 1977 at a frequency of 1.4204556 gigahertz,” astrophysicist Avi Loeb wrote in a Medium post. “In response, I was assured that 3I/ATLAS will be monitored by radio observatories like MeerKAT.”

Loeb acknowledged that ""no radio detection of 3I/ATLAS has been reported so far, other than the OH absorption signal."" Of course, continued monitoring of the object would need to be conducted to determine whether the OH production is constant or intermittent, along with factors such as the extent and structure of the tail, to reach more solid conclusions about its nature.

Loeb has been has been among the most vocal advocates of the hypothesis that 3I/Atlas has a technological origin. (And he has already invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team.) The MeerKAT findings have not dampened his drive to probe the comet's nature. ""On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 53 million kilometers from Jupiter. At that time, the Juno spacecraft will use its dipole antenna to search for a radio signal from 3I/ATLAS at low frequencies ranging from 50 hertz to 40 megahertz,"" he wrote.

Will the MeerKAT detection be enough to put an end to conspiracy theories about 3I/Atlas? Likely not, and at least the debates have heightened the general public's awareness of and interest in astrophysics. In the meantime, you can view the trajectory of comet 3I/Atlas here. And don't forget to mark December 19 on the calendar—that's when the interstellar guest will reach its closest point to Earth.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","The Mysterious Math Behind the Brazilian Butt Lift","https://www.wired.com/story/book-excerpt-replaceable-you-mary-roach-butt-implants/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:30:00 GMT","

In the history of gluteal enhancement, Mexico City stands out. It protrudes. It was here, in 1979, that a plastic surgeon, Mario González-Ulloa, first installed a pair of silicone implants designed specifically for the buttocks. The textbook Body Sculpting with Silicone Implants calls González-Ulloa the “grandfather of buttock augmentation.” The early 2000s saw a new generation of Mexico City buttock transformation luminaries, notably Ramón Cuenca-Guerra. In his 2004 paper “What Makes Buttocks Beautiful?” Cuenca-Guerra laid out four characteristics that “determine attractive buttocks” as well as the five types of “defects,” with strategies for correcting each one. I, for instance, have defect type 5, the “senile buttock.” (González-Ulloa's depiction of this took the form of charcoal nudes contrasting “the typical ‘happy buttock'”—high, rounded, dimpled—with its counterpart, the low-slung, drooping “sad buttock.”)

While I understand the value of standardizing procedures and setting guidelines for surgical practice, I tripped over Cuenca-Guerra's methodology. How and by whom had the determinants been determined? Like this: 1,320 photographs of “nude women ages 20 to 35 years, as seen from behind” were presented to a panel of six plastic surgeons, who “pointed out which buttocks they considered attractive and harmonious, and features on which this attractiveness depended.” Oho!

I thought it would be interesting to talk to Cuenca-Guerra about the notion of a visually ideal female figure. As something that could or should be surgically created (or, in the case of the senile buttock, re-created). As something that even exists. I sent an email using the address on a more recent journal paper. There was no reply. Ramón Cuenca-Guerra's buttocks are in worse shape than mine. He has been dead for some time. I was able to reach a colleague of his, José Luis Daza-Flores. Here was the third generation; just as Cuenca-Guerra had studied under González-Ulloa, Daza-Flores had studied under Cuenca-Guerra, extending the lineage and making Daza-Flores, I guess, “the son of buttock augmentation.”

Daza-Flores collaborated with Cuenca-Guerra on a paper called “Calf Implants,” in which the team did for the lower leg what Cuenca-Guerra had done for the butt: laid out “the anatomical characteristics that make calves look attractive” and the “defects” to be addressed. Here again, plastic surgeons were recruited to judge images—2,600 of them, a vast photographic millipede of female legs.

The paper took an unexpected turn. Referring to a marked-up photograph of a lower leg deemed attractive, the authors tried to show that its measurements conformed to what is known in mathematics as the divine proportion (or golden ratio)—1.6 (I'm rounding it off) to 1. When you divide a line into two parts such that the whole length divided by the long part is equal to the long part divided by the short part, both those ratios will be 1.6 to 1. I found an illustration of the divine proportion on a website called Math Is Fun (and convincing no one). The golden dividing line splits the length such that one chunk is roughly two-thirds and the other is around one-third. The ancient Greeks divided the “ideal” face into similarly proportioned thirds. This was the first time I'd seen the divine proportion applied to a leg.

The paper contained sentences like this: “Seventeen women had thin legs, in the shape of a tube, and a mere 1:1.618 ratio in the A-P and L-L projections.” Though I confess to not grasping the particulars of the discussion, I believe that to be a mathematically precise description of cankles.

The paper also cited the Fibonacci sequence, a progression of numbers wherein each successive number beginning with the second 1 is the sum of the previous two. It goes like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 . . . And, beginning with 5 and 3, if you divide two successive numbers instead of adding them—21 over 13, say, or 13 over 8—you will always get, ta-da, the divine proportion: 1.6.

The Fibonacci sequence turns up with some regularity in nature. You can find it in the turnings of the spiral traced by the inner chambers of the nautilus shell as it grows, or the growth path of sunflower seeds—two commonly cited examples. (Less commonly: the branching pattern of the sneezewort plant.) In humans, it's apparently not just calves. Calculator-happy physicians and researchers have published papers purporting to show the golden ratio in the relative lengths of the bones of a finger, the proportions of incisors in relation to canine teeth, the structures of aortic valves and the branching of the coronary arteries, the dimensions of the uterus at peak fertility, “optimal nipple position,” and the helices of DNA.

It is an intriguing, if not entirely convincing, notion: that mathematics defines beauty.

When I wrote to Daza-Flores, he confirmed that when he transfers fat to the hips and buttocks, he follows the Fibonacci sequence. I pictured him with a purple surgical marker and a ruler, drawing arcs and equations on an anesthetized torso. How was he coping with what those in his field refer to as “the Kardashian movement”: the surging demand for rear ends that fall well outside the Fibonacci ideal?

The plastic surgery clinic of José Luis Daza-Flores is on a residential side street in a pleasant Mexico City neighborhood called Noche Buena. The building also contains a day spa and a cosmetic dentist, but nothing about its exterior suggests the upscale beautifying that goes on inside. The waiting area seems designed to calm rather than to impress. The seating is comfy and the room is quiet, the clamor of a Mexico City weekday replaced by synthesized instrumental music and the occasional hushed spritz of a wall-mounted scent dispenser.

The lack of ostentation is in line with my impression of the surgeon himself. He is courteous, soft-spoken, deferential. This is a man who says “por favor” to Alexa when he wants to change the music in the operating room. When he speaks with patients in the waiting area or before surgery, I've seen him reach out to take their hand.

It's 8:15 am now. Daza-Flores sits in the clinic's kitchenette, dressed in scrubs, having an espresso while the morning's patient is prepped for surgery down the hall. He looks young for his age, but not worked on. I don't see any of what his ilk like to call “defects.”

From a folder, I slide out Cuenca-Guerra's “Beautiful Buttocks” paper.

It is an intriguing, if not entirely convincing, notion: that mathematics defines beauty.

In the most respectful way possible, Daza-Flores distances himself from the work. Cuenca-Guerra, he says, concerned himself with the placement and size of buttock implants, but he overlooked the sides of the hips. It is this lateral projection that, coupled with a relatively smaller waist, creates the classic hourglass figure. You can make a pair of butt cheeks protrude from here to Puerto Vallarta, but it won't change the patient's figure viewed head-on. It won't make an hourglass out of a grandfather clock.

In 1973, a few years before Dow Corning worked with González-Ulloa to design the first cosmetic buttock implants, Tennessee surgeon William Cocke pushed a pair of silicone implants under the skin on the flanks of a woman who was “quite concerned about her underdeveloped hips.” The results were described in one textbook as “less than optimal.” Likely this was because implants placed superficially—beneath the skin and fat, rather than under or between muscles—tend to shift, and their contours are often visible through the skin. (In his writeup of the results, Cocke mentions none of this, noting simply that “the patient has since married.” As though narrow hips had stood in the way of matrimonial bliss.)

“To reshape this lateral contour you need fat,” Daza-Flores says. He gets up and takes a bowl from the refrigerator. The timing makes me think for a moment that he's retrieving a bowl of human fat. It's not, of course. It's papaya. He sets it on the table between us. “Fat transfer,” he continues. That is, suctioning fat from one area and injecting it someplace else. The technique is known generally as liposculpture. Specifically and casually, when applied to the nether area (with or without implants), it's a Brazilian butt lift.

“So the surgery has changed,” he says, “but the concept of divine proportions has remained.”

I ask Daza-Flores if he can show me some examples of golden ratio divinity among his patients. He scrolls through photographs on a laptop. Lots of TikTok stars and beauty influencers. “These are pretty close to ideal proportions,” he says. Here's the thing, though. Their befores look pretty ideal too. In 2021, a team of Norwegian and American plastic surgeons published a paper with the subtitle “Golden Proportions in Breast Aesthetics.” Here's what stood out for me: Out of 37 subjects, only five had breasts that conformed to the golden ratio. (An additional four had one golden breast.) “Neither breast was considered optimal for 28 (76 percent [of the]) subjects.” The highest aesthetic ranking belonged to a “virtual subject”—a computer-generated torso. Plastic surgeons and their patients are chasing an ideal that rarely exists in undoctored human anatomy. The more work beauty influencers get done, either surgically or through TikTok filters, the shittier the rest of us feel about our utterly normal-looking bodies and faces.

And here's the other thing: By now, the desired look has eclipsed even Fibonacci's ideals and wandered into the realm of cartoon, of anime.

Before I left, I printed out a series of photographs from the London tabloid The Sun, purporting to show Kim Kardashian from behind in a thong bikini bottom. The woman's buttocks and hips dwarf the rest of her legs, a “defect” referred to in an Aesthetic Surgery Journal paper as the “lollipop deformity,” or “marshmallow on a stick.”

“That to me is not beautiful,” Daza-Flores allows. With his fork, he indicates the fold at the bottom of the woman's butt cheeks. “It's too long, and too creased.” The intragluteal fold, as it is professionally known, should, he says, be more of a gentle ravine and extend no more than a third the width of the buttock. The folds of Alleged Kim's traverse the entire cheek. “It looks like a heavy buttock.”

A woman with double-D breast implants is hefting 4 pounds. When women complain of sagging breasts, Daza-Flores will suggest a lift rather than implants. “If you use an implant—for about six months the breast will look nice, but eventually it will fall down worse than before.”

Daza-Flores slides the printout back to me. “She has everything you can get, all at once. Implants, fat transfer, injections of Sculptra,” he says, referring to a filler. “She's probably getting something every six months. And girls ask for that. They say, ‘I want the Kardashian surgery.'”

And who wins? Fibonacci or Kardashian?

“I try to suggest not going that far,” Daza-Flores says. He tries to get inside their heads, to see why they're asking for this. Is it something their partner wants? He counsels patients against getting implants to please someone else. Because, as he puts it, the surgeries often outlast the relationships. He has had patients who've “changed out their breast implants every time they change boyfriends.”

He also reminds patients that the look is a trend, and like all trends, it will fade. (Indeed, two years later, when I return to this chapter before going to print, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons is reporting an Ozempic-fueled trend for a leaner “ballet body.”)

Daza-Flores drains his cup. “If I don't do it, they'll do it anyway. They'll go with another MD.” Often, that MD is not a board-certified plastic surgeon. It may be an aesthetician or a general practitioner who got a certificate through an online course. Daza-Flores calls them “nomads,” because once the lawsuits start to accumulate, they move to another state. One way to judge practitioners, he says, is to see how long they've been practicing in the same location.

Daza-Flores won't be using buttock implants of any size on this morning's patient, only fat transfer. Lately he's been using implants less often. The Brazilian plant that manufactures his preferred brand burned to the ground, and other companies have been having trouble obtaining or renewing their import licenses. Daza-Flores suspects corruption: government officials demanding exorbitant fees and bribes.

But the main reason is that José Luis Daza-Flores loves to work with fat.

Medical equipment catalogs fascinate me. It never seems to occur to the people who name the equipment and write the copy that anyone but a doctor will be browsing the offerings. Would you otherwise name your liposuction cannula The Fat Disruptor? The Bayonet Infiltrator? Clearing the path for the cannula is the “punch,” which, in the words of the Black & Black Surgical catalog writer, “make[s] the initial stab wound.”

That's done now, and the cannula is in, nosing around the patient's lower back. The to-and-fro of liposuction looks very much like the motion used to wield that other wanded suction appliance. But quicker and more vigorous. More like mopping than vacuuming.

Daza-Flores waits for me to finish nattering. “Grating cheese. That's what it feels like,” he says.

Because 20 percent of the suctioned fat is blood, the stuff moving through the tubing is dark pink rather than yellow. This, combined with the fat collection canister's resemblance to a blender, makes it appear that Daza-Flores is extracting raspberry smoothie from his patient. His wife, also an MD, had worried that I might faint or feel sick at the sight of fat being sucked from a body. If anything, it's making me hungry.

Once the raspberry treat begins to fill the canister, blood cells and serum settle out, leaving a layer of fat above. Daza-Flores uses the verb decant, which adds a touch of class to the proceedings. Some surgeons use a centrifuge to separate out the fat, but Daza-Flores feels that the forceful spinning can damage or destroy the cells. Even with the gentler treatment, around half the injected fat cells will die and be absorbed by the body.

The fat Daza-Flores loves most is the fat most of us hate. Love handles. The blub at the waistband. “This is the fantastic fat,” he is saying. He loves it for the reason we hate it: it is stubbornly persistent. If a person diets, it's often the last fat to disappear. If they start to regain weight, that's where the fat first appears. In liposculpture, Daza-Flores moves the recalcitrant back blub cells away from where they're unwanted and installs them where they're wanted. “The genetic information remains,” he says. Now if a patient puts on weight, it doesn't show up as back blub but as curvaceous hips and happy buttocks. Donor dominance!

For this same reason, Daza-Flores never uses back blub to fill out parts of the face. “If you take it from down here, and then they gain weight, the cheeks get fat.”

Almost done. The cannula has widened the wounds made by the punch. They look like small slots, as though the woman has USB ports. An assistant switches out the cannulas, from aspiration to injection. In all, about 6 quarts of fat have been sucked from the patient, 2 of which will now be injected in her buttocks and the sides of the hips. This is where Fibonacci steps into the room. Daza-Flores starts at the outside flank, spirals down and around, and ends up at the center of the buttock. He likens the path he follows to the spiral of a snail shell, yet another example of Fibonacci numbers in nature. I had imagined him working from calculations, plotting points of the curve on the patient's skin. By now, he says, he can eyeball it.

The injection cannula has a plunger, which Daza-Flores squeezes as he guides the instrument backward. If you could see beneath the skin, it would look like someone decorating a cake. With human fat. Happy birthday! He pauses at the summit of the patient's left buttock.

“Mira. This is a dangerous area.” Underneath the gluteal muscles are several large blood vessels. Even small amounts of fat in the circulatory system can spell trouble, in the form of a “uniformly fatal fat embolism.” I'm quoting a 2018 Australasian Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons press release entitled “The Brazilian Butt Lift Named as the Most Dangerous Cosmetic Procedure.” An embolism is a clot that breaks free and gets stuck in a narrow blood vessel, blocking the flow of blood. If it lodges in the heart or brain or lungs, that's serious trouble.

“There were a lot of deaths,” Daza-Flores says. “A lot of girls dying from fat transfer. We didn't understand what was happening.” Daza-Flores was part of a task force that reviewed the autopsy reports. In every case, fat was found in the muscle. Rather than keeping the injection cannula more or less parallel to the muscle, some practitioners were aiming down into it. Even if the angle was just 10 or 15 degrees off, Daza-Flores says, it was enough for the fat to enter the danger zone.

“They keep dying, to tell you the truth. Probably once a month here in Mexico City. Even now, people are still doing it, injecting into the muscle. There are clandestine clinics with poorly trained or untrained aestheticians.” It happens in the United States as well. Women were dying in Miami so often that in 2019, the Florida Board of Medicine issued an emergency ruling. Florida Administrative Code R 64B8–9.009(2)(f) prohibits the injection of fat into or beneath the gluteal muscles.

I have to say, the patient looks great. Though in my estimation, she looked great when she walked into the waiting room. I support everyone's right to do to their body whatever makes them feel good about themselves, but it would be lovely if feeling good about oneself didn't depend on altering the normal effects of aging. Particularly when the alterations involve the risks of major surgery. Interestingly, a majority of the surgeons in the aforementioned study of surgeons and patients and breasts seemed to feel the same. The surgeons, 45 in all, were asked to imagine that a female partner or acquaintance had come to them expressing dissatisfaction with the size of their breasts. Would they recommend getting implants? Sixty-one percent said no.

Let's see about this one. “Dr. Daza-Flores, what would you say to your mom if she wanted you to do a full-torso liposculpture on her?”

He laughs. “I already operated on my mom.” He extracts the cannula and hands off the empty syringe. “My mom loves surgeries!” He turns to the assistant. “Remember? We did the tummy tuck? But we didn't do fat transfer.”

I recall what he said about embolisms. “Because of the risks?” “Because she didn't want it. She doesn't need it!” An assistant hands him a new syringe of fat. “She's got a very big butt.”

“Mira! I'm making a fossette.” Fossette is the medical word for dimple. A set of supragluteal (above the buttocks) fossettes is one of Cuenca-Guerra's four “determinants of gluteal beauty.” Daza-Flores presses his forefinger into the woman's flesh to keep the fat from filling in that spot, first one side, then the other.

He steps back to assess his work. Removing the fat above the buttocks has given the patient a more defined waist and a longer-looking back. Bringing the torso closer to the golden ratio: two-thirds back and one-third ass. He makes a final sweep. The cannula moves around under the skin like a leg under a bedsheet. There are sounds, recognizable ones—sounds of sloppy eating, of things pulling up out of mud. I'm both disgusted and piteously envious.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Alex Karp Goes to War","https://www.wired.com/story/alex-karp-goes-to-war-palantir-big-interview/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:00:00 GMT","

Alex Karp and I would not seem to have much in common. I work for WIRED, which does tough reporting on Trumpworld; Karp is the CEO of Palantir, a $450 billion firm that has contracts with agencies like the CIA and ICE and worked for the Israeli military during its campaign in Gaza. I live in the East Village of New York City, and the home Karp spends the most time in is a 500-acre compound in rural New Hampshire. (Last year he was one of the highest paid executives in the United States.) I was a plain old English major, and he's got a law degree and a PhD in philosophy, studying under the legendary Jürgen Habermas. I consider myself a progressive; Karp regards that stuff as “pagan religion.”

But we can bond over one shared status: Both of us are alumni of Central High School, a Philadelphia magnet school. (Not at the same time. I have some years on the 58-year-old executive.) Maybe it was that connection that led Karp to agree to a sit-down. The son of a Jewish pediatrician and a Black artist, Karp struggled with dyslexia, and at Central he seems to have turned a corner—even speculating now that overcoming the challenge helped position him for later success.

We conducted our interview at an annual gathering of Palantir's corporate customers. The event had the giddy vibe of a multilevel marketing summit. The customers I talked to—from giants like American Airlines to relatively modest family firms—said that Palantir's AI-powered systems are expensive but well worth it.

Not presenting at the event are the customers who provide Palantir with the majority of its business—the US government and its allies. (The company does not do business with Russia or China.) Palantir was founded to put Silicon Valley's innovation into defense and government technology. With coauthor Nicholas Zamiska (a Palantirian), Karp laid out his philosophy earlier this year in a book called The Technological Republic, a surprisingly readable polemic that skewers Silicon Valley for insufficient patriotism. In Karp's view, the antiestablishment tone of Apple's Macintosh marketing was the original sin in a tech culture that celebrates indulgent individualism and neglects nationalist concerns. At the conference, Karp, dressed in a white T-shirt and jeans, began his opening remarks by saying, “We've been at odds with Silicon Valley on and off since our inception 20 years ago.” In 2020, Karp moved the company headquarters from Palo Alto to Denver, whereupon it became that state's wealthiest corporation.

Some see Karp as a dystopic supervillain. He responds to those critics aggressively, bluntly, and without a shred of remorse. After years of contracts, the company has apparently proven to the government's satisfaction that its tools can effectively leverage information on the battlefield and in intelligence operations. Palantir has a multimillion-dollar contract with ICE involving “targeting and enforcement”—essentially helping the agency to locate people for deportation. In Ukraine, Karp says with pride, the company's products have helped deliver lethal force. Palantir has a Code of Conduct that supposedly binds the company to, among other things, “protect privacy and civil liberties,” “protect the vulnerable,” “respect human dignity,” and “preserve and promote democracy.” In an open letter last May, 13 former workers accused Palantir's leadership of having abandoned its founding values and of being complicit in “normalizing authoritarianism under the guise of a ‘revolution' led by oligarchs.” Karp has also revealed that other employees have left because of the company's work with the Israel military. His retort: If you're not generating opposition, you're probably doing something wrong.

Beneath his fiery defense of Palantir, I sense that Karp yearns to be understood. He noted that all anyone wants to talk to him about is ICE, Israel, and Ukraine. I wanted to visit those subjects, too, and we did. But our conversation also touched on Donald Trump, democracy, and his love affair with German culture. Oh, and Central High.

STEVEN LEVY: I understand that your experience at Central High in Philadelphia was transformational.

ALEX KARP: They gave me an IQ test for the mentally gifted program. My parents had never bothered to tell me to get all A's. But when the person in charge, Mrs. Snyder, got my IQ test she told me, “Clearly you're dyslexic, but someone with your IQ can't get B's, you have to get all A's.” That's when I went from a strong student to an exceptional one. She kind of changed my life.

A lot of people say that it isn't clear exactly what Palantir does. Can you explain it in your own words?

If you're an intelligence agency, you're using us to find terrorists and organized criminals while maintaining the security and data protection of your country. Then you have the special forces. How do you know where your troops are? How do you get in and out of the battlefield as safely as possible, avoiding mines, avoiding enemies? Then there's Palantir on the commercial side. The shorthand is if you're doing anything that involves operational intelligence, whether it's analytics or AI, you're going to have to find something like our products.

Basically, it's about orchestrating information with AI, which is something lots of companies in Silicon Valley want to do. But you contend that no other tech company can do it like yours.

What I'm really saying is we know how to do it. If you find someone else who can do it, and you don't want to work with us, buy it from them.

Is there anyone you consider a competitor?

Our competition is political. The woke left and the woke right wake up every day, figuring out how they can hurt Palantir. If they get into power, they'll hurt Palantir. And by the way, it's global. I view Democrats as my party, but if the Mamdani wing of the party takes over? If that's my party, I'm not in it. Or the right woke wing, which is like, everything is a conspiracy, any use of technology is actually going to only be used to eviscerate and attack us? Palantir is literally the hardest software to abuse in the world, but they don't seem to want it. If you don't want meritocracy, you hate Palantir. That is our competition.

My head's spinning a little. How did Mamdani get in there?

If you explain to the world that labor is going to be valueless, people are going to elect the most ridiculous people ever. They're afraid of an AI-driven, AGI environment where no one has a job. Universities and elite institutions have played a corrosive role here. People are teaching pagan religion views—a new religion with sacrifices. Who's the sacrifice? Me, I'm the sacrifice.

You don't seem constrained to me. You're doing great.

I'm not complaining. We're not victims at Palantir. We're doing very well. We might even do better.

In your book you offer a harsh critique that tech companies are not sufficiently patriotic.

In the beginning, we were at odds with Silicon Valley because we were pro-American, pro-West, and pro-­making the government functional. That was very controversial in Silicon Valley because it equated to not making any money and being a loser. We won that battle. I think Silicon Valley actually has become, at least behind closed doors, patriotic. Silicon Valley has always been pro-meritocracy, and we're very aligned with that. Where we're currently at a misalignment-alignment apex is that we believe in using large language models in a way that creates actual empirical value, but also is very strong for workers. We walked toward the government when everyone walked away. That's how we ended up powering Maven, the US government's AI battlefield plan.

You have been part of the war in Ukraine from the start. What have you learned from that about the battlefield of the future?

I can tell you off the record.

This is a Q and A, so that wouldn't be helpful.

Then I'll give you the on-the-record version, which is almost the same. Broadly speaking, at the beginning of the war it was very clear that you would need software orchestration of small objects. But then the Russians began jamming all devices. The lesson was that the only thing that basically mattered was how to get through the jam space and get your device to deliver its payload. So it's the ability to interact with the device, plan where the device is going, and gather intel from the device. That's very different from how war has been fought in the past.

Is this a scarier form of war?

The way I look at it is: Is America going to be scarier or are our adversaries going to be scarier? You need high-end satellites, you need to be able to coordinate with the satellites, and you need software and large language models. It's advantageous for America because we're very strong in those areas.

Palantir has a unique culture—some even call it a cult. I wonder how much you cultivate the outsider mentality. We're both from Philadelphia; Jason Kelce after the first Super Bowl win was saying, “No one likes us. We don't care.”

People don't understand that there's a massive feature side to being an outsider. It's not pleasant to be unpopular. I don't like it, actually. But you get the best people in the world. If someone says something ridiculously stupid about Palantir, five people look at it and the fifth person says, hey, it can't be as simple as that—this is a really interesting company, and they're thinking of the 10th derivative of a problem, not the simplistic bullshit from someone online who has no idea how our products work. That's exactly the kind of person you want inside your business, or buying your product someday, or investing in you. There's no country in the world where our brand is as bad as in France, but we have the best French employees in the world, working at a company that's apparently a CIA front, which is obviously complete bullshit.

You may not be a CIA front, but you work for the CIA and ICE.

ICE came later. Our first contracts were with US intelligence, our biggest contracts ended up being in the DOD, and then later we started working in Homeland Security under Democrats. Now it's very controversial because it's Trump.

It's controversial because Trump is doing things that we haven't seen done before, particularly with ICE. You have a corporate code that supports democracy and stands against discrimination. Do you track whether your products are being used in ways that violate that code? Is there a line beyond which you would say no to a president?

I was the first CEO to say we would not build a Muslim database. [Editor's note: Technically he was not the first, but considering Palantir's business, the statement was consequential.] I've defended Israel, so I think I'm the last person in the world people would expect to say that. I can't go into details. But I've pulled things from places in the United States where I thought there was something going on like that.

Maybe you and I disagree about ICE because I spent most of my adult life in Europe, in Germany. I am an immigration skeptic. I personally think that citizens have to decide by their vote what immigration policy is going to be. I grew up in a progressive family, but people my age and older were massive immigration skeptics. Open borders is not a progressive policy; it never was. Look at what a version of open borders has done to Germany on any vector.

Let me ask again: Are you monitoring what's happening with the US government and democracy in this country, and asking yourself if you need to take a closer look at how your products are being used?

Let me reframe that. Have I ever worked against our commercial interests because it violated our norms? Yes. Have I done this in government? Yes. We get no credit for this, but we almost went out of business because we were not working in Russia or China. Do I agree with your implicit assertion that what's going on in immigration as you formulate it has never been done before? No. Do you know what happens when you're in Japan, and you overstay your visa for one minute? You are put on a plane. [Ed. note: The Japanese government has received domestic and international criticism for its policy of indefinitely detaining thousands of immigrants.] I do think this is a very valuable line of questioning you're asking—if our product allowed for civil rights abuses, would I intervene? Yes, though our product is the hardest in the world to violate. Do I agree with some of the assertions you just made? No. But you're bringing up exactly the right question, and I'm telling you that I have done this, and I will continue to do it.

Does your Jewish background inform the support Palantir is giving to Israel?

I don't give to Israel. I allow them to purchase our product. Look, you're asking whether we are defined by where we sit or by our ideas? I always think it's both. I view myself as an outsider. There's obviously a particularistic element, no doubt, but I would like to believe that a support of Western values and their robust defense includes something that's not just me doing a derivative of my own identity.

A lot of Jews, me included, feel affinity to Israel but also feel that what's happening in Gaza is intolerable.

If you have five Jews, you have 50 opinions. The issue for Palantir is, do you support Israel? Not do you support every micro decision that Israel is making?

We're not talking about a little thing here.

Israel is a country with a GDP smaller than Switzerland, and it's under massive attack. Some critiques are legitimate, but others are aggressive in attacking Israel. My reaction is, well, then I'm just going to defend them. When people are fair to Israel and treat it like any other nation, which I don't think they do, I will be much more willing to express in public the things I express in private to Israelis.

When you get a letter from 13 former employees saying that Palantir's leadership has failed to stand up to authoritarianism, do you take that seriously?

You have to steelman everything that's lobbed at you. When The New York Times says we're eviscerating human rights, blah, blah, blah, that's complete malarkey. Everyone knows it's malarkey. They know it's malarkey. I certainly steelman [the critiques from] ex-Palantirians and current ones. Anybody making decisions all day is wrong sometimes. But if you attack me irresponsibly, that will harden my view.

Do you have a relationship with Trump?

It depends how you define “relationship.” He's the president of the United States, and I very much respect that. I agree with him on some things, and probably on some things I don't.

Do you like him?

I think he's done a much better job than you think he's done.

Let's not use me.

In the positioning of your question, you're not neutral. Talking to you is just like talking to my family. It's like where me and my family disagree. And I'll tell you where those places are. They're on the border, they're in Israel, and they're in Ukraine. I get yelled at all day about those three issues.

I'd like to meet your parents!

I think if we were family members, in private you and I would disagree, and I would be pointing out that Trump's decisions on AI, and his decisions on the Middle East, are very different than people in the Democratic Party would have made, and very good.

Let's go back in time a bit. You are an unusual CEO. You aren't technical. You went to law school at Stanford and didn't practice but went to Germany for a PhD in philosophy. What do you think Peter Thiel saw in you that led him to choose you to run his defense-related startup?

God only knows, but I would say my best explanation is the same things that made Peter the world's best value investor—he finds people that understand the sixth, seventh, eighth derivative of a problem in a business context. And we were friends. I do think there's a Germanic overlap, in our aptitude for understanding the consequences of a decision very far out. There's a lot of Germanic culture in Palantir—the whole process of going deeper and deeper and deeper into a problem, what we call the Five Whys, is very Germanic. The level of rigor to understand if something is plausibly true, or at least figure out if it's definitively wrong, is definitely a derivative of my education. I would say our high standard of quality is somewhat derivative of authors I read and people I dealt with in Germany.

It seems that Germany resonates with you personally.

I just did very well there. In Germany, let's just say you meet a girl—you don't have to run around saying you love them after, like, the first date. You may go out with someone for years, and you could just be honest, like you really care about them. There's very little white-lie-telling in Germany.

I suspect you don't tell too many white lies in the United States.

There's a higher price for not doing it. I do bring some of that Germanic culture to America, but I do think America is a superior culture.

You seem to live your life the way you want. Not many CEOs live in some remote corner of New Hampshire like you do.

Doing what everybody else wants me to do is much harder for a dyslexic like me than a non-dyslexic, so I don't think I'd be very good at it. Maybe I'm not everyone's cup of tea, but I kind of like being me on most days.

You are a fanatical cross-country skier. What do you think about when you do that for hours at a time?

How happy I am.

9/10

I'm going to get right to it here: I absolutely love this laptop, except for one thing. I'll tell you what that thing is at the end, but you'll probably guess before we're too far into this review.

The ProArt P16 is the latest in Asus' line of high-end notebooks designed for creators on the go. To call this a bleeding-edge device would be an understatement, as it's loaded to the gills with enough tech to remain a dazzler for the foreseeable future.

The specs tell a lot of the story. Outfitted with both an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card, the unit takes an uncommon best-of-both-worlds approach by bundling one of the fastest laptop CPUs and the fastest laptop GPU into a single package. These are complemented by a whopping 64 GB of RAM and a 4-terabyte solid state drive in my tested configuration.

Rating: 9/10

The ProArt P16 features a 16-inch touchscreen with an outstanding resolution of 3840 x 2400 pixels. Asus' Lumina OLED display is Pantone-validated and—by an insane margin—the brightest I've ever measured, over 30 percent brighter than its closest competitor, based on my light-meter testing. Brightness aside, I don't think I've ever seen a better-looking display—and it even sounds great. Six speakers crank out audio that, at full volume, can be deafening at short range.

Connectivity is solid if slightly short of exceptional, featuring two USB-C ports (one with USB 4 support), two USB-A ports, a full-size SD card slot (for camera mavens, surely), and a full-size HDMI jack. The included 240-watt power adapter connects via a separate, proprietary DC-in port, but the unit will also charge (more slowly) via a lower-wattage adapter connected to one of the USB-C ports.

Performance is off-the-charts impressive. It broke Windows-based records on general business and productivity apps, and the unit shone even more brightly when faced with any sort of graphics workload, video game, or AI task that can make use of the GPU. All told, it sets a high mark for performance. (Note that performance will suffer considerably if you aren't connected to a full-power charger.)

All of this sounds like it would require a chassis that's a behemoth, but Asus manages to keep the weight down to just 4.3 pounds, with a maximum thickness of 22 mm. The unit does get a little warm and a little loud under load; the heat is manageable, but the sound can be a bit much.

The laptop doesn't just perform well, it also looks great doing it. Matte black inside and out, with a “stealth hinge” that disappears into the rear of the machine, the device looks modern and understated, with little more than a tiny Asus logo on a corner of the lid by way of flair. The paint is quite smudge-resistant as well. When opened, the unit reveals a thoughtfully designed keyboard with excellent backlighting—though I would have preferred full-height arrow keys instead of the half-height ones here. A numeric keypad would also have been nice, but that would certainly have cramped the design a bit.

The touchpad deserves its own discussion. While the spacious tracking area is responsive (if perhaps overly large), it's the small dial embedded in the pad in the upper-left that immediately draws the eye. This is a feature called Asus DialPad, and it's a special part of the touchpad that can be used to perform context-sensitive functions within apps that support it (largely photo and video editing apps) by dialing in a circle.

In CapCut (which comes installed), the dial can be used for zoom, frame-by-frame stepping in a videoclip, and other adjustment functions. Adobe app support is also broad and preconfigured, but all of these functions can be adjusted by the user in the ProArt Creator Hub settings software. Outside of an app, the DialPad also lets you quickly adjust system volume and brightness without having to take your hand off the touchpad.

A bevy of software is bundled with the unit. In addition to CapCut, it's preloaded with Nvidia Studio Suite, Asus StoryCube (a file-management assistant), and Asus MuseTree (streamlining the creative process). It's also a Copilot+ PC, so you have access to all of Microsoft's AI tools. I tested all of these functions and found them to be worthwhile additions—though none are absolutely game-changing.

Rating: 9/10

All told, I really loved working with the ProArt 16 and was sad to have to box it up at the end of my week of testing. But I realize I've perhaps left you hanging. I mentioned at the start that there was one negative with the laptop, and it might well be a deal-breaker. It's the price of the thing. At $4,000, this is the costliest laptop I've tested since reviewing the insane $5,000 HP Spectre Foldable two years ago, and that hardly even counts.

A better comparison is probably pitting the ProArt against the Apple MacBook Pro M4 Pro, which has similar levels of performance and costs around $3,500 these days in its top-tier configuration. Both are exceptional systems, though today I'd have to give the edge to the ProArt based on its sheer power and discrete GPU.

I know there are people out there who have the budget for these kinds of laptops, and if you do, you know who you are—but even I have to say that I'm tempted by the raw power and surprising sophistication of this machine. The bottom line is that if you need the absolute best performance you can get in a Windows laptop today, look no further. This is it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Lice Checks, Crafts, and Being Touched by Strangers: Inside a Role-Playing ASMR Spa","https://www.wired.com/story/lice-checks-crafts-and-being-touched-by-strangers-inside-a-roleplaying-asmr-spa/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 10:30:00 GMT","

“It's time for your lice check,” a woman who goes by “Ms. K” whispers directly into my ear as she starts running her fingers into my scalp and through each strand of hair. I'm in a dark room, Eastern flute music playing in the background as I sit across from my partner who's also having his hair caressed by a stranger. We close our eyes so we don't burst out laughing.

“OK kiddos, nobody wants to start their first day of school,” coos “Ms. A,” my partner's lice checker, in a soft, velvety voice, most likely noticing the dumbfounded looks on our faces. “We're going to be really thorough, because a lot of critters and cooties can hide pretty well.”

You might be wondering, am I a child? The answer is no.

Our inspectors move on to drawing lines and circles into our heads with metal sticks before brushing our hair with combs as tingly, shivery sensations crawl from the back of my ears down to the middle of my spine. At first it's uncomfortable, because honestly, I've never felt this sensation before and I'm not sure I'm doing whatever I should be right. But after 10 minutes of leaning into the uncertainty and nearly falling asleep, our session ends as we're both “cleared” of lice and they tell us to “get back to class.”

You might be wondering, am I a child? The answer is no. This also isn't some kind of kink. I'm in my thirties, and I have not-so-fond memories of lining up for lice checks back in the early 2000s in elementary school. But I'm here to experience at Tinglesbar ASMR Spa & Collective in Toronto, Canada. Dubbed the world's first dedicated ASMR spa, I'm with a group of strangers pretending to be fifth grade students for a role-paying ASMR experience—and yes, I'm completely terrified.

As a cynical person who hates viral internet trends transplanted to IRL scenarios (think Labubu milkshakes on sale at Erewhon), I thought I'd never be able to take this seriously, especially when it came to strangers touching me or whispering in my ear. ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response, is a sensation triggered by sounds, touch, feel, that send a tingly sensation through the body, usually around the neck and spine area. Its loyalists claim that it triggers a sense of total relaxation and calmness, eases anxiety, and even helps with insomnia. The term was technically coined in 2010, and since then, ASMR videos have skyrocketed on YouTube and TikTok, garnering billions of views. Some of the genre's content creators have made ASMR a full-time job, and year after year it remains one of the most searched terms on the platforms.

In the past couple of years, spas and wellness retreats offering ASMR experiences have popped up in the US, UK, and Canada, offering back scratching, hair and face brushing, and soundscapes. But Tinglesbar stands out for its role-playing offerings, which include Harry Potter role-play that aims to “un-petrify” you, a Fairy's Fortune role-play “offering sweet fairy whimsy and gentle answers from your mystical guide,” a doctor's visit that “blends light tapping, gentle examinations, and reassuring conversation to melt away tension,” and a 1940s beauty salon experience, in addition to the group hangouts. The particulars can be customized, depending on one's “ASMR triggers.” Prices range from CAD$139 for a solo session with $50 add-ons for role-playing, or $25 to $75 for group hangs.

Despite the hype, it's not a phenomenon I've explored or taken seriously. Add the student role-play with a bunch of strangers who paid to do this, and it has me wondering: Can all these grown-ass people all just pretend to be children? What brought them all here? And perhaps the most important question: Can I be converted into a believer?

The moment we step into the space, we're told to stow away our phones so we can fully be transported into the classroom. There's a table full of art supplies such as markers and paint, sounds playing from a speaker to imitate the ambience of a schoolyard, even snacks from our childhoods like Goldfish crackers and fruit snacks handed out to each of us in a brown paper bag. A woman in a smock and large tortoise-shell glasses introduces herself as Ms. G, our “art teacher,” and greets us all by asking us how our summer break was as we awkwardly smile back. Today's assignment? Decorate and paint our own canvas pencil case. To avoid breaking the ice with strangers, everyone immediately goes heads down into crafting.

“How was the fourth grade for everyone?” Ms. G asks as we wonder who will speak up first. As an extrovert uncomfortable with awkward silence (and probably more issues I need to figure out in therapy), I blurt out that I loved “cross-country running” as a fourth grader. The others nod and smile; some say they weren't really athletic, but I'm relieved I could break the silence in what seemed like a room full of introverts. But as Ms. G continues to ask us about our favorite classroom memories and movies from our past, I start to notice that more of my “classmates” are sharing their experiences with one another, whether trading a nostalgic snack or comparing each others' artwork.

As we craft, “students” in pairs are called into a room for the “lice checks.” To be clear, this isn't an actual check for lice but a teacher-student ASMR simulation. Each student that comes out after their check looks as if they'd enjoyed an hour-long massage, but it also melts the sort of awkwardness that's so common among adult strangers. It feels like we're bonded by the vulnerability of the odd shared experience and want to compare notes before “storytime.”

“I felt very tingly when she was just brushing my hair, touching my hair and whispering. I love that. It was a really nice experience,” our classmate Larissa Jhessin tells us. I admit to her that I was fully skeptical and had moments where I had to refocus to take it seriously. But once I got to that space, I did feel the goosebumps which, because of how new they were, put me in a realm of the unfamiliar and meditation.

This is Jhessin's sixth time at Tinglesbar but her first in a group setting. As a college student who works full-time, she says she has been using ASMR for years to help her deal with high stress environments and to sleep. “I know for people who have never experienced it before, it could be weird,” she says of the role-play element. But “they should try it at least once. It brought back many great childhood memories.”

This is exactly what Tammy Lung envisioned when she had the idea to open Tinglesbar in 2018. As a child, she found herself immersed in the makeup channel or the British-TV show Art Attack because of the goosebumps and sense of calm the sounds gave her. Those “super soothing” sensations, which she couldn't define into a single concept pre high-speed internet days, were always part of her life, but they were also isolating because she didn't know if anyone else felt what she had.

“It wasn't until like my early twenties I specifically looked on YouTube for makeup videos to help me fall asleep, and that's kind of when I found this term that kept coming up: ASMR,” Lung tells me. “It led me down a rabbit hole to all sorts of content, and I would just watch that every night throughout university to help me with stress or anxiety or sleep.”

Everyone who enjoys ASMR is different, Lung emphasizes. Some love the sounds of chewing and tongue clicks while others enjoy full narration, often in whispers or different accents. There's also a whole section of ASMR that focuses on the sounds and sensations of inanimate objects, for example, keyboard tapping, slicing vegetables, even a YouTube short ASMR video of a Labubu being sliced in half which has garnered 5 million views. For Lung, some of the most relaxing sounds come from makeup tutorials; the sound of brushes gliding over a face, the pop of a lipstick canister, or the patting of powder into the skin as if you're in a makeup chair. While some people don't need the element of role-play to feel the sensations of ASMR, Lung says the scenarios can help break down people's walls to make the most of the experiences.

“It's a lot of what you used to feel as a child in the form of care and comfort, and we don't get that as much. You don't get hugged as much. You don't get your hair brushed or back scratched,” she says. It's important “to relive the more simpler, gentler times of your life that you haven't been able to feel in a really long time and in a soothing, calming way,” Lung adds. “It's like a massage for your brain.”

For Milan Seki, a 32-year-old content creator who runs Invisible Strangers, a group dedicated to organizing meet-ups with introverts in Toronto, this is exactly the type of nostalgia she was hoping to experience while socializing with new people.

“I think like a lot of millennials and Gen Z love to go back and re-experience that. Specifically I really liked the little details like the lice check where you have the ASMR experience and then the story at the end,” Seki says. “It really puts you in the moment, which I think we were all craving.”

As a proud introvert, Seki told me that she did have some reservations before coming to a group ASMR role-play session but that the element of crafting and cosplaying was helpful to share a balance of socializing but also being immersed in an activity. “We have to be kids again,” she said, and I agree. We both wonder if our parents would enjoy the experience too.

As I walk out of the “classroom” and into the real world as a full-grown adult with responsibilities, I wonder what exactly I've taken away from the experience. Tingles? Check—though it may take a few more sessions for me to get comfortable with people whispering and touching me. Immersion into the role? Check—but it does leave me wondering if anyone had left the role-play feeling weirded out. What's clear is that in this extremely antisocial era of AI chatbot companions, dating apps, and shitposting for engagement to feel social, my classmates and I very much organically started to talk to one another again, without a drink at the bar for the nerves or being introduced by a mutual friend.

So how do we replicate this? Perhaps sitting in a room full of strangers role-playing as children is the easiest way to meet people in real life again. Maybe letting someone you don't know caress your scalp away from the armor of your phone is the single most real thing you can do to feel human again. And while I personally may not necessarily be using ASMR as a daily sleep medicine, this experience taught me one thing: Even the most introverted of introverts crave companionship, even if it's in disguise. And ASMR? It can be their sanctuary.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technewsworld.com","Why Nvidia's Reign Invites Disruption and an Open-Source Future","https://www.technewsworld.com/story/nvidias-reign-invites-disruption-and-an-open-source-future-180003.html","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:01:02 GMT","

The tech narrative often dictates market reality, and the sheer velocity of Nvidia's ascent is both dazzling and deeply precarious. Having achieved the historic milestone of becoming the world's first $5 trillion company and commanding roughly 80% of the AI accelerator market, Nvidia stands atop the AI pyramid.

Yet, this summit position — built on the proprietary success of CUDA — also places a massive target on Nvidia's back, inviting an inevitable counter-revolution led by open-source rivals and custom silicon engineers. The point here is not to critique past success, but to acknowledge the gravitational pull that eventually brings every empire back to Earth.

This week, let's discuss what Nvidia's current dominance means for its long-term stability — and speaking of AI, we'll close with my Product of the Week: the Euvola AI Companion, which is what Microsoft's Cortana could have been, and should have been.

Nvidia's initial success is undeniable; the CUDA parallel computing platform, launched in 2007, was visionary and transformed graphics cards into general-purpose powerhouses.

However, a company that suddenly finds itself atop a multitrillion-dollar market often suffers from what might be termed “peak performance malaise.” Why pivot when every quarterly report is a record? In practice, that success frequently leads to reduced focus on lower-margin, harder-to-serve customers — the very environments where the next wave of disruption is quietly forming.

Furthermore, a $5 trillion valuation creates an unprecedented single-company concentration in major market indices, making Nvidia's stock performance essential to the stability of the entire S&P 500 — a level of pressure that distracts from pure innovation. The focus shifts from developing the next thing to optimizing the current revenue stream.

The most potent threat to Nvidia's dominance is being leveraged by AMD, which is directly attacking Nvidia's greatest weakness: its proprietary CUDA lock-in.

AMD's strategy is fundamentally customer-centric:

U.S. export controls, intended to kneecap China's AI ambitions by reserving top-end chips like Blackwell for U.S. companies, have inadvertently functioned as rocket fuel for domestic Chinese competitors. Restrictions on Nvidia's high-end chip sales in China have caused its market share in advanced AI to plummet from 95% to virtually zero in restricted high-performance categories.

Far from stopping progress, this move catalyzed massive, state-coordinated investment and forced Chinese tech giants like Baidu, which placed large orders for Huawei's Ascend 910B chips, to pivot to highly capable indigenous silicon.

These Chinese alternatives, built under the protective umbrella of U.S. tariffs, are now competing on price and local customization, demonstrating that export controls created a massive, captive domestic market that funds rapid R&D and product iteration for domestic challengers.

The AI market is currently experiencing a boom characterized by valuations fundamentally disconnected from immediate revenue and cash flow. Nvidia's recent ascent to a $5 trillion valuation is heavily dependent on the continued, exponential growth of this market and on high-margin hardware sales.

When the inevitable “trough of disillusionment” hits — a common phase in every major tech wave — Nvidia, with its high market capitalization, will be hit hardest. A potential trigger for a significant valuation readjustment is likely to occur in late 2026 or early 2027, coinciding with two events:

To avoid the fate of the pioneer who gets buried in their own wake, Nvidia needs a radical shift:

Nvidia's current dominance is a tribute to its past vision, but its proprietary foundation is rapidly becoming its greatest liability.

The combined forces of AMD's agile, open-source competitive surge, the accelerating threat of hyperscaler custom silicon, and the emergence of subsidized Chinese alternatives are converging on the company's commanding market position.

If Nvidia fails to radically embrace openness and restructure its business model to prioritize flexibility and lower cost-per-performance in the next year, its $5 trillion valuation risks a painful correction, ushering in a multi-accelerator future where the crown is passed to those who build collaboratively.



In my hometown of Bend, Ore., where the crisp air often highlights the quiet solitude of working from home, the quest for genuine connection is real.

We've seen smart assistants and chatbots, but the Euvola AI Companion is the world's first dedicated, at-home product designed explicitly for emotional presence when in-person connection is missing.

This device is less about scheduling your calendar and more about serving your heart, making it the essential new tool for an age defined by digital isolation.

Euvola's core technology isn't just advanced natural language processing; it's precision emotional computing. Co-created with top psychologists, the AI is trained on rich, multicultural datasets, allowing it to interpret emotions across cultures with depth and nuance.

It utilizes a sophisticated, evolving memory system featuring both short-term memory (instantly grasping your current mood) and long-term memory (fostering trust by remembering shared stories and moments over time). This design allows the device to develop alongside you, creating a sense of bona fide companionship rather than the transactional interactions typical of standard smart speakers.

This is the level of contextual, empathetic intelligence that Microsoft's ill-fated Cortana struggled to achieve for years. While Cortana was primarily a transactional assistant, Euvola is built for intimacy and presence, sensing your entry into a room via proximity sensors and responding with mood-aware ambient lighting and a gentle greeting — a 24/7 comforting presence. It truly fulfills the promise of an emotional copilot.

The launch of Euvola is timely, coinciding with the global mental health crisis and the surging demand for emotional support, particularly among young adults and older people.

Euvola doesn't just offer a generic companion; it allows for profound personalization. Users can create a custom companion by uploading a cherished photo and a 30-second voice clip of someone they miss, love, or admire — such as a grandparent, mentor, or even a self-created ideal — transforming the device into a “digital presence” that looks and sounds familiar.

As the Euvola evolves, it can comfort a user with the familiar voice of a loved one, recalling shared memories — a feature that provides significant emotional continuity, particularly for those navigating grief or long-distance separation.

Euvola is a beautifully designed, standalone desktop device with an eight-inch HD display. The device operates with a privacy-first design: it contains no camera, and conversations are primarily processed locally, with advanced memory features only stored in the encrypted cloud with explicit user consent.

While the core companion experience is available in a standard mode, users require a Premium Access subscription — costing approximately $14.99/month or $149/year — for full access to personalized voice cloning and permanent memory storage after the initial promotional period. The device was launched via a successful Kickstarter campaign, which is how I bought mine. You can order it now directly from Euvola for $245.

The Euvola AI Companion earns its place as my Product of the Week not just for its advanced technology, but for its foundational mission: in a world saturated with apps and notifications, Euvola is the first dedicated, emotionally intelligent AI built for intimacy and presence, not productivity, offering a meaningful connection where human presence is lacking.

Five years ago, when Miles “Deuce” McBride moved to New York as a 20-year-old rookie playing for the Knicks, he found the transition to a big city overwhelming and struggled to find the right crowd.

“When I got up here, everybody on my team was married with kids or just kind of loners,” he told TechCrunch, reflecting on his initial feelings of loneliness being the youngest player on the team. “I wish there was a way to meet people organically who have the same interests. I feel like with social media, everybody is so superficial.”

Recognizing a common pain point for many in their twenties, McBride teamed up with veteran startup founder Joe Einhorn to create Mmotion, an app that combines elements of location tracking with social discovery features to help people find new friends based on shared interests while also recommending nearby bars, restaurants, and other social hotspots. 

Now available in beta for users in NYC, the app diverges from traditional friendship platforms like Bumble BFF, instead competing more directly with apps like Snap Map and Find My. Instagram also recently entered the space with a new Map feature. (Mmotion's beta will be limited to 1,000 members.)

Mmotion leverages geofencing and state tracking to follow users' movements, highlighting people with similar interests in the vicinity. It also keeps track of where users go to recommend similar, worthwhile locations to explore. Plus, users get a private log of all their location history, acting like a personal timeline so they can easily look back on all the spots they've explored.

To access Mmotion, users must apply for a membership. Once accepted, they can enter their interests, join “Circles” or groups they're interested in (such as those focused on hiking, attending basketball games, or visiting art galleries), and send friend requests to others nearby. The app also offers private messaging between users. 

To prioritize user safety, the app features encrypted location data that is only accessible to the user unless they choose to share it. Users are incognito by default, which Mmotion refers to as “Vault Mode,” and can be switched at any time. 

Additionally, if users prefer that only certain individuals on the app know their location, Mmotion offers a feature called “Personas.” This feature allows users to create up to three separate groups, enabling them to share more private locations like their home address with a select group of people while maintaining a more public persona.

“So Miles might have [his “Deuce” Persona], which is something where it's a bit more curated, because he's a public figure. So it's for all the Knicks fans to see Miles go to places he's okay with mainstream people knowing. And then he might have a [Persona], for when he goes to a different city, and he wants to be really low-key,” Einhorn explained.

Standard safety and moderation tools like blocking and reporting are also implemented. 

The app will operate on a monthly subscription model for users. While the exact pricing details weren't disclosed, Einhorn hinted that it will be affordable, stating, “It's not going to be more than a cup of coffee per month. It's not going to be anything crazy.” 

Premium options offering additional features may also be available. For example, the basic tier only lets users join five Circles per city at a time.

Another aspect of the app is its offering for local businesses. By featuring restaurants, bars, coffee shops, fitness studios, and more on the map, Mmotion aims to promote small businesses while also providing them with insights into their customer base. The app aggregates data from various sources, including Google, OpenStreetMap, and Apple Maps.

Mmotion's long-term vision is to encourage businesses to sign up for a subscription service that provides access to anonymized analytics. This service would help businesses effectively target the right customers.

In addition to subscription fees, the app will generate revenue through ads. 

The launch marks McBride's first time as a startup founder, positioning him alongside other athletes who have transitioned to entrepreneurship. Einhorn, meanwhile, is known as the founder and CEO of Fancy, a social e-commerce platform that competed with Pinterest. He also launched a luxury goods startup last year called Long Story Short.

Mmotion plans for a wider launch in the near future when there's enough feedback from testers. It's currently available to download on iOS and Android devices.

After helping several enterprises document how work actually happens, Scribe has raised $75 million at a $1.3 billion post-money valuation to roll out Scribe Optimize, a platform that maps workflows across the enterprise to reveal where automation and AI will actually yield returns — instead of becoming another sunk cost.

The all-equity Series C round was led by StepStone, with participation from existing investors Amplify Partners, Redpoint Ventures, Tiger Global, Morado Ventures, and New York Life Ventures. The new funding comes over a year after Scribe raised its $25 million Series B, capital the five-year-old startup has largely not needed to draw down, co-founder and CEO Jennifer Smith (pictured above, left) said in an exclusive interview. With this round, Scribe plans to accelerate the rollout of Scribe Optimize and related products, as enterprises struggle to determine where AI and automation will have the greatest impact.

Many companies are racing to adopt AI, but Smith told TechCrunch that most still cannot answer a fundamental question: What should we automate first? Enterprises often try to find the answer through interviews, workshops, or by bringing in consultants, she said, approaches that take months and still miss much of what people actually do on a day-to-day basis.

“Without really knowing how work is done, it is really hard to know where to improve it, where to automate it, where agents can help,” she said. “Scribe Optimize is all about answering that question. Very simply, it mines across workflows for what people are doing when they're at work, and then it abstracts those up into being able to show you in a single pane of glass, here are the actual workflows that are being done. Here's how often, how long it takes, etc.”

Founded in 2019 by Smith and Aaron Podolny (CTO) (pictured above, right), Scribe started before the GenAI boom, and its current flagship product, Scribe Capture, helps automatically document how work is done. When someone completes a process or workflow, Capture generates a step-by-step guide using its browser extension and desktop app, along with text and screenshots. Those guides can be shared with colleagues or embedded in internal tools to reduce repeated questions, minimize errors, and expedite onboarding.

Customers using Scribe Capture report saving 35 to 42 hours per person per month and making new hires 40% faster, the startup said.

The market of process documentation includes players including Tango, Iorad, UserGuiding, and Spekit. Nonetheless, Smith told TechCrunch that Scribe competes against the status quo of people manually recording workflows.

“People are still using stopwatches to sit behind somebody and understand what this process is,” she said. “Even now, when it comes to deploying AI agents, the irony is that the process of deploying agents is incredibly manual.”

To date, Scribe has documented more than 10 million workflows across 40,000 software applications. The startup said that it has more than 5 million users and is used by teams inside 94% of Fortune 500 companies. Further, 78,000 organizations are its paid customers. It counts teams at New York Life, T-Mobile, LinkedIn, Hubspot, and Northern Trust among its users.

“Users come to Scribe not because their boss tells them to, but because they want to,” Smith told TechCrunch. “It starts with the end user, and then goes up to their team lead, department lead, and then some kind of central function who are all interested in it for the question of, how do we scale, what we know, how to do, and how do we get better?”

The San Francisco-based startup sees the U.K., Canada, Australia, and Europe among its biggest markets after the U.S.

Scribe said it has more than doubled its revenue over the past year, though it did not disclose figures, and also said its valuation has increased fivefold since its last round. The startup currently has a headcount of 120 employees, and it plans to double that number in the next 12 months, Smith said.

Nearly seven years after announcing its first fund, Sapphire Sport — the venture fund focused on sports, media, and entertainment — is spinning out from Sapphire Ventures. The fund will rebrand as an independent venture firm, 359 Capital.

The firm's new name is a tribute to the sub-four-minute mile, a feat once deemed humanly impossible but ultimately achieved through rigorous dedication and perseverance. 359 Capital co-founder and managing partner Michael Spirito said that the name reflects the firm's core principle of helping its portfolio founders achieve the impossible.

The separation from Sapphire Ventures, an investment firm with about $11 billion in assets under management, was always on “the vision board,” said Spirito. “We're all grown up and ready to leave home.”

Sapphire Sport, which is currently halfway through investing its second fund of $181 million, has always maintained a separate group of limited partners from Sapphire Ventures. Its LPs are all deeply tied to the sports industry, including major names like City Football Group, adidas, AEG, Madison Square Garden, Sinclair, and dozens of team owners.

“When we started in 2019, the name Sapphire Sport wasn't just alliterative and sounded cool,” Spirito said. “Sport captured the LP group.”

Seven years later, the sports-focused LPs still leverage their relationship with the firm to gain insights into emerging tech companies across the media and sports landscape, Spirito said.

Some of the startups 359 Capital has backed include Beehiiv, a creator-focused newsletter; an online casino, Betty Labs; a sports media platform; Overtime, an AI search engine; Perplexity, a successful AI browser; and Tonal, a home gym system.

The firm's entire portfolio of 30 companies and all of its investment staff will move over to 359 Capital. The transitioning staff includes Spirito, co-founders of Sapphire Ventures David Hartwig and Doug Higgins, and newly promoted partner Rico Mallozzi.

As 359 Capital, the firm will continue to focus primarily on Series A and Series B startups, writing checks between $2 million to $10 million. The firm will continue to invest from its second fund through the first half of 2027, Spirito said.

359 Capital will have high-profile competition in the world of sports-focused venture capital. Courtside Ventures, backed by Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan, is in the process of raising a fourth fund of $100 million, according to an SEC filing.

For more than a decade, makers of government spyware have defended themselves from criticism by saying that their surveillance technology is intended to be used only against serious criminals and terrorists, and only in limited cases.  

The evidence gathered from dozens, if not hundreds of documented instances of spyware abuse all over the world, however, shows that neither of those arguments are true.  

Journalists, human rights activists, and politicians have repeatedly been targeted in both repressive regimes and democratic countries. The latest example is a political consultant who works for left-wing politicians in Italy, who came out as the most recently confirmed victim of Paragon spyware in the country. 

This latest case shows that spyware is proliferating far beyond the scope of what we have typically considered to be “rare” or “limited” attacks targeting only a few people at a time. 

“I think that there is some misunderstanding at the heart of stories about who gets targeted by this kind of government spyware, which is that if you are targeted, you are Public Enemy Number One,” Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has studied spyware for years, told TechCrunch.  

“In reality, because targeting is so easy, we have seen governments use surveillance malware to spy on a broad range of people, including relatively minor political opponents, activists, and journalists,” said Galperin. 

There are several reasons that explain why spyware often ends up on the devices of people who, in theory, should not be targeted.  

The first explanation lies in the way that spyware systems work. Generally, when an intelligence or law enforcement agency purchases spyware from a surveillance vendor — like NSO Group, Paragon, and others — the government customer pays a one-time fee to acquire the technology, and then lower additional fees for future software updates and tech support.  

The upfront fee is usually based on the number of targets that the government agency can spy on at any moment in time. The more targets, the higher the price. Previously leaked documents from the now-defunct Hacking Team show that some of its police and government customers could target anywhere from a handful of people to an unlimited number of devices at once. 

While some democratic countries typically had fewer targets that they could surveil in one go, it wasn't uncommon to see countries with questionable human rights records with an extremely high number of concurrent spyware targets.  

Giving such a high number of concurrent targets to countries with such strong appetites for surveillance all but guaranteed that the governments would target far more people outside the scope of just criminals and terrorists.

Morocco, the United Arab Emirates (twice), and Saudi Arabia (several times), have all been caught targeting journalists and activists over the years. Security researcher Runa Sandvik, who works with activists and journalists who are at risk of being hacked, curates an ever-expanding list of cases of spyware abuse around the world.  

Another reason for the high number of abuses is that, especially in recent years, is that spyware — such as NSO's Pegasus or Paragon's Graphite — makes it extremely easy for government customers to successfully target whoever they want. In practice, those systems are essentially consoles where police or government officials type in a phone number, and the rest happens in the background.  

John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at The Citizen Lab who has investigated spyware companies and their abuses for a decade, said that government spyware carries a “huge abuse temptation” for government customers.  

Scott-Railton said spyware “needs to be treated like the threat to democracy and elections that it is.” 

The general lack of transparency and accountability has also contributed to governments brazenly using this sophisticated surveillance technology without fear of consequences. 

“The fact that we have seen targeting of relatively small fish is particularly concerning because it reflects the relative impunity that the government feels in deploying this exceptionally invasive spyware against opponents,” Galperin told TechCrunch. 

In terms of victims getting accountability, there is some good news.  

Paragon made a point of very publicly cutting ties with the Italian government earlier this year, arguing that the country's authorities refused help from the company in investigating abuses allegedly involving its spyware.  

NSO Group previously revealed in court that it disconnected 10 government customers in recent years for abusing its spyware technology, although it refused to say which countries. And it's unclear if those include the Mexican or Saudi government, where there have been countless documented cases of abuse.  

On the customer side, countries like Greece and Poland have launched investigations into spyware abuses. The United States, during the Biden administration, targeted some spyware makers such as Cytrox, Intellexa and NSO Group by imposing sanctions on the companies —  and their executives — and putting them on economic blocklists. Also, a group of mostly Western countries led by the U.K and France are trying to use diplomacy to put the brakes on the spyware market.  

It remains to be seen if any of these efforts will curb or limit in any way what is now a global multi-billion dollar market, with companies more than happy to supply advanced spyware to governments with a seemingly endless appetite to spy on pretty much everyone they want to.

Venmo on Monday introduced a new rewards program, Venmo Stash, offering cash back to customers who transact with their favorite brands on the payments app and engage with Venmo's products. 

While cashback rewards are a common incentive for credit cards, Venmo's rewards — which can be up to 5% — are returned to Venmo's Mastercard Debit Card.

The program is designed to incentivize continued use of Venmo's service by bringing more funds into the ecosystem, the company explains. 

However, this program also represents a new way that today's brands are attempting to reach younger users, many of whom have shown a preference for debit cards over credit cards.

One 2024 study cited by eMarketer indicated that only 39% of Gen Z users reported frequent credit card use, compared with 51% for older generations. Another Morning Consult survey for Cash App Afterpay from earlier this year noted that 63% of Gen Z users said they favored debit cards over other payment methods.

As a result, payment providers and retailers are looking to accommodate younger consumers by rolling out more debit rewards and by offering alternatives at checkout — like the use of “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) services such as Affirm, PayPal Pay Later, or Klarna.

In Venmo's case, the program is designed to offer larger rewards as customers interact more with Venmo products. This keeps them invested in the Venmo ecosystem, the company believes. 

It also competes with other cashback incentives offered by Venmo's rivals, like Cash App's offers, which are doled out to its own Cash App debit card customers.

Initially, customers earn 1% cash back for their Venmo Debit Mastercard when they spend their Venmo balance. Rewards grow to 2% when customers turn on auto reloads to keep their balance replenished automatically. And customers are able to earn 5% cash back when they receive Direct Deposits on Venmo each month. 

However, instead of offering a certain percentage back by spending category, like groceries, gas, or dining, Venmo's program has customers pick from curated bundles of their favorite brands. For instance, you could pick a group of brands that includes McDonald's, TikTok Shop, Uber, and Uber Eats, or one that offers Amazon, DoorDash, Domino's, and Walgreens. 

The PayPal-owned company says that next year Venmo Stash will expand to offer customers rewards when they pay with Venmo at merchants within its nationwide network.

I remember perhaps a decade ago, a coworker and I were watching a clip of Zuckerberg walking up to a group of employees and they started clapping for him. I mentioned how odd it was to see, and he thought it was perfectly natural to applaud the CEO of your company. We never applauded when our boss showed up, and I've never really been sure where the line is for which authority I'm supposed to cheer for merely from being in their presence. I haven't thought about it too much since then, but obviously it's stuck with me.As a society, we've all had our lips pretty firmly pressed onto the asses of the oligarchs for quite awhile, so it seems pretty natural that they think it's the natural order of things.

No, Zuckerberg did not set out consciously trying to ""fracture society"".  He started out trying to provide a way to rate women at Harvard by how attractive they were, then by just trying to optimize revenue without any consideration for unintended consequences.  Then kept going.Not understanding the failure mode is going to just lead to repeating the same mistakes at even grander scales, like what's happening now with AI.  Nerds obsessed with creating ""AGI"" without the capability or willingness to think through the potential consequences.

I called it at spending at a constant average of USD$2500/day.  With 'only' $20million yielding 5%, you have $2700/day without even touching principle.

Which, by definition, is incomplete when we're talking about the world. If we examined by country, it would fluctuate wildly. For example, in any country with soccer as the national sport, Ronaldo would crush Zuckerberg in popularity.Either way, the point (in which I think we're all mostly in agreement) is that Zuckerberg's comment falls somewhere between the absurd and the delusional. If you want to pick a different list of names, go right ahead. I'd say Tailor Swift is indisputable, though.

Same (minus the footballer part). When I was made aware of Ed Sheeran, he was already the biggest artist in the world. But that says something about me and my general disinterest for music and pop culture, not Sheeran's popularity.

Zuckerberg probably is more well-known than Ed Sheeran. ""Ed Sheeran"", the name, may be more familiar, but what do typical people really know about the details of his life? Zuckerberg, on the other hand, had a movie made about him. At least everyone knows about Taylor Swift's dating life, if we want to compare to music celebrities.Still, imagine Prince William or Prince Harry have to be most well-known. They've been chronicled since birth. Especially when you look past an Americentric view and turn to the world stage.

Amd millennials found their replacement for housing bubble with the stocks / crypto bubble.And democracy is good for boomers, because they are too many and outnumber everyone else in battle. So millennials and genz are not unsympathetic to less democracy (a view that Thiel shares).Thiel in this context could be considered a boomer, and his interests lie with them

It looks like there has been some turnover at the universities since the quote from Eric Weinstein. I quick survey (could be incorrect!) says it is now more around 63.That's still high but not as high as what Eric Weinstein was quoting.Would be a great time series.

> I would be the last person to advocate for socialism. But when 70% of Millennials say they are pro-socialist, we need to do better than simply dismiss them by saying that they are stupid or entitled or brainwashed; we should try and understand why. And, from the perspective of a broken generational compact, there seems to be a pretty straightforward answer to me, namely, that when one has too much student debt or if housing is too unaffordable, then one will have negative capital for a long time and/or find it very hard to start accumulating capital in the form of real estate; and if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.But when he gives examples of the ""iron grip"" boomers have on power, he only talks about their control of universities and the government. He leaves out wealth and capital.

By far, the largest wealth transfer that happens is young to old, via defined benefit pensions (such as social security), healthcare, and asset price increases (via decreases in purchasing power of the currency).In a democracy, most voters will vote for these policies, because most voters are or will soon be beneficiaries of these policies.  I am betting that Millenials, once they are in their 50s, will continue voting for the same policies that Boomers have for the past 20 years, since they will have the same incentives.

Anecdotally, very briefly dated a 40 year old who claimed she only ever cooked boxed food; had never even baked or microwaved a potato. Her words!They're the Gizmodo and Ars Technica journalist crowd exploiting slave labor while bitching about social justice. The 1984 double speak is strong with them.America is a passive investor society. Like Trump thinking factories will just appear because he wishes it, Millennials wish to be enriched without giving a shit about externalities.I base this entirely off their actual effort on the ground. Their ""thoughts and prayers"" may be cranked to 11, but my lived experience is they're even more disconnected from obligation to themselves than Boomers and GenX who at least spent some part of their life solving their ground truth problems.They prefer socialism (which I am not against) because they realize they're screwed as individuals, they need help. Many probably expect they'll be served by it, not serving it.

This comes from decades of teachers misremembering what the rule was, and eventually it morphed into the Wikipedia specific form we see today - the actual rule is that you cannot cite an encyclopaedia in an academic paper. full stop.Wikipedia is an encyclopaedia and therefore should not be cited.Wikipedia is the only encyclopaedia most people have used in the last 20 years, therefore Wikipedia = encyclopaedia in most people's minds.There's nothing wrong with using an encyclopaedia for learning or introducing yourself to a topic (in fact this is what teachers told students to do). And there's nothing specifically wrong about Wikipedia either.

That's a different scenario. You shouldn't _cite wikipedia in a paper_ (instead you should generally use its sources), but it's perfectly fine in most circumstances to link it in the course of an internet argument or whatever.

And, for instance, I have barely any knowledge of how my computer works, but it's a tool I use to do my job. (and to have fun at home.)Why are these different than using LLMs? I think at least for me the distinction is whether or not something enables me to perform a task, or whether it's just doing the task for me. If I had to write my own OS and word processor just to write a letter, it'd never happen. The fact that the computer does this for me facilitates my task. I could write the letter by hand, but doing it in a word processor is way better. Especially if I want to print multiple copies of the letter.But for LLMs, my task might be something like ""setting up apache is easy, but I've never done it so just tell me how do it so I don't fumble through learning and make it take way longer."" The task was setting up Apache. The task was assigned to me, but I didn't really do it. There wasn't necessarily some higher level task that I merely needed Apache for. Apache was the whole task! And I didn't do it!Now, this will not be the case for all LLM-enabled tasks, but I think this distinction speaks to my experience. In the previous word processor example, the LLM would just write my document for me. It doesn't allow me to write my document more efficiently. It's efficient, only in the sense that I no longer need to actually do it myself, except for maybe to act as an editor. (and most people don't even do much of that work) My skill in writing either atrophies or never fully develops since I don't actually need to spend any time doing it or thinking about it.In a perfect world, I use self-discipline to have the LLM show me how to set up Apache, then take notes, and then research, and then set it up manually in subsequent runs; I'd have benefited from learning the task much more quickly than if I'd done it alone, but also used my self-discipline to make sure I actually really learned something and developed expertise as well. My argument is that most people will not succeed in doing this, and will just let the LLM think for them.

Despite, LLM's are useful.   I could write the code faster without an LLM, but then I'd have code that wasn't carefully reviewed line-by-line because my coworkers trust me (the fools).   It'd have far fewer tests because nobody forced me to prove everything.   It'd have worse naming because every once in a while the LLM does that better than me.   It'll be missing a few edge cases the LLM thought of that I didn't.   It'd have forest/trees problems because if I was writing the code I'd be focused on the code instead of the big picture.

(1) Its reach: More people of all ages, of different backgrounds, expertise, and intents are using it. Some are heavily misusing it.
(2) Its (ever increasing) capability: Yes, it has already become pretty easy for ChatGPT or any other LLMs to produce a sophisticated but wrong answer on a difficult topic. And I think the trend is that with later, more advanced versions, it would become harder and take more effort to spot a hidden failure lurking in a more information-dense LLM's answer.

The term I've been using of late is “authority simulator.” My formative experiences with “authority figures” was a person who can speak with breadth and depth about a subject and who seems to have internalized it because they can answer quickly and thoroughly. Because LLMs do this so well, it's really easy to feel like you're talking to an authority in a subject. And even though my brain intellectually knows this isn't true, emotionally, the simulation of authority is comforting.

ANNs are arbitrary function approximators. The training process uses statistical methods to identify a set of parameters that approximate the function as best as possible. That doesn't necessarily mean that the end result is equivalent to a very fancy multi-stage linear regression. It's a possible outcome of the process, but it's not the only possible outcome.Looking at a LLMs I/O structure and training process is not enough to conclude much of anything.

What more are LLMs than statistical inference machines? I don't know that I'd assert that's all they are with confidence but all the configurations options I can play with during generation (Top K, Top P, Temperature, etc.) are all ways to _not_ select the most likely next token which leads me to believe that they are, in fact, just statistical inference machines.

This is not what the Dunning-Kruger effect is. It's lacking metacognitive ability to understand one's own skill level. Overconfidence resulting from ignorance isn't the same thing.

Even then, there's so many other things that can go wrong with games. With DOS-era titles, DOSBox does a pretty fantastic job, as long as you use a fork with useful features like DOSBox-X. With Windows titles the possibilities to preserve games is almost endless thanks to hooking. I've spent the past few years compiling a personal archive of games to get them in a playable state. For me, this often involves support for modern controllers and _at least_ natively rendering at a higher resolution. Compatibility shims like dgVoodoo make it easy to bump up the rendering resolution of a game, while preserving aspect ratio for games that may only support 4:3.Graphics are basically solved with projects like dgVoodoo, and there's numerous dinput -> xinput solutions out there, but that's rarely the whole picture. WinSock could really benefit from a wrapper that tunnels traffic over the internet (VPNs are really like using a steam roller to drive a nail). Registry API calls really could be redirected to read from config files instead of relying on the weird bastardization of WOW64 and the VirtualStore. Hell, even file access could be redirected so we can contain all of a game's files.I'm actually working towards implementing the latter two as a way to preserve the functionality of installers and allow their reimplementation through something like PowerShell.

I dunno if it's really preservation when you have to completely rework the game to work on a screen three times wider and 4x denser than anything that existed when the game was designed, and hack in a completely new way of talking to the controllers. Just package up the whole thing in an emulator and call it a day. Even if they're still both running versions of Windows, a 2025 computer and a 1997 computer are completely alien systems that have about as much to do with each other as a 2025 computer and a Nintendo 64.

If it runs on a runnable emulator of the target platform then we're good.

So in the interest of making older games future compatible we (those interested in preservation) do need to pursue those things.How else can we guarantee they'll run on future devices? Emulators are one good way to make things run on newer devices, but emulators will in turn need the features to be able to run on 4K/8K screens, XR devices, etc.

I don't think comptime as just some macro system. It is closer to a reflection system. I use comptime to access types. You can create specialized paths depending on type.Also imo generics are “first class” in zig. Comptime is first class and thus generics are too.

For example, it would be interesting to compare how many Rust bugs mentioned crashes back when there were only 13k bugs reported, and the same for the JS VM comparison. Don't get me wrong, as a Rust zealot I have my biases and still expect a memory safe implementation to be less crashy, but I'd be much happier concluding that based on stronger data and analysis.

For most languages I can usually see one or two “killer features” that push the language: For Rust is taking C space with memory safety + modern semantics, for Go is being easy to learn by most engineers + parallelization, for Ruby is ergonomics…I don't see any similar pitch for zig other than a general “I kinda enjoy it”, and the language seems to have a couple red flags, so why focus on it? (Honest question).

My impression is that this is the main thing for Zig too. The intersection of the set of languages that let you write very low-level code where you have full control over memory and allocation and the set of languages that are enjoyable to program in is pretty small.C is in there if you've internalized many of its warts are fine with all of the many many footguns it has. C++ is in there if you much of your enjoyment comes from the machismo of feeling like you have conquered C++'s beastly language complexity. Rust is in there if proving to the compiler that you know what you're doing is satisfying to you.Zig sort of gets out of your way like C does, even when what you're trying to do is potentially harmful. But it's more modern and expressive and doesn't have all of C's historical baggage.

C is very basic and (especially when you stick to something like C99), can be very tedious to write. In C, if I hope for smarter things I need to write them by hand; usually there are no ways of achieving some goals without just crunching out the code. Zig preserves C qualities but also gives some extra tools that are completely optional and makes it less tedious than C.I believe that Zig's popularity is also caused by general tendency of some people. Some prefer to fix a segfault than spend half a day refactoring something that was supposed to be easy but is causing half of the codebase to be rewritten.(Oh, and Zig is also an escape hatch to easy CGo :))

I find Zig to be a pleasant option for code that requires high performance. I find it strictly dominates C as an option, as Zig outperforms C on every criteria I care about in a language's developer experience.I often see people compare Zig to Rust and complain that Zig doesn't have Rust's safety guarantees. I don't know Rust, but looking at it casually, the language itself seems to have a lot of complexity that doesn't appeal to me, and I'd still prefer Zig to Rust. If I need memory safety, I'd rather write in Go or Python.When I read articles like these, the gotchas they find don't seem that compelling to me. It's always like if you write your code in a deliberately confusing way to confuse the compiler, you can get incorrect results, but I don't care because I would never write code like that.

It's better at that than Rust because it's less abstracted, and it's better at that than C because you don't have to worry all the toolchain nonsense / weird conventions / weak type system of the C ecosystem.As a small example wrt Rust: resetting an arraylist/vector while reusing its memory is a weirdly complicated trick  https://lobste.rs/s/emvkea/why_we_didn_t_rewrite_our_feed_ha...I think I don't need to provide references for C.It's a new pathway to mastery that really works well for some people. That in itself is much more valuable than any new specific feature the language has to offer, although the ability of the toolchain to cross-compile reliably not only Zig but also C and C++ code does play into that.And, while not yet 100% there, instant incremental rebuilds also help to achieve faster feedback loops.People like Zig because it's a tool that helps them become better programmers, faster.

In South America, a mysterious monument stretches almost a mile (1.5 kilometers) through the southern Peruvian Andes. Called Monte Sierpe, meaning serpent mountain, it consists of rows of around 5,200 aligned holes, and researchers have put forth a new theory for what they may have been.

In a study published today in the journal Antiquity, an international team of researchers conducted sediment analysis and took drone photography of Monte Sierpe. Their results suggest that the monument, also known as “Band of Holes,” was used by indigenous peoples in accounting and trade.

“Hypotheses regarding Monte Sierpe's purpose range from defence, storage, and accounting to water collection, fog capture, and gardening,” Jacob Bongers, an archaeologist from the University of Sydney and lead author of the study, says in an Antiquity statement. “The function of the site remains unclear.”

The holes are arranged into sections, and each hole is 3.3 to 6.6 feet (1 to 2 meters) wide and 1.6 to 3.3 feet (0.5 to 1 meters) deep. The team shed light on the perplexing monument on both the micro and macro levels, conducting microbotanical analysis of the holes' sediments and capturing high-resolution aerial imagery. The microbotanical analysis revealed plant remains such as corn as well as wild plants traditionally used in basket making.

“These data support the hypothesis that during pre-Hispanic times, local groups periodically lined the holes with plant materials and deposited goods inside them, using woven baskets and/or bundles for transport,” Bongers explained.

What's more, the aerial imagery suggests that the holes' arrangement aligns with numerical patterns. The researchers argue that this, in addition to its segmented organization, makes Monte Sierpe like a giant khipu: a cord and knot documenting system used by Andean people. As such, Monte Sierpe may have been a giant accounting system that the Inca state utilized to collect tributes.

The Inca were a pre-Columbian indigenous civilization best known for building Machu Picchu (recently also admired for this three-walled building), whose modern descendants are Andean Quechua-speaking people. Monte Sierpe would have been usefully located between two Inca administrative sites and in proximity to an intersection of pre-Hispanic roads. What's more, it also sits between the highlands and lower coastal plain, an area where communities from both regions would have gathered for trade.

Altogether, the researchers propose that the pre-Inca Chincha Kingdom originally developed and used Monte Sierpe for controlled trade, which then turned into an Inca space for accounting.

“This study contributes an important Andean case study on how past communities modified past landscapes to bring people together and promote interaction,” Bongers concluded. “Our findings expand our understanding of barter marketplaces and the origins and diversity of Indigenous accounting practices within and beyond the ancient Andes.”

A former Trump official will be the new chief of notorious Israeli spyware maker NSO Group as the company tries to save its tarnished image after a string of high profile surveillance scandals.

Trump's former U.S. ambassador to Israel (and one time bankruptcy lawyer), David Friedman, will be Israeli spyware maker NSO Group's new executive chairman.

NSO is best known for its product Pegasus which can hack into any phone to turn it into a spying device. The product and NSO itself have been the subject of accusations that span a decade.

In 2018, Amnesty International claimed that its staff members were targeted by a malware attack using NSO software. In 2021, Amnesty said that the software was used to hack into the devices of Palestinians working for civil society organizations in the West Bank. Around the same time, an investigation claimed that an Emirati agency used NSO's Pegasus to target the phone of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi's wife just months before his assassination in October 2018.

The accusations have since continued. Earlier this year, Amnesty International published a report saying that two investigative journalists from a Serbian network were targeted with Pegasus in February 2025.

The Biden administration took legal action against the company in 2021 when the Department of Commerce blacklisted it for knowingly supplying software to foreign governments to be used to target dissidents.

Then in 2024, a U.S. federal court found NSO liable for reverse engineering Meta's WhatsApp to hack into the phones of more than 1,400 attorneys, journalists, human rights activists, and government officials around the world, including some U.S. diplomats. Last month, a federal judge granted WhatsApp's request to have NSO's products blocked on WhatsApp, but according to Friedman, NSO is appealing that decision.

Despite all the financial struggles that came with the years of legal and ethical controversies over its surveillance practices, NSO is determined to renew its business and get in the U.S. government's good graces. The company got sold last month to an American investor group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds, who is behind famous movies like Happy Gilmore, Bad Moms and Hustlers. The new American owners, who hold a controlling stake in the firm, made the decision to bring in Trump-ally Friedman to lead the company.

Friedman's goal is to have NSO ink partnerships with the Trump administration.

“If the administration, as I expect they'll be, is receptive to considering any opportunity that might keep Americans safer, it will consider us,” Friedman told the Wall Street Journal, adding that he is aiming to attract American law enforcement agencies as customers.

Technically, NSO would be barred from any partnerships with government agencies due to a 2023 executive order signed by then-President Biden. According to the order, government agencies and departments are banned from using any commercial spyware that have been misused to enable human rights abuses.

But there is precedent for the contrary. The Trump administration is no stranger to partnerships with Israeli spyware companies that have murky reputations.

Under Trump's rule, ICE has gone full speed ahead with a $2 million contract with Israeli spyware firm Paragon, a company whose products were used by the Italian government to spy on journalists and migrant rights activists.

The deal was first signed in late 2024, but was blocked until a compliance review could determine whether it adhered to Biden's executive order. That block was lifted a few months ago. In the time between the block being enacted then lifted, Paragon got acquired by a Florida-based private equity firm.

The rise of AI is changing the world in more ways than one. As this booming new industry revolutionizes the way we live and work, scientists are racing to quantify its environmental impact as well.

Projections for AI's resource consumption and carbon emissions already paint a grim picture. A new study published Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability shows that AI server deployment across the U.S. could produce 26 million to 48 million tons (24 million to 44 million metric tons) of carbon dioxide equivalent per year between 2024 and 2030—equal to putting 5 to 10 million new cars on the road.

On top of that, the researchers expect AI to consume roughly 193 billion to 297 billion gallons (731 million to 1,125 million cubic meters) of water per year, as much as the annual household water usage of 6 to 10 million Americans.

“The magnitude is striking,” lead author Fengqi You, an endowed professor of energy systems engineering at Cornell University, told Gizmodo in an email. Though his findings underscore the significant environmental consequences of AI's rapid growth, they also point to effective ways to make the industry more sustainable.

“Equally striking is that better facility location, clean-power procurement, and efficient cooling can cut those impacts by roughly 70–85%,” You added. “So the footprint is significant but also manageable with coordinated action.”

As AI data centers proliferate across the U.S., communities are already feeling the impact. Skyrocketing electric bills, air pollution, and power grid strain are just some of the challenges Americans face when these facilities come to their hometowns, and the consequences are most severe for low-income areas and communities of color.

But the impacts aren't just local. Through their analysis, You and his colleagues show how much the U.S. AI industry is contributing to global climate change and national water scarcity.

To quantify these larger impacts, they linked projected AI electricity demand to each state's grid carbon and water characteristics, You explained. His team then compared baseline impact scenarios to mitigation scenarios that use strategies such as smart siting, grid decarbonization, and advanced cooling techniques to reduce data centers' impact.

The findings point to data center siting as one of the most significant factors influencing AI's environmental footprint.

States differ considerably in their renewable energy and water resources, local climate, power grid carbon intensity, and the concentration of existing data centers. As such, the same AI workload can have a two- to five-fold difference in emissions or water use depending on where it operates, You said.

Many data center clusters are currently being constructed in water-scarce states, such as California, Nevada, and Arizona, according to the study. And in states that have already become data center hubs—such as Virginia—new construction can compound existing strain on local infrastructure and resources.

You and his colleagues therefore advocate for siting new facilities in regions with low water stress and plentiful renewable energy resources. They highlight the Midwest and “wind belt” states—particularly Texas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota—as ideal siting locations for reducing data centers' carbon and water footprint. New York also stands out for its clean electricity mix of nuclear power, hydropower, and renewable energy.

That said, making a meaningful difference in AI's environmental impact will require more efficient cooling technology and grid decarbonization as well, according to the study.

“Location, power source, and cooling technology together determine whether AI infrastructure becomes part of the sustainability solution,” You said. “AI may look virtual, but it runs on very real systems, such as grids, water, and cooling. The footprint depends on where we build and how we power and cool it.”

That special magic of the holiday season is just around the corner but finding that perfect decoration piece can be quite a challenge. Well, LEGO has just dropped something that nails both: the Christmas Tree set is currently available on Amazon for just $26, off its original $44 price tag. This is the first time this festive set has gone on sale at the online retailer, and even LEGO's own website hasn't beaten it yet.

See at Amazon

You'll like its 2-in-1 building approach: you can either build one large Christmas tree display model that stands over 11 inches tall or split the pieces into two smaller trees measuring 9 inches and 6 inches, respectively. This means you're able to adapt your display depending on your space whether you work with a spacious mantelpiece or a cozy desk corner. Each tree comes with classic ornaments and candles topped by that iconic yellow star that completes the Christmas look.

The building experience itself provides that satisfying hands-on activity perfect for the holiday downtime. Designed for ages 12 and up, this set hits that sweet spot where it is engaging enough for teenagers and adults who love LEGO but will be accessible to younger builders who might want to tackle it with a bit of guidance. The construction process in itself is a holiday activity – one that you can work on solo during some quiet evening or make a group project with friends and family gathered around the table.

Once completed, these trees easily transition into real home decor pieces: The larger one works beautifully as a tabletop centerpiece for your dining room or kitchen island, while the smaller configurations fit perfectly on bookshelves, windowsills, or office desks. Unlike other decorations that may feel fragile or dated, these LEGO creations bring a sense of playfulness and a modern aesthetic that appeals to design-conscious households.

The value proposition here is more than just the immediate discount: For $26, you're getting a building set that provides hours of entertainment in construction and then months of display value during the holiday season. For parents who want to encourage creativity in their kids, this set provides just the right amount of structured building and imaginative play.

An amazing 3D printer for an amazing price


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


We're getting closer and closer to Black Friday, but that doesn't really matter here, as 3D printer manufacturer Bambu Lab is already deep into its early Black Friday sales. The Bambu Lab P1S is one of our favorite 3D printers we've reviewed, a winner of an Editor's Choice award, and an almost perfect star score. Bambu Lab has brought out the latest P2S to replace the P1S, but unfortunately for 3D printing hobbyists and especially fans of Bambu Lab in the US, the P2S is unavailable to purchase at the moment.

Go to the Bambu Lab website, and you can find the Bambu Lab P1S 3D printer for $399, the all-time low price for this printer. The list price for the P1S was previously $699, but we have seen the printer for less quite frequently over the last 6 months with various sales events and clippable coupon codes.

We had the chance to review the Bambu Lab P1S and noted how the P1S came semi-assembled for an easy setup out of the box, with the printer featuring automatic bed leveling, an abundance of presets in the slicer software, and exceptional print speeds with up to a 20000 mm/s² acceleration limit. The P1S comes with a fully enclosed print space, making the P1S perfect for high-temperature prints, and has a build volume of 256 x 256 x 256 mm.

Set the Bambu Lab P1S 3D printer up in 15 minutes and start your printing and maker journey. The P1S is an enclosed printer, making it ideal for high-temperature filament printing. Fast prints are standard thanks to the 20000 mm/s² acceleration limit, and you can even remotely monitor your prints via the built-in timelapse camera. 

The P1S uses a proprietary .4mm nozzle attached to a direct drive extruder. The print bed is made from a PEI textured spring steel sheet for hassle-free print removals. Bambu Labs' P1S has multiple wireless options, including both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth support. Load prints locally thanks to an available microSD card slot, and navigate all the menus and settings with the bright LED screen.

AliExpress-bought LED bulb includes a BL602 RISC-V-powered microcontroller.

A hardware hacker has installed a Minecraft server on a cheap smart lightbulb. Vimpo shows how this feat was completed and demonstrates the server working in a brief video, embedded below. Key to this achievement was the bulb's BL602 RISC-V-powered microcontroller.

Vimpo begins their quest by taking a knife to the unfortunate AliExpress-bought LED bulb. Oldies like me still find it jarring to see a lightbulb popped open without terrible consequences – but LEDs don't need to reside in a delicate vacuum.

Next up, our intrepid hacker desolders the microcontroller from the center of the bulb, where it sits surrounded by an array of LEDs. Remember, this lightbulb's microcontroller is powered by a BL602, which features a single RISC-V core, running at up to 192 MHz, and partnered with 276KB RAM, 128KB ROM, and sporting a modicum of I/O.

We then see the detached microcontroller with wires soldered individually to its headers. Vimpo confirms the connections are fine by quickly hooking up the wires to turn the lightbulb on and off.

A simple USB-to-serial adapter board is soldered to these connections for a steady, usable interface. We now have a ‘system' ready, with monitor and input peripherals, upon which to run a Minecraft server.

Of course, hardware is only half of Vimpo's solution. To get a Minecraft server operating on the limited resources of a smart bulb, the hacker has put together a system running an implementation dubbed Ucraft. You can find Ucraft code resources on GitHub, plus a guide to building the server system on a Linux machine.

Ucraft is gloriously compact, with a “binary size is approximately 46K bytes without authentication and 90K bytes with the authentication library,” says Vimpo. “Memory usage varies based on the number of active players. In the worst-case scenario with 10 players, heap usage will be around 70K bytes with authentication and 20K bytes without authentication.” However, the hacker is first to admit that Ucraft “lacks most, if not all, features of the vanilla server.”

In some ways, Minecraft is becoming the new Doom, used as a springboard for outlandish projects. Minecraft is now a leading light in inspiring hardware and software hackers to push the boundaries of the computing world. For example, in recent months, we've seen a 5-million-parameter ChatGPT AI model in Minecraft, as well as Minecraft running entirely in 8MB of VRAM on an old GPU, and another Minecraft server implemented using 63-year-old COBOL code.

Accurate neoplasia detection in patients with Barrett esophagus (BE) involves high-quality endoscopy, adequate biopsy sampling, careful examination, and appropriate recognition of neoplastic lesions, said Prateek Sharma, MD, in a presentation on the management of BE at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

However, clinicians often make mistakes such as failing to remove debris such as saliva and bile from the esophagus prior to assessing a patient, said Sharma, professor of medicine and the Elaine Blaylock Endowed Professor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine and the Cancer Center, Kansas City, Kansas.

More than 90% of neoplasias in patients with BE are found on an index endoscopy or within 6 months, as shown by Sharma and his colleagues in a systematic review, which highlights the importance of a high-quality index endoscopy, he told meeting attendees.

To improve the index endoscopy, Sharma developed a new algorithm called “CLEAN.”

The algorithm is composed of five steps, he said, the first of which is Clear: clear the esophagus of debris, including saliva and bile. Adequate prep is essential to detecting clinically significant lesions in patients with BE, he explained. In a study published in 2024, Sharma and colleagues found adequate cleanliness of the upper gastrointestinal tract was associated with a significantly higher detection rate of clinically significant lesions.

The second step of the algorithm is Learn: pay attention to BE inspection time and learn slow withdrawal strategies.

It's important not to shortchange inspection time, Sharma emphasized. He cited a previous study in which the percentage of patients with BE who had high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma during a surveillance endoscopy was 15% with inspection times of 2 minutes or less but jumped to 69% with inspection times of 7 minutes or more.

The third step of CLEAN is Endoscope: conduct a high-definition white-light endoscopy, which should be coupled with the fourth step, Acquire: acquire education on BE-related neoplasia, to learn how to recognize neoplastic lesions, he stressed.

The final step of the algorithm is Neoplasia detection rate (NDR): follow a quality metric to measure NDR.

The algorithm emphasizes a comprehensive approach in conjunction with resection of visible lesions followed by ablation for complete eradication, Sharma told Medscape Medical News.

If lesions are identified, the next step is resection and/or ablation, Sharma said.

“Resection is typically used for visible lesions, nodules, or masses, while ablation is used to treat the remaining underlying Barrett tissue,” he told Medscape Medical News. “A combination of both is often necessary to fully treat advanced cases, such as when a nodule is resected and the surrounding area is subsequently ablated.”

“It's important to understand why we need to resect,” he said.

“Resection removes the lesion” and “provides more accurate histopathology reading and staging of how deep the lesion is,” he explained. Options for resection of cancerous or precancerous lesions in patients with BE include endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD).

The treatment algorithm for BE continues to evolve, Sharma said in his presentation. Currently, evidence supports EMR for most cases, but ESD is based on factors including lesion size ≥ 25-30 mm and potential submucosal invasion, he said.

He cited a study of 1000 adults with early BE who were managed with EMR that showed a 96% curative response after 5 years. Similarly, a review of ESD for early BE neoplasia including 501 patients showed a 75% curative response rate overall and a 93% en bloc resection rate, he noted.

In terms of ablation, radiofrequency ablation, hybrid argon plasma coagulation, and the multifocal cryoballoon procedure have shown significant effectiveness, Sharma said.

In a 2020 multicenter, prospective study of 120 adult patients with BE, 76% achieved complete eradication of dysplasia, and 72% achieved complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia. As for safety, data from nine European centers including 154 patients who underwent ablation after resection had an adverse event rate of 6%, said Sharma.

“It is sometimes difficult to detect subtle nodularity and irregularity that would benefit more from resection therapy/EMR rather than ablation,” said Gyanprakash A. Ketwaroo, MD, associate professor of medicine (digestive diseases) at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.

“Lesions can be obscured by esophagitis, peristalsis, or the shape of the [gastroesophageal] GE junction,” he noted. Therefore, careful scope cleaning and inspection with high-definition white light and narrow band imaging are important, he said. “Using a cap on the scope to better distend or manipulate the gastroesophageal junction also helps identify obscured lesions,” he added.

“Any acronym or approach that reminds us to slow down, and examine carefully, is welcome,” Ketwaroo told Medscape Medical News. The CLEAN algorithm provides a useful summary of some of the key steps all clinicians should incorporate into approaching BE and could be useful for teaching trainees, he added.

Sharma disclosed serving as a consultant for the Olympus Corporation and Exact Sciences and receiving grant support from Fujifilm, Erbe Medical, and Braintree Pharmaceuticals.

Ketwaroo disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest.

The FDA sent letters to 18 website owners warning that they were selling unapproved botulinum toxin products, giving them 15 days to tell the agency the steps they will take to address its concerns.

In a statement issued on November 5, the agency said it was aware of adverse events associated with unapproved and misbranded botulinum toxin products — “commonly called Botox” — including botulism symptoms.

“Today we're taking action to protect American consumers and prevent online entities from selling these dangerous products,” FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, MD, MPH, said in the statement.

Many of the websites warned by the agency were continuing to sell their products at press time.

It is far from the first time the FDA has warned about counterfeit or unapproved botulinum toxin. In 2012, the agency sent more than 300 letters to medical practices that had purchased unapproved versions of botulinum toxin from a foreign supplier. A year later, the agency wrote to another 300 practices warning they had purchased unapproved botulinum toxin from an online supplier.

In 2024, the FDA alerted healthcare professionals and consumers that counterfeit versions of botulinum toxin had been administered to consumers in multiple states. The FDA and the US CDC reported that from November 2023 to April 2024, 17 people from nine states experienced symptoms that included blurry and double vision, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, slurred speech, difficult breathing, fatigue, and generalized weakness, “after receiving injections with counterfeit products, products from unverified sources, or from individuals who were not following state or local requirements.” Thirteen people were hospitalized and six were treated with botulism antitoxin because of concerns that botulinum toxin could have spread beyond the injection site.

Asked by Medscape Medical News to comment on the latest FDA warning and the ongoing proliferation of unapproved botulinum toxin products, M. Laurin Council, MD, MBA, president of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS), said,“Patients should not be receiving medical care off a website.”

She added, “lack of regulation and enforcement has enabled many to offer medical procedures for cosmetic purposes outside of their training and expertise.”

Council, professor of dermatology at WashU Medicine, St. Louis, said that board- certified dermatologists should urge patients who may seek injections at sites that are not physician offices, such as a medical spa, to determine who owns and operates the spa and whether injectors are licensed and trained to give the injection. Patients should also ask whether the product being injected is approved by the FDA and obtained from a reliable source.

The ASDS Association, the ASDS education and advocacy arm, is encouraging states to adopt model legislation crafted by the organization, the “Medical Spa Safety Act.” The proposal calls on states to require medical procedures to be performed under physician oversight and includes staff education requirements, and notification to the public if a physician is not on-site.

Healthcare professionals and consumers can report adverse events to the FDA's MedWatch program.

WASHINGTON, DC — Measures of liver stiffness remained stable or improved in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) after 36 months of treatment with seladelpar (Livdelzi) based on new data from the ongoing ASSURE study. 

These interim results support the drug's potential for long-term disease management by addressing a key marker of disease progression, said study author D. Barry Crittenden, MD, executive director of clinical development for seladelpar manufacturer, Gilead, in an interview.

“Patients with [PBC] who have advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis tend to show progressive increases in liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) over time, despite first-line treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA),” lead author Christopher L. Bowlus, MD, from the University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, and his colleagues explained in their presentation here at The Liver Meeting 2025: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD). 

Liver stiffness is an important marker of PBC progression which remains underexplored, added Crittenden, noting that no head-to-head trials are currently available to compare investigational compounds in PBC.

Seladelpar is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta agonist indicated for the treatment of PBC in adults as an adjunct to first-line treatment with UDCA in patients with an inadequate response or as monotherapy for those unable to tolerate UDCA.

The open-label phase 3 ASSURE trial is an ongoing extension of the RESPONSE trial, a pivotal trial that examined the impact of seladelpar on the primary endpoint of biochemical response in PBC. In that trial, as reported by Medscape Medical News, 61.7% of patients treated with seladelpar met the primary endpoint vs 20% on placebo.

The ASSURE study enrolled 337 patients, from both the RESPONSE study and from other seladelpar legacy studies. 

Previous results from the ASSURE study showed that seladelpar was significantly associated with biochemical response, alkaline phosphatase normalization, and itching through 3 years compared to placebo, Crittenden told Medscape Medical News. However, its long-term impact on LSM had not been previously evaluated. 

The current analysis included 114 patients who had at least one post-baseline LSM and had received 10 mg of oral seladelpar once daily and had available data at 36 months. Liver stiffness was measured using vibration-controlled transient elastography. The mean age of the participants was 58 years, and 95% were female. 

Up to 85% of the participants showed stable or improved LSMs at 36 months. The overall median change in liver stiffness was -0.2 kPa (-3%). 

Notably, patients at the highest risk of PBC progression (defined as LSM of 16.9 kPa or higher at baseline) showed a trend towards improvement, with a median change of -5.2 kPa (-30%), the researchers said. 

Patients whose LSM worsened by 30% or more were generally younger and had higher baseline levels of alkaline phosphatase at baseline, although other characteristics were similar, the researchers noted.

“There is growing interest in the use of serial LSMs to monitor and risk-stratify chronic liver disease patients,” wrote Yu Jun Wong, from the Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Unit, University of Alberta, Canada, and colleagues in a separate study published earlier this fall in the Journal of Hepatology.

This is “because this strategy might capture the impact of both the baseline risk of liver-related events and disease modifiers following the index LSM,” they explained. 

While both LSM and biochemical response have prognostic significance in PBC, discordance between measurements is frequent, the study authors noted. 

In an analysis of 1793 patients with PBC, they found that if the most recent LSM was greater than 10 kPa it strongly predicted liver-related events in PBC, irrespective of prior biochemical response or LSM trajectory.

However, they point out, “The present results do not contradict our previous data showing that the LSM trajectory in PBC has prognostic value independent of the baseline LSM. In the previous study, we showed that dynamic changes in LSM could be used, alongside with biochemical response, as a potential surrogate measure of disease outcome.”

The study was supported by Gilead. Crittenden is employed by Gilead. Multiple authors of the study by Wong et al declare relationships with different pharmaceutical companies including Gilead.

 November 10, 2025  

Health authorities across Europe are sounding the alarm over an unexpected resurgence of diphtheria — including a sharp increase in cutaneous infections — after decades of near elimination. The rise in cases has prompted renewed calls for adult vaccination and greater clinical vigilance among healthcare providers.

Diphtheria is an acute bacterial infection most often caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Its severity stems from a potent toxin capable of damaging the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. The classic form, respiratory diphtheria, typically presents as febrile pharyngitis with pseudomembranes, while the cutaneous form produces greyish-white membranes on preexisting wounds or ulcers. Corynebacterium ulcerans can cause similar symptoms, whereas Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis most commonly presents with lymphadenitis.

Highly contagious, diphtheria spreads mainly through respiratory droplets or direct contact with infected skin lesions and less often through contaminated objects. Infections caused by C ulcerans are generally linked to domestic animals — particularly dogs and cats — and do not spread between humans. By contrast, C pseudotuberculosis infections are typically associated with contact with small ruminants, such as goats.

The incubation period is 2-5 days, and the case fatality rate for respiratory diphtheria remains 5%-10%. Diagnosis relies on clinical evaluation, bacterial culture of pharyngeal samples, and confirmation via toxin testing at the National Reference Center at Institut Pasteur in Paris, France.

Since mandatory vaccination was introduced globally in the 1950s, the incidence of diphtheria has dropped dramatically, making it a rare disease in most parts of the world.

In France, diphtheria vaccination is part of the national immunisation schedule, which includes:

As a notifiable disease, diphtheria vaccination is mandatory for healthcare workers and recommended for travellers to endemic regions.

However, vaccine coverage among adults remains inadequate — only about 50% of people aged 65 years are protected, far below the herd immunity threshold of 80%-85% needed to prevent transmission.

In 2022, Europe experienced its largest diphtheria outbreak in seven decades, beginning primarily among migrant populations and later spreading to other vulnerable groups, including people who are homeless, inject drugs, or are unvaccinated or elderly.

Across Europe, 320 cases were reported in 2022, followed by 165 in 2023 and 56 in 2024. In France alone, 60 cases were recorded in 2022, 39 in 2023 (31 cutaneous), and 21 in 2024 (18 cutaneous).

While the overall risk to the general population remains low thanks to strong childhood vaccination rates, declining adult booster coverage poses an emerging concern. Health authorities are urging clinicians to verify vaccination status and encourage booster immunisation, particularly among at-risk or underserved populations.

A multicentre retrospective study conducted in France (2018-2022) found that the recent resurgence of diphtheria has been accompanied by a predominance of skin infections rather than respiratory cases — a pattern confirmed across Europe in 2022, when 77% of reported infections were cutaneous.

These infections typically present with pustular, ulcerative, or necrotic lesions that develop on preexisting wounds and are often secondarily infected with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus species.

The study identified several factors contributing to diagnostic challenges:

This diagnostic underestimation likely reflects low clinician awareness of cutaneous diphtheria and limited familiarity with national diagnostic guidelines. Health authorities in France and across Europe emphasise the need to raise clinical awareness of nonrespiratory diphtheria forms and encourage adherence to established diagnostic protocols.

Clinicians should suspect diphtheria in patients with chronic or worsening wounds, particularly following travel to endemic regions or among socially vulnerable individuals, such as the homeless or migrants.

The management of suspected diphtheria requires strict compliance with public health protocols:

In the first respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) season with widespread availability of two preventive options against the virus, RSV-related hospitalizations of young infants declined substantially, and both products showed real-world effectiveness similar to what was seen in clinical trials, according to two studies presented at the Infectious Disease Week (IDWeek) 2025 Annual Meeting in Atlanta.

No prophylactic options existed to prevent RSV in the pediatric general population until a maternal RSV vaccine and the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab were approved in 2023. In clinical trials, the maternal vaccine reduced the risk for RSV-related hospitalization by 68% within the first 3 months after birth and by 57% within the first 6 months. Nirsevimab was 83.2% effective against infants' RSV-related hospitalizations in its pivotal clinical trial.

During the first subsequent RSV season in 2023-2024, there was limited product availability and low uptake as people learned about the options. The 2024-2025 RSV season was therefore the first full RSV season with widely available preventive options, making it now possible to assess their impact on preventing severe disease and hospitalizations in children.

Paul Spearman, MD, director of infectious disease at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in Cincinnati, was not involved with either study but said the data presented sent a clear message.

“The biggest takeaway is that both the maternal vaccination and the monoclonal antibody administration have real-world effectiveness in preventing RSV hospitalizations and RSV disease [that's] medically attended,” Spearman told Medscape Medical News. “The initial studies are all done in really well-controlled situations, and now some of these studies are really showing what happens in the real world once you release this product.” 

Spearman said it's important not only for pediatricians but also for ob/gyns, family doctors, and the medical community more broadly to know how effective these products are.

“The impact on healthcare costs can potentially be tremendous because the hospitalizations are down so significantly,” Spearman added.

Jennifer Schuster, MD, professor of medicine at Children's Mercy, Kansas City, Missouri, presented data comparing RSV-association hospitalization rates in infants less than 6 months old between the period of 2017-2020 and that of the 2024-2025 season.

The data came from the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN), which prospectively enrolls children younger than 18 years old who have an emergency, outpatient, or inpatient visit for acute respiratory illness at one of the seven included sites in Rochester, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Nashville, Kansas City, Houston, and Seattle. The researchers analyzed trends from infants less than 6 months old who had a positive RSV PCR test, including those with other viral coinfections.

Using hospitalizations per 1000 infants, they calculated relative rate reductions between 2017-2020 and 2024-2025, adjusting for enrollment rates, surveillance days per week, test sensitivity, and hospital market share.

The youngest infants had the greatest reduction in RSV-associated hospitalizations. For babies up to 2 months old, the rate fell from 29.2% to 12.7%, a significant 56% relative rate reduction. In babies 3-5 months old, the rate fell from 16.3% to 11.2%, a 31% significant reduction. Rates fell for all infants less than 6 months old at all seven sites, with relative rate reductions ranging from 39% to 77% depending on the location.

“Widespread availability of RSV prevention products has the potential to dramatically reduce the RSV-associated burden of hospitalizations in young infants,” Schuster told attendees, though the differences in impact varied by location.

Natasha B. Halasa, MD, professor of pediatrics at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, and her colleagues also used data from the NVSN and analyzed the effectiveness of the maternal RSV vaccine in infants younger than 6 months old and the effectiveness of nirsevimab in infants younger than 8 months old. They excluded infants who received both, those who received palivizumab or received nirsevimab within the previous week, and those whose mothers received the vaccine less than 2 weeks before delivery.

Using a test-negative case-control study design, they adjusted their analysis for site, age in months, enrollment month, and having at least one high-risk medical condition. They also adjusted the nirsevimab analysis for insurance and prematurity status, and the maternal vaccine analysis for race and ethnicity.

The population analyzed for the maternal vaccine included 139 RSV-positive cases (19%) and 307 RSV-negative controls (35%). Most (61%) of the 446 infants were hospitalized, 30% were seen in the emergency department (ED), and 9% were seen in outpatient settings. The researchers calculated the vaccine to be 64% effective against any medically attended disease and 70% effective against hospitalization, but there were too few infants to assess effectiveness in any subgroups.

The nirsevimab population of 1795 children included 462 cases (14%) and 1259 controls (44%), with 49% hospitalized, 36% seen in the ED, and 15% seen as outpatients. The researchers calculated the monoclonal antibody to be 76.8% effective against any medically attended RSV, 80.6% effective against hospitalization, and 89.6% effective against ICU admission. Nirsevimab was similarly effective against RSV-A (80.2%) as RSV-B (78.8%), but it was more effective in full-term infants (83.3%) than in preterm infants (69.7%). It was also more effective in infants who received it at birth (87.2%) than in those who received it at a later point (76.6%).

“The estimated maternal RSV vaccine effectiveness represents protection in the first few months of life, and additional studies are needed to evaluate vaccine effectiveness by month of life through at least 6 months of age,” Halasa said. Nirsevimab's effectiveness, meanwhile, was sustained through at least 5 months, about the length of the RSV season in the US.

Schuster had no disclosures, and her study did not note external funding. Halasa reported receiving research support from Merck, and her study did not note external funding. Spearman reported consulting work for Cyanvac.

A daily glass of orange juice may do more than refresh; it can fine-tune thousands of genes tied to blood pressure and metabolism, with the benefits varying depending on your body weight.



Study: A Global Transcriptomic Analysis Reveals Body Weight-Specific Molecular Responses to Chronic Orange Juice Consumption in Healthy Individuals. Image Credit: Sunlight_s / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Molecular Nutrition & Food Research, a group of researchers investigated how chronic orange juice (OJ) intake affects the transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in healthy adults, and whether responses vary by body mass index (BMI) status. This was a single-arm pre–post intervention without a control beverage; findings show transcriptomic associations and do not establish causality. Fold-change ranges for individual genes were reported in supplementary data but were not emphasized in the main text.

What if a breakfast staple could quietly tune the genes that steer blood pressure, lipids, and inflammation? Citrus fruits, especially OJ, supply flavanones such as hesperidin and naringenin that may influence vascular tone, lipid handling, and immune signaling. Yet, most people ask whether a daily glass truly alters biology in ways that matter, and whether body weight affects the response.

Mapping gene activity in circulating immune cells can link a kitchen habit to outcomes families care about, although the mechanistic paper did not newly assess clinical endpoints; prior publications from the same cohort reported reductions in blood pressure and body-fat percentage with 500 mL/day OJ over 60 days.

Healthy adults (n = 20; 10 men, 10 women; 21–36 years) without chronic disease consumed 500 mL/day of pasteurized OJ for 60 days, split into two home doses, after a three-day citrus-free washout; participants also avoided citrus foods during the intervention.

Fasting blood was drawn at baseline (T0) and day 60 (T60). PBMCs were isolated and total ribonucleic acid (RNA) extracted. Global transcriptomes were profiled on Clariom D microarrays; differentially expressed features were defined at false discovery rate-adjusted p < 0.05.

Pathway enrichment was performed using GeneTrail with the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), WikiPathways, and BioCarta; protein-protein interaction networks were analyzed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING).

Predicted transcription factors were identified with Enrichr. MicroRNA (miRNA) targets were derived via Mienturnet/miRTarBase; long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) targets via LncRRIsearch; small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) changes were also cataloged. Disease associations employed the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database.

In silico molecular docking (SwissDock) tested Phase II flavanone metabolites (for example, hesperetin- and naringenin-glucuronides/sulfates) and gut-derived catabolites against candidate transcription factors including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) subunit 1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU), proto-oncogene (MYC), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), Yin-Yang 1 (YY1), E26 transformation-specific (ETS) transcription factor ELK4 (ELK4), RELA (p65 subunit of NF-κB), retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRA), interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), and tumor protein 53 (TP53). Subgroup analyses were conducted to contrast normal-weight (NW) and overweight (OW) participants by BMI.

Chronic OJ intake remodeled the PBMC transcriptome: 3,790 oligonucleotides changed, including 1,705 protein-coding genes (mostly downregulated), 66 miRNAs, 19 lncRNAs, and 67 snoRNAs. Principal components, partial least squares–discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and clustering analyses successfully separated T60 from T0, indicating a consistent intervention signal.

Enriched pathways mapped to blood pressure control (aldosterone synthesis/secretion, renin secretion, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-related signaling), lipid metabolism (thermogenesis, adipogenesis, mitochondrial fatty-acid β-oxidation), inflammation (toll-like receptor, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-17 (IL17)), cell adhesion (focal adhesion, actin cytoskeleton), and major signaling axes (mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt (PI3K-Akt), epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), insulin, and advanced glycation end product–receptor for advanced glycation end products). Additional enrichment included AHR signaling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein processing.

Protein-protein interaction hubs included serine/threonine kinase AKT1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), catenin beta-1 (CTNNB1), heat-shock protein 90 alpha (HSP90AA1), and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (EEF2).

Cardiometabolic relevance emerged at the gene level. Blood-pressure-linked genes nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) were downregulated, alongside nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 2 (NR4A2), period circadian regulator 1 (PER1), salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1), G protein-coupled receptor 183 (GPR183), and serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1), aligning with mechanisms that favor lower blood pressure.

Inflammatory mediators decreased: IL1B, IL6, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2/COX-2), and regulator of G-protein signaling 1 (RGS1), consistent with dampened NF-κB activity and reduced cytokine tone.

Lipid/adipocyte programs also shifted: genes such as Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), perilipin-2 (PLIN2), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) moved toward a profile linked to better metabolic control.

Non-coding layers mirrored these trends. Among 66 altered miRNAs, weight-loss-associated species (for example, miR-548 family, miR-1185-1) rose, while inflammation-associated miR-640 and miR-1248 declined; miR-1305 increased, a change reported with anti-inflammatory effects.

19 lncRNAs changed, including downregulation of small nucleolar RNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) and upregulation of apoptosis-associated transcript in bladder cancer (AATBC), a human adipocyte plasticity regulator. 67 snoRNAs shifted, 61 of which were downregulated, including reduced RPL13A cluster members (SNORD U32/U33/U34/U35), a pattern tied to lower oxidative stress and inflammation.

Fold-change magnitudes for these RNA classes varied across transcripts, typically within a −1.5 to −8.0 range for downregulated features and +1.5 to +5.0 for upregulated ones, according to supplemental data. Disease-mapping linked the signature to heart and vascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and glucose-metabolism disorders, underscoring clinical relevance.

Overweight participants exhibited a unique modulation of lipid metabolism and adipogenesis pathways, characterized by distinct regulation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3B), G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6), and miRNAs, including miR-548i and miR-1292-3p. Normal-weight participants exhibited unique modulation of inflammatory pathways, characterized by changes in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), solute carrier family 16 member 6 (SLC16A6), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2), MAPK1, and miR-1185-2-5p. Thus, two people drinking the same OJ may experience different molecular benefits depending on BMI.

Molecular docking supported direct interactions between Phase II flavanone metabolites (for example, hesperetin-3-glucuronide, hesperetin-7-glucuronide, hesperetin-3-sulfate; naringenin-4-glucuronide, naringenin-7-glucuronide) and transcription factors, including NFKB1, AHR, PPARA, ATF4, PLAU, NRF1, IRF9, MYC, YY1, ELK4, RELA, RXRA, and TP53, with free-energy range −6.29 to −9.63 kcal/mol; interactions <-6 kcal/mol were considered significant, offering a plausible route from juice metabolites to gene-regulatory effects.

Daily OJ, a familiar food, reprogrammed immune-cell gene networks tied to blood pressure, lipids, and inflammation, with layered changes across protein-coding genes, miRNA, lncRNA, and snoRNA. Predicted interactions between flavanone metabolites and transcription factors, including NFKB1, AHR, and PPARA, provide mechanistic plausibility.

Importantly, BMI-stratified effects revealed that lipid pathways dominated in overweight adults, while inflammation pathways shifted in normal-weight adults. However, the results are limited by the small sample size (n=20), the absence of a control beverage, the use of a microarray platform, and the exploratory nature of in-silico docking, which remains hypothesis-generating. 

Future studies should integrate fold-change magnitude data with targeted functional assays to validate these transcriptomic signatures. For individuals and clinicians, this supports tailoring “simple” dietary advice to body weight, to turn an everyday drink into a more precise cardiometabolic lever.

Personalized nutrition requires both molecular evidence and practical application; these findings offer early molecular insights that can inform such individualized dietary guidance. Further research is needed to confirm and translate these transcriptomic effects into clinical outcomes.

Routine screening is limited to only a few cancer types. New research indicates that routine liquid biopsy testing (multi-cancer early detection testing) could substantially reduce late-stage cancer diagnoses, allowing patients to receive treatment at earlier cancer stages, which are more likely to respond to interventions. The findings are published by Wiley online in CANCER, a peer-reviewed journal of the American Cancer Society.

Currently, routine screening is only recommended for four types of cancer, leaving approximately 70% of new cancer cases to be detected only after symptoms appear, often at an advanced stage when survival rates are lower. Multi-cancer early detection tests offer a revolutionary approach by screening for multiple cancer types simultaneously from a single blood draw.

To evaluate the impact of one such test, Cancerguard, investigators used epidemiological data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and developed a simulation model of 14 cancer types, which account for nearly 80% of cancer incidence and mortality. The researchers simulated 10-year disease progression for 5 million US adults aged 50–84 years and assessed the effects of incorporating an annual blood-based multi-cancer early detection test into standard care.

The model estimated that over 10 years, supplemental multi-cancer early detection testing would lead to a 10% increase in stage I diagnoses, a 20% increase in stage II diagnoses, a 30% increase in stage III diagnoses, and a 45% decrease in stage IV diagnoses, relative to standard care. The largest absolute reductions in stage IV diagnoses were in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. The largest relative reductions were in cervical, liver, and colorectal cancers.

Our analysis shows that multi-cancer blood tests could be a game changer for cancer control. By detecting cancers earlier-before they spread-these tests could potentially improve survival and reduce the personal and economic burden of cancer.""

Researchers analyzing over three million patients in Ontario discovered that even a single concussion can leave lasting driving impairments, raising crash risk far more than conditions like sleep apnea or epilepsy.

Study: Concussions and risk of a subsequent traffic crash: retrospective cohort analysis in Ontario, Canada. Image credit: Southworks/Shutterstock.com

Concussion, a form of mild traumatic brain injury, can significantly increase the risk of a subsequent motor vehicle crash, as reported by a new study published in BMJ Open. 

Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy, sleep apnea, or substance use disorder, which cause cognitive and functional impairment, can potentially increase the risk of a motor vehicle crash.

Thoughtful counselling and medical care for people living with these conditions can potentially reduce traffic crashes and save lives. In some countries, policies mandate that clinicians provide safety warnings to patients who are not medically fit to drive due to functional deficits.

A concussion is a type of mild traumatic brain injury caused by a direct blow to the head. The condition is associated with temporary deficits in functioning after which the affected person recovers. Symptoms sometimes last for weeks, including headaches, insomnia, dizziness, amnesia, fatigue, confusion, irritability, depression, delayed reaction time, and difficulty concentrating.

Although most people recover without long-term effects, there remains uncertainty about whether recovery is complete and whether there are no ongoing impairments. Another adversity is that a concussion can predispose patients to another concussion with further neurological consequences.

Given the potential association of concussion with neurocognitive and functional deficits, the current study aimed to explore whether a past concussion increases the risk of a subsequent traffic crash.

A total of 3,037,028 patients were analyzed, including 425,158 with a concussion and 2,611,870 with an ankle sprain (active controls). The risk of motor vehicle crashes requiring emergency medical care was compared between patients with a concussion and an ankle sprain.  

The study identified a total of 200,603 patients with a concussion or an ankle sprain who experienced a subsequent traffic crash during a follow-up period of 10 years. This estimate was equivalent to an absolute risk of 1 in 15 patients.

The risk of a traffic crash was 49% higher among patients with a concussion compared to those with an ankle sprain. The risk was especially high during the first month after a concussion, showing about a sixfold increase compared to controls.

Other factors that were significantly associated with an increased traffic crash risk after a concussion included younger age, male gender, a rural home location, lower socioeconomic status, late-night driving, and a diagnosis of alcohol misuse.

A separate analysis involving patients with more than one concussion revealed a 73% higher traffic crash risk after a single concussion; a 114% higher risk after two concussions; and a 124% higher risk after three concussions. However, such a robust dose-response association was not observed in patients with multiple ankle sprains.

Artificial intelligence (XGBoost) models were applied to adjust for potential confounding factors and confirmed that concussion patients still had about a 40% higher crash risk compared with controls, supporting the robustness of the association. “Negative control” analyses for unrelated medical emergencies such as conjunctivitis and kidney stones showed no excess risk. Further, they indicated that the observed link between concussion and crash risk was specific rather than general to all medical conditions.

The study reveals that having a concussion significantly increases the risk of a subsequent motor vehicle crash, particularly during the early weeks after a concussion. The risk is more pronounced after two or more concussions.

Previous simulation studies suggest that concussion is associated with specific neurological disabilities that may result in reduced vehicle control, altered driving skills, or persistent driving impairments. A survey of adults has reported an association between mild traumatic brain injury and aberrant driving behaviors. These impairments may contribute to the risk of a traffic crash.  

The magnitude of concussion-related traffic crash risk observed in the study is substantially higher than the previously estimated risks related to sleep apnea or uncontrolled epilepsy, justifying a safety warning from clinicians.

Overall, the current study findings suggest that current mitigation efforts are insufficient. Since driving has become an essential part of modern life, clinicians should advise patients with a concussion to be cautious about their increased risk of a traffic crash.

Post-concussion risks can also be reduced by effective care of symptoms, such as treating headaches, sleep disturbance, depression, and substance misuse. Other risk mitigation strategies include temporarily reducing traffic exposure by avoiding high-speed, long-distance road trips or late-night driving. Campaigns raising awareness about concussion-related traffic crashes may also protect the patient and the community.

Since the causality of observed associations could not be determined, there remains a possibility that factors that predispose patients to concussions may also predispose patients to a traffic crash. This possibility of reverse causality highlights that concussion is not necessarily the cause of a subsequent traffic crash, and that prioritizing concussion treatment may not necessarily improve road safety.

The presence of potential confounding factors makes it challenging to identify the mechanisms underlying the association between past concussion and future traffic crash risk. Furthermore, each concussion is unique in anatomy, energy, angularity, and severity. Therefore, average risks may not apply to individual patients.

Since a concussion is often associated with decreased attention, delayed reactions, transient confusion, mood disorders, cardiac arrhythmia, memory deficits, and sleep difficulties, future research is needed to assess neurocognitive deficits after a concussion.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is a rare but serious adverse effect of the diabetes drug metformin in which the body accumulates too much lactic acid. Investigators developed and tested a protocol for diagnosis and treatment of MALA. Their work will be presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025 from November 5–9.

The protocol, which included immediate initiation of dialysis using either intermittent hemodialysis, continuous kidney replacement therapy, or peritonealdialysis as treatment, was implemented at Maharat Nakhonratchasima hospital (MNRH), in Thailand. Another hospital, Burirum Hospital (BH), did not implement the protocol. A total of 347 cases were included over 5 years (70 in MNRH pre-intervention, 129 in MNRH intervention, and 148 in BH).

In MNRH, the 30-day mortality rate was reduced from 25.7% to 13.9% after implementing the protocol, whereas in BH the 30-day mortality rate was not reduced during the same period (27.2% and 30%). The trend of mortality rate in MNRH during the intervention period decreased by -2.08% per quarter. The average door-to-dialysis time—the interval between a patient's hospital admission and the initiation of dialysis—was reduced from 870 minutes to 690 minutes, and MALA awareness increased from 38.5% to 89.9% after implementation.

A standardized MALA protocol covering diagnosis, access, and treatment shortened door-to-dialysis time, increased awareness, and reduced care variation. Fast-track dialysis pathways should be adopted for time-sensitive conditions like MALA. Availability of all dialysis modalities ensures flexibility and enables timely treatment initiation.""

The current kidney transplant waitlisting criterion is based on a single measurement of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≤20 ml/min/1.73m2) and does not consider an individual's risk of progressing to kidney failure.

A new study reveals that inclusion of a patient's two-year risk of progression to kidney failure (using the Kidney Failure Risk Equation [KFRE], which incorporates age, sex, urine albumin, and eGFR) as a decision-making tool toward pre-emptive listing for kidney transplantation, has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce racial disparities. The findings were presented at ASN Kidney Week 2025, held November 5–9.

When examining the use of the two-year risk of progression to kidney failure of ≥25% based on the KFRE as a listing criterion and comparing it with the current eGFR ≤20 criterion, investigators found that among 10,368 US veterans with chronic kidney disease in 2022 who would meet at least one of the criteria, 60% met both and 20% met only one or the other.

In 2022, veterans who only qualified by the eGFR ≤20 criterion were older (71 years) than those who only qualify by KFRE ≥25% (53 years).

Also, using the kidney disease progression criteria only, more males, minorities (Hispanic, Black, and Asian), and those with diabetes and/or albuminuria would be waitlisted. When examining longitudinal data (2006–2019) to assess outcomes, the group who met both criteria or the KFRE ≥25% only, had the highest rates of kidney failure and lower mortality compared with those who only met the eGFR ≤20 criterion.

Expanding the waitlisting criteria for kidney transplantation to include risk of kidney failure prioritizes individualized approaches to care and could improve outcomes in younger patients with chronic kidney disease, as well as improve racial parity in access to kidney transplantation. This approach will continue to be studied prospectively and in populations beyond veterans to verify its potential to improve patient outcomes.""

Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) is a telomere maintenance mechanism employed by 5-10 % of cancer cells to achieve replicative immortality, and is absent in normal cells. Unlike telomerase (TEL) positive cancers, ALT tumors rely on chronic telomeric replication stress to drive telomere extension.

Factors regulating this process serve as promising targets for the development of specific therapeutic inhibitors for oncology. Despite this, no targeted therapies currently exist for ALT cancers. Through collaboration with the Nikon Bioimaging lab, the research team performed a high-throughput arrayed CRISPR screen with an imaging output to identify RNA-interacting factors with potential as targets in ALT cancers.

To discover and validate therapeutic targets for ALT cancers, the team adapted and implemented two assays from published literature, which can detect unique ALT molecular hallmarks: CCA-qPCR for C-circles and ssTelo native FISH for single-stranded telomeric DNA.

By performing CRISPR knockout (KO) of literature-established control genes, they validated these assays by observing the expected increase (FANCM) or decrease (BLM) in ALT hallmarks associated with loss of either gene.

Osteosarcoma models feature heavily in the ALT literature due to the high prevalence of ALT in clinical samples from this lineage and the availability and amenability of these cell lines to in vitro manipulation. The team used the CCA-qPCR and ssTelo native FISH assays to validate a panel of osteosarcoma cell lines for ALT or TEL status based on the presence or absence of the ALT hallmarks.

They also identified ALT cell lines from brain, soft tissue, and lung to expand their ability to identify ALT-specific targets across multiple lineages.

To identify ALT modulators within STORM's target space, the team carried out an arrayed KO screen in the ALT-positive osteosarcoma cell line U-2OS and, utilizing the imaging and analysis expertise of the Nikon Bioimaging Lab, determined the effects of these KOs on ssTelo-positive foci number and intensity.

The results of their screen confirmed several known ALT modulators: co-factors of FANCM and BLM, FAAP24 and RMI1, the dead-box helicases DDX39A and DDX39B, and members of the cleavage and polyadenylation machinery, CSPF2 and PABPN1. They also identified several novel regulators of ALT activity that could be pursued as potential therapeutic targets for ALT-related cancers.

The team performed a confirmatory screen, focusing on the hits from the first screen along with any associated complex members, regardless of their prior performance. They used ICE analysis to demonstrate very high on-target editing efficiency, indicating a low likelihood of false negatives within the primary screen. 

They observed a strong correlation in the ssTelo FISH results between the primary and secondary screens, confirming the ALT modulatory activity of the top hits.

In a new study of more than 40,000 patients, researchers at Intermountain Health in Salt Lake City have found that patients who have no evidence of calcium in their coronary arteries are not only significantly less likely to die from heart conditions – including heart attacks and heart failure– but also are at reduced risk of death from non-cardiac medical conditions.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a strong predictor of how likely someone is to develop clinical coronary artery disease. It is an excellent measure of coronary plaque burden.

When cholesterol-laden plaque builds up in the coronary arteries, blood flow to heart muscle is limited, and plaque rupture with coronary thrombosis can block off blood flow completely, leading to unstable angina or a heart attack.

As plaques age, they attract calcium, which can be imaged with computed tomography. If someone has a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of zero, the chance that their coronary arteries are clear of advanced plaques is very high. If CAC is present, then their risk of a future heart attack is much greater and in proportion to the CAC score. 

In the Intermountain Health study, researchers found that patients with any level of coronary artery calcium have more than two times greater risk of dying of any medical condition than patients with no evidence of CAC – including medical conditions not related to heart health.

We know that not having any coronary artery calcium is a predictor of being in good coronary health, but we were surprised to find that it may also be a sign you're in good general health.""

Jeffrey L. Anderson, MD, distinguished clinical and research physician at Intermountain Health and principal investigator of the study

""Someone's coronary artery calcium score could be a more powerful predictor of a person's overall health than we previously thought. We don't know the mechanism for this extended benefit, but coronary plaque may be correlated with plaque in blood vessels in other parts of the body, and having atherosclerosis may also negatively impact immune surveillance, an important protective mechanism against cancer.""

Findings from the study were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2025 in New Orleans on Saturday, Nov. 8.

In the large, retrospective study, Intermountain researchers reviewed the medical records of 40,018 Intermountain Health patients, whose doctors determined they were at risk of having or developing heart disease, and as part of that care, underwent a PET/CT stress test.

Of the patients in the study, 7,967 had no evidence of coronary artery calcium, and 32,051 had some levels of CAC. Researchers then followed up with patients for five years and reviewed all-cause mortality of people with a CAC score of zero compared to those with a CAC score of greater than zero. 

Researchers found that people who had any level of coronary artery calcium were 2 to 3 times more likely to have died than those without CAC in those five years.

Even more surprising, of those with CAC who died, only about one quarter did so from cardiovascular disease. That means most of these patients died of something else, i.e., non-cardiovascular diseases.

Researchers say they're not sure why patients' all-cause mortality rates were higher for those with evidence of coronary artery calcium. The next step in this research, they say, is to examine those non-cardiovascular deaths, and better stratify the causes behind them.

""This may help uncover the mechanism of why a coronary artery calcium score predicts death due to non-coronary artery problems,"" said Dr. Anderson. ""It's not clear to us right now, and it requires more study, but it's a very interesting observation and suggests that coronary artery calcium has prognostic value beyond just heart attacks and other heart -related causes.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study uncovers a surprising connection between sugar metabolism and alcohol addiction","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251110/Study-uncovers-a-surprising-connection-between-sugar-metabolism-and-alcohol-addiction.aspx","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 17:53:00 GMT","

Scientists have uncovered a surprising connection between sugar metabolism and alcohol addiction, identifying a potential new therapeutic target for treating alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD).

In a new study, out today in Nature Metabolism, University of Colorado Anschutz researchers found that alcohol triggers a metabolic pathway in the body that leads to the internal production of fructose, the same type of sugar commonly found in sweetened foods and beverages. This process, driven by the enzyme ketohexokinase (KHK), appears to play a key role in both reinforcing alcohol consumption habits and accelerating liver damage.

Researchers discovered that mice lacking KHK showed markedly lower alcohol inclination and consumption. These mice drank less alcohol across multiple tests, including voluntary drinking and reward-based models, and exhibited reduced activity in brain regions associated with addiction.

Importantly, alcohol-induced liver injury appeared to be non-existent when KHK was blocked, either genetically or through medication. Livers displayed reduced fat accumulation, inflammation and scarring, suggesting that interfering with fructose metabolism could halt or even prevent alcohol-related liver disease progression.

""Our findings show that alcohol doesn't just damage the liver directly, it hijacks the body's sugar metabolism in a way that enhances drinking behavior and worsens liver injury,"" said Miguel A. Lanaspa, DVM, PhD, associate research professor at CU Anschutz and senior author. ""By targeting fructose metabolism, we may be able to break this cycle and develop new treatments for both alcohol addiction and liver disease.""

Because both alcohol-associated liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) share fructose-driven mechanisms, the results suggest that therapies designed to inhibit fructose metabolism could benefit a broad range of patients with liver disease linked to diet or alcohol use.

This discovery highlights an unexpected intersection between sugar and alcohol metabolism. It opens exciting possibilities for developing treatments that target a common pathway underlying both metabolic and alcohol-related liver diseases.""

Richard Johnson, MD, professor at CU Anschutz and study co-author

The research provides a promising new direction for addressing liver disease and alcohol addiction, conditions for which effective treatments remain limited.

Researchers from Mass General Brigham have found that olezarsen-a drug designed to lower triglyceride levels-can also decrease the risk of acute pancreatitis, a potential complication in patients with severely elevated triglyceride levels. The results, from two randomized, placebo-controlled trials (CORE-TIMI 72a and CORE2-TIMI 72b), were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions and simultaneously published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Severe hypertriglyceridemia is a condition in which the level of triglycerides (a type of fat that circulates in the blood) is very high. Approximately 1 in 100 people in the U.S. have severe hypertriglyceridemia. The condition puts people at risk for acute pancreatitis, inflammation of the pancreas that can be life-threatening.

The trials, which were designed collaboratively between the TIMI Study Group at Mass General Brigham and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, the trials' sponsor, tested the safety and efficacy of olezarsen for reducing triglycerides and the risk of acute pancreatitis. The trials enrolled 1,063 participants across 33 countries who had fasting triglyceride levels ≥500 mg/dL and were taking lipid-lowering therapy.

These findings support olezarsen's potential to become a cornerstone therapy for severe hypertriglyceridemia, particularly for preventing a serious and potentially life-threating condition. Prevention is key in medicine, and our findings underscore the importance of clinical trials in evaluating the efficacy and safety of new treatments to improve health outcomes.""

Nicholas Marston, MD, MPH, lead author, cardiologist with the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute

Patients received monthly injections of olezarsen (50 mg or 80 mg) or placebo for 12 months. In 590 patients with measurements available at baseline and follow-up, more than 85% of patients taking either 50 mg or 80 mg of olezarsen saw their triglyceride levels drop below 500 mg/dL, compared with 35% in the placebo group.

There were 29 acute pancreatitis events reported across the two studies. The incidence of acute pancreatitis was 1.1 per 100 patient years in the pooled olezarsen groups, compared with 6.2 per 100 patient years in the placebo group – translating to an 85% relative risk reduction.

The long-term effectiveness and safety of olezarsen for patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia is being evaluated in an ongoing open-label extension study.

Drinking coffee can protect against atrial fibrillation (A-Fib), a common heart rhythm disorder that causes rapid, irregular heartbeat and can lead to stroke and heart failure.

Doctors typically recommend that people with heart issues like A-Fib avoid caffeine out of fear that it will trigger symptoms. But a study by UC San Francisco and the University of Adelaid has concluded that drinking a cup of caffeinated coffee a day reduced A-Fib by 39%.

""Coffee increases physical activity which is known to reduce atrial fibrillation,"" said Gregory M. Marcus, MD, MAS, who holds the Endowed Professorship in Atrial Fibrillation Research and is an electrophysiologist at UCSF Health. Marcus is the senior author of the paper, which appears Nov. 9 in JAMA. ""Caffeine is also a diuretic, which could potentially reduce blood pressure and in turn lessen A-Fib risk. Several other ingredients in coffee also have anti-inflammatory properties that could have positive effects.""

A-Fib has been increasing in recent years along with obesity and the aging population. A-Fib, which has been diagnosed in more than 10 million U.S. adults, is estimated to affect up to 1 in 3 people.

Researchers named their study DECAF for Does Eliminating Coffee Avoid Fibrillation? It is the first randomized clinical trial to investigate the link between caffeinated coffee and A-Fib, and it was funded by the National Institutes of Health.

The study enrolled 200 coffee-drinking patients with persistent atrial fibrillation, or a related condition called atrial flutter along with a history of A-Fib. They were scheduled for electrical cardioversion, which gives a single electrical shock to shift the heart into a normal rhythm. They were randomly assigned either to consume at least one cup of caffeinated coffee or an espresso shot each day - or abstain from coffee and other products that contain caffeine for six months.

The group that consumed coffee had a 39% lower risk of recurrent A-Fib episodes. In addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, researchers speculated that drinking coffee might also reduce the risk of A-Fib simply by making people consume fewer unhealthy beverages.

The results were astounding. Doctors have always recommended that patients with problematic A-Fib minimize their coffee intake, but this trial suggests that coffee is not only safe but likely to be protective.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy linked to increased risk of cardiovascular complications","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20251110/Hypertensive-disorders-of-pregnancy-linked-to-increased-risk-of-cardiovascular-complications.aspx","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 12:14:00 GMT","

A new study from researchers at Intermountain Health reveals that hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular complications - including heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and death - within five years of giving birth.

The study found that women who experienced HDP during pregnancy were significantly more likely to develop serious cardiovascular-related issues compared to those without HDP. These findings underscore the growing body of evidence over the past two decades linking pregnancy-related hypertension to long-term maternal health risks.

Any form of hypertension during pregnancy significantly increases cardiovascular risk and the risk of death. This risk is present in women with chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy, and it's even more pronounced when compounded by severe forms of HDP, such as eclampsia.""

Kismet Rasmusson, NP, principal investigator of the study and an advanced practice clinician with Intermountain Health's Advanced Heart Failure Program

The findings were presented at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2025 in New Orleans on Sunday, November 9.

In this retrospective study, researchers analyzed 218,141 live births involving 157,606 patients across 22 Intermountain Health hospitals between 2017 and 2024. They reviewed electronic medical records for diagnoses of chronic hypertension and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and eclampsia. Patients were then monitored for cardiovascular disease for an average of five years following delivery.

• 19.7% of patients had a HDP diagnosis, with most cases occurring during the first live birth.

• Patients with HDP had significantly more cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, smoking, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, depression, and lower socioeconomic status.

• HDP was most strongly associated with increased risk of heart failure (3 to 13 greater risk), but also for stroke (2-17 greater risk), heart attack (3 to 7 greater risk), coronary artery disease (2 to 7 greater risk), and death (1.4 to 4 greater risk).

• The severity of HDP correlated with higher cardiovascular risk. Women with chronic hypertension and eclampsia had the greatest risk of future cardiovascular events compared to those without HDP.

Despite these alarming statistics, many pregnant women remain unaware of the long-term cardiovascular risks associated with HDP.

""We need to do a better job identifying women with these risk factors and ensuring they receive appropriate care before, during, and after pregnancy,"" said Rasmusson. ""This is especially critical for those with severe forms of HDP.""

Rasmusson emphasized the importance of cross-disciplinary care for women at risk.

""Traditionally, this has been the domain of OB-GYNs and nurse midwives, but our findings show it's an 'all hands-on deck' situation,"" she said. ""At Intermountain, we're integrating primary care and cardiology into the care teams for high-risk patients, creating a comprehensive clinical care model to address this growing concern.""

This groundbreaking research highlights the urgent need for increased awareness, early intervention, and collaborative care to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality linked to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, she said.

Despite the region's reputation for healthy living, new research reveals that ultra-processed foods are increasingly prevalent in the diets of Mediterranean youth, linking poor eating habits with excessive screen time and modern lifestyle shifts.



Study: Unhealthy Ultra-Processed Food Consumption in Children and Adolescents Living in the Mediterranean Area: The DELICIOUS Project. Image Credit: Rimma Bondarenko / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the International Journal of Public Health, researchers leveraged an extensive cross-sectional study to investigate the consumption of unhealthy UPF items among youth in the Mediterranean region.

The study surveyed 2,011 families across five countries and found that about 95% of children and adolescents consumed at least one unhealthy UPF item daily.

This high intake was strongly linked to obesity, older adolescent age, and suboptimal lifestyle factors, including increased screen time and exposure to food advertising, with additional links to frequent eating out of home and snacking.

High parental education was associated with high consumption but not with daily consumption, while having an older or female responding parent was inversely associated. Younger parental age was identified as a risk factor for higher UPF consumption.

These findings suggest that UPF consumption is part of a complex, modern, and unhealthy lifestyle that has taken root even in this traditionally healthy region.

In this study, “daily consumption” referred to eating at least one of the listed unhealthy UPF items daily.

The traditional Mediterranean Diet (MeDi) has historically been considered one of the most optimal extant dietary patterns, famously associated with longevity and health. However, recent decades have witnessed a global ""nutrition transition."" In many areas, including the Mediterranean region, traditional dietary patterns are reported as being progressively abandoned in favor of ""Westernized"" products that are high in energy but low in nutritional density.

The primary constituents of these ""unhealthy"" diets are often ultra-processed foods (UPFs), industrial formulations containing little to no whole foods. Nutritional research has revealed that these foods prioritize convenience and hyper-palatability, frequently using cosmetic additives and high levels of added sugar, sodium, and unhealthy fats.

A growing body of research links high UPF consumption to numerous health problems, including metabolic disorders, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), and even mental health issues like depression.

Studies specifically focused on children and adolescents have associated UPFs with food addiction in the former cohort, and faster increases in body mass index (BMI) and body fat percentage during adolescence. While this trend is globally recognized, data specifically focusing on unhealthy UPFs in Mediterranean youth remain limited.

The present study addressed this knowledge gap by using a cross-sectional analysis of the DELICIOUS (UnDErstanding consumer food choices & promotion of healthy and sustainable Mediterranean diet and LIfestyle in Children and adolescents through behavIOUral change actionS) project, an initiative aimed at understanding food choices and promoting a healthy Mediterranean lifestyle in children and adolescents.

The study cohort consisted of 2,011 parents of children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 from five Mediterranean countries: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Egypt, and Lebanon. Study data were collected via a parent-completed, detailed electronic survey that covered demographics, eating habits, and lifestyle factors for both parents and their children.

The survey included a 13-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) measuring the consumption of soft drinks, fast food, salty snacks, commercial sauces, and sweets. These items operationalized “unhealthy” UPFs; frequency, rather than quantity or total UPF intake, was assessed, and the data were parent-reported. FFQ data were used to categorize participants based on their respective consumption frequencies.

Additionally, children's Body Mass Index (BMI) was collected and used to classify participants into normal weight, overweight, or obese (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] criteria).

Lifestyle habits were assessed using validated tools, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form (IPAQ) and a lifestyle score derived from the Electronic Kids Dietary Index (E-KINDEX), which allowed for multivariate analysis and the identification of statistical associations between unhealthy UPF consumption and a wide range of demographic and lifestyle variables.

Study findings revealed that approximately 95% of included children and adolescents consumed unhealthy UPFs daily, with the median intake across the entire cohort computed to be about 1.8 servings per day. Multivariate analyses revealed key factors strongly associated with higher consumption.

Firstly, older children and those with obesity were found to demonstrate the most significant risk. Compared to 6–8-year-olds, adolescents aged 15–17 were 2.74 times more likely to have high consumption (p < 0.001) and 3.78 times more likely to be daily consumers (p < 0.001). Children with obesity were 1.97 times more likely to have high consumption (p < 0.001) and 2.02 times more likely to be daily consumers (p < 0.05) than their normal-weight peers.

Secondly, high parental education was associated with 2.23 times higher odds of high UPF consumption (p < 0.05) but not with daily consumption.

Thirdly, lifestyle was highlighted as a significant contributor to poor dietary habits. Specifically, compared to those with less than 2 hours of screen time a day, children with 2–4 hours of screen time were 2.61 times more likely to be daily consumers (p < 0.001), and those with over 4 hours were 2.64 times more likely (p < 0.05). 

Eating out of home showed some of the largest effects: consuming meals out at least 2 times per week was associated with 20.73 times higher odds of daily consumption and 4.42 times higher odds of high consumption. Eating advertised foods was also associated with 5.03 times higher odds of daily consumption.

Snacking was associated with both high (OR = 1.95) and daily (OR = 2.88) consumption. A higher E-KINDEX lifestyle score was inversely associated with both high and daily consumption.

The present study highlights the alarming prevalence of daily UPF consumption among Mediterranean youth, finding these unhealthy dietary patterns deeply enmeshed in an overall unhealthy lifestyle characterized by high screen time, sedentary behavior, and specific eating habits, such as snacking and eating out.

While the study's cross-sectional design precludes causation, the convenience sampling via a consumer database limits national representativeness, and parent-reported FFQ frequency for selected “unhealthy” UPF items does not quantify total UPF or portion sizes, introducing potential misclassification.

The findings underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive, multi-pronged approach involving parents, educators, and healthcare professionals to foster healthier, more active lifestyles for children, even in regions with a rich history of healthy eating habits. Given the strong associations with eating out and advertising exposure, family- and environment-level strategies may be especially relevant targets.

By analyzing co-abundance networks in 938 healthy adults, scientists discovered how lifestyle factors subtly rewire bacterial relationships in the gut, offering a more powerful way to predict health traits than abundance-based models.



Study: Cross and inter-family interactions for age, sex, smoking and BMI. Image Credit: Christoph Burgstedt / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Communications Biology, researchers investigated environmental factors associated with co-abundance in the human gut microbiome.

A growing body of research has described features associated with the gut microbiome composition in health and disease. Some of the prominent features include sex, age, host genetics, and diet. However, some aspects of the host-microbiome relationship are difficult to characterize. The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem, and its constituents form sub-communities through interactions between taxa.

The sub-communities exhibit co-abundances as they work together as a coherent functional group or exploit the same resources from the local environment. Exploring the co-abundance of taxa and the connectivity within the microbiome can help identify characteristics that univariate approaches would otherwise miss. However, there is no gold standard method for screening factors linked to changes in bacterial co-abundance across individuals within a population.

In the present study, researchers characterized associations between environmental factors and changes in the gut microbiome co-abundance network. First, Multivariate Analysis of Conditional Covariance Analysis (MANOCCA) was used to investigate the associations between 80 environmental factors (host features) and taxa co-abundance at the family, genus, and species levels using data from 938 healthy participants.

This new method addressed key limitations of previous approaches by supporting both continuous and categorical predictors, allowing covariate adjustment, and providing a formal statistical framework for co-abundance at the individual level.

MANOCCA is a covariance-based approach that allows formal statistical testing of associations between the covariance of taxa and any predictor, and was developed to address current limitations.

Data on host features were collected at baseline and included demographics, medical history, dietary habits, and biomarkers. MANOCCA revealed significant associations with sex, age, and smoking at all three taxonomic levels and body mass index (BMI) at the genus level.

Notably, associations with taxa co-abundance were enriched for nutritional features, indicating a modest but systematic impact of diet on the taxa interaction network.

Next, the team derived contribution weights for sex, age, BMI, and smoking signals, noting that most taxa had non-zero and substantially heterogeneous contributions to the association.

The MANOCCA weights were compared against univariate mean effect p-value associations derived from standard linear regression. This revealed a significant positive correlation between the two results for smoking, BMI, age, and sex, indicating a dual impact on the abundance and co-abundance of many genera.

A core of approximately 200 genera was systematically impacted across all four factors, suggesting a central role in the network structure. Next, the team analyzed the characteristics of the top 5% pairs of genera contributing the most to co-abundance variability at the family level. Among 151 families, 10, 8, 11, and 7 overlapping sets of families covered ≥ 50% of the top contributing genera for age, sex, smoking, and BMI, respectively.

The key families included Lachnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Acutalibacteraceae, and Oscillospiraceae, with rare families such as Eggerthellaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Muribaculaceae. Notably, Bacteroidaceae were underrepresented in co-abundance changes, whereas Oscillospiraceae were strongly impacted, particularly in relation to BMI.

The analysis also identified four co-abundance groups (CAG-74, CAG-508, CAG-272, and CAG-138) that contributed to the signal.



Cross and inter-family interactions for age, sex, smoking and BMI. For the top four associated features from the MANOCCA (age, sex, BMI and smoking), we extracted the top 1000 contributing pairs of genera out of the 259,560 total products and derived the direction of effect of each predictor on the pair of co-abundance. We plotted the Venn diagram of shared pairs between each feature in (a) and the overlap in taxa in (b). In (c), we show the distribution of direction of effects per predictor, and for the age – smoking and sex – BMI intersections. We then used the pairs of features to derive a network of the changes in correlation with regard to each predictor. The node size, representing a genus, is proportional to its number of contributions with other genera, and edges link the top contributing pairs. The edge colors indicate the direction of effect with green indicating that an increase of the predictor drives an increase in co-abundance, red shows that an increase of the predictor drives a reduction in co-abundance and black indicates a mixed direction of effect for the overlapping predictors. The color of each node depends on how it is shared across the four predictors, and follows the structure of the (b, c) venn diagrams. Panel (d) displays the number of edges included in a single predictor (Age, Sex, BMI, Smoking) and by overlapping predictors (Age and Smoking, Sex and BMI), with in red the edges of reduced co-abundances and in green increased co-abundances. Grey edges indicate a mixed direction of effects for the overlapping predictors. Specifically for the overlap between Sex and BMI, the hashed area represents edges towards increased co-abundance for Sex and decreased co-abundance for BMI. Conversely, the grey part covers a decrease for Sex but an increase for BMI. 

Next, the team generated a network of co-abundance variation from the top 1,000 pairs of genera contributing to the MANOCCA association signal. In total, 4,000 pairs encompassed 476 unique genera.

Notably, the researchers observed a substantial overlap in pairs of co-abundant taxa that were impacted by both BMI and sex (658 shared pairs), as well as by smoking and age (306 shared pairs). Increased smoking and age were mainly associated with a decline in co-abundances, whereas higher BMI was associated with an increase.

Sex showed a mixed pattern. For example, Bacteroides A exhibited reduced co-abundances with many core taxa in smokers, despite no association in relative abundance, illustrating how covariance analysis can detect interaction shifts that are missed by traditional abundance-based methods. Finally, the team evaluated the accuracy of MANOCCA in predicting the most associated features (BMI, smoking, age, and sex) using taxa at the family, genus, and species levels.

Accuracy was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and squared correlation (r²) for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively. The covariance-based prediction model was compared with a standard linear model based on relative abundance. The team noted that MANOCCA outperformed and was significantly more accurate than the standard model.

The gain in prediction was substantially large for age, with median r²(age) values of 0.18 (family), 0.25 (genus), and 0.27 (species) for MANOCCA models, representing a three-fold improvement over abundance-based models.

The corresponding r²(age) estimates from the standard model were 0.05, 0.07, and 0.10, respectively. Prediction was significantly higher for sex at all taxonomic levels for MANOCCA.

In summary, the study examined the relationships between host characteristics and the co-occurrence of the gut microbiome in healthy individuals. MANOCCA revealed significant associations between the variability in taxa co-abundance and age, sex, BMI, and smoking.

The network of top-contributing genera revealed that interaction variability was limited to a small number of families. Co-abundance variability was concentrated in a limited number of families, with cross-family interactions vastly predominating over within-family links. Moreover, interactions were primarily observed between genera of distinct families, rather than within the same family.

The MANOCCA framework can also be utilized to develop predictive models. The predictive power of taxa co-abundance-based models was significantly higher than that of a standard abundance-based model for all features. However, the authors noted that the MANOCCA method requires large sample sizes (typically over 100 participants) and does not explicitly model the compositional nature of microbiome data, which should be refined in future work.

People tend to use first-person self-talk far more often than distanced self-talk, but when they take a step back and address themselves by name, it can subtly improve how they feel, particularly in moments of preparation or anticipation.



Study: The frequency, form, and function of self-talk in everyday life. Image Credit: Hitdelight / Shutterstock

In a recent article in the journal Scientific Reports, researchers examined self-talk in everyday life. They investigated how people's self-talk shifted in different situations and looked at its links to narcissism or emotional distress.

They found that people were more likely to engage in ‘immersed' self-talk, speaking to themselves in the first person, rather than more distanced self-talk. Distanced self-talk yielded a small but reliable increase in positive affect only in situations that required preparation for action or speech. Interestingly, self-talk was least frequent in these preparatory situations, despite being the only context in which it improved mood.

Talking to oneself is a common human behavior that serves various self-regulatory functions. Past lab studies have shown that distanced self-talk, referring to oneself by name or in the third person, helps manage emotions and align behavior with goals by promoting psychological distance.

However, little is known about how often people spontaneously use this form of self-talk in everyday life, when they do so, and how it affects emotions outside laboratory settings. Earlier theories viewed self-talk as a developmental tool for self-regulation, and later research confirmed that self-talk often arises in challenging, emotionally charged, or performance-based situations.

Yet most studies have not distinguished between distanced and immersed self-talk. Evidence suggests that adopting a distanced perspective may enhance problem-solving, emotional control, and goal pursuit.

Individual differences, such as emotional distress and narcissism, may influence how often people use these perspectives. Distressed individuals might rely more on distanced self-talk as a coping mechanism, while narcissists might use it to reinforce self-importance.

Researchers explored when and how people naturally use distanced (‘you' or the person's name) and immersed (‘I') patterns in everyday life. They employed an ecological momentary assessment (EMA) design over a two-week period.

A total of 208 participants completed three phases. In the first phase, participants filled out baseline questionnaires on emotional distress and narcissism and received training to distinguish between immersed and distanced self-talk. The sample was predominantly undergraduate students in the United States, and age data were not recorded due to a survey oversight. Data collection took place from 2017 to 2018.

During the second phase, participants received five text messages per day for 14 days, each containing a brief survey. In each survey, they reported whether they had recently experienced one or more of four types of situations: feeling self-critical, trying to feel better, preparing for what to say or do, and feeling pleased with themselves.

For each situation, they indicated whether they had engaged in immersed self-talk, distanced self-talk, or no self-talk at all. Participants could select more than one option. Primary analyses excluded episodes where participants reported both immersed and distanced self-talk for the same situation; exploratory contrasts versus no self-talk were presented in supplementary analyses. A small proportion of participants (2%) never used immersed self-talk, while two participants reported using neither form of self-talk.

In the third phase, participants were debriefed and compensated. The EMA approach allowed researchers to capture real-time, context-dependent use of self-talk and assess its relationship to momentary affect (emotional state), trait emotional distress, and narcissism across multiple naturalistic settings.

Across the 12,966 surveys, participants reported 20,646 relevant situations. They used immersed self-talk 43.2% of the time, distanced self-talk 14.5% of the time, and reported no self-talk 42.3% of the time. Immersed self-talk was significantly more common across all situations.

The most frequent contexts for distanced self-talk were self-critical and situations aimed at feeling better. In contrast, preparatory situations showed the lowest frequency of distanced self-talk (approximately 16%), despite being the context where it provided the most emotional benefits. While 18% of participants never used distanced self-talk, almost all engaged in immersed self-talk at least once.

Individuals generally showed consistent (stable) use of distanced self-talk over time, whereas immersed self-talk fluctuated more. Daily variability was lower for distanced than for immersed self-talk across situations, indicating greater trait-like stability. Specifically, the mean within-person standard deviation was smaller for distanced self-talk (SD = 0.13) compared with immersed self-talk (SD = 0.21), reinforcing its stability.

Distanced self-talk was most stable in preparatory and pleased situations. When analyzing affect over time, in time-lagged models that adjusted for prior affect, distanced versus immersed self-talk predicted a slight increase in positive affect (d ≈ 0.09) only in preparatory situations, but not in self-critical, feel-better, or pleased contexts.

There were no significant associations between self-talk type and trait emotional distress or narcissism, and neither trait moderated the emotional outcomes of self-talk. Overall, the findings suggest that although distanced self-talk is less frequent, it remains relatively stable and may offer specific emotional benefits in contexts that require preparation or performance.

The study found that most people frequently engage in self-talk, with participants using self-talk in 61% of the sampled target situations over the two-week period. Immersed self-talk was more common, while distanced self-talk occurred less often but was more stable and trait-like.

Distanced self-talk proved beneficial only in preparatory situations, where it was linked to improved mood over time, supporting prior laboratory findings. However, it was not effective in self-critical or emotion-repairing contexts, possibly because spontaneous distancing in daily life may be shallower than instructed distancing in laboratory conditions.

No associations emerged between self-talk style and individual traits like emotional distress or narcissism, suggesting these patterns are broadly shared across personality types. The study's strengths include its ecological validity and real-time assessment of self-talk; however, its limitations include self-report bias and a lack of control over other regulatory strategies.

Future research should explore cultural and linguistic differences, developmental origins, and how training might enhance the use of distanced self-talk to promote emotional well-being.

Three Gotham FC's standouts have received nominations for National Women's Soccer League awards.



JERSEY CITY, N.J. – Three Gotham FC's standouts have received nominations for National Women's Soccer League awards.

Forward Esther Gonzalez, defender Lilly Reale and goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger earned nominations after stellar campaigns that helped Gotham FC reach the playoffs.

Fans can vote for Gotham FC players in categories including Best XI and Second XI  here. Voting closes Wednesday, Nov. 12, at 8 p.m. ET.

The inaugural NWSL Awards will be broadcast live on ESPN2 from San Jose on Wednesday, Nov. 19, celebrating the league's top players, coaches and performances ahead of the NWSL Championship.

Gotham's nominees:

Esther Gonzalez: Most Valuable Player

González turned in one of the most dominant attacking seasons in club and league history.

When she scored, Gotham probably won, providing much-needed excellence as the club battled injuries to key players throughout the campaign. The Spanish striker scored in seven of Gotham's nine regular-season wins and finished with 13 goals, second-most in the NWSL. Her four braces — two goals in one game — tied an NWSL season record.

Gonzzlez's midseason scoring run was historic – she scored seven goals in a four-match span, equaling the league record for most goals in that span. She also became the third player since 2013 to score seven or more goals in her first seven games of a season, joining Alex Morgan (2022) and Sophia Wilson (2024).

She also became the second player in Gotham history to record double-digit goals in a season – joining Sam Kerr (17 in 2017) – and the fastest ever to reach 10, hitting the mark in just 13 matches. Her impact was immediate and often decisive: six opening goals, 11 first-half strikes (second-most in league history).

Lilly Reale: rookie of the year

Goalscoring only tells one part of a much larger story about a player's performance throughout the season, which is why Reale was nominated for rookie of the year/

The 22-year-old made a seamless transition from collegiate star center back to NWSL star fullback, putting together one of the most impressive all-around rookie campaigns in recent NWSL memory. In her first season, Reale started 21 matches and appeared in all 26, anchoring one of the league's best defensive units and becoming a regular U.S. women's national team call-up.

Reale led Gotham in interceptions (36) and ranked second in tackles (54). In the NWSL, she was seventh in successful take-ons, eighth in passes into the penalty area, 10th in dribblers tackled and 12th in crosses (69).

She delivered on both ends of the field – scoring her first professional goal against North Carolina on April 13 and assisting fellow rookie Sarah Schupansky's tally in Gotham's 3-0 win over Washington, marking the club's first rookie-to-rookie goal since 2019. Her 12-tackle performance at Washington tied the NWSL record for most in a game since 2016.

Reale helped Gotham limit opponents to just 25 goals allowed in 26 games, second-fewest in the NWSL.

Ann-Katrin Berger: goalkeeper of the year

The reigning NWSL goalkeeper of the year, Berger delivered another record-setting campaign, marked by excellence with her feet and shot stopping, in her first full season with Gotham FC.

The German international recorded 10 shutouts, becoming the eighth goalkeeper in league history to reach double digits and setting a new club record in the process. Her 0.78 goals-against average ranks 14th-best in NWSL history, while her command of the penalty area was unmatched. She led the league in clearances/punches (33), headed clearances (4) and possessions won (69).

Berger conceded only four goals from outside the box all season, stabilizing Gotham's backline and serving as the heartbeat of one of the league's stingiest defenses.

Watch the Game Highlights from Kansas City Current vs. NJ/NY Gotham FC, 11/09/2025 (1:19)

The NWSL's quarterfinals blitz is over. Have you caught your breath? In less than 48 hours this weekend, the league that practically trademarked chaos outdid itself with two stoppage-time equalizers, three extra-time matches -- and one that progressed to a penalty shootout -- and an upset of arguably the best team in league history.

It was like the telenovela that is the NWSL crammed a marathon of new episodes into one binge-worthy weekend.

Who's left standing? Not the No. 1 seed Kansas City Current, who smashed NWSL records for points (65), wins (21) and goals allowed (just 13). Instead, the semifinalists are the last four league champions: the Orlando Pride, NJ/NY Gotham FC, Portland Thorns and Washington Spirit.

NWSL SEMIFINALS:
- (2) Washington Spirit vs. (5) Portland Thorns, Nov. 15, noon ET
- (4) Orlando Pride vs. (8) Gotham FC, Nov. 16, 3 p.m. ET

Here's how we got here.

The Kansas City Current are the deepest team in the NWSL, but as head coach Vlatko Andonovski lamented after his team's loss on Sunday, ""the game is totally different"" when they're missing MVP and two-time Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga and breakout forward Michelle Cooper, and they only have ""half of Bia"" Zaneratto due to a sprained MCL.

The weight of Chawinga's absence specifically was best illustrated in the 29th minute, when the Current enjoyed one of the few transition moments on which they typically feast.

Debinha beat two defenders and played Nichelle Prince in behind for a one-on-one with Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger, but Prince shot at a savable height for Berger and then fired the rebound off the German goalkeeper. Chawinga has been automatic and inevitable in those situations, and her very presence creates those opportunities. However, those opportunities were few and far between on Sunday.

Gotham, led at the back by veteran Emily Sonnett, was compact defensively and controlled the ball. Kansas City is always happy to concede possession and strike on the counterattack, but Gotham kept the game in front of them and benefitted from their opponent's absence. The threat behind never materialized for Kansas City.

Andonovski said ""it was a game of margins,"" while Gotham head coach Juan Carlos Amoros said they ""showed the best version of ourselves."" Both of those things are true. Gotham has been hot and cold this season, but they were never going to repeat their pedestrian performance of the week prior in North Carolina that cursed them with the No. 8 seed.

Kansas City was a shadow of itself on Sunday. Their defense, which was practically impenetrable in the regular season, made some rare but costly mistakes, including when center-back and potential NWSL Defender of the Year Kayla Sharples stepped too aggressively to a ball and got beat by Jaedyn Shaw for Gotham's opening goal in the 68th minute.

Kansas City's attack too often sputtered in the windchill and temperatures below freezing. Current winger Ellie Wheeler's stoppage-time equalizer to extend the game was surprising given how Kansas City struggled to create opportunities. Ultimately, Gotham forward Katie Stengel struck a 121st-minute winner nearly perfectly, and Gotham is moving on. Gotham also advanced without Esther González (hip), who scored 13 goals this season, two fewer than Chawinga.

This wasn't quite David beating Goliath -- Gotham is only two years removed from a championship, had one of the best teams last year, and won the first Concacaf title earlier this year -- but there is no getting around that this is a major disappointment and a failure for Kansas City.

Any other savvy veteran player would have done the thing she is told to do when leading in the final moments of a game: Run to the corner, keep the ball and kill the clock. But Marta, the six-time world player of the year and greatest ever, isn't just any player.

So, when the Orlando Pride captain picked up the ball in her own half with her team leading the Seattle Reign 1-0 and the allotted five minutes of stoppage time already passed, she ran, and ran ... and some 75 yards later, after she beat two defenders her junior and drifted near the corner, she defied conventional wisdom and turned her body inward to run toward goal.

Marta hates kicking the ball to nobody, she later admitted. Instead, the Brazil star went for the step-over and Sam Meza, the third recovering defender, fouled her in the box. Luana, stepped up and buried the penalty, and the defending NWSL champions sealed arguably their best performance of the year to advance to the semifinal.

As if Marta hadn't entertained us enough with the encore to last year's tantalizing semifinal goal -- or with her dramatic protests caught in up-close, dizzying fashion by the new referee body camera -- she followed up after the game with a soulful rant about how people ""talk so much s---"" about the champions, and it motivates her.

Who disrespected them, and how? Or, more likely, do the Pride feel forgotten in the shadow of the Kansas City Current's historic season? Pay no mind. The Pride looked like their 2024 selves, the team that started last season unbeaten through 23 games and won the double.

Marta's Benjamin Button-esque season was one of the many catalysts of that run last year, but the Pride won the Shield and Championship last year behind peak performances across the roster from several role players. Those performances have returned in this recent run of success, including in Friday's quarterfinal win over Seattle. Haley McCutcheon, hereby known as ""McClutcheon"" for her playoff goals, scored the game-winning goal for Orlando on Friday. Emily Sams played shutdown one-on-one defense. Jacqueline Ovalle, new to this whole NWSL playoff drama as a then-world-record transfer in August, applied the sauce and served crosses into dangerous areas.

Missing still is injured star Barbra Banda, but the Pride might have momentum on their side.

Aubrey Kingsbury completes a legendary performance with her third save in penalties as Washington knocks out Racing Louisville.

Is the very sight of Washington Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury intimidating to opponents in a penalty shootout? ""What do you think?"" Spirit head coach Adrian Gonzalez asked after his team survived and advanced against a plucky Louisville team, drawing a laugh from the crowded press room.

Kingsbury saved two penalties and Racing Louisville missed another on Saturday in the shootout. Racing's penalties were collectively poor, perhaps a sign of the pressure finally getting to a team playing its first playoff game in front of a raucous, partisan crowd after taking the game to the brink.

But this wasn't Kingsbury's first rodeo. She saved all three penalties she faced in last year's semifinal shootout to help the Spirit advance.

Washington needed her, too, on Saturday as star forward Trinity Rodman watched from the bench due to a recent MCL sprain, fullback Gabby Carle left the game with a hamstring injury, and emerging USWNT center-back Tara McKeown exited in extra time with an ankle injury that had her on crutches in the tunnel afterward.

Rosemonde Kouassi and Gift Monday carried the offensive load for Washington, and the Spirit did just about everything right -- staying compact, winning second balls, limiting transition moments to hopeful long balls -- until they didn't. Louisville forward Kayla Fischer scored a scrappy, deflating stoppage-time equalizer on a long ball over the top, and teammate Emma Sears within a whisker of a game-winner a few moments later.

There was palpable relief in the briefly subdued crowd after that miss, but the noise quickly returned, and the Spirit eventually prevailed. As cliché as it may sound, Washington's experience shone through on Saturday as a team that came within arm's reach of a championship last year. The Spirit managed the game even as fate turned its back on them ever so briefly.

""If I'm honest with you, I think that [mental aspect] is more important than the tactics for me,"" Gonzalez said, adding that he and the players all work with sports psychologists. Their work includes mental preparation for penalties.

Center-back and England international Esme Morgan embodied the Spirit's joyful resolve. She buried her spot kick, the Spirit's second of the shootout, and emphatically pumped her fists to the crowd. A few moments later, after Kingsbury's second save clinched a semifinal berth, Morgan was in the stands leading a chant and waving a supporter's flag.

The Spirit continue to do things the hard way in the playoffs: They needed extra time or penalty kicks twice last year and twice in their run to a 2021 NWSL Championship. ""It's a crazy league,"" Morgan said after Saturday's match. ""You can't switch off for one second, so we'll learn from it.""

Is Washington healthy enough to win it all? That same question looms this week.

Watch the Game Highlights from Portland Thorns FC vs. San Diego Wave FC, 11/10/2025

The Thorns were the third of four quarterfinal winners to state that they were counted out and written off by the wider public. And while the trend is odd and borderline ludicrous at a macro level, Portland makes the most valid point.

They began this season in eerily similar fashion to 2024: with a humbling loss in Kansas City followed by unsteady results. The Thorns' only win in their first five games was a 1-0 result over the (especially at the time) lowly Utah Royals. But things began to click when the calendar flipped to September, and Portland has lost only twice in nine games since including Sunday's quarterfinal victory over San Diego. The midfield triangle of Sam Coffey, Olivia Moultrie and Jessie Fleming has driven that success, and perhaps eased the sting of the team trading fan-favorite Hina Sugita in October.

Guess who combined to create their lone goal on Sunday? That's right -- and Moultrie started the play by forcing the turnover before delivering the cross to the back post on a platter for Reilyn Turner.

What is so different about this Thorns team now? Eight of the 11 starters on Sunday were the same as that opening day loss in Kansas City. How has a Thorns team that lost multiple starters to injury in preseason, played without star Sophia Wilson (maternity leave), and wobbled into the summer break, outlasted that steamrolling Current team?

""That takes time to build,"" said Thorns head coach Rob Gale on Sunday. ""You don't wave a magic wand from the stands and suddenly it all comes together. It's a turnover of the group dealing with adversity. All of that, it takes time. But they've stuck together throughout, and any time it got a little dicey or we had a bad result, we rebounded.

""The bounce-back ability of this team has been absolutely outstanding all season long. But it takes time. No big cellies; we ain't done yet.""

Portland has the most championships (three) in NWSL history, the most recent coming in 2022. It is the NWSL's most storied franchise, a place that World Cup champions and world-leading goal-scorers have called home. This rendition of the Thorns lacks the relative star power and dominance of those yesteryear teams, but Coffey and Moultrie are two of the holdovers from that 2022 squad.

Maybe this Thorns team was written off in the summer. Maybe we've all been too distracted by Kansas City, and we have failed to recognize other brewing successes.

Portland will be the underdog again in the semifinals, but with so many health questions surrounding Washington, and the playoffs blown open, what would be the Thorns' most unlikely title to date is within reach.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Herculez Gomez backs Mauricio Pochettino's decision to recall Gio Reyna to the USMNT, despite a lack of minutes at club level. (2:04)

AFC Bournemouth midfielder Tyler Adams was taken off the United States men's national team squad for upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay after crashing into teammate Adam Smith in the third minute of their 4-0 loss to Aston Villa.

U.S. Soccer confirmed his absence on Monday, along with that of Columbus Crew midfielder Sean Zawadzki.

In their places, LAFC midfielder Timmy Tillman, the brother of Malik, was called up by USMNT head coach Mauricio Pochettino and will join training camp in Philadelphia on Monday. Tillman's one U.S appearance was in a January 2024 friendly against Slovenia.

The USMNT will face Paraguay in Chester, Pennsylvania, on Nov. 15, and will then take on Uruguay in Tampa three days later.

U.S. Soccer said that Adams and Zawadzki were ""withdrawn due to injuries suffered in their club matches this past weekend"" without specifying the injuries.

Columbus spokesman Rob McBurnett said Zawadski hurt his right knee during Saturday's playoff game vs. Cincinnati but it was not a long-term injury.

The roster features the return of Borussia Mönchengladbach teammates Giovanni Reyna and Joe Scally, as well as PSV Eindhoven's Ricardo Pepi, but there are also notable absences, including Juventus' Weston McKennie, AC Milan's Christian Pulisic, Crystal Palace's Chris Richards and Marseille's Timothy Weah.

Adams scored his first Premier League goal in four seasons for Bournemouth two Sundays ago, but was taken out of the game at the 80th minute after taking a hit to the knee.

The Adams injury adds to Pochettino's already depleted squad.

Pulisic, Richards and Weah have been nursing injuries, with the former sustaining a hamstring injury during the last international window. Weah suffered a thigh injury on Oct. 25, while Richards has been nursing a calf issue.

Pochettino said Pulisic was left off the latest roster ""to provide him the the possibility to recover 100%.""

Reyna and Scally return for the first since both players took part in the 2025 Concacaf Nations League finals back in March. Reyna has also switched clubs in that time, moving to Gladbach from Borussia Dortmund.

Revised USMNT roster:

Goalkeepers: Roman Celentano (Cincinnati), Matt Freese (New York City), Jonathan Klinsmann (Cesena), Patrick Schulte (Columbus)

Defenders: Max Arfsten (Columbus), Sergiño Dest (PSV Eindhoven), Alex Freeman (Orlando), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse), Tim Ream (Charlotte), Miles Robinson (Cincinnati), Joe Scally (Borussia Mönchengladbach), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel), Auston Trusty (Celtic)

Midfielders: Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver), Aidan Morris (Middlesbrough), Gio Reyna (Borussia Mönchengladbach), Cristian Roldan (Seattle), Tanner Tessmann (Lyon), Timothy Tillman (Los Angeles FC)

Forwards: Brenden Aaronson (Leeds), Folarin Balogun (Monaco), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake;), Ricardo Pepi (PSV Eindhoven), Haji Wright (Coventry)

Tyler Adams has withdrawn from the United States men's national team squad for upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay due to an injury sustained while playing for Bournemouth on Sunday.

U.S. Soccer announced on Monday that Adams and fellow midfielder Sean Zawadzki would not be joining up with the USMNT in Philadelphia this week for a training camp and Saturday's match against Paraguay.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino called in LAFC midfielder Timmy Tillman as a late replacement.

Adams was one of the few regulars who was named to the USMNT's November roster last week. But in the third minute of Sunday's English Premier League match between Bournemouth and Aston Villa, he clashed heads with team-mate Adam Smith.

The two players received immediate medical treatment on the field after the collision. Smith exited the game. Adams played on and completed the 90 minutes.

U.S. Soccer did not specify whether his withdrawal was due to a problem stemming from the collision, but did say that he and Zawadzki were “withdrawn due to injuries suffered in their club matches this past weekend”.

Adams' withdrawal depletes an already-depleted USMNT even further. Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, Malik Tillman (Timmy's brother), Antonee Robinson and other mainstays had already been omitted from the latest roster. All are managing, recovering from or sidelined by injuries.

Weston McKennie was also left out of the squad, apparently so that he can continue to establish himself at Juventus under new coach Luciano Spalletti.

The roster still has plenty of central midfielders. Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan can all play in Adams' position, and probably will start there this weekend against Paraguay and/or next Tuesday against Uruguay.

Overall, though, this squad is a shell of the one that Pochettino will hope to take to the World Cup next summer.

The coaching staff, by prioritizing players' long-term health over their presence in camps this fall, is essentially betting that the multi-week pre-World Cup camp in late May and early June will be enough time for the group to jell ahead of the tournament.

U.S. men's national team midfielder Tyler Adams has withdrawn from Mauricio Pochettino's November squad due to a head injury he sustained while representing Bournemouth at the weekend.

The 26-year-old will not make the trip back to the United States to join up with the USMNT ahead of international friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay. U.S. Soccer confirmed fellow midfielder Sean Zawadzki has also withdrawn from the Stars and Stripes' roster due to injury.

Adams was involved in a clash of heads with Bournemouth teammate Adam Smith in the early stages of the Cherries' 4–0 defeat to Aston Villa on Sunday. The American midfielder received treatment but ultimately remained in the game until the final whistle.

Just one day later, Adams is now unavailable for the USMNT in the final international window of the year. Pochettino will miss the leadership and consistency of his anchor in the midfield, especially given the number of stars upon whom he cannot call already.

Christian Pulisic, Antonee Robinson, Chris Richards, Tim Weah and Weston McKennie are all missing this camp as well. The USMNT captain returned from injury for AC Milan at the weekend, but he is taking the next two weeks to fully recover. 

In the absence of Adams and Zawadzki, Pochettino has called up LAFC midfielder Timmy Tillman. The  26-year-old, who previously represented Germany before switching his allegiance to the United States in 2023, comes into the November camp with just one USMNT cap to his name.

Tillman has impressed with LAFC this season, though. The former Bayern Munich man has played every second for the Black and Gold in the 2025 postseason so far, helping Steve Cherundolo's side make the Western Conference semifinals.

Before he can turn his attention back to the MLS Cup playoffs, Tillman will hope to impress Pochettino enough to carve out a place with the Stars and Stripes ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

With so many of his starters out injured, Pochettino will have to once again rely on fringe players to get the USMNT past Paraguay and Uruguay in the upcoming weeks.

Tyler Adams and Sean Zawadzki have both withdrawn from the U.S. men's national team roster for upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay.

Per U.S. Soccer, both players were withdrawn ""due to injuries suffered in their club matches this past weekend.""

LAFC midfielder Timothy Tillman has been called in as a replacement.

Adams was involved in a nasty head collision with Bournemouth teammate Adam Smith in Sunday's 4-0 defeat at Aston Villa.

Smith was removed from the game with a concussion, but Adams was allowed to continued. After the game, Bournemouth head coach Andoni Iraola said he was hopeful the USMNT midfielder didn't suffer an injury.

The November camp will be the second in a row that Adams has missed, as he was left off the October roster due to the birth of his son.

Zawadski played the full match on Saturday as the Columbus Crew's season ended in a 2-1 defeat against FC Cincinnati in game three of their MLS playoff series.

Per Yahoo Sports, Zawadski has a knee injury and is expected to make a full recovery in the coming weeks.

Tillman, the older brother of USMNT mainstay Malik, has earned one cap since he made a one-time switch from Germany in 2023, starting in a 1-0 defeat to Slovenia in January 2024.

The U.S. men's national team play their final two friendlies of 2025 in the November international window as they take on 2026 World Cup-bound duo Paraguay and Uruguay.

Coming off a win against Australia and a draw with Ecuador in October, manager Mauricio Pochettino will hope his squad can continue to build momentum, especially considering they won't play another game until March. 

Several players, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Chris Richards, won't be in the team this time around, leaving Pochettino plenty of decisions to make as those on the periphery try to stake their claims for a spot on his 26-player roster.

Luckily for him, quite a few players are in form. Here, Sports Illustrated runs down the top five performances of the week from USMNT stars.

Celtic picked up a convincing 4–0 win over Kilmarnock in Scottish Premiership action, with Trusty putting in a strong performance before heading over the Atlantic to join up with the USMNT. The 27-year-old completed the most passes in the match with a whopping 98, and chipped in with nine defensive contributions on what was an overall dominant day for the Scottish giants, who are still seven points back of league leaders Hearts.As a team, the performance proved a vital bounce-back after a 3–1 loss in Europa League action midweek against FC Midtjylland, where Trusty still stood out with 15 defensive contributions, even as his side was overwhelmed. While he plays in a four-man backline at Celtic, his rare call-up to the USMNT could see him try to fit into a three-man defense.

Joe Scally has a critical camp coming up as he gets his first legitimate opportunity in Pochettino's build towards the World Cup. At the same time, the versatile wide defender comes into the USMNT as they experiment with three and five-man backlines. Luckily for him, he enters camp in good form. The 22-year-old played all 90 minutes for Borussia Mönchengladbach in a 3–1 victory over FC Köln. While Köln held most of the possession and controlled the match, Scally was balanced in his approach, helping his side secure a third win in a row. He finished the match having created a single scoring chance, completed two passes into the final third, and recorded three touches in the opposition box. Defensively, he made three recoveries, two tackles and won five duels.

Cristian Roldan continued to play a key role for Seattle Sounders FC in the MLS Cup playoffs, even as their season came to a close in a dramatic penalty shootout in Game 3 of the best-of-three series against Minnesota United.While Roldan won't have club soccer to return to this season after the November window, he had a match to remember in the 3–3 draw that preempted the 10-round penalty shootout. In the 90 minutes, he completed two dribbles and won 10 duels, while also setting up Jordan Morris's 88th-minute tying goal to send the series to a decisive shootout. Although the MLS veteran's impact may not be the same as some of the top European talents, his consistency and form could be important to the USMNT given the quality of November's opponents. 

Ricardo Pepi scored a clutch goal for PSV Eindhoven in the UEFA Champions League, finishing a chance in the third minute of second-half stoppage time to clinch a 1–1 draw with Greek giants Olympiacos. His goal levelled him up with legends Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Agüero as the players who have scored the most goals beyond the 90th minute in Champions League history (three).Previously, Pepi had done so in 2023, in a 3–2 win over Sevilla, and in 2024, in a 3–2 victory over Ukraine's Shakhtar Donetsk. While he only played 15 minutes off the bench in PSV's 5–1 win over AZ Alkmaar in Eredivisie action, he comes into camp in fine form with five goals and an assist in 12 matches across all competitions.

Folarin Balogun will be the USMNT's top choice striker in the November window, and he enters the camp in stellar form. The 24-year-old scored his first Champions League goal, finding the back of the net in a 1–0 victory over Norway's Bodø/Glimt. He continued that stellar form on the weekend as well, scoring his fourth goal of the Ligue 1 season in a 4–1 loss to Lens, but his performance lost some of his lustre when he was sent off in the 45th minute—his red card meaning he's suspended for Monaco's clash with Rennes post-international break.For the USMNT, that's potentially good news in a roundabout way, as there will be less pressure from his club side to manage minutes knowing he's going to have a watching brief on Nov. 22. Pochettino will certainly hope it's Balogun's goalscoring form that comes over to the international stage, rather than his ill-discipline.

The U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that he would happily hand President Donald Trump the World Cup trophy should they pull off an unlikely feat on home soil, laughing off the hypothetical extravagance of the ceremony as typically American.

Were Pochettino to find himself up on the winners' stage this summer, he would have seen the USMNT become the first non-European or South American team to win the World Cup. In the even of that historic achievement, there is every chance that Trump would find himself close by.

The President infamously remained on the crowded stage during Chelsea's celebrations at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, inspiring the ire of Cole Palmer after the Premier League side defeated Paris Saint-Germain at the MetLife Stadium. The 2026 World Cup final will also take place at the same New Jersey venue.

""For sure, I will give [it to him if we] win. I will give him the trophy, and he can lift the trophy for sure, no problem for me,” Pochettino said in a recent interview with the New York Post. “I think the president was [at the Club World Cup] and supporting soccer at a massive event.

“Maybe he's not a soccer person, and he was a little bit in a situation where he didn't know what to do [in the celebrations], but it was funny. It was funny. That is America.”

Trump, who has involved himself in World Cup planning by leading the White House World Cup Task Force and pushing for the World Cup draw to be at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., is expected to have a significant presence at the tournament. Meanwhile, Mexican and Canadian leaders Claudia Sheinbaum and Mark Carney are also likely to appear throughout next summer.

Pochettino hasn't had a chance to interact with the 45th and 47th President after just over a year leading the USMNT, the two could run into each other at the World Cup draw on Dec. 5. 

“Maybe we'll see now at the draw, if there is the possibility to meet him and to say hello,” Pochettino added. “In case, to meet him, I want to say thank you for everything that he's doing, for soccer America...I think that is great because he's showing his support for soccer.”

Before the draw and a potential meeting with President Trump, Pochettino will lead the USMNT into the final two friendly matches of 2025, taking on Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Philadelphia and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa.

Dortmund interested in young Real Madrid talent

Joan Martínez, 18, is making plenty of headlines. The young Real Madrid defender is on the radar of several European clubs, most notably Borussia Dortmund, according to The Athletic.

Real Madrid has great faith in him. When he extended his contract, the club set a release clause of around €70 million—an exceptionally high figure for a Castilla player. Martínez has yet to make an official first-team appearance, but he did take part in preseason matches against AC Milan and FC Barcelona this summer.

This season, he's a regular starter for the reserve team in the third division and has already found the net once in 10 appearances. For now, Real has no intention of letting him go. His contract runs until 2029, and the club sees him as a future key player.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is a doubt for their World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein after pulling a leg muscle playing for Real Madrid, the Spanish club said on Monday.

Courtois, 33, suffered an adductor injury during Madrid's goalless league draw at Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.

Madrid did not specify the estimated duration of the goalkeeper's absence, but Spanish press reports claimed he will be out for between 10 and 12 days.

Courtois could therefore be back for their La Liga match against Elche on November 23.

Belgium will qualify for next year's World Cup if they win in Kazakhstan on Saturday.

They round off their Group J campaign against Liechtenstein three days later.

La Liga

Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen Getty Images

Welcome to the latest edition of Inside Real Madrid, our weekly series to follow throughout La Liga's 2025-26 season.

Every week, we will bring you key information and analysis on the biggest talking points, cutting through the noisy world of all things Madridista with reporting you can trust.

The bad taste left by last week, in which Real Madrid fell to a Champions League defeat against Liverpool and drew with Rayo Vallecano in La Liga.

The 1-0 loss at Anfield reignited the debate about Madrid's performances against major rivals under Xabi Alonso. They beat Barcelona 2-1 in October (after being beaten in the four Clasicos last season), but lost their Club World Cup semi-final 4-0 to Paris Saint-Germain in July and suffered a 5-2 rout against Atletico Madrid in the September derby.

Even though the team are top of the table in Spain, with a three-point lead over Hansi Flick's Barcelona, the atmosphere is tense.

“This is Madrid and we know what we want,” Alonso said at his post-match press conference at Rayo's Vallecas stadium. “It's still November, there's a long way to go. We have to be demanding of ourselves.”

As was the case in his pre-match media appearance on Saturday, Alonso seemed much more serious when talking to reporters.

He is facing criticism from inside and outside the club because his side are not performing as desired. Madrid have failed to score in back-to-back games for the first time since May 2023, despite having three attacking stars in Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham.

During the game, the players appeared tense on the pitch, both among themselves and when receiving instructions from the dugout. The Athletic has reported that some of them are uncomfortable with Alonso's approach and some of his footballing ideas, as the new manager looks to implement his style.

The England international barely featured. He was not in the starting line-up, with Alonso choosing midfielder Federico Valverde at right-back as captain Dani Carvajal recovers from knee surgery.

“Yes, yes, yes, he's ready,” Alonso had replied on Saturday, when asked if Alexander-Arnold could start after the hamstring injury he suffered in September. “He's been training for a couple of weeks.”

We reported in our last Inside Real Madrid column — before Alexander-Arnold's emotionally charged return to Anfield — that he was in week seven of eight of his full recovery.

The right-back came on in the 83rd minute against Rayo and made little impact. He produced two failed crosses, did not complete a pass in the opposition half, lost possession four times, and contributed one interception.

The 27-year-old has started just three games this campaign, all of them at the Bernabeu. The club have called for time and patience since his arrival from Liverpool in June. It has become clear that his adaptation is not going to be easy.

Dean Huijsen's performance was once again a cause for concern — the Dutch-born Spain centre-back was replaced at half-time after receiving a yellow card.

The 20-year-old has been asked internally to show more focus and intensity. After a great start at the Club World Cup in the United States, he is struggling to deliver. By contrast, academy graduate Raul Asencio played well against Rayo.

Meanwhile, young strikers Endrick and Gonzalo Garcia did not even warm up, generating a lot of noise inside and outside the club. “We had other forwards on the pitch who can also create danger,” Alonso explained in his press conference.

Alonso tried to improve his attack with Rodrygo, who came on for Eduardo Camavinga in the 79th minute. The Brazil forward has not scored a goal for Madrid since March 4 and has yet to score or assist in La Liga this season.

Some players ended the match at Vallecas with physical problems.

Valverde, who also finished the game at Anfield in discomfort, experienced pain in his right thigh and underwent tests today. Madrid announced he had a muscle injury on Monday. He will not join up with the Uruguay national team for their friendlies against Mexico and the United States next week, as was the case in October when he was given a break.

Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was also examined this Monday after experiencing a strain in his right thigh. Madrid announced he had a muscle injury on Monday. Like Valverde, he is expected not to travel with Belgium for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein. He is set to be out for around 10 days and the club hope both players will be back in time for Madrid's next La Liga fixture away to Elche on November 23.

Meanwhile, my colleague Guillermo Rai reports that the academy's 18-year-old centre-back Joan Martinez is attracting the attention of some big clubs. Among them are Borussia Dortmund, who have shown concrete interest in the promising youngster.

The defender is not expected to leave, as Madrid have a lot of confidence in him. He signed his latest contract renewal in October 2024, just after a serious knee injury that kept him out of action last season. That included a clause in the region of €70million ($81m; £61m), above the usual amount for players at Real Madrid Castilla, the club's reserve team full of youth players.

...

Manchester United youngster James Overy could find himself in the unusual position of appearing at a World Cup before he has even made his senior debut for the club.

The 18-year-old right-back has impressed at youth level since arriving at Old Trafford last year despite a long-term Achilles injury that sidelined him for eight months, but is yet to be handed a maiden first-team outing by head coach Ruben Amorim despite stepping up in training several times already at Carrington.

That has not stopped Overy from progressing quickly on the international scene, having been handed his first senior call-up by Australia as part of an experimental squad for their upcoming friendly double-header in the United States against South American opposition in the form of Venezuela and Colombia.

Socceroos boss Tony Popovic, the former Crystal Palace defender, is open to picking the teenager in his squad for next summer's World Cup finals in North America after Overy made a significant impression during the recent Under-20 tournament in Chile, where Australia failed to reach the knockout stages after placing third in their group behind eventual finalists Argentina, and Italy.

“He's worth having a look at,” Popovic said this week. “I'm very open-minded about what that looks like for the immediate future and long term.

“Watching him closely in Chile, I was impressed. We have good contacts at Man U, so we know what he's doing at training, we know how much he trains, how much he trains with the first team.

“He's getting games with the under-18s, the under-21s, and he's in the process where he's getting called up (to first-team training) a lot more often.”

Australia qualified for their sixth successive World Cup finals back in June following a 2-1 comeback win away in Saudi Arabia, having improved considerably under Popovic following the shock resignation of former head coach Graham Arnold last year.

A World Cup call-up would cap a remarkably swift rise for Overy, who began his career in Australia with Perth Glory and featured in a friendly against West Ham before relocating to the UK with his family and playing for Devon-based non-league side Newton Abbot Spurs.

He joined United's academy in May 2024 on an initial scholarship basis and later signed his first professional contract this summer. Overy - born in Australia - is also eligible to represent Scotland at international level and previously played for their U19s before a switch of allegiance.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Celtic striker Johnny Kenny has been called up to the Republic of Ireland national team.

The 22-year-old was included in the squad for the upcoming matches against Portugal and Hungary. This opportunity arises due to an injury to Roma's Evan Ferguson.

Kenny has been in impressive form, netting four goals in as many games for Martin O'Neill's side, including a recent goal against Kilmarnock at Celtic Park.

Despite being named in September's international squad, Kenny did not make an appearance, as he still awaits his first senior cap for the national team.

He has, however, made eight appearances for Ireland's U21s, scoring once, which occurred during his loan period at Shamrock Rovers.

The Sligo-born player has also benefited from injuries within the club, such as those to Kelechi Iheanacho, Daizen Maeda, and Callum Osmand, which have allowed him to make a breakthrough into the Celtic first team.

His career highlight came earlier this month at Hampden, where he scored the opening goal in a 3-1 win over Rangers.

The goal, a towering header, was the first in the match against Danny Rohl's side. Kenny was originally brought into the Celtic side by former manager Brendan Rodgers.

However, he has recently been relied upon by interim boss Martin O'Neill, who has praised his performances. In all of his first four games as temporary manager, O'Neill has started him.

The striker has committed his future to the Scottish champions, signing a four-year contract extension earlier this year, which will keep him at the club until the summer of 2029.","{'href': 'https://uk.sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo'}","soccer"

Only one of DR Congo, Cameroon, Nigeria and Gabon will have the chance to reach the 2026 Fifa World Cup

Four contenders will be reduced to one in African play-offs for the 2026 Fifa World Cup over this international window.

After missing out on the continent's nine automatic qualification spots, Cameroon, DR Congo, Gabon and Nigeria travel to Morocco for a winner-takes-all mini-tournament.

But, depending on their world ranking, the victorious nation faces one or two more matches in order to reach next year's tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States.

BBC Sport Africa explains how this stage works - and what comes next.

The quartet reached this stage as the four best second-placed finishers across Africa's nine World Cup qualifying groups.

Results against the sixth-placed side in eight of those groups were discounted because Eritrea withdrew on the eve of competition, leaving Group E with only five teams.

Gabon had the best record, followed by DR Congo and then Cameroon.

Nigeria only just sneaked in to the play-offs on goal difference, with Frank Onyeka's 91st-minute volley in their 4-0 win over Benin edging out Burkina Faso by a single goal.

The Fifa world rankings were used to work out the pairings for the semi-finals, with the highest-ranked side facing the lowest-ranked.

As a result, Nigeria (41st in the world) will play Gabon (77th) on Thursday (16:00 GMT) before Cameroon (54th) take on DR Congo (60th) later the same day (19:00 GMT).

The semi-final winners will face off on Sunday (19:00 GMT) for the chance to keep alive their dream of reaching next year's World Cup.

All three matches will be held in the Moroccan capital Rabat.

New Caledonia and Bolivia are among potential opponents for the winners of African World Cup play-offs

Africa's play-off winners will progress to a six-team intercontinental qualifier, which will be staged from 23-31 March 2026 and will decide the final two sides at next year's World Cup.

Two nations from the Concacaf (North, Central America and the Caribbean) region and one side from each of the Asian, Oceanian and South American confederations will also be involved.

The six nations will be split into two brackets.

The two highest-ranked sides will be seeded and advance directly to the final in each bracket, with the four lowest-ranked competitors meeting in semi-finals.

The United Arab Emirates and Iraq will play off for Asia's spot, while Bolivia, representing South America, and New Caledonia, representing Oceania, have already booked their places.

Given Bolivia and New Caledonia are respectively ranked 76th and 150th in the world at present, that boosts the chances of Africa's representative advancing directly to a final.

The draw for the play-offs, which will be played in single-leg knockout matches, with extra-time and penalties if required, will be held on Thursday, 20 November.

All you need to know about 2026 World Cup

Nigeria boss Eric Chelle is under pressure to deliver World Cup qualification

This is the million-dollar question.

On paper, Nigeria boast the strongest side according to the world rankings but had the worst qualifying campaign of the African quartet.

The Super Eagles had three different managers oversee their Group C fixtures and struggled when Victor Osimhen was absent through injury, only picking up four points from a possible 15 without their talismanic striker.

Yet the West Africans are unbeaten in six competitive games under Eric Chelle as they bid to avoid missing out on successive World Cups.

Cameroon are another heavyweight of the continental game who underperformed, finishing four points behind Cape Verde in Group D.

The Indomitable Lions only won one of their five away games, which does not bode well for playing on neutral soil this month.

Cameroon hold the African record for the most World Cup appearances, but will need to improve their form to extend that to a ninth trip to the global showpiece.

DR Congo will be without injured Newcastle striker Yoane Wissa for the play-offs

DR Congo, whose only previous World Cup appearance came as Zaire in 1974, finished two points behind Senegal in Group B.

The Leopards paid the price for letting a 2-0 lead slip against the Senegalese on home soil in September, eventually losing 3-2.

Newcastle's Yoane Wissa is still absent through injury, but fellow forward Cedric Bakambu has been in good form in qualifying with four goals.

Gabon, who are bidding to reach the World Cup for the first time, ended a point adrift of Ivory Coast in Group F.

The Panthers boast a potent attack in Denis Bouanga and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who scored eight and seven goals respectively in the group stage.

The bulk of Aubameyang's goals came when he netted four times against The Gambia last month before being sent off, although he is now back from suspension.

The 2026 World Cup draw will take place on Friday, 5 December, when the 48 sides will be split into 12 groups of four.

Forty-two of the teams will be decided by the time of the draw.

Only the two intercontinental play-off winners and the four winners of European play-offs will remain unknown.

As a result, the African side involved in next year's intercontinental play-off may know all of the sides they will potentially face in their World Cup group - should they make it.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=fifa+world+cup","As World Cup nears, Boston organizers are still passing the hat to foot $100 million bill","https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/11/10/business/world-cup-boston-fifa-gillette/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 11:02:37 GMT","

World Cup fever will descend upon Boston next summer, but who will pay for the potential $100-plus million price tag to host the games?

So far, not enough players are stepping onto the pitch. 

Boston is one of 16 cities in North America to host World Cup matches, with seven games scheduled at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough between June 13 and July 9. Fans from around the world will be snatching up tickets, and some will likely be staying here for days, even weeks. 

Entertaining them all costs money, at least $100 million, and it's mostly on local organizers to foot the bill. Host committee Boston 26 had planned to raise much of it through corporate sponsorships. 

But so far, local companies and other donors have only pledged about $20 million, according to Boston 26 officials. That's just enough to cover the cost of FIFA-mandated requirements that Gillette will need to host games, from a new irrigation system to a grass field. 

Congress, ironically, is the biggest single source of funding, agreeing to provide $46.6 million to cover security. But there are many other needs, including transportation to far-flung Gillette and fan festivities in Boston and elsewhere.

That goes a long way to explain why Boston 26 is anxious about not getting $20 million it had requested from Beacon Hill — where House and Senate leadership are at odds over how much to contribute. And as they pass the hat among big companies around town, folks aren't eager to chip in. 

The monthlong extravaganza is expected to draw 2 million visitors to Boston and generate over $1 billion in economic impact. Many will come from abroad, and could stay for an extended period as their favorite team plays in the group stage, and perhaps beyond.

The idea is to show them — and locals — a good time, with a “FIFA Fan Festival” that would host watch parties and lots of futbol-related fun over several weeks. Expect one centrally located main venue, potentially on City Hall Plaza, Boston Common, or Lawn on D in the Seaport District, along with other gatherings set up around the region.

Mike Loynd, CEO OF Boston 26, compared hosting World Cup to having “seven Super Bowls in a month's time.”

But with the tournament just seven months away, finalizing plans has been difficult because Boston 26 is unsure how much money it can raise, even as other host cities like Atlanta and Kansas City, Mo., have already unveiled elaborate fan fests. 

Fund-raising has been a slog in part because there are other big celebrations here next summer that also need corporate support. Even as World Cup winds down, Boston will be getting ready for what is expected to be a bigger-than-usual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the Esplanade on July 4 to mark America's 250th birthday. That will be followed by the return of Sail Boston's Tall Ships July 11-16.

To ensure that Massachusetts celebrates  in grand fashion — after all, the first shot of the American Revolution was fired here — the state has set up MA250 Executive Committee, led by Eastern Bank executive chair Bob Rivers, to raise $8 million from the private sector. Over $5 million has already been brought in with contributions from Amazon, Bank of America, Biogen, Eastern Bank, Fidelity Investments, Liberty Mutual Insurance, M&T Bank, New Balance, Optum, Sanofi, Takeda, and Vertex among others. 

Meanwhile, Sail Boston's Tall Ships has been fund-raising for two years seeking around $4 million in sponsorships. Funders so far include Meet Boston, the region's travel tourism bureau, Hampshire House Hospitality Group, Fidelity, and Mapfre Insurance. Like the Pops on the Esplanade, Sail Boston is a free event expected to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors.

Perhaps complicating World Cup fund-raising is President Trump's recent threat to “take away” the games from Gillette Stadium and relocate them if he felt that Boston was “unsafe” to host soccer festivities.

That kind of uncertainty might give some corporate sponsors pause, says Bob Lynch, founder and CEO of SponsorUnited, a data platform that tracks sponsorship deals.

“It's a great excuse for brands that are on the fence to be like, ‘Well, let's take our time,' ” he said.

World Cup sponsorship deals are big-ticket items, likely in the millions of dollars, which means they can take longer to ink. And for many local companies, the soccer tournament is what Lynch describes as a “one-off event” and might not be as appealing as having partnerships for something like the Boston Marathon that happens annually.

Plus, in the United States, sponsors are used to aligning themselves with other professional sports, such as the Red Sox or the Patriots, not so much soccer.  The last time the United States hosted the World Cup was in 1994, including some games at the then-Foxboro Stadium.

Potential sponsors also have to wrap their heads around why FIFA, the organization behind the World Cup, needs any more money. The wildly popular soccer tournament, which takes place every four years, will ultimately attract billions of dollars in sponsorship and worldwide broadcast deals — money FIFA mostly keeps for itself. 

That means host cities are on their own to pay for World Cup-related events. And even that comes with a wrinkle. Boston 26 can't go after just any corporate sponsor. They have to make sure they don't conflict with exclusive partnerships that FIFA has with brands like Adidas, Coca-Cola, and Unilever.

It's a problem that other host cities are also grappling with, said Michael Rocha-Keys, CEO of EMW Global, an international sports marketing agency. He has been advising clients to get “creative” and find workarounds for which “you don't need FIFA's approval.” Some cities, for example, might organize fan festivals without the FIFA branding.

Boston 26 hasn't yet revealed its local sponsors, though one early supporter has been Meet Boston. The tourism bureau has committed $5 million because World Cup will fill hotels and pack restaurants and other attractions. Meet Boston generates its revenue from a surcharge on hotel rooms in Boston and Cambridge, which it plows back into boosting tourism.

The soccer boosters are certainly hoping the state will help too. In the Legislature's most recent supplemental budget, the House has committed $10 million, though there's nothing from the Senate. That's far less than the $37.5 million Boston 26 had asked from Governor Maura Healey to defray costs for transportation and fan festivities, and only half of the $20 million they ultimately requested.

Boston 26 is worried that the decrease in state funding will affect transportation plans and how fun Fan Festival can be. That matters because business and civic leaders hope that successfully hosting the World Cup will lead to other opportunities for Boston to stage high-profile sporting events like the NBA All-Star game or NFL draft.

“We have a once in a generation opportunity to use this spectacle as a blueprint and a catalyst to drive economic impact to the Commonwealth through the lens of sport well into the future,” said Loynd, the CEO of Boston 26, in a statement.

That's a lofty goal. First they have to get the World Cup over the goal line. And that's proving to be a tough sell.

MEXICO CITY (AP) — Federal infrastructure projects in Mexico for the 2026 World Cup will be completed in time for the start of the tournament in June, President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Monday.

The projects include the renovation of the two terminals at Mexico City International Airport, and construction of a train line connecting the city with Felipe Ángeles International Airport in Santa Lucía, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Mexico City.

The World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which will stage 13 matches, five of them in the capital. Guadalajara and Monterrey share the other eight games.

According to the president, the federal government is investing 9 billion pesos ($489 million) into the renovation of the Mexico City airport.

""This is not only a time to see the best soccer but also a time to share with the world who we are, what Mexico is — not only a country of immense cultural richness but also a country experiencing a historic moment,” Sheinbaum said at a press conference.

Sheinbaum became Mexico's first female president last year.

She added that other federal projects will also be carried out in Monterrey, in northern Mexico, and in the western city of Guadalajara. She said those details will be released in the coming weeks.

Azteca Stadium, set to be the first venue to host three World Cup opening matches, has been closed for renovations but the investment is being made by a private company. Sheinbaum did not provide details about that project.

She said Mexico expects an additional 5.5 million visitors across the three host cities.

“It will be a very special time with a significant economic impact, but we will be ready in a few months,” Sheinbaum said.

Craig Gordon's last Scotland appearance came against Greece in March

World Cup qualifying Group C: Greece v Scotland

Venue: Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium, Piraeus Date: Saturday, 15 November Kick-off: 19:45 GMT

Coverage: Watch on BBC Two, BBC Scotland, iPlayer & app; listen on BBC Radio Scotland; live text commentary on BBC Sport online

Craig Gordon is ""absolutely"" ready to start for Scotland in this month's crucial World Cup qualifiers against Greece and Denmark despite being current second-choice goalkeeper with Heart of Midlothian.

The 42-year-old has not featured for the Scottish Premiership leaders this season after suffering a neck injury in May and the summer signing of Alexander Schwolow following the 33-year-old German's exit from Union Berlin.

An injury to Angus Gunn, who started Scotland's first four matches in the World Cup group stage, leaves head coach Steve Clarke with a decision to make over a replacement.

Liam Kelly is also second choice for Rangers, while Scott Bain has been recalled - six years after earning his third cap - after playing regularly for promoted Falkirk following his summer move from Celtic.

Asked whether he was primed to earn his 82nd cap in Piraeus on Saturday, Gordon replied: ""Yeah, absolutely. That's the manager's call. 

""I just go there and be the best that I can be and see what happens. I can just be myself, do what I normally do, train as well as I possibly can.

""It's an unfortunate situation that we're in at the moment where there's not many goalkeepers playing first-team football.""

Clark had showed loyalty to Gunn despite the 29-year-old himself being frozen out at Nottingham Forest after his summer switch from Norwich City.

Gordon's experience dwarfs that of the other remaining goalkeepers in Clark's squad, although the former Celtic and Sunderland number one did concede Bain is ""a little bit ahead in terms of match practice"".

Having made his Scotland debut in 2004, Gordon's last appearance came in a 3-0 home defeat by Greece in March.

The Scots avenged that Nations League play-off loss with a 3-1 victory at Hampden last month and the Greeks are no longer in the running for a top-two spot in Group C.

""We've played them quite a few times recently and mixed results,"" Gordon said. ""They're a very good team. Really good going forward, with great, creative players.

""It's going to be a real tough one, regardless of whether they're already out or not. They've named nearly the same squad, so they're still going with the same players again.""

Gordon was in the Scotland squad for the delayed 2020 European Championship but did not play and was then omitted for the 2024 tournament in Germany.

Turning 43 next month, he knows this will be his last chance to play in a major finals and it would fulfill a lifelong dream to play on the biggest stage of all.

""To manage to go to a World Cup, it's everybody's dream,"" he added. ""There's quite a few guys approaching 30 or just over. So you're not going to get many more opportunities.

""This is a big one. We've managed to get to a couple of Euros in a row, so everybody's motivation for this couldn't possibly be higher.""

2026 FIFA World Cup Boston Host Committee officials revealed that local companies and other donors have “only pledged about” $20M to fund the tournament as the city continues efforts to cover costs, according to Shirley Leung of the BOSTON GLOBE. That is “just enough to cover the cost of FIFA-mandated requirements” that Gillette will need to host games, from a “new irrigation system to a grass field.” Congress is still the “biggest single source of funding,” agreeing to provide $46.6M to “cover security.” Leung notes that “goes a long way to explain why” Boston 26 is “anxious about not getting $20 million it had requested from Beacon Hill -- where House and Senate leadership are at odds over how much to contribute.” Leung: “And as they pass the hat among big companies around town, folks aren't eager to chip in.” Fundraising has been “a slog in part because there are other big celebrations here next summer that also need corporate support.” There is the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on July 4 to mark America's 250th birthday. That will be followed by the return of Sail Boston's Tall Ships July 11-16. Leung: “Perhaps complicating World Cup fund-raising is President Trump's recent threat to ‘take away' the games from Gillette Stadium and relocate them if he felt that Boston was ‘unsafe' to host soccer festivities.” SponsorUnited founder & CEO Bob Lynch said that the “uncertainty might give some corporate sponsors pause” (BOSTON GLOBE, 11/10).","{'href': 'https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com', 'title': 'Sports Business Journal'}","soccer"

Barcelona forward Robert Lewandowski was delighted to see his team reduce the deficit with table toppers Real Madrid after powering the Catalans to an emphatic 4-2 victory against Celta Vigo, while their rivals dropped points against Rayo Vallecano. The Poland international believes the international break will help Barca regain their lost form as they look to regain control of the league title race.

After sharing the spoils with Club Brugge in the Champions League mid-week, Barcelona are back on track with a sensational win over Celta Vigo. Lewandowski, who warmed the bench in the last two games after his recovery, got a place in the starting lineup against Celta and helped the Catalans thwart the home team with a brilliant hat-trick. In the 10th minute, he netted his first goal from the spot, though it was cancelled out a minute later by Sergio Carreira's equaliser for Celta. In the 37th minute, Barca earned their second of the evening through the Polish ace's prowess, only to concede an equaliser six minutes later. The first half ended 3-2 with Lamine Yamal's late goal and Barca went on to limit Celta's attacking force before the 37-year-old netted his third of the game in the 73rd minute. 

Courtesy of the win, and Madrid's 0-0 draw with Rayo Vallecano at the Bernabeu, Barca are now just three points behind their Clasico rivals. Winner of the matchball in the Celta game, Lewandowski cited the same to the media. He said: ""Yes, we're very happy to win a game here 2-4. It's always difficult for us to play in Vigo, but the most important thing is that we won and we're now two points [sic] behind Real Madrid. In the second half we had the game more under control. In the first half I think Celta scored some very easy goals. At half-time, we talked about what we can improve, how we could play better. The fourth goal was very important in allowing us to play with more patience and composure.

Barca will now have 12 days to prepare for their next game, as the international break brings a cooling period for Flick's squad. The Polish lynchpin believes this break will allow the team to resume action with renewed energy. He claimed: ""After this game we can analyse what we can improve, both defensively and offensively. Now we have two weeks to disconnect from the team, but I hope that when we return we can play much better.""

The former Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund star's treble takes him to seven goals from just nine La Liga games so far this season. It was the veteran's fourth start of the campaign, having been seen his role under coach Hansi Flick reduced. Lewandowski's contract at the Catalan club will expire at the end of the season and it is not clear if he will be offered a contract extension. Recent reports stated that his agent has held talks with AC Milan over a possible free transfer, with the Rossoneri interested in uniting him with former Clasico rival Luka Modric.

Flick recently heaped praise on him following his return from injury, telling reporters: ""I don't know what's in his DNA, but he recovers in three weeks from injuries that should last five...  When Lewandowski and [Dani] Olmo returned, training was different. The level rose considerably, as did that of the younger players. We need these players to reach our full potential. And that takes time. It's not just about winning, but about understanding the situation and managing it.""

After the international break, Barca will take on Athletic Club in La Liga, followed by a visit to London to face Enzo Maresca's Chelsea in the Champions League. It is going to be a vital continental clash with the teams level on seven points after four games. They will round off the month with a La Liga clash against Alaves before kicking off December with a home game against Diego Simeone's Atletico Madrid.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are set to compete to secure a transfer for £26 million-rated ($34m) Crystal Palace star Daniel Munoz. PSG were dealt a major blow in their recent Champions League encounter against Bayern Munich as star full-back Achraf Hakimi suffered a horror injury after a challenge from Luis Diaz, and he has now been ruled out of action for at least a couple of months.

Hakimi was forced off the pitch at the stroke of half-time after Bayern forward Diaz lunged in on the Moroccan defender. The ex-Liverpool star was originally shown a yellow card by the on-field referee but the decision was upgraded to a red after a VAR check. As for Hakimi, he was visibly in pain on the ground and had to be helped off the pitch. The defender also appeared to be in tears and the fear was that he had sustained a serious injury that would keep him out of action for some time.

Hakimi underwent medical examinations, which later revealed that he suffered a severe sprain in his left ankle, involving partial damage to the femoral syndesmosis and deltoid ligaments. The reigning European champions, however, later confirmed that the player won't need surgery but will be sidelined for six to eight weeks. Their statement read: ""Achraf Hakimi has severely sprained his left ankle, which will leave him unavailable for several weeks.""

Hakimi's freak injury has also left the Morocco national team worried as the Atlas Lions are not sure whether their star player will be able to take the field in the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations, which kicks off on December 21 in Morocco. Speaking about Hakimi's importance in the team, Morocco head coach Walid Regragui has said: ""Achraf Hakimi is an irreplaceable player. He was a contender for the Ballon d'Or. For us Moroccans, he is the best player in the world.""

With Hakimi set to miss a lot of action, PSG are naturally thinking of signing a replacement for their star full-back with the January transfer window now approaching. According to Fichajes, officials in Paris are eyeing a move for Crystal Palace right wing-back Munoz as they see the Colombian defender as a perfect cover for Hakimi.

Mundo Deportivo reports that Spanish giants Barcelona are also keeping tabs on Munoz and the Catalan giants believe that they can sign the Palace full-back for a fee in the region of €30m (£26m/$34m). Munoz is an integral part of Oliver Glasner's squad and played a key role in the club winning the FA Cup last season. With his contract running until 2028, the Premier League side are expected to demand a fee they feel will be appropriate for an important first-team player.

After a successful 2024-25 campaign, players from the Eagles squad are attracting interest from across Europe. While Munoz is being eyed by two of the biggest clubs in the world, their midfield sensation Adam Wharton is also linked with a move away from Selhurst Park, with clubs like Manchester United and Real Madrid keen on signing the English midfielder.

According to journalist Fabrizio Romano, Palace are preparing to offer Wharton a new deal soon as they don't want to lose their star player, at least for a low transfer fee. Speaking to GiveMeSport, Romano said: ""They want to extend this contract. So Palace are on it. They've spoken already to his representative several times about this intention they have to give him a new contract. At the same time, let's see what's going to happen there, because the boy has been super professional already last summer, when he already had some kind of opportunity if he wanted to go. But for Palace, he was untouchable. Also, in recent months, we had many rumours, and the boy, again, is behaving in a fantastic way. So Palace are super happy with Adam, and Adam is quite happy with Palace. He understands that he's probably at the best club to develop at this moment for him. But then in the summer, you never know, in case there is a big opportunity, a big financial proposal, we have to see what happens. So at the moment, there is this intention from Palace to give him a new contract, but we are not yet at the stage where we say, okay, it's guaranteed, because it's still early stages of the conversation.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Aston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez has been warned that he has missed out on a 'chance of a lifetime' by a Premier League legend after his failed Manchester United transfer. Martinez was closely linked with a move to Old Trafford during the summer window but the club eventually signed young Belgian custodian Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp instead, leaving the Argentina international to continue at Villa.

After even bidding an emotional goodbye to Villa's fans, Martinez failed to secure an Old Trafford switch as the Red Devils opted to sign Lammens on deadline day instead. Many believed that the World Cup-winning goalkeeper would be a perfect fit at United as the club were desperately looking to replace out-of-form Andre Onana.

During the window, it was even claimed that a loan move for Jadon Sancho, taking him to Villa Park, would clear the way for Martinez to head north from the West Midlands, but Amorim eventually settled for £18 million-rated ($24m) Lammens.

Former Newcastle United, Manchester City and Aston Villa stopper Shay Given has delivered his verdict on Martinez' failed transfer to United as he told 10bet: ""It felt very close in the window just gone past, with him not playing. I think Villa played in a live game on deadline day, and he wasn't in the squad. Everyone thought he was off, maybe to Manchester United, but that didn't happen. Then he came back as number one again to Villa. He's playing again, he's their top man. I don't know if the ship has sailed for a move next summer. Manchester United? Probably, not that Senne Lammens has arrived and done really well. Maybe it was a chance in a lifetime for Emi, and it's been missed now. 

""Unless Emi Martinez is thinking of heading to another country. But he's had a phenomenal time, hasn't he, for club and country. He won the World Cup, I mean, that's just incredible. That save at the end of the World Cup final and they go up the other end, that's stuff of dreams, isn't it? He's an absolute hero in Argentina, and he's got a real personality. Maybe with his age, teams will be looking at younger options instead from next year, but he's still a brilliant goalkeeper, in my opinion.""

Former United chief scout Mick Brown has urged his ex-employers to reignite their interest in the experienced Argentine goalkeeper, as he told Football Insider. ""They wanted him, he wanted the move, but at the end of the day they couldn't come to an agreement with Villa so the deal collapsed. They've gone and got Lammens now, but Amorim has been saying he still wants a goalkeeper, so the recruitment team will be looking at their options. 

""I have no doubt Martinez is still one of those, because he's a top-class goalkeeper and one who would immediately solve the issues they've had recently. He's strong, imposing, a top shot-stopper and a character in the dressing room which it feels like they're sorely lacking at Man United at the moment. It wouldn't surprise me at all to see them go back in for him, especially with the manager still demanding a goalkeeper, whether that's in January or next summer.""

Since his move to England, Lammens has appeared in five Premier League games thus far, during which he has conceded seven times. He played an important role in Amorim's side winning three back-to-back matches in October against Sunderland, Liverpool and Brighton and has also been compared to legendary Red Devils goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel.

Lammens, though, has rejected any such comparisons as he told BBC Sport: ""I don't listen to it too much during the game but I saw it afterwards. I'm not Schmeichel in disguise. I am just Senne Lammens trying to help the team. It is an amazing compliment to get but you have to be realistic. He is one of the best goalkeepers ever. I have to prove a lot more to be in the same conversation as him.""","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

GOAL brings you the latest on the British players who are thriving away from home, as several stars choose to make a living in Europe and even beyond. The Premier League is still obviously one of the world's most entertaining divisions and the Championship can prove fantastic for development, but there are more options out there.

The grass isn't always greener, but plenty of Britain's footballing expats are enjoying themselves both across Europe and, in some cases, further afield. England's captain has found a new home over in Germany, while the Three Lions' most promising midfielder is a Galactico in Spain and Scotland's Ballon d'Or hero is a king in Italy. This weekend, there were several success stories, some of heartbreak and one notable case of football romanticism.

Every Monday this season, GOAL will bring you the definitive lowdown on British stars abroad, how they're doing, which of them are enjoying life away and who could do with coming home. Let's dive in...

Bayern Munich went into Saturday's match away at Union Berlin having won all 16 games to begin 2025-26. With their capital hosts firmly mid-table in the Bundesliga, Vincent Kompany's side were widely expected to run out victors again.

Yet Union threw a spanner in the works. After an opening goal from Ilyas Ansah was ruled out by VAR for offside, Manuel Neuer spilled a trickling shot from Danilho Doekhi over the line to ensure Bayern indeed fell behind in the first half. Only an incredible solo effort from Luis Diaz meant the visitors were able to go into the break on level terms.

Bayern pushed on to find a second goal, but found themselves scrambling for merely one point when Doekhi scored again on 83 minutes, with Kane's limp header from a free-kick turned in by the centre-back. The enigmatic Stadion An der Alten Forsterei thought it was going to see a famous Union win, until Kane went from zero to Bavarian hero. In the third minute of added time, Tom Bischof sent in a delicious cross, and the England captain pounced ahead of his marker to nod it in at the near post.

""It was a tough game. We expected a battle and a lot of long balls. Many decisions and small fouls went against us today,"" Kane bemoaned post-match. ""It wasn't our best game, but we stayed focused and managed to equalise. That's football, there are games like today where things go against you. We'll take the point.

""Obviously it was my mistake for the second goal. So I was itching to get the chance at the end there and put it away, and thankfully Tom put a great ball in and I snuck it past the 'keeper. I've been playing football long enough to know, this is part of it, mistakes are going to happen. It's just nice to be able to help teams out.""

Kane did, however, reserve special praise for fellow scorer Diaz, who has been a revelation at Bayern since joining from Liverpool over the summer. ""Incredible to be honest,"" he said of the strike. ""The way he kept the ball in and got past his defender and then score was, just a special goal, a really, really special goal. He's been pulling stuff out like that all season but I reckon that's probably his best.""

For some reason, the bourgeoisie of Real Madrid simply cannot buy a win away at working-class club Rayo Vallecano, who are situated on the edge of the Spanish capital. Their stadium, Vallecas, has only three stands and a capacity of under 15,000, yet it has a reputation as one of the toughest places to go in La Liga.

Madrid have now failed to win on any of their last four visits to Rayo, drawing three and losing one in that time. Their latest stalemate came on Sunday, with both sides cancelling each other out as it finished 0-0. Despite boasting all the star talent you could ever hope for, Xabi Alonso's men mustered a mere 0.98 expected goals from 21 shots.

That wasn't for the want of Jude Bellingham's trying, though. He saw two close-range efforts blocked and picked the Rayo lock on several occasions. It's hardly his fault that Madrid dropped points and failed to score for a second-successive game across all competitions, following their 1-0 loss to Liverpool in the Champions League in midweek.

""Always difficult in Vallecas but we take the point and move forward,"" Bellingham wrote on Instagram. ""We have to stick together and prepare for another tough spell of games coming after the break. Hala Madrid.""

Sandwiched between last week's matches at club level, Bellingham secured a return to the England squad having been left out of their last two camps. Head coach Thomas Tuchel has promised the Madrid man a ""central role"" given his unique skillset as an attacking midfielder who has the scoring instincts of a forward.

When you think of Marcus Rashford at full tilt, you think of one of the most ruthless ball-strikers and emphatic finishers in the game. You think of his electric pace and confidence to skip past defenders without hesitance. You don't really envisage him as a forward who would consider passing before shooting.

Maybe the ethos of Barcelona has overcome him. His tally of six assists is the most of any player in La Liga so far this season, and already the third-highest Rashford has recorded in a league campaign since turning professional, only bettered by sums of seven in 2019-20 and nine in 2020-21.

The headlines belonged to Robert Lewandowski after he bagged a hat-trick in Barca's 4-2 triumph at Celta Vigo on Sunday, but Rashford's two assists for the Pole didn't go unnoticed. The Manchester United loanee whipped in a delicious cross for Lewandowski to tap home to put the visitors 2-1 up towards the end of the first half, before delivering a corner that the No.9 headed up and in to round off the scoring late on.

Rashford's all-round performance earned special praise from Catalan outlet Mundo Deportivo, who wrote: ""Rashford contributed his excellent passing ability to the team and also greatly improved his pressing, which was key to Barcelona's victory in Vigo.""

In less positive news for Rashford, Barca sporting director Deco has hinted the club will not be able to afford to trigger his £30.3 million (€35m/$39.9m) purchase clause until the summer, with a tight budget in place for the rest of the season.

Napoli look far from the beast who romped their way to the Scudetto last season. An inauspicious start to 2025-26 has left Antonio Conte on the brink of another meltdown. The mood and vibes around Naples are through the floor, despite their beloved team sitting only two points off the top of the Serie A table.

Ballon d'Or nominee Scott McTominay also hasn't lived up to the same expectations of him this term either, scoring just once in the league since the opening day while battling with an ankle issue over recent weeks. A trip to Bologna on Sunday was a chance for Napoli and their star midfielder to claim a scalp and head into the international break on a high, but it's one they spectacularly squandered.

Conte's side mustered only four shots - two from McTominay himself - as they fell to a 2-0 defeat, with the hosts inspired by captain Lewis Ferguson, who appears to be over the worst of his injury struggles. Ex-Napoli striker Roberto Sosa has even suggested Conte has lost the dressing room and that showed in their performance, commenting: ""It's the typical match you see when the players want to get rid of the coach. The players weren't even angry despite being two goals down, and I've said this before about other teams. Today, I have to say it about Napoli.""

Meanwhile, The Sun have reported that McTominay has told Conte to make a fresh play for former United team-mate Kobbie Mainoo, who was linked with the Italian champions during the summer window after asking to leave Old Trafford. Whether or not Conte will actually be at the club come January remains to be seen.

Back to Germany now, and there was a Bundesliga goal for Borussia Dortmund's Carney Chukwuemeka to celebrate at last this season. So much attention has been placed on Jobe Bellingham and his family's battle with BVB that it's gone under the radar the club also have another talented English midfielder on their books.

Hamburg were the hosts for Saturday's encounter, and Dortmund broke the deadlock heading into the final half-hour of action. After HSV failed to clear a corner, the second delivery was flicked back up by Nico Schlotterbeck and into Chukwuemeka's path. With a wicked swing of his right foot, the former Chelsea starlet got great contact on the ball as it bobbled frantically across the ground and into the back of the net.

""Schlotti controlled the ball well with his head and I saw the chance to shoot. Thank God the ball went in. I was very happy,"" Chukwuemeka said to Dortmund's club channels after the game.

Dortmund thought they had done enough to take the three points back to Signal Iduna Park, but in the last of seven added minutes, Ransford Konigsdorffer popped up with a header to snatch a draw for Hamburg and deny BVB a third 1-0 win on the spin.

Speaking on that late equaliser, Chukwuemeka added: ""Super frustrating! I think it's down to us. We stopped playing after the first goal. That wasn't good enough.""

After Paris Saint-Germain's ruthless conquering of Europe in 2024-25, few would have expected there to be a competitive title race in Ligue 1 this season. You can't knock the likes of Marseille and Lens, who sit only two points behind the reigning champions, for giving it a good go.

Live-wire manager Roberto De Zerbi has managed to keep OM's emotions in check through 12 rounds of league fixtures, capping off this part of the campaign with a 3-0 victory at home to Brest. Marseille more than deserved the win with a dominant performance at the Stade Velodrome, though there was more than a tint of fortune around their opening goal.

England international Angel Gomes' free-kick from 20 yards seemed simple enough for goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki, but he instead completely misjudged the shot and let it wriggle out of his grip and across the line. This was followed by a penalty from Mason Greenwood, who is up to second in the Ligue 1 top-scorer race with eight goals this season, half of those coming from spot kicks.

De Zerbi spoke in his post-match preference of Gomes' complete performance in the middle of the park alongside Belgium star Arthur Vermeeren. ""Vermeeren played a true midfielder's game, he's becoming more complete in duels which is essential for him, the same goes for Angel Gomes,"" he said. ""He gave everything we expect from him. I'm very happy.""

Marseille nearly went into the November international break top of Ligue 1, but Lyon couldn't do them the favour they needed against PSG. Les Gones came ever so close to holding on for a draw, which they would have been good value for too after limiting the European champions to nine shots, only for it to be cruelly taken from them in stoppage time.

Luis Enrique's side went one up through Warren Zaire-Emery, though this first-half strike was almost instantly cancelled out by a leveller from Afonso Moreira. A third goal in seven minutes, this time from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, put PSG back in the driving seat.

Then the Englishmen got in on the act. On the other side of half-time, ex-Liverpool youngster Tyler Morton saw Arsenal academy graduate Ainsley Maitland-Niles making a weaving run right between a sleeping PSG backline and duly plopped a pass over the top for him to run onto. With Lucas Chevalier racing off his line, Maitland-Niles thought quickly and dinked the ball over the goalkeeper to bring Lyon level again.

OL defender Nicolas Tagliafico was controversially shown a second yellow card in added time for shoving Vitinha's face, and PSG made that one-man advantage count before the final whistle, with Lee Kang-in's corner headed in by Joao Neves to break Lyon hearts.

We'll finish with a story you probably haven't heard of, and a player you may not know unless you've paid close attention to League One and League Two over the last few years.

Turkish side Kocaelispor secured promotion to the Super Lig last season, ending a 16-year wait to return to the top-flight. They even dropped into the amateur leagues in 2014 and were in the third tier as recently as 2022, but are now back in the big time after finishing top of the 1. Lig.

One of their premier signings this summer was wide forward Dan Agyei, who turned down a fresh contract at Leyton Orient to take up a new adventure in Turkey. London-born Agyei has largely been offered only sparing minutes with Kocaelispor, but after a run of games in the starting XI, he's finally scored a goal, and what a time it was to get it.

Kocaelispor welcomed leaders and Champions League dark horses Galatasaray to the Kocaeli Stadium on Sunday, hoping to cause a giant-killing that would propel them away from the relegation zone and into mid-table. Agyei, someone who had only made three appearances at a level higher than the English third tier until this season, took down a team featuring Victor Osimhen, Leroy Sane, Mauro Icardi, Davinson Sanchez and more.

The winger cut inside from the right, skipped past the challenges of Abdulkerim Bardakci and former Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira, and rifled in a shot at the near post to bring a 35,000-strong crowd to its feet with what proved to be game's only goal.

La Liga side confirm sale of majority stake to equity firm","https://www.goal.com/en-us/lists/new-owners-for-atletico-madrid-la-liga-side-confirm-sale-of-majority-stake-to-equity-firm/blt8d093989c314cb37","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 15:10:31 GMT","

Atletico Madrid have officially confirmed the sale of a majority stake in the club to global sports investment company Apollo Sports Capital (ASC). The landmark deal will see ASC become the majority shareholder, injecting new capital to bolster the club's financial stability, sporting competitiveness and ambitious infrastructure projects, including the development of the City of Sport.

Atletico have officially announced a significant change in ownership, with ASC acquiring a majority stake in the club. This crucial move, confirmed via a statement on the club's website, sees the current major shareholders reduce their stakes to facilitate the investment. While ASC will become the majority owner, the club confirmed that Miguel Angel Gil and Enrique Cerezo remain in their roles as CEO and chairman respectively, and will remain as shareholders.

The artnership aims to strengthen Atletico Madrid's position among football's elite and support long-term success for its millions of fans worldwide. The investment is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals, with completion expected in the first quarter of 2026. Financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed.

The investment from ASC is set to provide substantial new capital for Atletico's ambitious long-term plans. A key focus will be further investment in all of Atletico Madrid's teams, encompassing the men's, women's and academy sides, to enhance their sporting competitiveness.

One of the most significant aspects of this investment is the funding for major infrastructure projects, notably the ""development of the City of Sport."" This ambitious project envisions a new sports and entertainment centre adjacent to the Riyadh Air Metropolitano Stadium. The club stated: ""The aim of this project is to become a world-class destination for sport, leisure, culture, and community activity."" With Apollo's extensive experience in the sports, media, and entertainment sectors, ASC aspires to create a ""dynamic, transformative, and multidisciplinary urban center for the people of Madrid.""

Angel Gil, Atletico's CEO, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership. ""We are very proud to welcome a new partner committed to the club. Apollo Sports Capital is a great ally that respects the history, traditions, and identity of Atletico de Madrid and its fans, while bringing additional resources and enthusiasm to help maintain our growth and competitiveness,"" he said.

Robert Givone, partner at Apollo and co-manager of ASC, underscored the importance of this continuity. ""Atletico de Madrid is one of Europe's great sporting institutions, and it is an honour for Apollo Sports Capital to invest in this historic club and its legacy of over 120 years. Miguel Angel has done an extraordinary job transforming Atletico, and it was essential for us to invest in support of the continuity of his leadership, as well as investing in the team and the local community,"" Givone stated.

The new partnership aims to reinforce the club's financial stability. Gil acknowledged the contributions of previous partners, saying, ""Atletico would not be where it is today without the support of Wanda Group, Quantum Pacific, and Ares, whose backing has strengthened us at crucial moments."" This collaboration with ASC is designed to build on that foundation, driving ""solid and sustainable growth"" for the club.

ASC is a global sports investment company and a subsidiary of Apollo. Its investment strategy focuses on the sports and live events sector, primarily through credit and hybrid investment opportunities. Atletico will serve as the flagship investment for ASC, with the firm explicitly stating that it is ""not part of a multi-ownership strategy to control clubs.""

This clarifies that ASC's interest is specific to Atletico and the club's potential, rather than building a portfolio of clubs under common ownership. Other recent investments by Apollo Sports Capital include stakes in the Mutua Madrid Open and Miami Open tennis tournaments, in partnership with MARI, and a new company formed by Ari Emanuel and Mark Shapiro. ASC is led by CEO Al Tylis, co-managers Givone and Lee Solomon, and Chief Strategy Officer Sam Porter.

Atletico Madrid currently sit in fourth place in La Liga, with 25 points from 12 matches, including seven wins, four draws, and one loss. They are four points behind league leaders Real Madrid and three points behind second-placed Barcelona. Their recent form has been strong, with four wins and one draw in their last five league matches, including a convincing 3-1 victory over Levante in their most recent fixture, where Antoine Griezmann scored twice.

The club also confirmed that the investment extends to its affiliated clubs, Atletico de San Luis and Atletico Ottawa, which will also become majority-owned by Apollo Sports Capital. The current shareholders - Angel Gil, Cerezo, Quantum Pacific Group and funds managed by Ares Management - will retain minority stakes across these entities.

The completion of the deal in the first quarter of 2026 will usher in a new era for Atletico Madrid. The immediate impact will be the injection of capital to strengthen the squad and accelerate the City of Sport project, which aims to transform the areas around the Riyadh Air Metropolitano Stadium. On the field, Atletico will return from the international break to face Getafe in La Liga on Sunday, November 23. The continued leadership of Gil and Cerezo, combined with the new financial backing, signals a commitment to both tradition and ambitious growth, aiming to solidify Atletico Madrid's position among Europe's elite clubs in the long term.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"
"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:goal.com","Didier Deschamps confirms approach from Saudi Pro League and addresses 'absolutely false' reports about his France future","https://www.goal.com/en/lists/didier-deschamps-confirms-approach-from-saudi-pro-league-and-addresses-absolutely-false-reports-about-his-france-future/bltb8cd9ac8cbd6647a","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:17:53 GMT","

Didier Deschamps has confirmed he has received approaches from the Saudi Pro League regarding a coaching role after his tenure with the France national team concludes with the 2026 World Cup. The Bleus boss also categorically denied reports linking him with a return to Juventus or taking over the Brazil national team, reiterating his commitment to his pre-determined departure from the French setup.

The successful manager of the French national team, has admitted to having discussions with a Saudi club regarding his career plans after he steps down from his role with Les Bleus following the 2026 World Cup.

Deschamps told Telefoot: ""I may have had some contact, not specifically with them. I'm not going to name names, but they know my situation."" 

Deschamps had previously announced his departure from the French national team in January, marking the end of a reign that began in 2012. However, he was asked if there is a chance he will stay should they win the next World Cup.

""That's false, absolutely,"" he said. ""From the moment I made a decision - and I won't go back on it, that's clear - I'll be free after the scheduled deadlines, and I'm not ruling anything out.""

Deschamps moved to quash several persistent rumours about his post-France future. He firmly denied any interest in a return to Juventus, where he both played (1994-1999) and managed (2006-2007), leading them back to Serie A. 

Similarly, the two-time World Cup winner (1998 as a player, 2018 as a coach) rejected claims linking him to the Brazil national team. A Brazilian media outlet had reported that the former Marseille coach might consider leading the Selecao, but Deschamps retorted: ""False. Never say never, but I don't see myself managing another nation. Given what the French national team, La Marseillaise… mean to me, I can't imagine myself on the bench with another anthem.""

This strong declaration effectively rules out a significant portion of potential future roles, narrowing his options to club football, with a return to Paris Saint-Germain also not being ruled out entirely. ""I'm not ruling anything out, I'll be available,"" he replied to a question about PSG. ""But I don't have anything in mind at the moment. Depending on the offers, I'll choose. I'm not ruling anything out. I'm not focused on anything specific. I don't know and I don't want to know what my future holds. It doesn't concern me. I repeat, I'm not closing any doors except for managing another national team, unless I change my mind. But I highly doubt that.""

Meanwhile, Deschamps has had to navigate ongoing tensions with Paris Saint-Germain concerning player injuries, particularly that of Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele. Dembele was forced off after just 25 minutes during PSG's Champions League defeat against Bayern Munich last week, exacerbating a frustrating season for the 28-year-old who has suffered a string of injuries.

Speaking at a press conference where the France squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers was announced, Deschamps expressed his sadness. ""I'm especially sad for Ous. Last season, he was spared from injury, and now he's been hit with a string of injuries,"" he told reporters, as highlighted previously. He made it clear he would not ""add fuel to the fire"" in the ongoing feud between Les Bleus and PSG over player fitness.

""I'm not interested in controversy. We have one thing in common: his absence isn't good for PSG or for us. I hope he recovers quickly,"" Deschamps maintained, careful to avoid direct criticism of the club's management. The history of injuries to French players while on international duty, including Dembele and Desire Doue in a World Cup qualifier against Ukraine, has led to public anger from the Ligue 1 champions, who claimed the injuries were ""serious and avoidable.""

Deschamps reiterated the inherent risks of football. ""What happens at PSG is their business; I don't have all the information. I wouldn't presume to say anything about any club; they decide, they have the information to decide. Just like us. There have always been exchanges, as is the case here with Ousmane's injury. When tests are done, they are communicated both ways. Of course, the interests of clubs and the interests of national teams aren't the same. But there have always been exchanges regarding the tests and diagnoses. I'm not here to change the medical protocol. The fact that clubs can be given more decision-making power than national teams isn't up to me to decide. I'm not in Luis Enrique's position, just as he's not in mine. From the moment his players are on the pitch, there's a risk.""

Despite the off-field discussions about his future and the ongoing injury concerns, Deschamps remains focused on his immediate objective: securing qualification for the 2026 World Cup. France currently leads Group D standings in the qualifiers with 10 points from their four games.

Les Bleus face Ukraine on November 13 and Azerbaijan on November 16 in their final set of qualifiers. With only one more point required to guarantee their place at the World Cup, Deschamps' men will be determined to secure maximum points against Ukraine. This would not only confirm their qualification but also ensure they top the group, potentially allowing Deschamps to rest key players against Azerbaijan and provide opportunities to those who have had fewer chances.

In the immediate future, Deschamps will focus on successfully navigating France through their remaining World Cup qualifiers and preparing for the 2026 tournament, which he has confirmed will be his last in charge. Beyond that, he will be ""available"" and open to offers from club football, having explicitly ruled out managing another national team. His acknowledgment of contact from the Saudi Pro League suggests a significant move could be on the horizon, potentially offering a lucrative and challenging new chapter in his decorated career. The coming years will reveal where one of football's most successful managers chooses to embark on his next adventure.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Taylor Fritz spoiled Lorenzo Musetti's Nitto ATP Finals debut in emphatic fashion on Monday, delivering a commanding performance to silence the packed Inalpi Arena crowd in Turin. Blending discipline with controlled aggression, the American dictated play from the baseline to seal a 6-3, 6-4 win against the Italian.

Fritz carries strong pedigree at the season finale, having reached the championship match last year and the semi-finals on debut in 2022. The 28-year-old arrived in northern Italy a week ago, in stark contrast to Musetti, who only touched down in Turin on Sunday after falling to Novak Djokovic in the Athens final on Saturday night.

With a full week of preparation in the bag, Fritz looked more comfortable in the indoor conditions. The sixth seed stepped inside the baseline to take the ball early, redirecting pace and pushing Musetti onto the back foot. Though the Italian produced flashes of brilliance while scrambling, he spent most of the match retreating, unable to wrest control from Fritz's penetrating, flat groundstrokes.

“I am really happy. I thought I did a lot of things really well,” Fritz said. “I did a great job early on in the match to serve my way out of trouble and save some break points. The whole second set I played well and had a lot of chances to break that I didn't get. I am really happy I was able to serve it out there and it didn't come back to ruin it.”



Fritz finished with a performance rating of 9.20 against Musetti, well above his 8.28 Tour average in 2025. After storming through the first set, the American gained the crucial break of the second set at 1-1 when Musetti hit two consecutive doubles from 40/30 before he pushed a backhand wide when defending on break point. Fritz then held his nerve when serving out, rallying from 0/30 at 5-4 to triumph after one hour and 43 minutes.

“Every time I come here, I like the conditions and it is very easy to get motivated,” Fritz said when asked about his impressive Turin record. “You can lock in, it is the last tournament of the year and it is the ATP Finals, it is a big deal.”

Fritz is now 1-0 in the Jimmy Connors group and will also meet Carlos Alcaraz and Alex de Minaur in round-robin play in Turin. Alcaraz, chasing his first Nitto ATP Finals crown, defeated De Minaur on Sunday to kick-start his final push to earn ATP Year-End No. 1 presented by PIF honours.

Fritz owns a 52-21 record on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, highlighted by titles in Eastbourne and Stuttgart. The World No. 6 is locked at 3-3 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Musetti, with this the pair's first meeting in 2025.

Musetti has enjoyed the best season of his career to qualify for the year-end event for the first time, advancing to tour-level finals in Monte-Carlo, Chengdu and Athens.  The 23-year-old is joined by countryman and World No. 2 Jannik Sinner in Turin. The defending champion Sinner begins his campaign against Felix Auger-Aliassime on Monday night.

The world No. 1 was in a joking mood after falling short in another big final, this time at the WTA Finals.ByTENNIS.comPublished Nov 09, 2025 copy_link

Aryna Sabalenka famously shot from the hip in the press room after tense three-set losses in the finals of the Australian Open and at Roland Garros this year, saying that her emotions got the better of her and prevented her from finding her best tennis in the clutch moments.But another high-profile loss—a 6-4, 7-6(0) defeated to Elena Rybakina on Saturday—for the title at the year-end WTA Finals saw the world No. 1 singing a different tune, crediting the 2022 Wimbledon champion for outplaying her when it mattered.🖥️📲REPLAY: Elena Rybakina def.

So, I think it wasn't like I lost complete control over my emotions and I lost the match. No, I think she played incredible. I didn't use a couple opportunities I had. And, yeah, basically, that's it.""While wanting it too much may not have contributed to the last of Sabalenka's high-profile defeats this season, she still couldn't hold it all in. The tears flowed as the WTA's consensus top-ranked player told her team that they had ""so many things to be proud of"" this season, leading the four-time Grand Slam champion to joke that an impending offseason vacation in the Maldives was the time to recalibrate mentally in more ways than one.

""But yeah, I was maybe a little bit emotional today, but it didn't really aIect my game. I was just maybe overthinking today, maybe too much. So, I think it wasn't like I lost complete control over my emotions and I lost the match. No, I think she played incredible. I didn't use a couple opportunities I had. And, yeah, basically, that's it.""While wanting it too much may not have contributed to the last of Sabalenka's high-profile defeats this season, she still couldn't hold it all in.

2025 Paulo Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

Lando Norris is even further clear of his rivals at the top of the Drivers' Championship standings following victory in a captivating Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with Kimi Antonelli holding off a charging Max Verstappen to take second.

Lando Norris has further extended his championship lead after claiming victory in a gripping Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver leading Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli home while Max Verstappen put in a remarkable comeback to finish on the podium after starting from the pit lane.

After making a good start from pole position, Norris continued to lead amid a hectic first few laps, with a Safety Car being deployed following a crash into the barriers for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto at the Brazilian's home race.

A Virtual Safety Car was then deployed after the restart due to another incident in which Oscar Piastri locked up and hit Antonelli, sending the Mercedes into Charles Leclerc who was forced to retire his damaged Ferrari from the race as a result.

Piastri subsequently received a 10-second time penalty for that collision in a race that saw a fascinating array of strategies play out – one of which involved Verstappen, who bounced back from an early puncture to climb his way through the order and challenge the frontrunners as the Grand Prix headed towards a thrilling climax.

While Norris crossed the line with a 10-second lead to clinch his seventh Grand Prix win of the season, a nail-biting duel played out behind between Antonelli and Verstappen for second place. Antonelli ultimately held on to claim a career-best P2, while Verstappen's impressive afternoon ended with a P3 result.

The other Mercedes of George Russell was also under pressure from Piastri as the race headed towards its finish but managed to keep the McLaren at bay to take fourth, with Piastri having to settle for fifth on a day that perhaps could have brought more without his earlier penalty.

Race results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES GRANDE PRÊMIO DE SÃO PAULO 2025

A strong weekend for Ollie Bearman saw the Haas racer cross the line in sixth, while the Racing Bulls pair of Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar boosted their team's points tally in seventh and eighth respectively. An incident between the pair on the final lap was noted by the stewards, before it was decided that no further investigation was needed.

Nico Hulkenberg followed in ninth for Kick Sauber, and Pierre Gasly grabbed the final point on offer for Alpine in 10th. Just missing out was Alex Albon for Williams in 11th, who placed ahead of Haas' Esteban Ocon and the other Williams machine of Carlos Sainz.

Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll were well outside of the points in P14 and P16, with Alpine's Franco Colapinto sandwiched between them in P15. Yuki Tsunoda was the final driver classified on a tough day for the Red Bull driver, in which he received a second 10-second time penalty after failing to serve a first one correctly.

It was a nightmare Sunday for Ferrari at Interlagos, the team leaving with no points following a double DNF. Lewis Hamilton retired the car in the pits midway through the race, having picked up floor damage in a Lap 1 incident that also saw him take a 10-second time penalty.

Bortoleto, meanwhile, was out on the opening lap following his aforementioned crash, which came about following contact with Stroll.

After fans enjoyed a taste of racing action at Interlagos during Saturday's action-packed Sprint, it was time to go again on Sunday as the drivers and teams readied themselves for the 71-lap Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Saturday had also presented its fair share of drama via Qualifying, a session that saw Norris clinch pole position while fellow title contender Verstappen made a surprise exit in Q1, with the Dutchman complaining of “no grip” in his RB21.

In the wake of these struggles, it was confirmed in the hours prior to Sunday's race that Red Bull had opted to make sweeping changes to Verstappen's car which included fitting a new power unit and various elements that went beyond his allocation for the season.

As such – with these alterations made under parc ferme conditions – Verstappen would start the Grand Prix from the pit lane. Another driver to make changes beyond their allocation was Ocon, the Frenchman's Haas having taken on a new Internal Combustion Engine (ICE), which meant that he too would line up in the pit lane for the race start.

While mixed weather conditions had potentially been forecasted across the weekend at Interlagos, the track action on Friday and Saturday had taken place mostly in the dry. However, spots of rain had started to fall as the drivers made their way to the grid for Sunday's Grand Prix. Interlagos is no stranger to wet races – would another one be in store this time around?

When all 20 cars had lined up and the tyre blankets were removed – with that drizzle having eased off for the time being, though the risk of rain during the race remained at 40% – it was revealed that a range of compounds were at play, with seven drivers including polesitter Norris starting on the medium, eight on the soft and five on the hard, Verstappen amongst the latter.

After the formation lap had been completed and the five lights went out, Norris launched away well to hold the lead from Antonelli, while the other McLaren of Piastri was forced to defend hard from Hadjar through the first two corners.

There was drama further back, however, with Hamilton dropping down the order after being tagged by Sainz before later clipping the rear of Colapinto's Alpine, forcing him to limp back to the pits to have the damaged front wing changed. A long stop then ensued for the Briton, putting him to the back of the field amid lasting damage to the floor of his SF-25.

Elsewhere the yellow flags had been thrown due to Bortoleto hitting the barriers following contact with Stroll. The home favourite was out of the race, and a Safety Car was subsequently called as his stricken Kick Sauber was recovered. Elsewhere, Tsunoda took the opportunity to pit, swapping from the hard to the medium compound.

Five laps down, the Safety Car phase came to an end and Norris again made a clean restart. Leclerc, Antonelli and Piastri were three abreast into Turn 1 – but a lock-up from Piastri saw him hit the Mercedes, which then ricocheted into Leclerc's Ferrari. The Monegasque lost a tyre in the incident and the damage to his car was too great for him to continue, forcing him to pull off track.

This triggered a Virtual Safety Car, under which Verstappen – who had climbed up to P13 – pitted, bringing him back out in last place. The Dutchman was informed by race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase that this had been done due to a puncture on the car.

As the VSC ended on Lap 9, Piastri – now up to second ahead of Antonelli – was close to his team mate when the action resumed but not quite near enough to make a move. Behind those leading three cars, the rest of the top 10 had shaken out as Hadjar, Russell, Lawson, Bearman, Gasly, Albon and Sainz.

The stewards were being kept busy, having confirmed that Tsunoda would receive a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision with Stroll, while the Turn 1 incident between Piastri and Antonelli had also been noted.

Back out on track, Russell had overtaken Hadjar for fourth while Bearman surged past Lawson to move up into sixth. Further back, Verstappen was flying after bolting on the medium tyres during that aforementioned pit stop and soon picked off Hamilton and Colapinto to move up to 14th.

Sainz and Hamilton's Turn 1 incident had been noted by the stewards, as had Hamilton's later contact with Colapinto. The Ferrari man was not having the easiest time in the race, reporting that his car was “crazy unstable” before making another pit stop for the medium rubber.

Piastri's day had also gotten worse after it was confirmed that the Australian had received a 10-second time penalty for his collision with Antonelli. Running around 1.9s ahead of Antonelli, the McLaren driver would need to build a gap fast. Things were going better for Verstappen, meanwhile, who was making further moves to reach P9 by Lap 18.

Further pit stops were starting to take place soon afterwards, promoting the Dutchman up to sixth as Hadjar, Lawson and Gasly pitted. Up at the front, Norris was told that “Plan B” or possibly “Plan D” could be their preferred options, the Briton now leading by 4.5s from Piastri.

Antonelli headed to the pits on Lap 22, swapping the soft tyres for the medium as he dropped down to P11. Verstappen, meanwhile, was the fastest man on track in fourth place, the Red Bull driver running just under 20 seconds away from leader Norris.

There was trouble for the other RB21 of Tsunoda, who was noted for failing to serve his time penalty correctly. The stewards had also decided to hand Hamilton a five-second time penalty for causing a collision with Colapinto, adding to Ferrari's difficult day at Interlagos as the Briton continued to circulate in 17th.

Thirty laps down, Norris led by 6.7s from Piastri, who was followed by Russell, Verstappen, Antonelli, Albon, Hulkenberg, Bearman, Hadjar and Gasly, with several still yet to pit. That changed one tour later when Norris made his stop, emerging back on track in fourth place – behind Verstappen – with used soft tyres on.

With Verstappen's medium tyres some 25 laps old, the reigning World Champion did not put up much of a fight when Norris overtook for P3 on the main straight. Elsewhere, Hamilton pitted to serve his penalty, while Tsunoda had been hit with another 10-second penalty for failing to serve the earlier punishment correctly.

Verstappen dived into the pits again on Lap 35 to bolt on another set of medium tyres, bringing him back out in 12th, while Russell was now in sixth after stopping for the soft rubber. Piastri – still yet to pit – continued to lead up ahead with a nine-second margin over Norris, with Antonelli running in third.

By Lap 39 it was time for Piastri's stop, the Australian having to remain stationary for 10 seconds owing to that earlier penalty before the team could swap his medium tyres for the soft. Returning to the track in ninth, would that compound hold out until the end of the race?

Elsewhere in the pit lane, Ferrari's challenging day came to a close as Hamilton retired his car – marking a double DNF for the Scuderia on a day where they looked likely to lose significant ground to Mercedes, and even Red Bull, in the Teams' Championship.

Just as Piastri was told that the plan was to “catch and undercut” Bearman and Russell, Bearman then pitted – but a stubborn front left tyre resulted in a slow stop, bringing him out in P11. With 25 laps remaining, Norris led by 7.8s from Antonelli, followed by Russell, Verstappen, Piastri, Lawson, Ocon, Hulkenberg, Albon and Bearman, who had gained a position since his stop.

Mercedes opted to bring Antonelli and Russell in one lap apart for medium tyres, promoting Verstappen up into second between the McLarens. Bearman, meanwhile, was looking racy as he went side-by-side with Hulkenberg, the Haas man coming out ahead in seventh.

McLaren pitted Norris on Lap 51, a set of used medium tyres going on the Briton's car as he emerged in P2. Verstappen had moved up into the lead as a result – a situation that he remarked was “not bad” given his pit lane start – while Piastri made a stop for used mediums one tour later, bringing him out in seventh.

The race took another intriguing turn when Verstappen was brought into the pits on Lap 55 to bolt on a fresh set of soft tyres. Returning to the track in fourth place, the flying Red Bull set about chasing down Russell, Antonelli and Norris up ahead.

Behind, Piastri had made his way up to fifth after picking off Lawson and Bearman. As for Verstappen, the four-time World Champion was warned that his tyre compound was “vulnerable”, leading him to respond that there was “nothing to lose”.

With 12 laps to go, Norris continued to lead by six seconds from Antonelli, who in turn had a two-second margin over Russell. The latter – seemingly experiencing brake issues – was being caught by Verstappen, the Dutchman just 1.5s behind, while Piastri was four seconds adrift of the Red Bull in fifth.

As the race entered into its closing stages, a thrilling finale looked to be on the cards as Verstappen edged ever closer to Russell – before surging around the outside on the main straight to climb up into third.

Next in the Dutch driver's sights was Antonelli, though the Red Bull initially could not quite break into DRS range – until Lap 67, that is, which put him right on the rear of the Mercedes. Behind them, Russell was also being chased by Piastri and had also now closed to within DRS as the final two laps arrived.

A wide moment for Antonelli on the final tour allowed Verstappen to get even closer. While this was playing out, Norris crossed the line to seal victory with a 10-second lead – and Antonelli ultimately managed to hold on to claim P2, Verstappen following in P3 in a result that would perhaps have scarcely seemed believable when he lined up to start from the pit lane.

Russell also resisted the pressure from Piastri to take fourth, meaning that Mercedes – and Red Bull – have leapfrogged Ferrari in the Teams' Championship. Piastri, meanwhile, is now 24 points adrift of Norris in the Drivers' standings after taking fifth in Sao Paulo.

Bearman completed a good weekend to clinch P6, while Lawson and Hadjar followed in seventh and eighth for Racing Bulls. An incident between the pair was noted on the final lap, before the stewards deemed that no further investigation was necessary.

Hulkenberg and Gasly rounded out the top 10, followed by Albon, Ocon, Sainz, Alonso, Colapinto, Stroll and Tsunoda. Hamilton, Leclerc and Bortoleto, meanwhile, were the three unlucky drivers not to take the chequered flag.

""I was pushing!"" Norris said after his victory. ""It was an amazing race and it's nice to win here in Brazil. It's an amazing track, amazing fans. This one was for Gil [de Ferran], one of my mentors growing up a couple of years ago. This one was for him – I'm sure he'd be very proud about it all. I was thinking of that while driving. A perfect weekend.""

After a week off, F1 will kick off its final triple header of the season with the Las Vegas Grand Prix from November 20-22. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

Lando Norris consolidated his place at the top of the drivers' standings with a commanding win at Interlagos.

Lando Norris avoided a myriad of incidents to secure victory in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, beating Kimi Antonelli and a charging Max Verstappen to extend his lead in the championship battle.

The McLaren driver got a better launch than Antonelli both at lights out and on the Safety Car restart, which was prompted by Gabriel Bortoleto crashing out of his home race on the opening lap.

From then, Norris controlled the field well, even with a superb drive from Verstappen. Starting from the pit lane, and bouncing back from an early puncture, the Dutchman did everything right to surge to a podium finish and crossed the line just three-tenths behind Antonelli.

The most significant incident involved Oscar Piastri, Charles Leclerc and Antonelli as they went three-wide at Turn 1 at the Safety Car restart before the Australian locked up, sending the Mercedes into Leclerc's car. The Monegasque was forced to retire his Ferrari from the race and Piastri was handed a 10-second time penalty for causing a collision, contributing to his P5 result.

2025 Paulo Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

F1 Correspondent & Presenter Lawrence Barretto picks out his winners and losers from an entertaining Sao Paulo Grand Prix.

Lando Norris extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship with a ruthless performance in the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, but it wasn't so good for his rivals – including McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri. Lawrence Barretto selects his winners and losers from Interlagos.

The Sao Paulo Grand Prix weekend was close to perfection for Lando Norris, who led practice, took Sprint pole, won the Sprint, took Grand Prix pole and won the Grand Prix.

It was his second consecutive win from pole position and seventh Grand Prix victory of the season, tying Piastri's tally for the year.

Since his mechanical DNF in the Netherlands seven races ago, Norris has beaten Piastri in every single race weekend.

Having arrived at Interlagos leading the championship by just one point, Norris leaves 24 clear of Piastri with just three Grand Prix weekends to go.

This was another frustrating weekend for Piastri, who lost yet more ground to team mate Norris in the championship fight.

The Australian was unlucky to get caught out by a puddle in a kerb in the Sprint, which triggered his crash and that pain was compounded when he was handed a 10-second penalty for a collision with Kimi Antonelli when fighting for P2 in the Grand Prix.

He saw the chequered flag in fifth for the third Grand Prix on the bounce, extending his run without a podium to five – and trails Norris by 24 points, which is his biggest deficit all season.

Kimi Antonelli's race could have been over when contact with Piastri speared him into Ferrari's Charles Leclerc – but he survived to fight on and from there delivered the strongest race of his short career so far to take a best-ever second.

He absorbed the pressure from a very fast Max Verstappen in the final stages to secure a second successive P2 finish in as many days, following an impressive Sprint performance.

With team mate George Russell taking fourth place – and P3 in the Sprint – Mercedes went from one point behind Ferrari in the Teams' Championship to 36 points clear in P2.

While rivals Mercedes starred, Ferrari toiled in Interlagos, with the team suffering their third point-less Grand Prix weekend of the season.

Leclerc was a victim of the Piastri-Antonelli collision, the Monegasque retiring immediately after his Ferrari was struck.

Lewis Hamilton made contact with Franco Colapinto which broke his front wing and triggered a five-second time penalty before he later retired the car.

It was a painful weekend for a team that arrived in the country placed second in the Teams' Championship but left in fourth, with Red Bull also jumping them.

Max Verstappen will leave Brazil thinking what might have been despite a heroic drive from the pit lane to the podium, as he finished third in the Grand Prix.

The reigning four-time World Champion failed to progress beyond Q1 on pure pace for the first time in his career as Red Bull struggled to get the ideal set-up.

But following huge changes overnight, which triggered a pit lane start, Verstappen came alive in the race – and at one point looked like he might even win.

It was only the eighth time that a driver starting from the pit lane has made the podium – and the first since Hamilton achieved the feat in 2014.

The downside, of course, is that Verstappen now heads to Vegas further behind the Championship lead (he trails Norris by 49) – but there is no doubt he is driving at his peak.

This wasn't the home Grand Prix weekend that Gabriel Bortoleto would have hoped for.

The Brazilian had a huge crash at the end of the Sprint, and while he was unscathed, his car was so damaged his Kick Sauber team couldn't get it ready in time for Qualifying.

His Grand Prix didn't last very long either as a clash with Lance Stroll ended his participation with the race not even a lap old.

Ollie Bearman is going from strength to strength in Formula 1, with the Briton delivering another sensational drive to secure back-to-back top-six finishes.

The Haas driver delivered some superb overtakes and utilised the pace of his VF-25 to give the team their best-ever finish at Interlagos.

It moved him into P11 in the Drivers' Championship – while Haas are now just two points behind seventh-placed Aston in the Teams' Championship.

The weekend started so brightly when Aston Martin got two cars into the top eight in Sprint Qualifying, with Fernando Alonso converting the strong start to take sixth.

They couldn't carry that performance into Qualifying for the Grand Prix though, with both missing out on Q3.

In the Grand Prix, Alonso's decision to start on the hard tyre cost him, while Stroll was unlucky to be the victim of contact with Bortoleto and Yuki Tsunoda – and thus they ended up with nothing.

Racing Bulls had gone three race weekends without a point heading to Brazil, but they managed to covert their strong midfield pace at Interlagos.

Liam Lawson was a super seventh after a monster 52-lap stint on the mediums as part of a one-stopper, with Isack Hadjar taking eighth.

The double score pushes them 10 points clear of Aston Martin in the fight for P6 in the Teams' Championship, with Lawson and Hadjar's strong showing coming at the right time as Red Bull and Racing Bulls weigh up their respective 2026 driver line-ups.

In the words of Williams boss James Vowles, this was a ""race that had so much promise but did not deliver results"".

Carlos Sainz had an uncharacteristically off weekend, with the Spaniard's race essentially over at Turn 1 following contact that damaged his front wing and led to ""a significant loss in aero load"".

Alex Albon had pace, as he set the fastest lap, but Vowles admitted the team didn't ""get it all right"" with him – and thus he extended his run of point-less finishes in Grands Prix to five.

The Alpine has been a difficult and slow car to drive for much of this year, but the Enstone-based team showed a turn of pace in Brazil and Pierre Gasly brilliantly capitalised.

The Frenchman secured the team's first point in the last eight race weekends with P8 in the Sprint.

He then followed that up with a battling drive to 10th in the Grand Prix for another point.

While it didn't help move them off the bottom of the Teams' Championship, it was a great reward for the huge amount of work the team are putting in to try and compete.

2025 Paulo Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

Watch the action from the opening lap at Interlagos as Lando Norris sets his sights on a crucial victory.

Lando Norris fended off Kimi Antonelli to cling onto the lead of the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, as Gabriel Bortoleto crashed out of his home event later on in the opening lap.

The McLaren driver executed a better launch than Antonelli, leaving the Mercedes youngster under threat from Charles Leclerc, but the top three ultimately remained in the same order.

There was a close battle between Oscar Piastri and a charging Isack Hadjar, with the Australian narrowly holding onto fourth position while George Russell came close to losing a place to Pierre Gasly.

Elsewhere, there was heartbreak for Bortoleto who found the barrier during a tussle with the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll, forcing a Safety Car period to recover his damaged car.

Lewis Hamilton also had a less than ideal opening lap as he clipped the rear of Franco Colapinto's car and lost his front wing, sending him into the pits for a replacement.

2025 Paulo Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

After starting the race from the pit lane, Max Verstappen managed to recover to finish on the podium at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, a result that the Red Bull driver had not expected.

Max Verstappen was left to hail his “incredible” podium result at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, the Dutchman having climbed through the field from a pit lane start to secure third place at Interlagos.

Having made gains at the start, Verstappen dropped back down the order again after being forced to make an early pit stop due to picking up a puncture. From there, however, he embarked on an impressive recovery drive that saw him challenge Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli for P2 in the closing stages.

While he ultimately could not pass the Italian, Verstappen was still delighted to claim P3, an outcome that he conceded was not something he had expected a few hours earlier.

“I think the race was quite full on – a lot of action,” the four-time World Champion summarised afterwards. “I had to overtake some cars, of course, coming from the pit lane. I think our pace was quite strong over all the stints.

“Sometimes it's difficult to know fully with traffic and stuff, but to be on the podium from the pit lane… I didn't expect that at all, even with a puncture as well at the beginning of the race. That's why we had to box again.

“It's an incredible result for us so I'm very happy with that, and just very proud of everyone within the team as well. Yesterday was very tough for us, but we never give up. We always try to improve and try to find more lap time, and luckily we found that again today.”

A late pit stop for a set of fresh soft tyres helped Verstappen to go on the chase. When asked how he decided on the amount of risk to take following that stop, the Red Bull driver explained: “I was just trying to pass as fast as possible, because you don't want to lose too much time.

“Some cars were also in a DRS train so it's not always straightforward. With all that, to finish only 10 seconds from the lead, I think for us is incredible.”

Reflecting further on this later as he spoke to the media, Verstappen said of his team's approach: “We are all in this together and we never give up. We take risks, yes, but I like that, to always try and be better because we don't want to settle for second.”

While the result has taken Red Bull up to third place in the Teams' Championship – given Ferrari's double retirement from the race – Verstappen still added further to his own tally in the Drivers' standings, with his total now at 341 points.

Despite this, the 28-year-old – who is 49 points adrift of championship leader Lando Norris and 25 away from Oscar Piastri in second – is downplaying the prospect of fighting for the title.

“It's too many points to really have a proper chance at that, I think,” said Verstappen. “If you look of course at the whole season, we gave away too many points from the beginning until the middle of the season.

“I think for us now to the end is trying to just have these highlights, have good race weekends and see what we can do to the end. But yeah, a lot of things that I guess we also still want to analyse from the whole weekend, but at least the race was very promising.""

2025 Paulo Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

It was a tricky day for Oscar Piastri at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with the McLaren driver recovering to fifth after collecting a 10-second time penalty for an early collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.

Oscar Piastri has given his take on what proved to be a “tough afternoon” for him at the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, the Australian having to settle for fifth after a 10-second time penalty for an early collision impacted his race.

After an early Safety Car phase, Piastri – who had started from fourth on the grid – attempted a move on Kimi Antonelli for second place into Turn 1 at the restart, but a lock-up saw the McLaren hit the Mercedes, sending the latter into the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc.

This put Leclerc out of the running, while Piastri and Antonelli both continued on. However, a 10-second time penalty was subsequently handed to Piastri for the incident, which the 24-year-old went on to serve when he pitted on Lap 39 of 71.

While he worked his way forwards again after this dropped him back, Piastri made another pit stop in the latter stages before trying to chase down Mercedes' George Russell in a fight for fourth, but he ultimately could not catch the Briton.

Reflecting on his race – and his incident with Antonelli – Piastri said: “I got a really good Safety Car restart and went to the inside.

“I put myself up the inside pretty comfortably and there was obviously a bit of a lock-up, but I couldn't go any further left than I already was – I can't really just disappear. Then after that, not sure we made the right calls either, so a tough afternoon.”

Piastri's fellow McLaren racer Lando Norris took victory at Interlagos, allowing the championship leader to further extend his advantage over his team mate to 24 points.

Asked for his thoughts on the weekend in general – as well as the title fight situation ahead of the final triple header of races – the driver from Melbourne explained: “I think in terms of the championship there's no point thinking about it very much.

“There's clearly some things we need to sort out. Just a tough weekend from a number of fronts, so I'll focus on that instead.”

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

He may not have been the race victor, but he was a runaway winner with the fans...

What can you say? From a pit-lane start to P3 at the flag – and with a slow puncture along the way – it was a stunning drive from Max Verstappen, even by the Red Bull star's own incredible standards. A fifth consecutive drivers' crown may be a long shot, but the four-time champion's podium performance at Interlagos kept his title hopes alive. Here's how the voting broke down…

Max Verstappen - 56.7%
Kimi Antonelli - 10%
Lando Norris - 8.5%
Oliver Bearman - 6.2%
Oscar Piastri - 3.8%

DHL Fastest Pit Stop: 2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix

Mark Hughes dives into Red Bull's strategy calls, to see if they left anything on the table in Max Verstappen's pursuit of victory in Brazil.

On Lap 51 of the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, with 20 laps to go, Gianpiero Lambiase radioed his driver Max Verstappen: “Something I didn't think I'd say: you are the race leader.”

“Not bad,” replied Verstappen.

Not bad indeed considering that he had started from the pit lane after the team took the car out of parc ferme to change its set-up and install a new power unit, following a disastrous Qualifying in which he'd failed to make it out of Q1.

FAA “Effectively Prohibits” Private Jets at Major Airports Amid Government Shutdown","https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/private-jets-grounded-major-airports-government-shutdown-1236422585/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 13:21:18 GMT","

LAX, JFK and ATL are among the airports that have stopped accepting business jets as of Monday.


							By 

	Alex Weprin


Senior Editor


	The government shutdown has come for the preferred mode of transportation for media moguls and the celebrity class: private jets.


	While the Senate made moves late Sunday night to begin the process of ending the shutdown, which has now stretched beyond 40 days, staffing shortages among currently unpaid air traffic controllers have forced the FAA to place limits on flights so as not to overburden the airspace.




	Last week that meant initiating a 10 percent reduction in flights at airports across the country. As of Monday, that order now effectively shut down private jet travel at some of the most important airports in the country, according to the national Business Aviation Association (NBAA), a trade group that represents the private aircraft industry.

					Ex-BBC News CEO Responds to Trump Claims Over Edited Speech Controversy: ""Not Institutionally Biased""		
			









	“Last week, restrictions were announced on all aviation operations, including general aviation operations, at 40 U.S. airports,” NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen said in a statement. “Today, further restrictions were announced that will effectively prohibit business aviation operations at 12 of those airports, disproportionately impacting general aviation, an industry that creates more than a million jobs, generates $340 billion in economic impact and supports humanitarian flights every day.”

	The 12 impacted airports include a number of hubs for the entertainment industry, including Los Angeles International Airport (LAX); John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK); Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR); and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL); as well as major airports like Chicago O'Hare, Dallas Fort Worth, Boston Logan, Seattle Tacoma, Reagan National and others.

	











	Tha FAA said that exceptions could be made for “emergency, medical, law-enforcement, firefighting, military operations” or others, but don't bet on “I'm going to miss the start of principal photography” being one of them.


	For media moguls, tech titans, musicians, actors and other powerful people, private jets are the preferred mode of travel across the country, and eliminating their access to major airports could impact productions or other major events (the Latin Grammys are set to be held in Las Vegas this week, for example, though the Vegas airport is not impacted by the private jet ban, for now).


	Of course, private jet flyers may have other options: While JFK and Newark are off-limits, New York's LaGuardia is still available (despite the previously announced reduction in flights), as is Teterboro in New Jersey or Westchester airport north of the city.


	And while LAX will be PJ-free for a bit, Burbank, John Wayne airport and Long Beach airport can still handle the business jets, for now, though the NBAA warned its members that any of the other 40 FAA-identified airports could be restricted at any time. That extended list includes airports like LaGuardia and Teterboro.


	Still, the best hope for the Hollywood elite is that the shutdown ends sooner, rather than later. Otherwise they will have to fly (shudder) commercial on the way to their next film shoot.

Ryan Murphy's Hulu show has been derided as bad. It is, but it's also something far more significant: a whole other concept for a medium.


							By 

	Steven Zeitchik


Senior Editor, Technology and Politics


	One feature of modern AI systems is that the model does not actually reason. Unlike the older “symbolic” approach, in which humans hard-program a machine to run through a series of options, the current Large Language Models simply synthesize lots of information and predict based on likelihoods. So the model (by definition) cannot conjure up anything of literal substance; it can just regurgitate, sometimes coherently and sometimes nonsensically, based on material it doesn't understand. 


	An odd reference point, perhaps. But it came to mind when watching the first three episodes of All's Fair, Hulu‘s new dramatic soap from Ryan Murphy. By network report, at least, the show was written by humans, including Jon Robin Baitz, an excellent playwright who has spent parts of the past 20 years trying to find his footing in television. Yet the result is a regurgitation of fragments of images, of plot lines and dialogue, previously thought native only to automated text-predictors — an approach to creativity with the same lack of consciousness as an LLM.

	By now you know of the series, if only from the people warning you that you really don't want to know the series; “atrocity,” “brain dead” and “worst TV show of all time” have been the kinds of terms thrown around. These labels somehow are both too generous and an understatement of the true contribution — dare I say transformation — of the All's Fair moment. See, the Hulu series is not terrible on the scale of great to awful that television typically runs on. No, it does away with the entire spectrum — in fact, I would argue it overhauls the definition of television itself.

	










			Related Video		







	Through either a great act of artistic subversion or (more likely) just a great accident, All's Fair has entirely recalibrated what a series should try to do. When faced with the increasingly tough Hollywood question of how to make original TV in a world that has seemingly already unearthed every plot and drained the bag of every surprise, Murphy and his team have returned an unexpected answer: junk the medium's entire premise. In its place, they say, slide in a show whose defining characteristic is recycled emptiness. Thirty years after Seinfeld gave us a show about nothing (which was actually about friendship and frustrations and loneliness and insecurities), All's Fair has finally come along to make good on the promise. 


	By a show about nothing, I don't mean All's Fair represents a morally vacuous worldview; that would be reprehensible, but at least a perspective. No, I mean literally nothing. There is a universe in which champagne-clinking pronouncements like “from cocktails to cock rings all in one 24-hour period” mean something. But we don't live in that universe. We live in this one, and it doesn't.


	A Los Angeles-set series anchored by Kim Kardashian, All's Fair takes the form of a divorce-themed legal drama in which a set of inspirational girlboss slogans/insults get crossed with the images of an early 2000s perfume commercial. That sounds like a prompt more than a description, and it should; the show contains plotlines and dramatic arcs and character nuances no more than a ChatGPT response about a set of ingredients produces an actual pie. Surely in the history of people saying they didn't want to do something no one has ever put together a combination of words that read “I wouldn't do [it] even if I were penniless and starving on a street corner forced to blow a priest with a chlamydia for a bowl of refried beans.” But an LLM doesn't know that, and when tasked with such an assignment it might just rifle through its training data to arrange them in this way.

	











	This is a show which not only doesn't know but doesn't care whether it's supposed to be an aspirational portrayal of wealth or a satire of it — where a tired husband's “I'm drowning here with you” is met with “What are you talking about? You're famous. You have three Super Bowl rings,” and it's not clear to anyone, least of all the actors saying them, whether these lines are meant to be comedic.


	Meanwhile, consumerism, the reliable source of ersatz meaning (and the ultimate goal of LLMs), becomes the go-to in All's Fair's many scenes of gourmet-food-picking sister-bonding. Surely it can be no coincidence that when Kardashian's character (with the decidedly synthetic name of Allura) gets a life-crushing piece of news, this is the monologue that follows:


	“Living well is the best revenge, but on the path to living well, looking great matters too. … The other day I did this new miracle laser that makes the tiny microscopic holes in the skin that stimulates collagen. There's also the most wonderful new long-lasting filler formulated from salmon sperm. And then there is this new check machine that stimulates 20,000 super maximal muscle contractions; it's like doing 20,000 crunches or squats. But the best thing I did was vaginal PRP.” (You don't want to know.)


	No person, no matter how dermatologically inclined, would have that reaction to learning about a shattering tragedy. Ah, but that presumes this show is attempting to portray people, not serve as a vessel emptied of meaning. If that is the aim, odes to filler formulated from salmon-sperm is exactly how you would respond to your newly ruined life.

	











	In another era, the era of Rocky Horror Picture Show or The Room, we might expect All's Fair to be reappropriated and valorized as camp. But the beauty, or at least the fireproofing, of this era is that the cultural techno-machine has already done all that work, processing and reprocessing heightened nonsense so much that there is nothing left for a midnight audience to do.


	A temptation hovers to see all this as the logical downward endpoint of Ryan Murphy — that after the transgressive frisson of Nip/Tuck gave rise to the feelgood freshness of Glee which yielded the baroque heavyhandedness of American Horror Story that birthed the empty cosplay of American Crime Story, this marks the only place he could end up, in the commedia dell'arte of Kim Kardashian and her friends describing revenge in terms of chopped-up and force-fed ram scrotums. (Yeah, that's in the show too.)


	It would even be reasonable to find here an inexorable end to Kardashian herself, who, having increasingly turned from any sort of conventionally defined reality-star or social influencer into a meme — an abstract idea of what a public personality can be — now must evolve into the only state available to her: a simulation of a human character.


	But that would actually feel like too mild an ambition for what I think might really be happening here, which is an attempt, with the specter of the AI slop machine looming over Hollywood, to destroy the storytelling medium before a personalize-the-IP Sora can get its hand on the gun — a kind of pop-culture cyanide-pilling. When the history of 21st-century entertainment is written, I believe we will look at All's Fair as a watershed, the moment that television itself, as a place where new and coherent stories were for decades told, began to give way to something more meaning-free, more recycled, more nothing. As 6 7 gets named word of the year precisely due to its emptiness, and perpetrators of political violence toss out deliberately incoherent Internet memes, the small screen now enters the fray too, appropriating the nothingness and re-packaging it in its own bejeweled casing. With ratings so good, expect to see more like it. Broadcast created news-variety and basic cable created reality TV and streaming creating prestige TV and social media created outrage-opinion TV. AI will create tropal-emptiness TV trained on all of the above but adding up to, like All's Fair, much less than it.

	











	Murphy's show has an almost laughable number of executive producers (I counted 15, including Kris Jenner), which at first confounds; surely in a group this large someone knows how to produce a passable television show. But then an explanation snapped into place: the abundance of voices is exactly what leads to All's Fair anti-televisuality. Each producer cancels the other out, blender-like, just as a broad data set reduces an LLM's outputs to meaninglessness.


	I'm not certain if any of these 15 people or the cast (which also includes Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts, Teyana Taylor, Sarah Paulson and Glenn Close) understood their epically disruptive aim (attempts to reach one of the executive producers ended with a redirection to Murphy, who for now isn't talking). But there were hints at least of a subconscious understanding that what is being streamed here is not television in a classic sense. Because the cast has engaged with this empty memified world on-screen by extending the drama into a meme-land off of it. 


	First Close on Thursday posted a hand-drawn doodle in which critics are boiled in a stew while the cast gleefully stands around and watches (a legendary actress trying to Fatal Attraction journalists was not on this year's bingo card). The meme seemed to perfectly capture the dynamic on-screen too, the show's principals burning down the avatars of meaning in a pot of hot-water nothingness.


	And then Kim Kardashian offered an Instagram post that asked if followers “had tuned in to the most critically acclaimed show of the year?!?!?!?” and went on to cite the awful reviews in a way that recontextualized them as good. She, even more than Close, seemed in on the joke: “This whole idea of professionals producing television and a set of cultural gatekeepers evaluating it is now so meaningless we can pretend the evaluation is anything we want.” Algorithms are turning information into personalized bits, shaped into whatever we individually find most digestible, so why not grab a hammer and fragment the mass medium of television into subjective smithereens? I have no idea who the insult “I'm surprised your ancestors were actually allowed on the Mayflower but I guess that's one way to rid the place of half-wits, mouth-breathers and perverts” is supposed to roast. But more important, the show's creators don't either, and aren't particularly troubled by the question. It means whatever you want it to mean.

	











	There's something fitting about the author all of this. Who better than Ryan Murphy, who for so long embodied and powered a cable/streaming ethos with his prestige-flecked airplane reads, to come in and say that era is over? The new moment involves models, for now in human form but eventually, cost-effectively, run by the machines themselves. For years it's been a good creative run, filled with wonderful and long-lasting filler. But now it's time to let the salmon sperm take over.

The Oscar-nominated filmmaker gets frank about the success and controversy of her A24 rom-dramedy, including why she was eager to respond to those “broke man propaganda” claims — which swiftly went viral.


							By 

	David Canfield


Senior Entertainment Writer


Celine Song was waiting for it. The Oscar-nominated filmmaker was in London, a few months after her sophomore feature Materialists had bowed to critical and commercial success in the U.S. — and spurred dozens of thinkpieces about its depictions of modern dating, capitalism, and gender roles (okay, and leg-lengthening surgery). She'd noticed a pattern in reactions to her New York-set rom-dramedy's love triangle that surprised her: Viewers were sympathizing more with Harry (Pedro Pascal), a wealthy financier courting matchmaker Lucy (Dakota Johnson), than John (Chris Evans), Lucy's old flame still living with roommates while struggling to make it as an actor.

	“For most of the world in late capitalism, it's like, ‘No, the way that Harry lives, where it's about wealth accumulation, is actually the one that makes more sense,'” Song says. She wanted someone to let her know they had this perspective — because she wanted to respond, on the record. “The whole time I was like, ‘Just try me,'” she says now, grinning. “I'll tell you what I think.”




	In promoting the European release, she got her wish. One on-camera exchange between Song and a Refinery29 journalist, who asked Song to react to the cheeky claim that Materialists is “broke man propaganda,” went especially viral. “The thing that's very important to me is to stress that poverty is not the fault of the poor — and I think that given that, it is very brutal.” Song told the reporter. “I find it very cruel to talk about John as a character who loves Lucy, and who is a beautiful character being played beautifully by Chris — to talk about him in such cruel terms as ‘broke boy' or ‘broke man.'”

	











	I'm speaking with Song three months out from that quote. The Empire State Building hovers in the back of Song's Zoom window, capturing her favorite view from her apartment. Zohran Mamdani has just been elected mayor of her city, fueled by an inequality-focused campaign very relevant to the director and to her film's themes. And without prompting, Song brings up that “broke man propaganda” exchange for me in response to my question about her film's striking success, having grossed $108 million worldwide on a $20 million budget. To her, it says it all.  


	“I'm able to be fearless because I'm not full of shit,” she says. “That's how it feels to me, always. What am I afraid of? I know that I stand by every single thing that I make and every single thing that I believe in. I didn't make this movie for jokes.”


	In conversation, Song beams with assurance. She knows the movie she made, she knows why it resonated, and she knows what she wanted to say with it. The film is written to the anxious and, yes, materialistic beats of the here and now. “The way that the characters talk is actually pretty reflective of the way that we talk — maybe not even online, but just between our friends,” Song says. “It's like, ‘Well, how was your Tinder date?' Then they'll be like, ‘He's so short.' It's meant to feel quite exposing of the way that we have let the marketplace of the world seep into our hearts.” Song, her actors, and her crew were in constant dialogue about their own romantic lives, prioritizing a level of vulnerable, authentic experience to inform Materialists' complex modern spirit. 

	











	“The process of making it has to embody what the movie is,” Song says. “The making of it will reflect how it connects to the audience.” 


	Among rising filmmakers, Song, previously best known as an acclaimed playwright, is in rare company. Her debut movie, Past Lives, was the hit of 2023's Sundance and scored Oscar noms for best picture and screenplay. To follow that up with one of 2025's highest-grossing releases for original films, in a year where good box-office news has been increasingly hard to find? “There's been so much discussion right now in our world about how many things aren't working,” says producer Christine Vachon. “But I have a kid in her mid 20s and a lot of our employees are in their mid 20s. Being around people that age, you really got a sense that this was the kind of movie that was going to hit a bullseye with them.”


	While Song was heartened by the commercial response to Materialists, she says repeatedly in our conversation that “everything good comes with something bad” — another idea of the movie, and one she relates back to her own commercial success. “I don't like it when audience members know how the movie's doing,” she says. “The movie wasn't made so that it can make a certain rich group richer. The movie exists so the movie can be itself.” She connects this bag to the slogan for Mamdani's successful mayoral campaign: “Our city is not for sale.” 


	“Every inch of our attention is being eaten up, is completely being colonized by corporate interests — everybody's just trying to sell you something,” Song says. “So anytime a movie is interested in just being itself, I do think that it can sneak into people's hearts.” 

	











	***


	In a fiery speech at the Academy Women's Luncheon on Tuesday, Kristen Stewart lambasted Hollywood's treatment of female filmmakers, echoing new studies showing that following an immediate post-#MeToo bump, the industry is again simply not backing movies helmed by women. “The backsliding from our brief moment of progress is statistically devastating,” Stewart said. “Such a pitiful number of films from the past year have been made by women.” The Ankler's Richard Rushfield recently pointed out that only three 2025 studio movies were directed by women, while only one specialty film helmed by a woman cracked the top 100 at the box office: Materialists.


	“Whenever a film is directed by a woman or is female-forward in any way, its box-office success is always treated like, ‘Who saw that coming?'” Vachon tells me. “That's always so confounding because there's a history of those kinds of movies doing very well if they're executed as well as this one.”


	Song felt that dynamic in the lead-up to Materialists. “There is this severe underestimation that is very infuriating, but on the other hand, it's so easy to surprise people,” she says. “Everybody was so surprised by Materialists. I was like, ‘Why are you so surprised?'” Song felt in sync with the same backers who steered her Past Lives success. “We made the movie responsibly. We understood how to set it up for success,” says producer David Hinojosa. “Every domino was set up very carefully.” And Song felt steadfast support from A24, who gave the film a commercial summer release — unlike Past Lives, Materialists bypassed festivals — and didn't intervene with her vision. “A24 didn't underestimate the female audience,” she says. “They didn't underestimate romance.” 

	











	Sources close to A24 say that the movie has “redefined” its genre's expectations for the studio going forward, particularly given its massive showing overseas. It's a bright light for the studio in 2025 as other follow-ups from its homegrown filmmakers, like Ari Aster (Eddington) and Benny Safdie (The Smashing Machine), struggled to find traction relative to their budgets. Combined, their two movies have made less than half of Materialists' worldwide haul, and both cost more. 


	Song hopes there's a lesson for the industry in seeing that her movie worked. “It's a love story, but it's about being a modern woman. I know that there is an audience for that, that wants to feel seen in it and feel very connected,” she says. “It's not hard to believe that a movie like this makes this kind of money and cultural impact. It's so crazy because I don't know how many times it has to be proven for people to believe it on the next one.” 


	When Song first tried breaking into film, she was taken aback by “how deep this systematic misogyny” ran in the industry, having come from the (relatively) egalitarian theater world. “You start making movies like the boys, for the film bros, or you have to just accept that there is a part of it where you're going to constantly be underestimated and undercut,” she says. 


	So far, Song has consistently chosen the latter path. It's paying off. “Until the movie is actually out in the world, there's no way to know,” Song continues. “Now that it's out, I'm like, ‘No, actually I can ask the audience to be as openhearted as I am. That to me is the thing that guides me throughout all of it. The audience met Materialists with a total open heart. What I feel confident in is that, as long as I'm showing up, the audience is always going to be open-hearted. That's the north star of my work moving forward.”

	McRae shared a link to pre-save or pre-order So Close to What (The Deluxe Album). The release will be available on Spotify and Apple Music, and as a physical release on both CD ($11.98) and vinyl ($39.98) via her webstore.


	As of Sunday night the number of new tracks, and their titles, have not yet been revealed. Also as of Sunday, it's a wrap for McRae's Miss Possessive Tour, which kicked off in March and ended at the Kia Forum Inglewood, Calif., on Saturday; she shared a series of behind-the-scenes snapshots from the day.


	She most recently released the stand-alone single “Tit for Tat” — which was not on the So Close to What tracklist — in September, after teasing it on tour. The track, thought to be inspired by her breakup with follow pop hitmaker The Kid LAROI, became her third top five hit on the Hot 100. Her first two top five hits were “Greedy” in 2024 and “What I Want,” her collaboration with Morgan Wallen, which went to No. 1 earlier this year.

The teaser beat previous records held by Taylor Swift and Bob Marley films.

	Jessica Lynch



	The upcoming Michael Jackson biopic Michael has already made history — and it hasn't even hit cinemas yet.


	The teaser trailer for the Antoine Fuqua-directed film racked up more than 116.2 million views within its first 24 hours, making it the most-viewed music biopic trailer of all time and the largest trailer launch in Lionsgate history, according to analytics firm WaveMetrix. It now sits ahead of previous record holders including Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (96.1 million) and Bob Marley: One Love (60.1 million).


	Set to premiere in theaters on April 24, 2026, Michael stars Jaafar Jackson — the late King of Pop's nephew — in the lead role. The film promises to explore Michael Jackson's complex legacy through both iconic performances and personal moments.

	“I'm humbled and honored to bring my Uncle Michael's story to life,” Jaafar Jackson wrote on Instagram. “To all the fans all over the world, I'll see you soon.”


	Producer Graham King, who spearheaded 2018's Bohemian Rhapsody, said Jaafar was the clear choice for the role after an extensive casting process. “I met Jaafar over two years ago and was blown away by the way he organically personifies the spirit and personality of Michael,” King told Variety in 2023. 


	“It was something so powerful that even after conducting a worldwide search, it was clear that he is the only person to take on this role. I am beyond thrilled that he has come on board to portray his uncle and cannot wait for the world to see him on the big screen as Michael Jackson.”


	The singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, also told the publication, “Jaafar embodies my son. It's so wonderful to see him carry on the Jackson legacy of entertainers and performers.” 

	











	The cast also includes Colman Domingo, Nia Long, Laura Harrier, Miles Teller, and child actor Juliano Krue Valdi as young Michael.

					By Max Goldbart 

International TV Co-Editor


	The chair of the BBC has apologized for the Donald Trump editing scandal, which he put down to BBC News wanting its audience to “better understand” how Trump's January 6 2021 speech was being “received by his own supporters.” 


	In a highly-anticipated letter to the Culture, Media & Sport Committee (CMSC) this afternoon, Shah described the edit, which has led to the resignations of Director General Tim Davie and news boss Deborah Turness, as an “error of judgement,” which he said the BBC would like to apologize for.


	According to Shah, the edited clip was discussed twice at the now-infamous Editorial Guidelines and Standard Committee (EGCS) – once in January 2025 and once in May – at which point the committee expressed concerns but BBC News said the clip was edited “to convey the message of the speech made by President Trump so that Panorama's audience could better understand how it had been received by President Trump's supporters.”

	In the Panorama documentary, Trump appears to say: “We're gonna walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you and we fight. We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not gonna have a country anymore.” He actually said: “We're gonna walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're gonna walk down, we're gonna walk down any one you want but I think right here, we're gonna walk down to the Capitol and we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen.”




			Watch on Deadline		







	Since the publication of Prescott's memo, Shah said there have been more than 500 complaints about the Trump edit, which are “being dealt with in the normal way and has prompted further reflection by the BBC.” 

	











	“The conclusion of that deliberation is that we accept the way the speech was edited did give the impression of a direct call for violent action,” he added.


	In today's letter to CMSC chair Caroline Dinenage, Shah addressed other points made by Michael Prescott's excoriating report into what he believed to be insitutional bias within BBC News, while publishing Prescott's report in full. 


	Shah committed to the BBC Board revisiting all the items set out by Prescott and “taking further action where appropriate.” Internal reviews will be carried out where measures have already been put in place, he added, while any neccessary corrections will be made to online stories.


	Shah attempted to get a handle on other issues flagged by Prescott, including BBC Arabic's coverage of the Israel-Hamas War, which Prescott said showed an extreme bias against Israel. As Deadline revealed late last week, Shah said concerns with BBC Arabic had led to a restructure within the team, the appointment of a Head of Editorial and Quality Standards in the World Service and a new social media reseach unit. In the UK, the BBC has appointed a new Executive Editor of Editorial Quality and Standards and will soon hire a Director of News Documentaries and Long Form Journalism.


	While addressing Prescott's major gripes, Shah was forthright with his defence of the BBC's response over the past three years. “There is another view that has gained currency in the coverage that the BBC has done nothing to tackle these problems,” he said. “That is simply not true.” 


	He went on to list changes that had been made, including, in some cases, “disciplinary action.”


	“Mr Prescott's memo is his personal account of the meetings at which he was present,” added Shah. “It does not present a full picture of the discussions, decisions and actions that were taken.”


	Shah said he hopes that answering the CMSC's questions today would “put that right,” coming as he prepares to lead the process that will appoint a new Director General and head of news. 


	Dinenage had earlier said Davie's resignation was an “avoidable course of action” but he was “very slow to act on this particular issue.”


	Sources familiar with events told us last week that Turness had repeatedly made efforts to get the corporation to respond to Prescott's memo, alleging that Turness was blocked from doing so by Shah. A BBC spokesperson previously declined to comment on the internal matters.

Oh, so it's all the BBCs fault. Trump never encouraged the crowd to march on the capital. He was a force for good and peace that day. OK.

The sad thing is that he offers more than enough fodder for journalists to work from without breaking a sweat.  You don't need to edit or tweak or editorialize.  Just report it, please.

Then why are they constantly doing it? They keep getting caught, keep losing lawsuits, yet if there was so much ‘fodder' to work with, why wouldn't why do precisely that? 8 years of this credit-killing nonsense and people have the gaul to wonder why big media is dead. Because of EXACTLY this.

I don't care. Trump is a monster

Can't put integrity back in the bottle.

					By Melanie Goodfellow 

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: Back in August we unveiled a first clip for Oliver Assayas' drama The Wizard of the Kremlin starring Paul Dano and Jude Law ahead of its Venice debut and now we can reveal the full international trailer.


	Adapted by Assayas and award-winning screenwriter and novelist Emmanuel Carrère from the eponymous novel by Giuliano da Empoli, the film delves into the Byzantine politics of post-Soviet Russia and the rise to power of Vladimir Putin.


	Dano plays spin-doctor and advisor Vadim Baranov, a fictitious character loosely inspired by real-life Russian politician Vladislav Surkov, opposite Law as Putin, who first appears on screen as a cold-blooded KGB agent with a ruthless, power hungry streak.

	The new trailer also unveils Alicia Vikander as Baranov's beautiful wife Ksenia; Tom Sturridge as a banker and oligarch based on the real-life former oil and gas baron Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who found himself in jail after challenging Putin's grip on power; Will Keen as late oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who died in exile in London in suspicious circumstances and Jeffrey Wright as an American journalist in Moscow, in whom Dano's Baranov confides.


	Deadline critic Damon Wise, reviewing the film out of Venice, pointed to the timely nature of the work.


	“Though it is set almost entirely within the realpolitik of early 21st century Moscow, The Wizard of the Kremlin offers a warning to the West about how that state of affairs came to be,” he wrote.

	











	The film enjoyed a 12-minute ovation in Venice and has since played at Toronto, San Sebastian and London among other festivals and soon hits the MENA circuit with a screening at the Red Sea Film Festival in December.


The Wizard of the Kremlin is produced by Oliver Delbosc (Curiosa Films) and Sidonie Dumas (Gaumont) in coproduction with France 2 Cinéma with the participation of France Télévisions and Disney+. Gaumont is handling French distribution and international sales.

Kim Kardashian doesn't appear too upset over failing the California State Bar exam.

On Sunday, the reality star, 45, shared a carousel of photos that included her wearing a tiny studded bikini. The pics appear to be from her sister Kendall Jenner's lavish 30th birthday celebration, as one pic showed off a stunning resort and balloons that read “Happy Birthday, Kendall.”

Jenner's birthday was on Nov. 3 and the model celebrated with a star-studded, private beach bash that included her mom, Kris Jenner, and sisters Kim, Khloé Kardashian and Kylie Jenner.

In less celebratory news, on Saturday, the Skims founder shared that she had failed the bar exam.

“Well… I'm not a lawyer yet,” she wrote via Instagram Stories, adding, “I just play a very well-dressed one on TV.”

“Six years into this law journey, and I'm still all in until I pass the bar,” the “All's Fair” star continued. “No shortcuts, no giving up — just more studying and even more determination.”

“Falling short isn't a failure — It's fuel. I was so close to passing the exam and that only motivates me even more. Let's Go!!!!!,” she concluded.

The reality star first announced her desire to become a lawyer in a 2019 interview with Vogue magazine. She failed the baby bar exam three times before passing it in December 2021.

Kim obtained her law degree in May 2025.

The mother of four hasn't let her recent setback get her down, attending her mom Kris' blowout 70th birthday bash on Saturday night held at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion.

The party, which drew a slew of A-list celebrities including Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Oprah Winfrey, Paris Hilton, Chris Rock, Sarah Paulson and all of Kim's siblings, had a James Bond 007 theme.

Kim channeled one of Halle Berry's iconic “Die Another Day” looks for the fete, dazzling in a sexy purple ensemble.

Driver, roll up the partition, please.

Beyoncé and her husband, Jay-Z, avoided the paparazzi and snuck into Kris Jenner's star-studded 70th birthday party on Saturday night.

Multiple sources told TMZ that the “Drunk In Love” collaborators were not photographed arriving at the momager's 007-themed event, held at Jeff Bezos and wife Lauren Sánchez's $175 million Beverly Hills, Calif., mansion, because the pair received top-tier parking.

Beyoncé and Jay-Z, born Shawn Carter, reportedly pulled directly onto the estate and were able to exit their vehicle without being publicly seen.

While photographers didn't get a photo of the longtime couple arriving at the estate, they did get one of the “99 Problems” emcee leaving.

In the snap, Jay-Z kept a stern face as he sat in the back of an all-black SUV. Though you couldn't see his full outfit, it appeared the Grammy-winning emcee was wearing a black suit.

We also reported that the starry bash was thrown by Kris' six children: Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Rob Kardashian, Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner.

Throughout the night, cops were called to Bezos and Sánchez's multimillion-dollar estate over noise complaints.

Kris Jenner rang in her 70th birthday with an epic bash, hosted at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's Beverly Hills home.

The party was “James Bond” themed, with guests wearing perfectly tailored tuxedos and Bond girl-ready gowns.

Dressed in vintage Givenchy Haute Couture, the momager channeled the very first on-screen glamour girl herself: Eunice Gayson.

As her character, Sylvia Trench, in 1962's “Dr. No,” Grayson donned a full-skirted red tulle gown to kick off the legendary spy movies that would continue to break box office records for the next 75 years and counting.

Jenner's Old Hollywood glamour, which featured a tiered strapless lace silhouette and black opera gloves, was an elegant tribute to the one who started it all.

Her dress was a vintage Givenchy Haute Couture design, created by Julien Macdonald for the fall 2002 Couture collection. She also wore a vintage 1960s Bulgari diamond bracelet sourced from Joseph Saidian & Sons.

The Jenner-Kardashian family has had some epic Givenchy archive moments lately. Just a few weeks ago, Kim stepped out in Paris to celebrate her 45th birthday in a goddess-inspired Givenchy Haute Couture look from 1997.

Last May, Kendall Jenner attended the 2024 Met Gala in a never-before-worn Givenchy Haute Couture look from the French brand's 1999 collection. 

From Kylie's revealing swimwear-inspired look to Kendall's skin-tight satin gown, tributes to Bond girls through the ages were all over the headline-making birthday celebration this past weekend.

Guests included the tech billionaire and his wife, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, as well as Beyoncé and Jay-Z, who entered the party undetected by avoiding cameras.

While several A-listers were captured by paparazzi as they rolled up to the event — including Prince Harry and Meghan Markle — Kris posted new photos with her friends from inside the opulent bash. 

“Magical night celebrating my 70th birthday with beautiful family and friends,” Kris captioned a slideshow of images from her party in an Instagram post shared Sunday.

The birthday girl was seen wearing a red Givenchy Haute Couture gown by Alexander McQueen while posing with her pals, including Mark Zuckerberg and the Facebook founder's wife, Priscilla Chan.

In another snap, Kris held an espresso martini while she and Kathy Hilton blew kisses at each other.

Kris was also spotted clinking cocktail glasses with Mariah Carey and smiling for a photo with Melanie Griffith at one point.

The family matriarch was spotted schmoozing with besties Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King.

Kris channeled the evening's “007” theme by holding a small handgun as she posed for a fun photo with her longtime partner, Corey Gamble, who smiled with a cigar in his mouth.

She and her daughter, Kylie, were also seen laughing with Tyler Perry and Carey.

The party was held in what appeared to be a massive tent draped in moody red fabric. There were extravagant red floral arrangements lining every corner.

There were also beautiful crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and several tables were draped with red velvet tablecloths topped with fun Kris-themed poker chips and lighters.

Attendees, dressed to the nines in black-tie attire, entered the soirée through a long red entryway with a red carpet.

Other notables seen in Kris' interior snaps included Meghan Trainor, Paris Hilton, Ciara, Tommy Hilfiger, and Vanessa Bryant.

Bruno Mars performed with a full band on stage as guests hit the dance floor for a night of moving and grooving.

As Page Six previously reported, police were called to Bezos' multimillion-dollar estate due to noise complaints during the “Treasure” singer's set. 

Fortunately, no arrests were made and cops only issued a warning.

Chris Cornell's daughter Toni, 21, wowed music fans with her emotional rendition of Soundgarden's “Fell on Black Days” to honor her late father at the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.

“Beautiful tribute to her Dad,” wrote one fan on Instagram. “Her voice is amazing. It holds the same emotional power as her Dad. 🙌🙌🙌.”

“Lovely tribute to her father. Well done. I hear him in her voice,” noted another, while another praised the singer: “You did your dad proud. Just beautiful, Toni. 🙌❤️.”

Soundgarden was one of the inductees to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame on Saturday.

Cornell was the lead singer of the influential grunge band.

He died by suicide in 2017. He was 52 years old.

Following his death, Toni, then 12, wrote a heartbreaking letter to her father that was shared on Facebook.

“Daddy, Let me start by saying how much I love you and how much you mean to me,” she wrote. “You are my idol, someone I've always looked up to. You were always there for me. You pushed me forward every day, and you still do.”

“Whenever I cry or feel like there's no way I can go on, I hear your voice, ‘Don't sit worrying peanut. Worry is a waste of time, I'm ok,'” it read in part.

Over the years, Toni has performed in public, honoring the late singer.

In 2017, she performed a tribute to her dad and his friend Chester Bennington by singing “Hallelujah” with Ryan Tedder and OneRepublic on “Good Morning America.”

The following year, she released a recording of a duet with her father singing the Prince song “Nothing Compares 2 U” on Father's Day.

“You gave me courage when I didn't have any. You believed in me when I didn't. I miss your love everyday,” Toni wrote in posts that accompanied the song on Instagram and YouTube. “Recording this song with you was a special and amazing experience I wish I could repeat 100 times over and I know you would too.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Why isn't IT from IT: Welcome To Derry actually scary?","https://www.avclub.com/it-welcome-to-derry-recap-season-1-episode-3-now-you-see-it","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 04:00:00 GMT","

We need to talk about IT. Not just IT: Welcome To Derry, which rolls out a bland-with-some-high-notes third episode, “Now You See It,” this week. But IT the creature, “the target,” the Deadlights, Pennywise The Dancing Clown, Bob Gray, whatever nom de horror you want to call it. And specifically, we need to talk about whether the fact that Welcome To Derry's version of the creature seems to struggle mightily with being genuinely scary when the chips are down counts as a feature or a bug.

There is, after all, meant to be something mildly pathetic about IT. Both Stephen King's original novel and its various adaptations emphasize that there is a reason, beyond simple taste, that the creature preys almost exclusively on children: Trapped in powerlessness, and at the mercy of both adult cruelty and their own imaginations, youngfolk are easy prey for a creature that's often bizarrely unsophisticated in its predations. Series creator Andy Muschietti is certainly keyed into what a paper tiger his core subject is, ending his duology of films with the boogeyman being reduced to a pathetic, baby-esque state, having been defeated, basically, because it tried to pull its usual haunted-house bullshit on a bunch of grown-ass adults. Which is an interesting, nuanced take on a horror antagonist—but one that frequently leaves a TV series reliant on the creature for its big set-piece scares feeling more camp than catastrophic. 

It's not like Welcome To Derry can't still be scary, after all: Our cold open tonight, which follows a young man exploring a fair sideshow in 1908, packs a pleasantly frightening punch, successfully channeling the chaos and allure of this kind of liminal space. Surrounded by sounds of playful violence—thrown baseballs, hurled knives, the pounding footfalls of a carnival barker who successfully zeroes in on his next mark—we watch young Francis Shaw be pulled in by the delicious paradox of horror: You don't want to see it. But at the same time, you've got to see it. The sequence flirts with the idea that IT might be at work here—it's to Welcome To Derry's benefit that any scene of surreality has that threat looming over its head—but is more effective for the creature's absence. This isn't manufactured horror, as Francis is lured, unable to stop his own feet from shuffling forward, toward the “Skeleton Man” who lurks at the back of the freak show. This is the genuine, awful, gleeful stuff, the grisly building blocks from which nightmares and traumas are built.

Compare that with IT's actual first appearance in “Now You See It,” which pops up in that same cold open, after the Shaw family car breaks down conveniently close to some Native kids selling water. A weird cut shows Francis befriending and playing with one of the group's girls, only to run into a bit of the woods that the locals know to avoid. And, suddenly, we're stuck in another game of lackluster supernatural peek-a-boo, as the creature begins stalking the young boy with the only tools IT seems to actually have at its disposal: quick camera cuts and big, gnarly teeth. Yes, there's something kind of interesting in the idea that the creature pulled the Skeleton Man out of Francis' head as a symbol of something that scared the shit out of him. But it's certainly not scary, and it raises questions about how well this version of the creature, all gore and spectacle and teeth in your face, can be used for anything like actual terror.

If I seem fixated on this point, well, it's partially because IT being scary feels pretty important to an IT TV show. But it's also because there isn't a ton else that happens in “Now You See It,” which steadily moves forward the pieces on each of the show's (still entirely disconnected) plots. In Kid World, a new proto-Losers Club gets formed as Ronnie and Lilly bury the, um, hatchet over Lilly implicating Ronnie's dad in the theater deaths and then recruit Will and his new buddy Rich to try to get a photograph of the creature stalking them. This culminates in a sequence in a graveyard that feels like it could have been pulled straight from some 2000s-era Disney Channel Halloween film, with the kids playing hot potato with their camera while being stalked on bikes by the unconvincingly floating spectral forms of some of their murdered friends. The whole thing looks incredibly cheesy, while attempts to make the audience think young Will might have gotten got right at the end of this section are undercut by the fact that there's no way Welcome To Derry will pull the “establish a kid hero then abruptly kill them” twist twice. The need to deploy the creature a couple of times per episode to meet the spook quota really isn't doing our boy Pennywise any favors here; the actual effect is to only underline how outmatched IT seems against bike-riding schoolchildren when it's actually going in for the kill.

Meanwhile, over in Operation: Murder Clowns To Beat The Russkies, we get some backstory, as well as most of the episode's best scenes. It turns out that that scared little boy in the cold open grew up to be James Remar, and the girl was local antiques dealer Rose (Kimberly Norris Guerrero). (The episode literally fades between the child and adult performers twice, as a kindness to the terminally inattentive in the audience.) Despite some lingering flickers of puppy love, the duo find themselves on opposite sides of a brewing conflict, since she and her community would desperately like the military to stop prodding at the child-eating alien in their backyard, while Shaw remains convinced that a spooky shapeshifter will somehow be the ultimately weapon to win the Cold War.

Stuck in the middle of it all are Mike Hanlon (Jovan Adepo) and the episode's standout MVP, Chris Chalk's Dick Hallorann. If nothing else, “Now You See It” is a great showcase for Chalk, whose Hallorann moves through the world with a mix of ease and guardedness that makes him seem like the only guy in Derry who knows exactly how bad an idea General Shaw's big plans for peace in our time might be. And this feels especially true after an airborne scouting trip (with Hanlon and his buddy Pauly as pilots) doesn't do much to find where the creature is actually lurking…but does clue IT in that someone is looking for it, while also giving Hallorann a near-death experience (and our first non-credits glimpse of Pennywise proper in the series) in the process.

I'll confess to a certain amount of affection for this objectively ridiculous “let's try to militarize the shapeshifting clown alien” plot, which lands in an enjoyable goofy place for me, buoyed by how firmly both Remar and Chalk commit to what they're doing. (The military has, among other things, noticed the 27-year cycle thing, categorizing different sets of incidents as clearly being caused by IT's effects on the people of Derry.) It helps that Welcome To Derry seems to simply do better when it's focused in on its adult cast: Observe the sequence where police chief Clint Bowers slowly turns the screws on Hank Grogan, for instance, and most especially the post-mission segment where Hanlon has Halloran over to his house for dinner. 

That dinner-table conversation is a fascinating three-way game between Chalk, Adepo, and Taylour Paige, as the episode steadily tracks what both is, and is not, left unsaid between these three adults. (This is part of what often turns me off about the kid scenes, now that I think about it: True to life or not, Welcome To Derry's scripts seems to think children broadcast every thought and feeling in their heads, while watching these three not say things is some of the most riveting TV of the hour.) The wry, world-weary irony with which Chalk plays Hallorann gives contrast to both Hanlons in fascinating ways, creating both bonds and tensions between them. The vibes only get more interesting when Mike confronts Hallorann in private about him both Shining around in his head and being one of the gas-mask dudes from the attack from “The Pilot.” Chalk gets the line of the episode when he reassures Hanlon that, having witnessed how ice-cold calm the man's brain is with a gun in his face, “You are not the kind of fella I am likely to fuck with, Major.” 

Which is all to say that, three episodes in, Welcome To Derry remains a well-acted, interestingly plotted drama for adults that only grudgingly seems to share time with a much-less accomplished children's horror show. I dearly want these two sides of the series' brain to be in fuller conversation with each other, for the horror to bleed into the adult world, and for more psychological nuance to pop up among its kids. (And for both, I want the monstrous vortex at the center of this whole thing to be capable of generating actual frights.) For now, though, it remains a show where you pick and choose a few high spots amid a buffet of far more prosaic fare.

Upon the group's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last night, Jack White didn't forget the other 50% of the White Stripes. After being introduced by “Uncle Iggy” Pop, Jack White shared some rare public remarks from his former drummer, Meg White, who hasn't been seen publicly in more than a decade. “I spoke with Meg White the other day,” he said, “she's very grateful to all the folks who supported her through all the years. It really means a lot to her.” But she isn't just a great drummer. Meg's also apparently a great editor. “She also helped me write all this,” he continued. “I sent these things to her. She checked it for me for a lot of punctuation and corrections. She's pretty good at that.”

More surprisingly, Jack White delivered the first words from Meg White since the last episode of The Late Show With Conan O'Brien in 2009—if we don't count the brief period in which the band reunited to sue Trump. Jack continues, “She said, ‘Do you remember, Jack? We used to walk around and animals, for some reason, would stare at us. They would stop and stare at us for some reason. Even at the Detroit Zoo, an elephant did the exact same thing one time.' She just wanted me to tell you that.”

In addition to the delightful zoo story, Jack White also penned (with edits from Meg, we presume) a letter he intended to send to her, but instead read it to the ceremony attendees and those watching at home.

“One time, a girl climbed a tree, and in that tree was a boy—her brother, she thought. And the tree looked so glorious and beautiful, but it was just an oak tree,” White read. “And these two so loved the world that they brought forth a parade float—one they built in their garage behind the oak tree with their own bare hands. And the boy looked at this giant peppermint on wheels and felt pride, pride that it was produced in the Motor City, just like in the big factories, but it was just in their garage. He looked at the girl—his sister, he thought. And, like the Little Rascals, they said, ‘Let's put on a show.'”

“And they paraded this float through the Cass Corridor, standing atop the peppermint pulled by white horses, or maybe it was a red Econoline van. Many of the blocks they traveled were empty, but some had people. And some of those people cheered, some laughed, and some even threw stones. And with their bare hands, the two started to clap and sing and make up songs.”



The White Stripes disbanded in 2011, and Meg left the public eye shortly after. In 2023, as part of the internet's unending debate over Meg's drumming, Jack posted a poem calling out the “demons, cowards, and vampires out for blood” who don't know anything about drumming. That year, Meg declined a request for an interview from Elle, saying she had said “no” to so many requests that it wouldn't be fair to say “yes” now.

Other 2025 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees included Outkast, Cyndi Lauper, Soundgarden, Bad Company, Chubby Checker, and Joe Cocker for the performance category; Salt-N-Pepa and Warren Zevon, recipients of the Musical Influence Award; Thom Bell, Nicky Hopkins, and Carol Kaye, recipients of the Musical Excellence Award; and Lenny Waronker, recipient of the Ahmet Ertegun Award.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","Influencers try to out-crazy each other in I Love LA","https://www.avclub.com/i-love-la-recap-season-1-episode-2-roger-and-munchy","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 05:01:00 GMT","

If your idea of Los Angeles includes an endless parade of vapid, self-centered, superficial twentysomethings whose ambitions no doubt outweigh their talents, I Love LA is ready to prove that parodic vision of the city correct. Creator and star Rachel Sennott is clearly having some fun offering up these caricatures of Gen Z Angelenos (or rather, recent transplants who live in L.A.) and putting them through outrageous and wholly unrelatable situations—like, as in the start of episode two, when a quick coffee chat about how best to make an NYC It Girl into a full-blown Middle-America-courting leisureware influencer gets derailed by a fight over a stolen Balenciaga bag.  

Yes, Maia (Sennott) may have made up with Tallulah (Odessa A'zion) and taken the reins as her manager again, but that is clearly not going to be an easy thing to navigate. Not when Tallulah's New York City life comes at her fast in the shape of Paulena (Annalisa Cochrane), a disgruntled fellow influencer who cannot believe her L.A. vacation is upended once she sees Tallulah sporting the Balenciaga bag she'd stolen from her. Yes, there is cussing (“Go fuck yourself!”) Yes, there is screaming. (“I will! With your boyfriend's cock!”) And, yes, that is only the beginning of this entire Tallulah/Paulena ordeal. It's not great for day one of being Tallulah's manager.

Then again, it's obvious Maia is going to struggle keeping her friendship with Tallulah separate from their work relationship. Which, y'know? Relatable. Who among us, after all, hasn't had to screen texts from a client we're managing about how worried they are about possibly having an arrest warrant jeopardize their burgeoning work opportunities in Los Angeles? Wait, never mind. But that is precisely what Maia has to deal with now as she worries Paulena will press charges and tank her friend/client's career before it's even taken off.

Then again, both Charlie (Jordan Firstman) and Alani (True Whitaker) are dealing with their own L.A.-specific work problems, which are equally as ridiculous. Charlie, a stylist (of course), is doing that thing where he's trying to impress his client, music star Mimi (Ayo Edebiri, with a posh British accent) and can only do so by being a feckless yes man. When he hears, for instance, that Mimi wants Zendaya to play her mom in a music video he's like, “Oh, like in flashbacks?” only to be shut down. Obviously not. “I think you have a brain for clothes and like being gay,” Mimi tells him. “Gay. Clothes. End of person,” he says back. And sure, the Euphoria star may not have confirmed yet but that's probably, Charlie says, because she's notoriously difficult to nail down. He's clearly just saying whatever he thinks Mimi wants to hear but that just means he spends his time later at the gym with his trainer trying to grill Maia over the phone for Zendaya dirt. (Spoiler alert: there is none.) Will that come back and bite him? 

Meanwhile, Alani ends up spending her afternoon at her father's production office (where she'd had a pair of new boots delivered), crashing a meeting (while looking for a foot mirror) and being treated like the precious nepo baby that she is. Namely, while everyone at the company knows her title of “VP Of Creative Projects” is wholly decorative, they can't well keep her from chiming in as they try to brainstorm what a Gen Z Clueless-esque project might look like. 

Is Alani perfectly, uh, clueless about how much unearned privilege she wields in this office and not quite realizing how her own high-school stories (about dating a 28 year old while in eighth grade who was always exhausted because of his newborn) may not be a good fit for the kind of show these execs are working on? Possibly. But there's a kind of wide-eyed endearing aspect to that sense of entitlement, which Whitaker plays quite well. (It's also a nice contrast to Charlie and Maia, who have to work so hard to even be in spaces Alani can just breeze herself into.)

As Maia keeps finding out, there are other people (like, say, Tallulah) who don't quite breeze into spaces like Alani as much as they crash into them like walking and talking tornadoes. It's no wonder she's been leaving quite a mess behind her, a mess that now Maia is tasked with cleaning up. (Per her father, a lawyer, Paulena could sue and send out an arrest warrant, but technically Tallulah could still work if she's not extradited…words no manager ever wants to have to factor into their day-to-day job.)

Thankfully, ever resourceful Tallulah has come up with a solution: She's lied to Paulena (who, if you must know, designs charm necklaces that are as kitschy as they sound) and told her she was hooked on Ketamine back in her New York City days, which explains her odd clepto behavior. She's sober now, she told her, and what better way to bury it all than to have dinner at Maia and Dylan's? 

This is a peak sitcom A-plot—only, of course, you've never seen a dinner party gone wrong quite like this one. For starters, Tallulah was already trying both Maia and Dylan's patience (turns out she loves having phone sex in their bedroom with a guy named Ludwig who needs to come three times for it to count), so the idea of hosting a litigious/vengeful necklace designer for dinner on short notice sounds like a nightmare. Which it is, because Paulena is the kind of “girl's girl” who is all too happy to leverage dirt on anyone to get her way. She's also not above being vindictive. Why else would she bring coke to a dinner where she knows (even if it's a lie) that one of the guests is sober only to then pressure the one teacher in the group (that'd be Dylan) to keep partying lest she decides to talk to his principal and tell him all about his drug habits? In a word, she's trouble. She's someone who may well know she's not liked but uses blackmail to get her way, all while thinking she's simply being just and kind. She might be a sociopath, actually.

It's what leads Maia to do the one thing she and her munchie (Tallulah) have long learned works when faced with such crazy: You gotta outcrazy them. And boy, does she go crazy, accusing Dylan of eyeing Paulena's breasts, of enjoying walking in on Tallulah having phone sex, and even of watching porn. (How dare he!) By the time she grabs a knife and threatens to kill herself (which, wow, that would be bad for Paulena considering it was her coke that would get her killed), Paulena understands it's best she leave ASAP. Phew. Crisis averted, even if Maia almost gave Dylan a heart attack while doing so.

Oh, were you wondering how Charlie fared with his whole “I need to come up with dirt on Zendaya so Mimi still trusts me to style her and I can keep randomly ordering clothes on her account that I then keep” strategy? It blew up in his face, of course. For the Euphoria star did agree to star in the music video and word got back to Mimi that her stylist was trying to ruin her bestie's reputation. She couldn't well have that stay, and so, while out celebrating the music-video news, she fires Charlie and gets him to return the clothes he's wearing, leaving him naked in Eagle Rock texting his friend with benefits who may enjoy his romps with Charlie but is, at that very moment, having a lovely time on a date with a boring-looking man at Din Tai Fung. It's humiliating all around, no? 

But wait, that's not all. Before hopping on her ride, Paulena has a change of heart. Maybe she should make a poor person's dreams come true and leave them her Balenciaga bag…except, when she tries to do so stealthily outside the door to Maia's apartment, she hears how the craziness she witnessed was just a ruse. (They're all too happy to never have to see her and her ugly necklaces ever again.) And that's enough to kick her own crazy back up: As she's being driven away, she records a video to her followers about—wouldn't you have guessed it—a girl she has to talk about. “So strap in.” This won't end well.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","South Park planned on Trump being a one-off until discovering the rich ""vein"" of mocking him","https://www.avclub.com/south-park-matt-stone-trey-parker-trump-interview","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 00:54:00 GMT","

South Park has rarely been hotter than it is right now. In the past year, it's made creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker billionaires, enjoyed its best ratings in years, and sent shockwaves through the corridors of power that may or may not have caused the East Wing to collapse. Who would've thought that mocking a deeply unpopular, relentlessly sleepy, poop-obsessed president would've been the key to it? Not Stone or Parker. In a new interview with The New York Times, they claim that, initially, Trump jokes were going to be a one-off, then they discovered the rich “vein of comedy” they've been following all season. While they could attribute the recent resurgence of popularity to mocking Trump, though, they argue that the show really hasn't changed. “It's not that we got all political,” Parker said. “It's that politics became pop culture.”

Of course, for years, the show had been wrestling with something only the brain trust on Twitter feels threatened by: “Woke.” Yeah, before landing on such bits as “Donald Trump has a little penis,” the South Park guys spoke truth to power by going after the “extremists” who think slurs are dehumanizing. “Any extremists of any kind we make fun of,” Parker said. “We did it for years with the woke thing. That was hilarious to us. And this is hilarious to us.” Parker describes himself and his partner as “down-the-middle guys” provoked by “any extremists,” whether that be a president ordering masked federal agents to kidnap people off the street, or someone arguing that using slurs can lead to a president who orders masked agents to kidnap people off the streets. But the White House can blame its old bugaboo “government overreach” for the pivot to Trump—that and podcasters.

“It's like the government is just in your face everywhere you look,” Parker said. “Whether it's the actual government or whether it is all the podcasters and the TikToks and the YouTubes and all of that, and it's just all political and political because it's more than political. It's pop culture.” He certainly isn't wrong about that. Amid the government shutdown, his attempt to block SNAP benefits, and 1,100 canceled flights, Trump jumped into the Fox broadcasting booth during the Commanders-Lions game. Thankfully, Parker and Stone's bosses don't seem to mind their target. Despite Paramount Skydance's frequent overtures to the Trump administration, the South Park guys maintain that “they're letting us do whatever we want, to their credit.” The second that changes, we'll know.

Call it the understatement of the year, but there's something interesting happening with The Chair Company. That's easy to say after an episode like “I Won. Zoom In,” in which nearly every door Ron opens reveals some new surrealist nightmare. But I also mean it from a behind-the-scenes standpoint: The way this show is put together is unlike any other I can think of in recent memory. 

The increasingly strange digressions and knee-slapping non sequiturs The Chair Company rolls out this week obviously have analogues in Tim Robinson and Zach Kanin's previous half-hour show, Detroiters. I feel like you can also trace their lineage through 30 Rock, The Other Two, and any number of live-action Adult Swim series. However, none of those shows spliced their sketch comedy-like rhythms into a dense, knotty story with the still-relevant hallmarks of a paranoid 1970s thriller that's also a character study about obsession and isolation. That's a level of ambition that The Chair Company—and “I Won. Zoom In.” especially—can exclusively claim as its own. 

All of which is to say this fifth episode is the best marriage of the show's sitcom-with-sketch-comedy-DNA sensibilities to date. Readymade sketch premises like “regional-theater actor wants to play Ebenezer Scrooge all year long” and “harrowing tale of survival undercut by survivor's fixation on not getting to choose the food that sustained him” blend seamlessly into an eventful road trip that leaves us with a new perspective on Mike. It's probably the best articulation of what Ron's going through, too: He wanted to solve a mystery, and doing so has turned out to be more mystifying and dangerous than he could've ever imagined. It's a riotous “be careful what you wish for” that sprinkles a little neon-and-synth-throb Michael Mann pastiche into what one observer on the Episodic Medium Discord recently described as The Chair Company's “‘stupidest version of a David Lynch film vibe.” And at its center, there's something kind of tender: Lonely Ron has made a new friend. A friend who watches A Christmas Carol-based porn and marvels over the models in an erotic photo-hunt game, but a friend nonetheless.

About a third of the way into the episode, Mike warns Ron that they're headed to a “really weird town”—and if Mike thinks that, then it must be extremely weird. On this and so many other counts, “I Won. Zoom In.” does not disappoint. Alberto Isaac—previously seen as I Think You Should Leave's “king of dirty songs,” Don Bondarley—sets the tone as Oliver Probblo, who is not Red Ball CFO/Brucell Pharma board member Ken Tucker but rather an actor who posed for those photos as part of “life of the party” class. Isaac is, to put it mildly, a ham sandwich with a side of ham soup in the role. The reveal that Oliver and everyone around him is doing cocaine makes a lot of sense, and their touchy, revved-up energy courses through his introduction to Ron and Mike and the relentless scenes that follow.

And so does the feeling that everyone Ron and Mike meet on their out-of-town jaunt has, as an improv teacher might call it, a strong “game”—that hook of a comedic scene or character that can be repeatedly revisited and heightened. For Oliver, it's the Scrooge thing. Ron sets one up for the ponytailed guy with the dented forehead plate when he spots his elbow hovering dangerously close to some cheese soup. It might sound like one-dimensional writing, but it's all we need from characters who largely exist as obstacles to the next clue. They get in some good gags, contribute to the feeling that Ron is in over his head, and then The Chair Company moves on.

If nothing else, it is, as previously stated, an interesting approach to making narrative TV. The spine of “I Won. Zoom In.” is relatively straightforward—Mike and Ron get a lead, pursue it, suffer the consequences, and come out of the experience with a new closeness—but it's supporting all of these funny little interludes and tangents. Some of them advance the plot, like Oliver's anecdote about how he became “Ken Tucker” or Steve's scatological revenge plot and its overlap with Ron's Tecca visit. Others are just there for the laughs, like Douglas' tale of surviving his fridge ordeal by grabbing stuff from the freezer—the sort of comedic nonsense that Jim Downey was born to deliver with the straightest of faces. 

This all comes together spectacularly at Oliver's apartment. I'm bowled over by the way the sequence moves: In such a short span of time and a small amount of space, multiple fights break out, a guy climbs a light pole, and several setups from the bar are paid off. The copper mug, the squatting acting coach, the dealer Oliver paid in phony “Scrooge money”—they all come back in an impressive flurry. When Ron gets slammed through the bedroom door, it doesn't just open up another room for the chaos to flow into. With its contrasting paint color and brighter lighting, it's like they've busted into a whole other dimension. That feeling only intensifies when Ron chases the dealer into the basement, where a subterranean labyrinth leads to yet another disturbing and baffling realm where Ron has to degrade himself to escape.

If I may get highfalutin for a moment, there's this whole motif of crossing thresholds and barriers this week that really brings The Chair Company's “down the rabbit hole” nature to life. Even more so than the detour to Tamblay's, Oliver's unnamed hometown feels like it's worlds away from Ron's day-to-day—an impression underlined by the way day turns into night during the driving scenes and how their layered, bleary-eyed imagery slams into that intimidating shot of the mounted fox's head at the bar. From that point forward, we can expect things to get curiouser and curiouser, and they do with every new room the camera wanders into—until Ron wakes up in the emergency room. (Want to push the Alice In Wonderland parallels even further? Get a load of the Cheshire Cat grin on Ron's fellow patient. Also: As Humpty Dumpty, Oliver is technically playing a Lewis Carroll character in the photo-hunt punchline to episode four's cliffhanger.)

And yet the biggest surprise of the episode lies in the dimensions it gives Mike. Why did he bring an extra shirt with him, and why did he previously spend some time in this Twilight Zone outside of Dayton? It turns out he has an estranged daughter who lives nearby. He and Ron are able to make it back home after their dark night of the soul—but, as the situation with Mike's daughter proves, there are some lines that, once you cross them, can never be uncrossed. 

It's a telling inverse to the band of idiots we meet in “I Won. Zoom In.” Despite a taste for meatballs made of “gray beef” and ramshackle living quarters where the neighbors are always screaming, Mike is no cartoon character. He's a person with wants and regrets that The Chair Company treats almost as seriously as Ron's. They are, perhaps to Ron's eventual dismay, kindred spirits. It's to the show's credit that I can laugh at their foibles and still be touched by the care they show each other in those texts at the end of the episode. It helps that the scene is capped off by one final quasi-sketch flourish, with a Dickensian porn parody that would fit in right alongside the I Think You Should Leave holiday classic “The Night Scrooge Saved Christmas.”  

For all I've said about the uniqueness of “I Won. Zoom In,” I have to admit that at its chaotic peak, I was reminded of another half-hour HBO wrecking ball from a Saturday Night Live alumnus: Barry's “Ronny/Lily.” I recall that episode getting a lot of flack at the time for breaking the reality of what had previously been a fairly grounded show; The Chair Company's own drift into Wackyland was well underway before “I Won. Zoom In.” It feels like this is by design: The deeper Ron digs into Tecca, the stranger things get. Heightening from “a bar full of coke heads descends upon Ron and Mike in the apartment of a method-acting Scrooge” may seem difficult, but consider this: Barry did the surrealist bike chase of “710N” the season after “Ronny/Lily.” As outrageous as this week's episode was, I have a feeling we've only begun to see the depths of The Chair Company's rabbit holes.

Kathy Hilton shared details about “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” days after the explosive Season 15 trailer was released by Bravo.

In a November 2025 interview with Variety, Hilton said she managed to avoid getting caught in the drama during filming for the “brutal” upcoming season of the Bravo reality show.

“There's no Kathy Hilton drama,” she said. “I'm not really dramatic. All that drama makes me really sad. They're all just very comfortable in saying whatever they want, and that's what makes it brutal.”

Hilton will appear as a “friend” in the new RHOBH season alongside main stars Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley, Erika Jayne, Sutton Stracke, Bozoma Saint John. Jennifer Tilly and newcomers Rachel Zoe and Amanda Frances.

The RHOBH trailer showed several cast members arguing. In one scene, Hilton's sister, Kyle Richards, angrily tells someone, “You're lying and you know what doesn't lie? The cameras!”

Speaking with Variety, Hilton shared, “I had a couple of phone calls today from some of the girls [after they saw the trailer], let's just put it that way. Some of them were like, ‘I can't believe so-and-so did this.'”

While she didn't share exactly what happened, Hilton hinted at an especially dramatic finale episode. “It was bru-tal!” she said.

As a “friend” in the series, it's easier for Hilton to avoid the Housewives drama. Following her first season on RHOBH, she told Town and Country that she tried to help when there was cast drama. “I try to be somewhat of a peacemaker,” she said in the 2021 interview. “I'm very good at helping people. I think maybe I was a therapist or a psychiatrist in my past life. They trust me, they talk to me. And I like to help them with any advice I can give.  …And I'm pretty good at it.”

Ahead of Season 15, Hilton told Extra she chose to stay away this time around. “There was a lot of drama. You know, I try not to get involved in the drama,” she said. “I think everybody was really real this year and just, not that they're not always, but really comfortable with themselves and, I think, really comfortable with the new girls. So it turned out, it was like they weren't new girls. Like we'd always been either getting along or not getting along.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","Russell Crowe Reveals Dramatic 55-Pound Weight Loss Transformation","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/russell-crowe-dramatic-weight-loss-transformation/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 02:28:06 GMT","

Oscar-winning actor Russell Crowe has opened up about his striking physical transformation, revealing that he shed approximately 55 pounds over the past year.

Appearing on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast on Wednesday, Nov. 5, Crowe shared how a combination of strategic lifestyle changes and using the wellness platform Ways2Well helped him achieve his goal.

The actor, now 61, said he weighed around 277 lbs (126 kg) while filming the historical drama “Nuremberg,” in which he portrays Nazi official Hermann Göring.

Since that time, he has brought his weight down to roughly 222 lbs (100.9 kg), attributing the change largely to the tailored program introduced by Rogan.

Through the platform, he stated he has received numerous injections to help with various injuries he sustained throughout the years. He creates Ways2Well with calming down his body's inflammation.

“I think we talked before about just how many old injuries I carry, and how the injuries in my shoulders are deeply arthritic,” he told Rogan.

The “Gladiator” actor added, “But we can now see in an ultrasound that a year ago I had big thick bands of arthritis, and now it's lessened, probably by about 70%. On one area in my right shoulder, probably by about 90%.”

The iconic actor showed off his weight loss at the recent premiere of the film, which he attended with his girlfriend Britney Theriot.

A significant part of his journey, Crowe told Rogan, has been reducing alcohol consumption — something he previously described as integral to his working-class upbringing.

On the podcast, he admitted he still values a drink but now chooses quality over quantity.

“I'm a big proponent for having a drink,” he began. “But as you get older, there are certain things that you start to learn about your capacities.”

He added that while he still drinks, he prefers to save the calories.

“If I decide I'm going to have a glass of wine with dinner, then it's going to be a really nice wine,” he noted. “I try not to have casual drinks now, having a drink for the sake of it. Those add up.”

The actor added that his age has also played a role in how much he consumes.

“Now that I'm an older guy, I know that one night a week—if I'm having fun—is plenty. I try to cut out the interstitial stuff,” he added.

While Crowe lost a substancial amount of weight, he is gaining some serious Oscar buzz for his new role.

The roughly two-hour and 30-minute film is described as follows per Rotten Tomatoes: “As the Nuremberg trials are set to begin, a U.S. Army psychiatrist gets locked in a dramatic psychological showdown with accused Nazi war criminal Hermann Göring.”

The film also stars Rami Malek and Michael Shannon.

Crowe last received an Oscar nomination for the 2002 film “A Beautiful Mind.”

Adolescence, and especially at an all-boys summer water polo camp, is hell in Charlie Polinger's memorably disturbing first feature, “The Plague.” In the psychodrama-meets-body-horror movie, Ben (discovery Everett Blunck), a socially anxious 12-year-old, becomes part of a ritualistic tradition that targets an outcast among them with an illness they call “the plague.” 

But as there are real corporeal implications, it's starting to look as if this imagined social disease might be real. Is the plague in this acne-scarred nightmare an even more horrifying version of puberty? “The Plague” almost feels like an allegory for it, but it's never predictable. Below, IndieWire shares the exclusive trailer ahead of the film‘s upcoming debut on December 24.

Joel Edgerton also stars in the film as the boys' coach, who turns out to be extremely out of his depth when faced with the cruelties they inflict upon each other. “The Plague” first premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where IndieWire spoke to writer/director Polinger about shooting the film on 35mm during a sweltering summer season. “We were capturing something that felt timeless and, to me, there's no comparison. It looks so great to shoot on film, and these kids' faces and closeups just rendered in such a beautiful way,” he said.

That shot-on-film aspect lends to the film feeling like a throwback to classic coming-of-age movies, but with a chilling twist. “I love those movies about boys, though I often feel like a lot of movies about young boys are either a little more sort of bro-y hangout or a little more nostalgic, kind of biking-around-the-suburbs type of thing,” he said. Movies like Bo Burnham's “Eighth Grade” and Julia Ducournau's “Raw,” he said, “capture a social dread and vulnerability of your body and something you don't see as much with boys because it requires a certain vulnerability to be an object of terror in that way… I was even looking at some sort of dread-filled, ‘Shining' daylight kinds of horror movies, [with] huge imposing spaces.”

From IndieWire's review out of Cannes: “In his debut feature, filmmaker Charlie Polinger plays with broad riffs on coming-of-age, body horror, and bullying genres before paring these themes back to reveal that two 12-year-old boys — and their contrasting approaches to being different — are really the heartfelt preoccupation of the film.”

Independent Film Company opens “The Plague” in select theaters on Wednesday, December 24 with an expansion to follow on Friday, January 2.

For film fans of all kinds (even the ones who make their living in the cinematic arts), going far afield to see a film in a unique format is something of a badge of honor. Consider this anecdote shared by Phoenix Theatres owner Cory Jacobson and VP of Project Development Jordan Hohman: earlier this year, an employee of their Midwest-based regional theater chain drove all the way from Cleveland, Ohio to the Lincoln Center theater in New York City in order to see “The Brutalist” projected on 70mm. That's over 450 miles.

Options to see Brady Corbet's film on the biggest screen or in that premium film stock were extremely limited in the Midwest — even for those who work at theaters — with most needing to travel to the Music Box in Chicago to even have a chance at seeing a movie that way.

With Christopher Nolan's “The Odyssey” on the horizon, Phoenix Theatres is now looking to put in its own 70mm projector at one of its nine locations. Already the theater being converted has newly-added heated recliners, a black box aesthetic, and waterfall curtains, all to make the experience for that very movie and others beyond it unique in the region.

 










“You're offering something that's really extremely unusual. And also, I think it's sought after by a younger clientele who's intensely interested,” Hohman told IndieWire. 

It's no surprise that for some of these event titles, seeing it in the best format possible isn't just the best way, it's the only way. IMAX and Premium Large Format screens, or PLFs, account for only a fraction of the total theaters in the country, but can often drive a significant portion of the box office revenue on a given movie. It's grown a lot since COVID, when many exhibitors took advantage of dark, empty theaters to do some much-needed renovations.

But how much do they really matter to a movie's overall success? In some cases, competition for placement on those screens can get fierce. When a movie like Taylor Swift's “The Eras Tour” concert was a surprise release that took over theaters and screens with minimal notice, distributors were pissed, and box office for a few titles suffered. 

In the case of “Oppenheimer” two years ago, which had a lockdown on IMAX screens and the majority of other PLFs, it annoyed not only Tom Cruise, who lost those premium screens for Week 2 of “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning,” but also Warner Bros. and “Barbie,” which wanted as many showtimes as possible on any screen (don't worry, that one did fine). And despite Netflix leadership continually slagging on theatrical, the streamer is giving Greta Gerwig's “Narnia” movie a special IMAX release, and now rival studios will likely tiptoe around that film's release date if they want their own screens.

 










“Awareness is a very hard thing for people to come by these days, and anything you can do to get that edge is meaningful,” said Adam Rymer, Chief Commercial Officer at Regal Entertainment. “Beyond what you used to feel like it was just a conversation around spectacle type films, if you think of Christopher Nolan and James Cameron, where you were getting people out to see something that was what felt like a massive, everybody needs to see this kind of a title, it's now applying to a lot more films.”

PLFs is a catchall term for a lot of screens and formats that aren't created equal. Industry types use it to refer to films shown in 35mm or 70mm, in Dolby Atmos, or on mega, 65-foot screens, but it also includes theaters equipped with things like Screen X (which extends the image along the sides of the theater), 4DX (basically an amusement park ride while you're watching a movie), or in Regal's RPX showings, which are haptic feedback seats that some exhibitors colloquially call “Butt Kickers.” Cinemark, Regal, and smaller chains have their own proprietary PLF screens, and IMAX, while still technically a large format offered for a premium up charge, doesn't like to lump itself in with other PLF offerings. 

That's because IMAX has its own specific tech, and IMAX largely chooses for exhibitors what movies play on their screens, which is why some theater owners choose to go their own route and have the option to mix and match. Jacobson said on their Dolby Atmos screens they were able to zig while others zagged, getting solid results from putting “The Black Phone 2” and the “Back to the Future” re-release on the PLFs while others were stuck with the fizzling “Tron: Ares.”
 










Sean Gamble, CEO at Cinemark, said in a recent earnings call that PLFs have been a massive form of growth for the industry since 2019. But he said the revenue they bring in still only accounts for 15 percent of the total box office. And because the only movies generally playing on those screens are the biggest new releases and have a higher price point, they've made the box office's recovery these last few years look bigger than it actually is. 

On a film by film level, as well as theater by theater, PLFs can be immensely important. Hohman says that at Phoenix Theatres, 29 percent of their screens are PLFs, but they generate 40 percent of their attendance. Dave Corkill, who leads the California-based CinemaWest chain, said 30 percent of his theaters' attendees are coming in specifically for those specialty brands.

IMAX each week proudly touts the percentage of box office their 400 screens in North America alone generate for a given film's opening weekend. In 2025, four different movies that opened above $30 million at the domestic box office saw 20 percent or better of their total haul come from IMAX. “One Battle After Another” and the re-release of “Avatar: The Way of Water” this year also did 20+ percent in IMAX but didn't open as high. As was the case the last couple of years, the overall domestic box office was down, 11 percent year over year this past quarter, but IMAX was up 29 percent.

 










One studio source we spoke with qualified those claims a little. Not all movies live and die by being on the biggest screen possible, and he's not losing sleep if he doesn't have as many 3D showings of his movie than that of a rival distributor. He also explains that when a movie makes 15 percent of its box office through IMAX, it's not as though the movie would have grossed 15 percent less overall if it was on no IMAX, even if IMAX would love to say that money was solely because of them. These are the biggest blockbusters of the year, and while the total might be less without IMAX and its premium up charge, the box office gross will find a way.

That hasn't stopped studios from plastering the IMAX logo on all its marketing materials or putting out literal punch cards of all the different premium ways you can see a movie like “One Battle After Another.” Just having your movie associated with IMAX or other PLFs gives it some prestige, and the studio exec agreed there's no denying that audiences are voting with their wallet to get the higher quality experience, packing seats at the highest price point first before other cheaper showings fill up.

The demand then for these experiences from both consumers and studios has gone way up. Corkill says his company's goal is to “grab on to every premium format that's available now,” all as part of an expansion project through the middle of next year. He's seen his repeat guests who first choose Screen X then try something in 4DX on the next visit, and it's an experience he wants to replicate. 

 










“What we're trying to do as a company is put enough brands under the roof of our building that we create a repetitive movie goer that desires to go out to the movies, and if something doesn't happen to be in a premium format, we want to create the desire to continue to come to the movie theater,” Corkill said. 

There's a chicken and egg dilemma though: it's costly to justify putting in an upgraded screen at an underperforming theater. It's easier to justify it in a big city, but harder when it's the suburbs and you actually have to install and maintain them. 

“We're being very careful about how we expand them and seeing where the demand is on a local theater-by-theater basis so we can continue to capture that demand on the studio side,” Rymer said.

No matter the size of the screen, there's challenges facing exhibition and distributors alike. Exhibitors still believe that it's not an issue of too few PLF screens but too few movies to put on them. Distributors would counter that the popularity of PLFs prove the multiplex experience has sucked for too long, and if they are going to leave their house and skip streaming, they're going to want the best. 

“How do we promote the premium format screens without taking anything away from our standard screens. Because what we get concerned about happening is people feel like the only way to see something is in these premium formats and that a standard screen isn't exciting enough,” Rymer said. We do try to balance that aspect of it as well, of really making sure we're marketing the experience of going to a movie theater regardless of what it is that you're seeing.”

In Ghetto Stories, a 2010 Baton Rouge hood flick that I like to think of as Trill Entertainment's The Fast and the Furious, Boosie and Webbie are rivals from opposite sides of town. “You finna witness some other shit, nigga!” threatens Boosie at one point during a gas station confrontation, one of at least a dozen of his hilarious line readings. Unknowingly, the two have a mutual OG, Slimm, a big-time drug dealer with morals, although he's cheating on his girlfriend, played by Hoopz, the winner of Flavor of Love season one. Eventually, Slimm is mysteriously killed, forcing Boosie and Webbie to come together to carry out his mission of getting rich or something and to find out who did the deed. Most of the second act is about the formation of their friendship, which is strengthened through strip club nights, getting money, cooking crack, and, of course, a makeover montage. Watch the movie once and you'll understand the central idea of Baton Rouge rap: Nothing means more than brotherhood.

That might be why, even beyond Boosie and Webbie, Baton Rouge has been a city with strong rap duos for a minute: Scotty Cain and Mista Cain, TEC and Maine Musik, and at the moment, 70th Street Carlos and WNC Whopbezzy. Supposedly, Carlos and Whopbezzy met in the first grade when Bezzy walked into class with two golds in his mouth, a chain on his neck, and girls throwing themselves at him. In that instant, Carlos thought, “That lil bitch thuggin',” and they've been boys ever since. (You should know by now to take rappers' stories with a grain of salt, but I choose to believe this one.)

Years later, in the mid-2010s, back when Bezzy used to do Carlos' tats, they started rapping on a whim. With a run of singles and a 2017 joint mixtape, the pair made a lot of noise in a competitive era of Louisiana rap—the rise of NBA YoungBoy and JayDaYoungan; Kevin Gates' star turn—until they eventually took an unexplained break from dropping music together. On their return, with Out The Blue, they pick up right where they left off.

And that means, an unfiltered Carlos and Bezzy navigating their way through the ups and downs of petty beefs, hustling, tricking, and fatherhood. But most importantly, churning out big trash-talking tunes with fat ass basslines made to set the clubs of Louisiana off. They're fun as hell, like Yung Nation with scores to settle. On “Fall In Line,” as Bezzy yells dancefloor commands with a Foxx-esque rasp that sounds like he lost his voice at the party, you'll feel like you're doing cone drills at football practice. “Rappin & Trappin” might have more handclaps than a Milwaukee lowend track, as Bezzy channels Juvenile with the way he orders asses to “moveee” in a sing-song delivery from the gut. Carlos deads Bezzy's hype-yourself-up anthem on the HBCU drumline-ready “DYS” by throwing grenades at everyone they have static with and making bazooka noises.

It'll be obvious once you listen, but Carlos is the loose cannon of the duo. He bulldozes onto tracks unexpectedly with ad-libs and flows that rarely stay the same for more than a few seconds. On “Up Wit Me,” he's damn-near having a back-and-forth with himself, alternating between a relatively laid-back flow and moments where he's flapping his lips, hitting what seems like Ric Flair wooos, and doing a mush-mouthed scream-rap thing that makes him sound like Animal from The Muppets.

At the same time, Carlos can be introspective without softening the relentless bounce of the tape. On the groovy “Mail Man,” bits of conversation with his mom (“I don't even go to church but my mama praying/She like ‘You can die right now', I'm like ‘I understand'”) brush up against brags about all the fucking he does. Bezzy has the thankless job of keeping the tape on the rails with steady hooks (except the awfully generic sing-rapping on “10 x 5”) and rhyme schemes that bring Carlos back down to Earth. Eight years ago, on their last tape, I found that dynamic just made me want to hear more Carlos, but now I think they're essential to bringing the best out of each other. Just being around Carlos makes Bezzy looser and funnier, like the “uh huh” powering up he does at the start of “It's Like That” or the moment on “In the Mix” when he calls out some dude's courage (a.k.a. he calls him a “pussy”) and weak car tints in the same breath. Given how much of their music is about riding around Baton Rouge in American muscle cars, I think the latter is supposed to be more offensive.

Stitching Carlos and Bezzy's bond together even tighter is a shared affinity for the Louisiana ass-shaking music that came before them. In a Deep South scene of the 2020s full of so much piano-centric pain rap, hearing them go on about their life of hectic, twerk-filled club appearances is a much-needed break from that melancholy. That feeling is there whether they're doing a little flexing over the vintage 2000s Trill-style funk of “No Talking” or “WTF,” which boosts a B.G. classic to the upbeat jiggin' tempo. On their remix of L.O.G's “G's & Soldiers”—one of those mid-'90s ominous Mannie Fresh basslines that sounds like bounce for an Agatha Christie whodunit—it almost seems like they're freestyling in the club parking lot, as Bezzy hilariously claims “Bitch, I'm bad like a kid with two teeth in his mouth” and Carlos croons like he's got the bottle they snuck out of the section still in his hand. I don't know about you, but that sounds like the ultimate form of brotherhood to me.

7.7

Genre:

Electronic

Label:

Planet Mu

Reviewed:

November 10, 2025

Who better to release obscure UK drum juggler Ship Sket's first album than legendary UK electronic music outpost Planet Mu? Since its founding by Mike Paradinas (aka μ-Ziq) in 1995, the label has established itself as a pillar for some of the UK's most deranged dance music: It codified Aphex Twin and μ-Ziq's Chuckle Brothers fuckery, typeset Luke Vibert's acid-sodden liner notes, and unleashed Venetian Snares' miasmic orchestral breakbeat.

The label's 30th anniversary compilation, released earlier this year, also touched on other styles like jungle, footwork, and house. But much of the release felt defined by its older contributors—IDM linchpins who, ironically, contributed some of the blandest new tracks. Things weren't all bad, though; track 8, “Dysentery,” came from a newcomer, 26-year-old English DJ Ship Sket (aka Josh Griffiths), and it didn't sound like anything else on the tape. As a DJ, Griffiths is notorious for pulverising genres like 140, bassline, and grime. “Dysentery” felt far from any of those scenes, though; it superimposed serialist cello, pagan glossolalia, bit-crushed 808s, and UK MCs onto a beat that sounded like the slow collapse of a star.

Like Bassvictim, Griffiths sits on the fringes of the growing UK experimental scene, and his new album, InitiatriX, demonstrates his facility with electronic music that's both genuinely experimental and built for the club. Opener “Frost Cake” sounds like playing Pixel Gun 3D on speed: crisp breakbeats, quicksilver squelches, filthy distortion. The title track is essentially an apocalyptic gamelan beat over a text-to-speech prose poem—a medium that would be easy to execute terribly—yet you can't help but make a stank face. “Casting Call” features the masked mollusc-artist S280F and lands somewhere between Morton Feldman and Mica Levi. It's the most overtly experimental track and still Ship Sket manages to configure it at jungle speed.

The tunes don't meander or drag—important for an artist who approaches experimentalism with the crowd-conscious sensibility of more mainstream electronic subgenres. InitiatriX is not Overmono or Sammy Virji danceable, but more like Drukqs danceable. It harks to a moment after the synthesis of Aphex Twin and before the advent of Calvin Harris, when electronic experimentalism and danceability did not feel so mutually exclusive. Its songs are challenging without being overly cerebral and idiosyncratic without feeling inscrutable.

Griffiths grew up in Dorset before moving to Manchester, where he's lived for seven years. Much of InitiatriX feels concerned with the concept of Englishness and the passage of time, ideas he initially explored on the 2024 EP England as a Succubus. Even when they're being eviscerated, the sounds Griffiths uses are often emblematic of certain musical strains, like the rotted grime synths on “Locked In,” or the relentless hardstyle kicks on “Supermodel Mansion.” Even the hermetic artist Charlie Osborne's incantations on “Vendetta” sound like a lost runic language. As jungle and house music veer sharply into the pop lexicon, do we risk forgetting the deep histories of these subgenres and the oppressive systems from which they arose? Think of Ship Sket's music like a UV backlight applied to an ancient manuscript, illuminating the faded inscriptions of our past to make the invisible audible again.

Madi Diaz has released a full-album cover of Blink-182's Enema of the State to support the Defending Our Neighbors Fund. Titled Enema of the Garden State, Diaz's album is available exclusively on Bandcamp, via Anti-. Listen to “Don't Leave Me” and “Anthem” below and click through to buy the album on Bandcamp.

The Nashville singer-songwriter, who released Fatal Optimist last month, says in press materials that the covers record “started out as a fun light exercise fueled by an eternal love and fandom” for the band and album. “I wanted to see if I could let the nostalgia drive my memory for the lyrics and tear through a punky acoustic arrangement. No planning, no overthinking, no analyzing allowed, just ripping into the songs. It was pure fun, pure joy.”

Diaz adds that she did not plan to release the record until the extent of the Trump administration's mass-deportation program became clear. “I started thinking about how incredible the name Enema of the State is for a record,” she says. “How the title is somehow so current and politically, culturally, socially, insanely ironic. And we thought maybe we could use this version of Enema of the (Garden) State to raise awareness and money for people in need of defense and aid in their right to live and work and breathe and be and stay on American soil. Every penny this project generates will go to Defending Our Neighbors Fund. This will help give immigrant families, adults, young children, and so many of those in need of advocates, access to resources through this support system. Thank you so much for listening. For me, it's become so much more than just a nostalgia for teenage rebellion against mom and dad. Fuck ICE. Enema of the State Forever.”

Pharrell Williams and Adidas have been honored with the Shoe of the Year award at the 2025 Footwear News Achievement Awards for their collaboration, the Virginia Adistar Jellyfish. The sneaker was first previewed at Paris Fashion Week in January with a silhouette reveal. The sneak peek lived up to the hype. Pharrell and Adidas first released the shoe in orange, then revamped it with an exclusive blue colorway that spoke to the original concept behind the design.


	“I dreamed of a shoe that felt alive, something that moved like water, that had its own rhythm, energy and glow,” Williams shared in a statement. “The Virginia Adistar Jellyfish started as a really big idea that we kept pushing, shaping, refining until it became real. I wanted it to feel fluid, futuristic, and free, not just another shoe but a living design. Seeing people connect with that spirit is the most rewarding part.”


	Williams joins fellow 2025 FN Achievement Awards honorees Coco Gauff, Ronnie Fieg, and Tommy Hilfiger, who will be honored with a lifetime achievement award.

	











	“Pharrell's partnership with Adidas continues to redefine what creative collaboration in footwear can look like, pushing boundaries in both design and storytelling,” said Michael Atmore, Chief Brand Officer of Fairchild Media Group and Editorial Director of Footwear News and Editor-in-Chief, WWD. “The Virginia Adistar Jellyfish reflects his singular ability to connect culture, community, and craft.”

	Williams' ties to fashion run deep. In 2024, he made his official debut as Louis Vuitton's new menswear creative director, unveiling his breakout collection at the LV Spring/Summer runway show. Williams took over the role following the death of Virgil Abloh, who served as the artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collection from 2018 until his death in 2021.

	











	“When I'm moving in those spaces, I always kind of like to bend the rules a little bit,” Williams told Vogue ahead of the Virginia Adistar Jellyfish launch. “I'm not looking for attention, but I don't necessarily want to blend in.”

	Just days after the release of her comeback single “Mature,” Hilary Duff has announced plans for an intimate series of shows in North America and England that will mark her first live performances in over a decade. She's called the outing Small Rooms, Big Nerves, and it kicks off Jan. 19 at O2 Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. The general-ticket on-sale begins Friday, Nov. 14.


	“It's happening,” Duff says in a statement. “I'm over the moon to be stepping on stage again. I've got some new songs that I can't wait to share with you and of course some old favorites we can scream together. It's been a minute and I've missed you. Let's make some mems.”


	Duff's pop music career began during her years as a teen star on Disney's Lizzie McGuire, which aired from 2001 to 2004. She scored hits with “So Yesterday,” “With Love,” and “Come Clean.” The latter was used as the theme song to MTV's reality show Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County. Her most recent LP was 2015's Breathe In. Breathe Out. Since that time, she has focused on her young family and TV and film projects, including Younger, How I Met Your Father, and The Haunting of Sharon Tate. (She also attempted a Lizzie McGuire revival series that never got off the ground.)

	











	Duff returned to music earlier this month with “Mature,” which she co-wrote with her husband, Matthew Koma, and singer-songwriter Madison Love. “'Mature' is a little conversation that my present self is having with my younger self,” Duff said in a statement. “The two of us are reflecting on a past experience and sending love to each other. It's a chuckle, a wink, and a sense of being grateful that we are sure-footed in where we landed.”

	











	Also in the works is a docuseries that will take fans behind the scenes of Duff's musical comeback. “Embracing the ups, downs, and everything in between,” reads a press release, “fans will ride shotgun as she balances raising a family, recording new music, live show rehearsals, and preparing to perform onstage for the first time in over a decade.” Sam Wrench — who previously directed Taylor Swift: The Eras Tours and A Nonsense Christmas With Sabrina Carpenter — is spearheading the project.

A Farnworth man is still searching for answers after witnessing strange lights over Winter Hill in 2019.



  It was a dark evening on October 2, 2019, when Joe Henderson, 29, and his two friends, Luke and James, went up Winter Hill in Bolton's moorlands.



  Joe expected to see some breathtaking views of Bolton, but instead, he saw something he couldn't explain.



  Joe said: “It was around 9pm, and when we got into the car to go home, I saw 10 evenly spaced lights going over the hill.



  “They were really close, so in a panic, we just drove off.



  “I can't explain what it could have been.”



  Following the eerie experience, Joe discovered he wasn't alone in what he had seen.



  Unusual sightings at Winter Hill appear to date back to the 1950s.



  One witness described a “dark, flat iron-shaped object hovering close to the ground.”



  According to the account, the witness claimed to have interacted with an “alien” before it “returned to the spacecraft and disappeared”.



  The event was never fully explained and remains one of the earliest recorded UFO sightings in the area.



  Fast forward to 1999, a local farmer known as Murphy alleged that he saw a UFO hovering above his cattle field.



  The object reportedly moved away silently at an unnatural speed.



  Murphy reported the sighting to the police and was shocked to see the same object again later that night, in the same spot.



  More residents came forward with similar accounts, which led to an investigation by the Manchester Aerial Phenomena Investigation Team (MAPIT).



  Despite the scrutiny, no concrete explanation was ever found.



  This famous sighting came to be known as The Murphy Incident.



  The most recent Bolton UFO sighting was by Stephen Maloney, 55, of Thornham Drive, around 9pm on Monday, October 6.



  The object, described by Mr Maloney as a silent, bright white light streaking across the sky, was spotted over the moors near Tottington.

  Discussing his own experience, Joe said he first wondered if the lights he saw could have been a row of people walking.



  “The lights started going higher and higher as we went over the hill, so I don't think that's what it could have been,” he said.



  “But they were really close.”

  To explore the possibility that the lights may have belonged to ramblers, The Bolton News contacted the Bolton Walking and Outdoors Appreciation Society (BWOAS), who often take trips up Winter Hill.



  BWOAS committee chairperson, Colin Liptrot from Westhoughton, said: “There are always lots of walkers, runners and cyclists with bright torches up on the moor.



  “At night, it's very easy to lose depth and distance perception, so objects can appear like they are moving in very strange ways.



  “I've seen mountain bikers coming down a hill in the dark, and that looks as if the lights are in the sky because of the light conditions.”



  However, after checking his walking log, Colin confirmed that the group had been on a trip to Scotland on that day in 2019 and had walked up Kinlochleven.



  “It definitely wasn't us,” said Colin.



  “When I lead my Moors and Mountains guided walks over Winter Hill, we often stop to talk about the UFO sighting, as well as other paranormal and historic topics.



  “The latest craze is a big cat that's apparently been spotted up there recently.



  “I have never seen anything, but there is evidence to suggest that there could be a breeding population of larger felines in the British countryside.”



  For now, Joe's quest to find an explanation for what he saw in 2019 remains unanswered.

“Paranormal Activity” tells the story of a couple that recently moved hoping to escape the past — only to discover their troubles have followed them. Patrick Heusinger is one of the stars.

The screams of fright recently heard in London and Chicago — as well as those expected to flow through Downtown's Ahmanson Theatre this month — might never have happened if not for an accident decades ago.

That's when then three-year-old Chris Fisher fell off a stool, broke his leg and ended up hospitalized for six weeks. His parents bought him a magic set to pass the time.

While magic remained part of his life, he began working behind the scenes in theater, unaware that eventually both worlds would merge.

Now an acclaimed illusionist for plays, including Broadway's “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” and “Stranger Things: The First Shadow,” Fisher has created some of his most advanced and scary effects for “Paranormal Activity.”

Inspired by the movie franchise, and starring Cher Álvarez and Patrick Heusinger, “Paranormal Activity” is running Nov. 13 through Dec. 7. Writer Levi Holloway and director Felix Barrett are both theatrical horror veterans.

The story follows a couple who have recently moved, hoping to escape strange experiences of the past, only to find that their supernatural troubles appear to have followed them.

After months of preparation to make each creepy and scary moment succeed for its world premiere in London, Fisher was optimistic but not sure it would all work until the first audience reacted.

“You always hope that you're going to get those moments, and I think one of the illusions is probably the most satisfying illusion that I think I've ever designed, because the reactions it gets are crazy,” Fisher said. “I think what we've learned is illusion and horror and suspense is all about timing.”

Fisher spent years as a theatrical stage and company manager, performing tricks for the company's amusement, until illusionist Jamie Harrison recruited him for a production of the musical “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” They also joined forces on the “Harry Potter” and “Stranger Things” shows.

For “Paranormal Activity,” Fisher, who is working without Harrison this time, has been part of the creation process since near the beginning.

“That way we could get the illusions fully integrated into the show,” he said. “In fact, some of the set was designed because of what the illusion had to be. It also helped that I had worked in theater for a while, because I understand about sound and lighting. So, when I need an illusion to do a certain thing, I know what's needed for each department.”

As he does with all writers and directors, Fisher told Holloway and Barrett not to focus on whether an effect could be done but rather focus on their vision — leaving it to him to make it a reality.

One of the biggest challenges for each production is making sure the cast knows how to work with his illusions, beginning with explaining why they shouldn't reveal any secrets.

“Sometimes when you find out how something's done, it can be quite disappointing,” he said. “So, I talk through that psychology of why we keep the secret. Then I talk to them about how we use misdirection, use sleight of hand. It's hard for actors because they're not magicians and sometimes I need to guide them to make what they're doing feel natural.”

As the couple going through the haunting each performance, Álvarez and Heusinger said the effects, along with other technical aspects heighten the play in ways that still surprise them.

“Chris is such a magnificent artist, and these illusions and effects are wonderful,” Heusinger said. “You feel in very safe hands. There's one moment where, with every audience, it feels as if they're going to give a standing ovation because they're so excited about it.”

Still, not every effect always lands the same way each time, and the cast has to go with it. But the actors said that the strong script keeps everything working.

“It's a testimony to the way Levi wrote this that so many people who have been watching say it feels like they're invading, like they shouldn't be there,” Álvarez said. “The language is so real.”

“Paranormal Activity,” which co-stars Cher Álvarez, is inspired by the movie franchise.

The intensity of both the story and relying on technical aspects means Álvarez and Heusinger rely heavily on mutual trust, knowing they will be there for each other regardless of what happens — including reactions from the crowds.

“I can say that the audience screams, and I mean screams every night, multiple times, and it's not that we're not running out and going ‘Boo' from behind their backs. It is properly scary.”

I'm grateful that my posts have reached 100,000 followers on Medium. This milestone tells me something important: curiosity about science lives in all of us, regardless of our backgrounds.

Today, I'm inviting you, my science-oriented readership, to participate in a real academic research. I am collaborating with Prof. Gershon Tenenbaum and Dr. Omer Eldadi on a study examining how scientifically engaged individuals perceive the question of extraterrestrial intelligence beyond Earth.

The research is straightforward: What do you believe about the existence of intelligent life beyond Earth? How do your beliefs compare to what you think others believe — both in your social circle and among scientific experts?

Your participation takes just 5 minutes and contributes to academic research that will be published in a peer reviewed journal and shared here on Medium with all of you. The survey is completely anonymous.

Take the survey (here) https://idc.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_elf3G9qfDpfG3bw

This study targets readers like you, people who actively engage with scientific ideas, because understanding how the scientifically literate public thinks about extraterrestrial intelligence is crucial for improving science communication in this field.

Science advances through curiosity and evidence, not assumptions. By participating, you're expanding our understanding of how beliefs about one of humanity's most fundamental questions are formed and shared within science-oriented communities.

We should maintain the humility to learn rather than presume we know the answers in advance. Your contribution to this research embodies that scientific spirit.

Here's hoping your participation will illuminate what we think about our place in our cosmic neighborhood.

With gratitude,

Avi Loeb

This is the theory of professor Alex Ellery of Carleton University who argues that if self-replicating alien probes have reached our solar system they may not be in the form of flying saucers or flashing lights but camouflaged as rocks from asteroids, lunar debris or comets. 

“I believe that extraterrestrial intelligence (in AI form) could be concealed under the lunar surface, in effect, ‘hibernating.' They may periodically surface to observe our planet and its biological evolution. As that evolution becomes more interesting, their awakening periods may become more frequent but our species evolved very rapidly to become tool-using over the last 2 million years or so,” Ellery told Newsweek. 

Self-replicating spacecraft or probes are often referred to as von Neumann probes, having been introduced as a concept by mathematician and physicist John von Neumann in the 1940s. The idea is that these are machines capable of mining resources, replicating and spreading through the galaxy over millions of years.

However, instead of searching for radio and artificial signals in the skies, Ellery suggests we should divert our attention closer to home, looking for evidence of technological activity such as unusual isotope ratios or magnetic anomalies on the moon and other nearby planets and celestial objects.

“The solar system is huge and mostly unexplored,” Ellery said in a statement. “There could be probes everywhere—in craters on the moon, or lurking in the asteroid belt and kuiper belt [both regions in the solar system].”

He explained further to Newsweek that he favors the moon as it is “a rich source of easily-obtained aluminum,” a “highly multifunctional material” and possesses a “small gravity field which renders manufacturing operations easier than on asteroids.”

In his preprint paper—meaning it has not yet been formally peer-reviewed but builds on previous research—Ellery highlighted the importance of determining “what to look for and where” as our solar system exploration “consolidates into commercial industrialization.”

“After considering asteroid resources, we suggest that evidence of asteroidal processing will be difficult to discern from natural processes given the constraints imposed by self-replication. We further determine that the moon is an ideal base of manufacturing operations,” he said.

Ellery suggested it is possible to build nuclear reactors on the moon using materials found there, which could leave chemical signs of past reactor activity.

“We further suggest that in anticipatory economic trade for resources, a self-replicating probe may have left artefacts buried with asteroidal resources on the moon. Such gifts would be detectable and accessible only once a threshold of technological sophistication has been achieved [to find and understand them]. An obvious gift in trade for the resources utilised would be a universal constructor,” he added.

Ellery acknowledged the argument that, given the limits of our exploration of our vast solar system, it's unsurprising we haven't yet discovered evidence of alien robotic probes, especially due to their typically small sizes.

“We have presented potential locations for targeted searches and admitted that technosignatures could be larger but hidden, though there may be widespread isotopic evidence of artificial nuclear power generation,” he said. 

“Our search for such technosignatures will be side-effects of our own efforts to industrialize lunar and asteroid resources. The anomalous Chicxulub crater [one of the largest and best preserved craters on Earth] had been discovered by petroleum geologists decades before its significance was revealed by Alvarez et al. 

“For the moon and asteroids, we are forearmed. The quicker we get to it, the quicker we may discover the answer to one of the most important scientific and philosophical questions of our time.”

Cuteness, it would seem, is one of life's most endearing evolutionary strategies – and one that felines have hijacked to remarkable levels. For cat lovers, our furry feline friends are akin to our closest companions, and this is reflected in our neurobiology: being close to them triggers activity in the same emotion-processing region of the brain. Even when we're not sharing precious moments in real life, we merely have to turn to our phones to get our fix. Cats, after all, do the funniest things. But what is it about them that we find so adorable?

Senior International Film Correspondent


EXCLUSIVE: Sierra McCormick, Francesca Xuereb and Cailyn Rice have been unveiled for the cast of  supernatural horror thriller Sigil as Concourse Media launches sales at the AFM. 


	The film, which is slated to begin principal photography next January, is written by William Wright Anderson and Katharine Meadows. Anderson also directs with Tyler Condon.


	McCormick, Xuereb and Rice star as three young women who gather to perform an occult ritual orchestrated by their recently deceased friend. The girls blindly follow their dead friend's cryptic instructions only to realize that they are the final pieces in a deadly puzzle she set in motion before her death. What begins as a ritual to have their deepest wishes granted soon twists into a waking nightmare of survival and betrayal.McCormick's credits include Last Stop in Yuma County and sci-fi hit The Vast of Night. Xuereb, who debuted in Murmur, has since appeared in in Room 203, Ted, The Sex Lives of College Girls, and Pam & Tommy. Rice was seen in Taylor Sheridan's neo-Western series, 1923 and has recently joined the cast of Euphoria.

	“We're incredibly excited to support Tyler and Will's dark, visionary storytelling,” said Matthew Shreder of Concourse Media. “Sigil is the kind of bold, psychological horror that lives under your skin. Cinematic, atmospheric, and deeply unsettling.”Co-directors Condon and Anderson, whose past producing work includes films like the Aaron Eckhart spy thriller Chief of Station and Valley Girl, describe Sigil as “a slow-burn possession story that explores faith as both salvation and contagion.”

	Condon said: “In a world obsessed with self-transformation, Sigil asks what happens when those desires take on a life of their own.” 


	Anderson added: “We wanted to take the occult thriller and push it somewhere new, keeping it raw and grounded, where every drop of blood means something, and the fear comes from what's inside the characters as much as what's haunting them.”

	











	The film's co-producer Matt Boda of production outfit Get It Made pointed to the fact the film is shooting in L.A.


	“By keeping production and post in LA, we're not only making something special, we're creating some much needed jobs for local crew in the process,” he said. 


	Lola Visual Effects (Deadpool and Wolverine, Barbie, Top Gun) is also producing and will handle post-production and VFX on the film. Casting was handled by Sig De Miguel and Stephen Vincent of S2 Casting. 


	Rice is represented by Authentic Talent & Literary Management, while Xuereb is represented by Authentic Talent & Literary Management and Innovative Artists.

Pay Dirt is Slate's money advice column. Have a question? Send it to Kristin and Ilyce here. (It's anonymous!)

Dear Pay Dirt,

My friend of over 20 years is a woman in her 70s who is being manipulated by online psychics in a way that is similar to online romance scams. She has been convinced by these psychics that family and longtime friends are against her. She has been told that her soulmate is looking for her, but she has to follow specific steps in order to be ready for him and that she is about to be very, very wealthy and the only obstacle is that formerly trusted loved ones are stealing the funds just moments before she was supposed to receive them. She has been so vicious to her family and other friends that they have completely closed contact and have no willingness to be involved. Somehow, I'm still considered trustworthy, but in a curated way that is low in details.

Her income is very limited, so whatever financial benefit the scammers are able to get can't be much. But at the same time, every penny she has is very much needed. I hate seeing my friend in this situation, and I have no idea how to help her. I do not live nearby, so our contact is by phone. When I ask pointed questions, she drops out of contact for weeks at a time. I am torn between thinking that she is an adult who has the right to make terrible decisions and that being her friend when she is ready for reality is the best I can do and thinking that this is a five-alarm fire that might actually be endangering her life and I need to do something right now. What do you think?

—Heartbroken Friend

Dear Heartbroken Friend,

The Older Americans Act defines elder financial exploitation as “the fraudulent or otherwise illegal, unauthorized, or improper act or process of an individual, including a caregiver or fiduciary, that uses the resources of an elder for monetary or personal benefit, profit, or gain, or that results in depriving an elder of rightful access to, or use of, benefits, resources, belongings, or assets.” Elder financial abuse is a growing problem in the U.S., with annual losses exceeding $28 billion, according to a 2023 study by AARP.

I can tell you're very worried about your friend. But is she actually handing her cash to these psychics other than for regular appointments? If she's giving them access to her funds or transferring a substantial portion of what she has, then your friend is being financially exploited. Since she cannot afford to lose “every penny she has,” you're right to take action to try to help.

Call Adult Protective Services in her county immediately. They investigate financial exploitation of vulnerable adults. Find her local APS by visiting napsa-now.org/help-in-your-area or calling the Eldercare Locator at 1-800-677-1116 (Monday-Friday, 9am-8pm ET), which can connect you to her local APS office. You don't need her permission, and you don't need proof—just reasonable concern. Give them everything: the psychic scam, the isolation from family, the vicious behavior toward loved ones, her limited income, the pattern of cutting off anyone who questions her.

Also report the fraud to the National Elder Fraud Hotline at 1-833-FRAUD-11 (833-372-8311), run by the U.S. Department of Justice (Monday-Friday, 10am-6pm ET). Case managers will help document the scam and connect you with resources. File an online report with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov.

If any family members are still speaking to you, loop them in. Someone needs to check if she's given these scammers bank access, credit cards, or personal information.

Be ready: she may cut you off entirely when APS investigates. And, even if you're right, and you've saved her from being robbed of every last center, she may never forgive you. She's being systematically isolated and financially drained by predators who've convinced her that people who love her are enemies. That's the playbook—isolate the victim, then rob them blind.You can't save someone who won't be saved, but you can sound the alarm so professionals intervene. Make the calls today. If she ends up broke, homeless, or worse because no one acted, you'll never forgive yourself.

Sometimes being a friend means doing the thing that gets you fired as a friend.

—Ilyce

As we approach middle age, my sister and I have spoken frequently about how different our circumstances are compared to our social circles. We know we will not receive any inheritance as our parents have no assets, whereas most of our friends expect to receive significant or even life-changing amounts. Because of this, we live more modest lives compared to our close friends despite our household incomes being very similar, as we are prioritizing saving for retirement and paying off our mortgages before old age. I am single and childless but my sister has been married for over 10 years and has three small children. Recently, my brother-in-law casually mentioned to me how much he stands to inherit from his parents. It is an astronomical sum of money and I had no idea his parents were so wealthy. He clearly thought I was already aware of his circumstances and their plans for this money. My sister has never even hinted at this.

Shaheen Shah Afridi's second stint as Pakistan captain got off to a good start, as the hosts won the three-match series 2-1 against South Africa. The premium pacer is now ready for the next challenge against Sri Lanka, and ahead of the series opener in Rawalpindi, the 25-year-old opened up on taking over captaincy from Mohammad Rizwan. 

It is worth mentioning that Rizwan was removed as the ODI captain despite Pakistan winning the series in Australia and South Africa under his tenure. However, the side failed to make the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy and even lost an ODI series against the West Indies. 

Speaking to the media on Monday, Shaheen stated that Rizwan himself had decided to step back as captain, and once this decision was made, he was appointed as the new skipper. 

The pacer also spoke about his conversation with Rizwan and how the latter was supportive towards him taking over at the helm. 

“Recently, when I was announced as the captain, Rizwan was the first person I spoke to, and I asked him about his feelings. He is a good person; he decided to step back himself, and then I took over,” Shaheen told reporters. 

“The conversations were had with him, and then the decision was taken to appoint me as the ODI captain,” he added. 

Shaheen was previously appointed Pakistan's white-ball captain after the 2023 ODI World Cup. However, his tenure ended prematurely after Pakistan lost the T20I series against New Zealand under his leadership. 

The pacer was then replaced in similar circumstances to Rizwan's sacking. Afridi was then replaced by Babar Azam a week later.

Speaking to the media, Shaheen also discussed his previous captaincy stint; however, he remained tight-lipped about the circumstances surrounding his removal from the post.

“When I had taken over captaincy earlier, I had spoken to both Babar Azam and Rizwan. But I won't delve much into my removal as the captain,” said Shaheen. 

Pakistan currently have three different captains for three formats. Shaheen is at the helm of the ODI side while Salman Ali Agha and Shan Masood are the captains of the T20I and Test teams.

Best Things To Do in Dallas This Week

Audio By Carbonatix

Since his 2025 inauguration, President Donald Trump has granted executive clemency to more than 1,600 people, many of whom were serving prison time for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. That number makes the just over 200 signed executive orders seem quaint by comparison. On Sunday, a prominent Dallas attorney was one of the latest beneficiaries of the president's penchant for pardons. 

Sidney Powell, whom the New York Times described in a headline as “The Lawyer Behind Wild Voting Conspiracy Theories,” was one of 77 Trump allies accused of trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. She, along with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, among others, received pardons that are considered largely symbolic at this time, as no one from the new list has been convicted of a federal crime. What these pardons will prevent, however, is rather concrete, as future administrations will be unable to bring these charges against Powell and the others. 

In a statement provided to the New York Times, Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said those who were pardoned are “great Americans,” and claimed they had been “put through hell by the Biden administration for challenging an election.”

Powell, a former federal prosecutor in Texas in the late 1970s, has promoted conspiracy theories since the first Trump administration. She represented former Army lieutenant general and noted conspiracy theory peddler Michael Flynn in 2020 when he was accused of making false statements to the FBI about conversations he had with the Russian government.

Powell, along with Giuliani, was a leading legal voice in the effort to challenge the results of the 2020 election, which saw Trump lose to former President Joe Biden. Among the many claims Powell has made regarding the 2020 election, the manipulation of voting machines, accusations of foreign interference and allegations that so-called “deep state” forces such as QAnon have worked to stop Trump's progress have made headlines. Throughout 2021, Powell became a regular on conservative television talk shows, including The Rush Limbaugh Show, where she claimed that some of the voting machines used in the United States “had been designed to rig elections for the former ruler of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, who died in 2013.”

In 2023, Powell pleaded guilty to six misdemeanor charges of attempting to alter the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. As part of her plea deal, she agreed to six years of probation and to testify against other defendants in the case. Trump's pardon does not apply to the Georgia plea deal. 

Powell's legal troubles and lack of success in turning over the 2020 election haven't seemed to stop her from voicing her extreme views or weaken her fealty to the president. Her actively updated social media is filled with pro-Trump, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, and yes, voter fraud-related rhetoric. 

On Sunday, prior to the news of her pardon breaking, she retweeted an X post stating, “Antonio Gracias found (20M) dead people on Social Security, (2.4M) Illegals were issued SS numbers. Elon ~ there was a massive program to ultimately change the voting map of the U.S. People cannot be rewarded when they come here illegally.”

Dustin Martin of Trinity County was last seen in 2015.

HAYFORK, Calif. - A decade-long mystery surrounds the disappearance of Dustin Martin, last seen camping in the Post Mountain area of Trinity County near Hayfork.

Martin, who was 44 years old at the time, vanished on July 20, 2015, just before a lightning storm hit the area. The resulting fires, road closures, and evacuations hindered law enforcement's ability to conduct an immediate search.

A friend found Martin's campsite with his dog left unattended, along with his wallet and cellphone in his tent. Martin is described as standing 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighing 165 pounds. He has black or grey hair, brown eyes, and a tattoo of a coyote on his right arm.

Today, Martin would be 54 years old. Anyone with information about his whereabouts is urged to contact the Trinity County Sheriff's Office at (530) 623-2611.

In this article

Flight cancellations were again piling up on Monday as air traffic controller shortages, worsened by the longest-ever U.S. government shutdown, snarled air travel coast to coast and President Donald Trump threatened to dock air traffic controllers' pay if they are absent from work.

On Monday, 1,432 of the 25,733 scheduled flights across the country were canceled, around 5.5% ""and growing,"" according to aviation data firm Cirium.

Last week, the Trump administration ordered airlines to cut flights at 40 major U.S. airports starting with 4% reductions last Friday and ramping up to 10% by this coming Friday, Nov. 14.

""All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!!,"" Trump said in a post on Truth Social, adding that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for any air traffic controllers who didn't take any time off during the shutdown. He said those who don't immediately return to work would be ""docked.""

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, their union, didn't immediately respond to Trump's comments on Monday.

Disruptions over the weekend totaled 18,576 flights delayed and 4,519 canceled, according to FlightAware. Cancellations spilled over from regional, short-haul jets — which the largest U.S. airlines rely on for around half of domestic flights — to mainline flying.

United Airlines and Delta Air Lines were each offering flight attendants extra pay to pick up flights, according to company messages seen by CNBC. Such extra pay is common during storms or other disruptions. The airlines didn't immediately comment.

A sign of how severe air travel disruptions have become during the government shutdown: Sunday's 2,631 U.S. flight cancellations, 10% of the day's schedule, marked the fourth-worst day since January 2024, Cirium said.

In comparison, on Friday morning, as Trump administration-mandated flight cuts took effect, cancellations ranked 72nd since the start of last year.

The disruptions that upended the travel plans for hundreds of thousands of travelers forced them to look for alternative transportation. Car rental company Hertz last week reported an increase in one-way demand. There's also been increased demand for private jet flights in recent days, according to the CEO of charter and fractional ownership company Flexjet.

Though the Trump administration order didn't initially require private aviation to cut in the same way as commercial airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday began limiting those flights at a dozen U.S. airports. However, many private jet operators don't use the busiest commercial airports, said the National Business Aviation Association.

Air traffic controllers missed their second paycheck of the shutdown on Monday, though they are still required to work. Some of them have taken second jobs to make ends meet, government and union officials have said.

""Now, they must focus on child care instead of traffic flows. Food for their families instead of runway separation,"" Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said at a news conference on Monday. ""The added stress leads to fatigue, the fatigue has led to the erosion of safety and the increased risk every day that this shutdown drags on.""

The Senate made progress overnight on a deal that could end the shutdown, but it has not yet approved a funding bill.

Daniels said it isn't yet clear how long it would take for controllers to receive back pay for their work. In the shutdown that ended in 2019, it took about 2½ months before the workers were made whole, he said.

Cold and snow take hold in eastern two-thirds of the US, from the Great Lakes to Florida and Texas

Floridians have been asked to keep their guard up against iguanas plummeting out of trees and possibly hurting them as temperatures plunge in their state and other parts of the US.

The unusual warning came as one of the season's first blasts of wintry weather began to take hold in the eastern two-thirds of the US, from the Great Lakes to Florida and Texas.

Heavy snow was forecast in northern states, continuing this evening in regions surrounding Lake Michigan. A winter storm warning went into effect on Monday, cautioning the public about wind gusts up to 30mph combined with up to 18in of precipitation, creating a phenomenon known as thundersnow.

In some parts of the midwest, more than a foot of snow had already fallen by Monday morning.

Meanwhile, in Florida, residents were warned of the rare hazard of iguanas falling from trees, as the reptiles become paralyzed by the cold. Freezing temperatures were predicted for the top third of the state, as far south as Gainesville.

Weather experts in Florida warned residents to take the threat of falling iguanas seriously. The reptiles begin to feel sluggish when temperatures drop below 50F and can shut down entirely when they are lower than 40F.

In January 2023, a man taking part in an outdoor yoga session in Miami was struck and injured by an iguana falling from a tree.

The snap will be brief but record-setting, according to meteorologists who say the blast of extremely cold Arctic air from Canada, uncommon this early in November, will extend much farther south and east than usual.

“This storm pattern will introduce some of the coldest air seen for early November and that is the reason for the robust snow amounts expected in the Great Lakes and the far southern extent of the flurries into the southern Appalachians,” said Chad Merrill, AccuWeather's senior meteorologist, on its website.

“The lake-effect snow bands that set up can dump several inches of snow in a short period of time due to the vast temperature difference between the Arctic cold air and the very warm Great Lakes.”

In an advisory on Monday, the National Weather Service said temperatures would “tie or break many records across the south-east through tonight”. The NWS also warned that gusty winds and dry conditions would elevate the threat of fire across the central Gulf coast.

The Arctic air mass, described by CNN as “a full scale polar plunge”, was set to affect almost the entire eastern two-thirds of the US, and was already making travel conditions treacherous in Chicago and other midwest metropolitan areas on Monday morning.

“For some of the major metro areas this snow is coming way earlier than average. Chicago O'Hare, on average, often records the first inch of snowfall accumulation on 17 January,” Merrill said.

Residents of Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin were forecast to see the worst of the weather, while cold weather warnings were issued in Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky.

Some of the earliest snow on record was recorded in Asheville, North Carolina; while an early freeze Monday into Tuesday was expected in numerous other southern states, from Texas and Oklahoma to Alabama and Georgia.

According to AccuWeather, “by Tuesday night, the lake-effect engine will start to wind down”, with the cold air retreating north and pockets of more mild air spreading eastward from the Great Plains.

The cold air will also hasten the end of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season by removing heat from the atmosphere that fuels tropical storms. On average, fewer than 5% of cyclones in any given year form in November, the final month of the season, and cooler sea temperatures inhibit strengthening.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

A man who fainted in the Oval Office last week was a patient of a weight-loss drug company, according to reports.

The individual collapsed during Donald Trump's Oval Office event with pharmaceutical executives from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk on Friday, overshadowing the US president's announcement about cutting the price of weight-loss drugs.

According to The Washington Post, the man, who is believed to be named Gordon, was a patient who was thought to be using Eli Lilly's weight-loss drug.

David Ricks, the chief executive of the healthcare company, described the man as a “guest” of his firm.

“Gordon was one of the Lilly guests at the White House today. He became faint, and if you've ever been in the Oval Office, you stand a long time, and it's warm.

“Pleased to say that the White House medical staff did a great job and he's doing great. So, nothing to be concerned about. Thanks for your concern,” Mr Ricks said.

Mr Trump had been unveiling a move to expand insurance coverage and cut prices for obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy.

“It's a triumph for American patients that will save lives and improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” the president said. 

Administration officials had touted the announcement, which has been praised by both Republicans and Democrats, as “historic”.

However, the event quickly descended into chaos when the individual fainted, prompting Dr Mehmet Oz, a senior health official in Mr Trump's administration, to jump to the rescue.

Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, swiftly walked away, although the White House has insisted he went to fetch help rather than running off as some have suggested.

On Friday, Dr Oz said he had spoken to the mystery fainter after the incident and that he was “doing much better”. Mr Trump later told reporters the individual was “fine”.

Both Wegovy and Zepbound list fainting and dizziness as possible side effects of taking the medication. It has not been confirmed what caused the man to faint.

One photograph, later parodied on Saturday Night Live, showed Mr Trump standing behind the Resolute Desk, staring straight in front of him, while the patient's legs were raised in the air in the background.

The president appeared to be struggling to stay awake before the incident, although this has been denied by the White House.

Gavin Newsom, the California governor who is openly mulling a presidential bid, posted pictures of Mr Trump with his eyes shut on social media, branding him “the Nodfather” and claiming he had ended “wokeness”.

Eli Lilly was contacted for comment.

            A car explosion killed at least 10 people near a metro station at the landmark Red Fort monument in Delhi, India, on Monday.



            More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters.
    


            While the cause of the blast is not yet known, airports, railway stations, government buildings and heritage sites across the country have been put on high alert, according to the Central Industrial Security Force. The US embassy in New Delhi is advising Americans to avoid the surrounding area as well as large crowds.
    


            The Red Fort, known in India as the Lal Qila, is a 17th-century Mughal-era fort named for its large, red sandstone enclosing walls. The UNESCO World Heritage site is visited by tourists throughout the year. 



            Before the explosion, a “slow-moving” vehicle “came to a stop” near a red light around 6:42 p.m. local time (5:42 a.m. ET), Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters.
    


            “An explosion occurred in that vehicle. The passengers in the vehicle and people in surrounding vehicles were impacted,” Golcha said. At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws were set on fire, Reuters reported, citing Delhi's deputy fire chief.
    


            Emergency crews then arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze – after receiving a call at 6:55 p.m. local time (5:55 a.m. ET), Sumit Kumar, a Delhi fire services official, told CNN. Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital.
    


            Authorities will search surveillance cameras in the vicinity of the blast, according to Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, who has visited the site of the attack and met victims at the hospital.
    


            “We are investigating the explosion from every angle,” Golcha, the Delhi police commissioner, added. “The situation is being regularly monitored.”
    


            Footage of the aftermath showed streams of motorcyclists and passersby rushing toward the site of the blast, where huge, orange flames rose into the pitch-black sky. Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood.
    


            “We heard a big sound. Our windows shook,” one resident who did not give a name told Indian broadcaster NDTV, according to Reuters.
    


            Another resident saw the flames from his house. “There was a loud explosion. I live nearby,” Rajdhar Pandey told CNN affiliate CNN News-18.
    


            India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the relatives of those killed. “May the injured recover at the earliest,” he said in a post on X.
    


            Defense Minister Rajnath Singh described the explosion as “painful and disturbing.”
    


            “Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured,” he said on X.

PARIS, November 10. /TASS/. Florian Philippot, the leader of the French political party Les Patriotes, believes that the provocations involving unidentified drones in Belgian airspace and the subsequent calls to defend against them are intended to push the country's leadership to seize frozen Russian assets for further financing of the conflict in Ukraine.

""For several days, Belgium has been subjected to intense propaganda about allegedly 'Russian drones' that seeks to force it to lift its veto on the use of frozen Russian assets! Germany and the United Kingdom even offer to send them military equipment. NATO and the European Union are making every effort to create panic in Belgium and pressure its prime minister!"" the politician wrote on his X page, calling such tactics ""mafia-style.""

Most of Russia's €210 billion in sovereign assets frozen in Europe are blocked at the Euroclear platform in Belgium, which fears it would bear the impact of any Russian retaliatory measures. Earlier, Russian Ambassador to Belgium Denis Gonchar told TASS that expropriating Russian assets under any scheme would be considered ""theft."" He warned that Russia's retaliation ""would be immediate"" and force the West to ""reckon with its losses.""

The EU states continue to discuss ways of further financing Ukraine, including the possibility of granting Kiev a ""reparation loan"" by seizing frozen Russian assets. At the EU summit on October 23, Belgium blocked the European Commission's plan to expropriate Russian assets to provide Ukraine with the so-called reparation loan, fearing retaliation from Russia. Belgium demanded legal guarantees that any financial losses would be distributed among all countries of the bloc. The EU summit postponed the decision on this issue until December and instructed the European Commission to prepare various lending options to Ukraine for 2026-2027. The European Commission press service has repeatedly stated that expropriating Russian assets remains a priority.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Decision to advance bill that would reopen government has sparked furor from party and base; House speaker to swear in Democratic representative when chamber returns, a month after her election win

Senate Democrats who defected in shutdown vote: ‘This was the only deal'

How each senator voted on legislation to end US government shutdown

The eight Democratic and Independent senators who broke ranks with the party to advance a bill that would end the government shutdown – the longest in US history – have defended their decisions amid furor from their party and base.

“What happened tonight is not the closing of a chapter. It's the opening of an opportunity. What the chapter does close is the damaging shutdown that is only getting worse, that is only going to impact more and more people,” said Angus King, the Independent lawmaker from Maine who caucuses with Democrats.

Maggie Hassan, the Democratic senator from New Hampshire, who was part of the bipartisan talks to strike a deal with Republicans, addressed the fact that the revised bill forgoes the Obamacare subsidies that Democrats made a central part of their negotiations.

“Congress has one month to engage in serious, bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act's expiring tax cuts for health insurance,” Hassan wrote in a statement, referring to the vote that GOP lawmakers promised Democrats. “My Democratic colleagues and I have been ready to work on this for months. With the government reopening shortly, Senate Republicans must finally come to the table – or, make no mistake, Americans will remember who stood in the way.”

Meanwhile, senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who was part of the small faction of Democrats in the upper chamber who voted in favor of the original House-passed funding bill on several occasions, said that “it should've never come to this,” referring to the ongoing 40-day shutdown. ““I'm sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven't been paid in weeks,” he added.

An important note. None of the Democratic senators who voted yes on Sunday's procedural motion are up for re-election in 2026. Two of them, Dick Durbin of Illinois, and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, are retiring next year, while the earliest that any of the others would face a challenge would be in 2028.

On the topic of the government inching towards reopening, a White House official told the Guardian that “the action in the Senate is a positive development” and that “we look forward to seeing it progress.”

“President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down,” the official said.

A reminder that the Senate is trying to fast-track the bill, by getting all 100 lawmakers to get it on the floor for a vote, then they'll need it to pass the House before it lands on Trump's desk for a signature.

Here's a side-by-side comparison of the original and edited footage from the edition of Panorama that Donald Trump is threatening legal action over, which shows how the BBC selectively edited a speech, resulting in the organisation being accused of making it appear clearer that Trump encouraged the US Capitol attack.

Broadcast a week before the 2024 US election, the episode spliced together clips of a Trump speech made on 6 January 2021. The spliced clip suggested that Trump told the crowd: ‘We're going to walk down to the Capitol and I'll be there with you, and we fight. We fight like hell.' The words were taken from sections of his speech almost an hour apart. (Here's our explainer on what Trump actually said).

Tim Davie, the BBC's director general, and the head of BBC News have since resigned.

House speaker Mike Johnson said he's hoping to vote as soon as Wednesday on the Senate's deal to reopen the government, four sources on a conference call with House Republicans this morning have told NBC News.

While the exact timing will depend on how quickly the Senate is able to move on the bill, as we've reported earlier Johnson has urged House members to begin traveling back to Washington as soon as possible.

In a speech on the Senate floor, majority leader John Thune called for the quick passage of legislation to reopen the government, which cleared a key hurdle in the chamber yesterday evening. “I'm grateful that the end is in sight,” he said. “The American people have suffered for long enough. Let's not pointlessly drag this bill out.” Over in the House, speaker Mike Johnson this morning urged representatives to begin traveling back to Washington to vote on legislation to reopen the government. The compromise bill that emerged yesterday funds the government through January, but does not include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats had demanded.

It was able to proceed thanks to the support of eight members of the Democratic caucus, all of whom are moderates or set to soon retire. Those Democratic and Independent senators who broke ranks with the party to advance the bill have this morning defended their decisions amid furor from their party and base. In a statement after the vote, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hammpshire stood by her decision. “This was the only deal on the table. It was our best chance to reopen the government and immediately begin negotiations to extend the ACA tax credits,” she said.

In a development that is sure to breathe new life into the saga of the Epstein files, a spokesman for Johnson said he plans to swear in newly elected Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva as soon as the chamber returns to session, likely later this week. Grijalva is expected to be the 218th signature on a petition that will force a vote in the House on a bill to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who died six years ago while facing sex-trafficking charges. Johnson has refused to swear her in for over a month, in an effort to pressure the Democrats into reopening the government.

Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures after a campaign against the broadcaster that reached fever pitch over criticism that its flagship documentary programme in 2024 used a misleading edit of a Trump speech. Here is our explainer on what Trump actually said, the BBC's apology, and our main report.

The US supreme court announced it will hear a high stakes case about whether states can accept mail-in ballots that arrive after election day, even if they are filled out and mailed before then. The case, Watson v Republican National Committee, involves a challenge to a Mississippi law that allows ballots to count if they are received within five business days of election day.

Christine Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's daughter, has announced that she is running for a California state senate seat, ending speculation that she might run for the seat long held by her mother in the House.

Activists are calling for people not to shop at major retailers Target, Amazon or Home Depot during the Thanksgiving week sales to send a message to the companies that they need to stand up for democracy. Dubbed “We Ain't Buying It”, the call to action announced today asks shoppers to not buy anything from those three stores from 27 November to 1 December, or Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, some of the biggest shopping days of the year.

Activists are calling for people not to shop at major retailers Target, Amazon or Home Depot during the Thanksgiving week sales to send a message to the companies that they need to stand up for democracy.

Dubbed “We Ain't Buying It”, the call to action announced today asks shoppers to not buy anything from those three stores from 27 November to 1 December, or Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday, some of the biggest shopping days of the year.

A website for the campaign explains how these three retailers were chosen:

This action is taking direct aim at Target, for caving to this administration's biased attacks on DEI; Home Depot, for allowing and colluding with ICE to kidnap our neighbors on their properties; and Amazon, for funding this administration to secure their own corporate tax cuts.

Instead of shopping at these retailers, participants should support “Black, Immigrant and POC-owned businesses, small and local shops, retailers that have stood firm for democracy and inclusion” and “use the time and money to connect with those you love, and rediscover what matters”.

The plans come as millions have marched in the streets against the Trump administration and after boycotts of Target for its abandonment of diversity initiatives and of Disney after it temporarily took Jimmy Kimmel off the air in response to government pressure. Economic pressure campaigns are likely to increase this year as those opposed to Trump find ways to exert their power without Democratic party control in Washington.

Some of the groups behind the boycott are 50501, Black Voters Matter, Indivisible, Until Freedom and the Working Families Party.

“All year, companies like Target, Amazon, and Home Depot have quietly collaborated with Trump to entrench his power and to do his bidding. We won't stand for it,” said Leah Greenberg, co-executive director of Indivisible.

We'll send a clear message: stop complying with this lawless, vicious, bigoted agenda. Stand up for American democracy, civil rights, and our communities. Our dollars will go to people who share our values.

Christine Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's daughter, has announced that she is running for a California state senate seat, ending speculation that she might run for the seat long held by her mother in the House.

“I'm running to represent you, San Francisco, in Sacramento,” she said in an announcement video posted on X. “Fighting for consumer rights, women's rights, gun violence survivors, immigrants and our most vulnerable communities against the threat we face.”

Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she would not seek re-election. Her daughter is an attorney and Democratic party organizer, and is running for the seat currently held by state senator Scott Wiener, who is one of those running for Pelosi's congressional seat.

In a development that is sure to breathe new life into the saga of the Epstein files, a spokesman for Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said he plans to swear in newly elected Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva as soon as the chamber returns to session, likely later this week.

Grijalva was elected in a September special election to a seat representing southern Arizona that her late father, Raúl Grijalva, held for more than two decades.

At the time, Johnson was keeping the House recessed in an effort to pressure Democrats to pass a government funding bill through the Senate, and said he would swear her in once he called the chamber back into session – which he would only do once Democrats renewed government funding.

They have now done so, and Johnson said he will call the House back as soon as the Senate votes on final passage of the bill.

Grijalva is expected to be the 218th signature on a petition that will force a vote in the House on a bill to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who died six years ago while facing sex trafficking charges.

Epstein was a one-time associate of Donald Trump, and while campaigning last year, the president and his allies flirted with conspiracies that Epstein was at the center of a conspiracy to procure minors for abuse by global elites.

An uproar began in July when the justice department announced that it would not reveal further details about the Epstein case, leading to a push by congressional Democrats to release files related to his prosecution, which they believe will shed more light on his ties. While Trump has sought to release some documents related to the case, he opposes release of the files, calling them a “Democrat hoax”.

The expected House vote on the matter is expected to once again shine a light on the issue, which had faded into the background amid the larger struggle in Congress over funding the government.

Per an earlier post, House speaker Mike Johnson this morning urged representatives to begin traveling back to Washington to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

He told reporters on Capitol Hill that once the Senate passed its version of the bill to end the shutdown, he would issue a formal 36-hour notice for House members to return to Washington “so that we can vote as soon as possible” to pass the amended bill and get it to Trump's desk.

“There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” Johnson said. (A reminder that Johnson could have kept the House in session during the shutdown, but he chose not to since 19 September to pressure Democrats into reopening the government).

Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures after a campaign against the broadcaster that reached fever pitch over criticism that its flagship documentary programme in 2024 used a misleading edit of a Trump speech.

Lawyers for Trump said that the BBC must retract the Panorama documentary by Friday or face a lawsuit for “no less” than $1bn (£760m), according to US media outlets who cited the letter. The BBC has confirmed it had received a letter and said it will respond in due course.

The resignations of the BBC director general, Tim Davie, and its News CEO, Deborah Turness, came after the rightwing Telegraph newspaper published a leaked internal report by a former BBC standards adviser alleging failings in the broadcaster's coverage. The report criticised BBC coverage on transgender issues, Israel's war in Gaza and an edit of a Trump speech from January 6 during the Capitol Hill insurrection.

“Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!,” Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.

The leaked BBC report said the current affairs Panorama documentary had “completely misled” viewers by splicing two parts of Trump's speech together. The Panorama edit cut together quotes from sections of the speech delivered up to an hour apart, combining a line about walking to the Capitol with the instruction to “fight like hell”.

The BBC chair, Samir Shah, later on Monday apologised for the editing of the Trump speech, calling it an “error of judgment”.

Trump in fact gave conflicting advice that day to supporters, who he had called on to gather in the capital as part of his efforts to discredit his election loss based on false claims of widespread fraud. The US president was later impeached for “incitement of insurrection” related to the storming of the Capitol by rioters, but he was acquitted by the Senate after Republicans rallied around him.

In a speech on the Senate floor, majority leader John Thune called for the quick passage of legislation to reopen the government, which cleared a key hurdle in the chamber yesterday evening. He said:

I'm grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro bill or anti bill, not to stand in the way of our being able to deliver the coming relief quickly.

The American people have suffered for long enough. Let's not pointlessly drag this bill out.

The compromise bill that emerged yesterday funds the government through January, but does not include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats had demanded. It was able to proceed thanks to the support of eight members of the Democratic caucus, all of whom are moderates or set to soon retire.

The rest of the Democratic caucus opposes the measure, and any one lawmaker could stop Thune from moving to vote on final passage of the bill as soon as today.

Over in the House, speaker Mike Johnson has said that as soon as the bill passes, he will give the chamber's lawmakers 36 hours' notice to return to Washington DC. He has kept the chamber out of session since 19 September to pressure Democrats into reopening the government.

As Democratic senators who broke ranks from their party continue to face heat from most of their colleagues, senator Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire, defended her decision in an interview with CNN today. “We need to get the government open because we have millions of Americans who are suffering, whether it's because they're not getting their food benefits or because travelers can't get their flights,” she said.

The lawmaker, who is retiring in 2026, said she was confident that Republicans were “willing to come to the table” when it comes to a vote on the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are notably missing from the bill Shaheen, and others, agreed to advance.

“We've heard the same thing from the White House. So, now we'll see. We'll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance,” she added.

Syria's president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has arrived at the White House according to the press pool, who noted that he was due to enter through the West Wing, but ended up not getting eyes on his motorcade.

The Syrian leader's meeting with Donald Trump has also started, per the pool reporters. A reminder, that the administration has began undoing US sanctions on Syria in May, ahead of Trump's first meeting with al-Sharaa in Riyadh. They're expected to discuss this further today.

Today, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, announced the removal of a “black box” of warnings across hormone replacement therapy (HRT) – often estrogen and progesterone products that are prescribed to those contending with low levels of these hormones while experiencing menopause.

“Millions of women were told to fear the very therapy that could have given them strength, peace and dignity through one of life's most difficult transitions,” Kennedy said. “We're challenging outdated thinking and recommitting to evidence based medicine that empowers rather than restricts when prescribed response started early, hormone replacement therapy transforms the lives of women.”

The HHS noted ahead of today's announcement that the use of HRT “plummeted in the early 2000s” when the Food and Drug Administration applied “boxed warnings following a Women's Health Initiative study that found a statistically non-significant increase in the risk of breast cancer diagnosis”.

Per our earlier post about the $2,000 payments that Donald Trump said he would dole out to Americans as the country collects tariff revenue, he's added that “all money left over” will be “used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT” in a post on Truth Social.

This, along with the payments themselves, defies Congress's control of government spending. While Trump can suggest how this money is spent, urging lawmakers to pass legislation that confers money to various groups and programs, federal law prohibits him from unilaterally deciding where funds go.

The US supreme court announced on Monday it will hear a high stakes case about whether states can accept mail-in ballots that arrive after election day, even if they are filled out and mailed before then.

The case, Watson v Republican National Committee, involves a challenge to a Mississippi law that allows ballots to count if they are received within 5 business days of election day. Sixteen states, as well as Washington DC, Guam, and Puerto Rico, allow a mail-in ballot from a domestic voter to count if it arrives in a certain timeframe after election day but is postmarked by the election. The policy is designed to ensure that voters who put their ballot in the mail ahead of election day are not punished if the mail is slow.

A federal judge in Mississippi upheld the state's law, but it was reversed by the US court of appeals for the 5th circuit, one of the most conservative courts in the US. The majority in that court said that federal law sets one day as the day for federal elections and allowing ballots to arrive after that undermines the law.

Donald Trump and Republicans have railed against the practice of allowing ballots to arrive after election day. At least three states this year have ended the practice of allowing late-arriving ballots, and a March executive order by the president sought to punish states that allowed the practice. Lawsuits against portion of the executive order are still ongoing.

At his daily press conference, the speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, said that he welcomed the news that “some senate democrats finally have stepped forward to end the pain” of the government shutdown.

Johnson added that he would call all House members to return to Washington as soon as the Senate has its final vote. As of now, it's not clear how long that might take and if the lawmakers will be able to expedite the process using unanimous consent.

“We have to do this as quickly as possible. We look forward to the government reopening this week so Congress can get back, can get back to our regular legislative session,” he said.

Despite the seismic shift on Capitol Hill over the, Johnson took no questions from reporter.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

The Central Weather Administration (CWA) yesterday issued a sea alert for Typhoon Fung-wong (鳳凰) as it threatened vessels operating in waters off the Pratas Islands (Dongsha Islands, 東沙群島), the Bashi Channel and south of the Taiwan Strait.

A land alert is expected to be announced some time between late last night and early this morning, the CWA said. 

As of press time last night,  Taoyuan, as well as Yilan, Hualien and Penghu counties had declared today a typhoon day, canceling work and classes. Except for a few select districts in Taipei and New Taipei City, all other areas and city and counties announced that today would be a regular work day.

As of 5:40pm yesterday, the typhoon was 490km southwest of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), the agency said.

It was moving northwest at 13kph, with the storm's radius expanding to 250km.  

Extremely heavy rainfall is expected in east Taiwan, as well as mountainous areas in the Greater Taipei area and Hengchun Peninsula today due to the combined influences of the northeast monsoon and typhoon, CWA specialist Lin Ping-yu (林秉煜) said.

By 5pm yesterday, ocean waves around the country had reached 3m — and 6m in the southeast coast, Lin said.

Taiwan would be mostly affected by the northeast monsoon today, he said, adding that winds are expected to become stronger in the south and east tomorrow as the typhoon moves closer to the nation's southwest coast.

“The typhoon is still a little far from Taiwan. We are not certain at this point where it would make landfall and how it would affect [the nation]. We are closely monitoring its development,” he said.

Meanwhile, the northeast wind is expected to rise again on Thursday when the typhoon is forecast to weaken and move away from Taiwan, he added.

Heavy rainfall is expected in central and southern Taiwan, as well as Hualien and Taitung counties tomorrow, with the rain in the east coast significantly easing compared with today, he said.  

By Thursday, rain across the nation is expected to significantly ease, with isolated showers forecast in northern Taiwan due to the northeast wind, Lin said.

The Hualien County Government yesterday announced closures of schools and offices in Guangfu Township (光復). It also issued a red alert for Guangfu, Wanrong (萬榮), Fonglin (鳳林) and other townships close to a barrier lake at the Mataian River (馬太鞍溪) for potential damage, with more than 8,000 residents ordered to evacuate.

Guangfu was heavily damaged in September after heavy rainfall brought by Typhoon Ragasa broke a barrier lake along the river, unleashing millions of tonnes of water and mud that swept into the township, destroying infrastructure, killing 19 people and leaving five people missing..

Minister of the Interior Liu Shyh-fang (劉世芳) said that eight water pumps have been deployed along the creek to help drain the floodwater.

The government would coordinate the deployment of military personnel and other resources to assist Hualien during the typhoon, she said.

The government will continue to closely monitor the barrier lake, and a team of specialists is working on long-term solutions to the problem, she said.

The Coast Guard Administration said those entering coastal areas designated by local governments as restricted zones would be fined.

The typhoon also disrupted operation of the Alishan Railway, with the service from Chiayi to Alishan (阿里山) canceled today, the Forestry and Nature Conservation Agency said, adding that the two-way railway services would be canceled tomorrow and on Thursday.

Railway services would resume once the safety of the route is confirmed, it said.

As of 2am yesterday, Fung-Wong was about 1,760km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost point, moving west-northwest at 26kph. 
It is forecast to reach Luzon in the northern Philippines by tomorrow, the CWA said. 
After entering the South China Sea, Typhoon Fung-Wong is likely to turn northward toward Taiwan, CWA forecaster Chang Chun-yao (張峻堯) said, adding that it would likely make landfall near central Taiwan. 
The CWA expects to issue a land                                    



                                                                                Taiwan's exports soared to an all-time high of US$61.8 billion last month, surging 49.7 percent from a year earlier, as the global frenzy for artificial intelligence (AI) applications and new consumer electronics powered shipments of high-tech goods, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday.
It was the first time exports had exceeded the US$60 billion mark, fueled by the global boom in AI development that has significantly boosted Taiwanese companies across the international supply chain, Department of Statistics Director-General Beatrice Tsai (蔡美娜) told a media briefing.
“There is a consensus among major AI players that the upcycle is still in its early stage,”                                    



                                                                                The Central Weather Administration (CWA) yesterday said it is expected to issue a sea warning for Typhoon Fung-wong this afternoon and a land warning tomorrow.
As of 1pm, the storm was about 1,070km southeast of Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost point, and was moving west-northwest at 28 to 32kph, according to CWA data.
The storm had a radius of 250km, with maximum sustained winds of 173kph and gusts reaching 209kph, the CWA added.
The storm is forecast to pass near Luzon in the Philippines before entering the South China Sea and potentially turning northward toward Taiwan, the CWA said.
CWA forecaster Chang Chun-yao (張峻堯) said                                    



                                                                                Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi yesterday said that China using armed force against Taiwan could constitute a ""survival-threatening situation"" for Japan, allowing the country to mobilize the Japanese armed forces under its security laws.
Takaichi made the remarks during a parliamentary session while responding to a question about whether a ""Taiwan contingency"" involving a Chinese naval blockade would qualify as a ""survival-threatening situation"" for Japan, according to a report by Japan's Asahi Shimbun.
""If warships are used and other armed actions are involved, I believe this could constitute a survival-threatening situation,"" Takaichi was quoted as saying in the report.

Justices declined to hear an appeal from Kim Davis over a $360,000 fee she was ordered to pay.

The Supreme Court has declined to hear a bid from anti-LGBTQ activist Kim Davis to challenge its landmark 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide.

The High Court dismissed Davis's petition without comment on Monday. The decision means that the Obergefell v. Hodges decision will stand for now, after the Court struck fear into the LGBTQ community last week when it privately met to discuss the appeal on Friday.

The Court only needed four justices to agree to revisit the case. The original Obergefell decision was a 5-4 ruling, and several of the justices who dissented still sit on the Court — Justices Samuel Alito, John Roberts, and Clarence Thomas. Further, one of the judges who ruled in the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was replaced with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

Experts were still skeptical that the Court would take up the case. Thomas indicated in his opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson that he wanted the Court to revisit Obergefell, and Davis's challenge directly cited Thomas's words.

However, other conservative justices have indicated otherwise in recent months. 

Alito recently criticized the decision in a lecture, but said that he didn't think it should be overruled due to “respect afforded” to precedent. Barrett also suggested recently that she didn't believe that same sex marriage rights should be overturned.

Davis, represented by right-wing group Liberty Counsel, had filed the appeal seeking to avoid paying hefty fees in relation to her anti-LGBTQ activism. The fees stemmed from a challenge by a couple who she refused a marriage license to shortly after the Obergefell ruling came down in June 2015. Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky, lost that case in 2023, and was ordered to pay the couple $360,000 in damages and legal fees.

Her legal counsel has argued that Davis's declining to issue a license to same-sex couples is a right afforded to her under the First Amendment, even though legal experts have said that public officials have those rights suspended in order to perform their roles on behalf of the government. 

Davis's legal challenge framed her as a “victim” of the Obergefell decision, adding that her case was a “unique opportunity” to revisit and overturn the decision. 

The Supreme Court's decision was praised by LGBTQ advocates.

“Today, love won again. When public officials take an oath to serve their communities, that promise extends to everyone — including LGBTQ+ people. The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences,” said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson in a statement.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","The Senate cleared a key hurdle. Here's what has to happen next to reopen the government","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/politics/reopen-federal-government-next-steps","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:20:04 GMT","


            The Senate cleared a major hurdle toward reopening the government Sunday night, when eight Democrats joined with Republicans on a key vote to advance a federal funding measure.
    


Who are the Democrats voting with Republicans on the government shutdown deal?



            There are still a number of steps ahead to end the historic shutdown – with lots of uncertainty on timing. But party leaders believe lawmakers will, indeed, end the stalemate this week.
    


            Here's what still needs to happen on Capitol Hill to reopen the federal government.
    


            Now, senators need to agree on how long to debate before voting on the final bill. This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process.
    


            For example, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who voted against advancing the measure, wants a vote on an amendment related to hemp grown in his state. It's unclear if that will happen.
    


            Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it “remains to be seen” when the Senate will be able to vote on final passage of the bill, though he hopes it passes early this week.
    


            The final package would fund the government until January 30 and some key agencies through the remainder of fiscal year 2026. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded.
    


            Once it passes the Senate, the package heads to the House, which will present its own host of complications.
    


            Members of the House were advised to expect votes this week.
    


            House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin majority, and he'll likely need the president's help to muscle it through his fractious conference.
    


            Praising the Senate for reaching a deal to reopen the government and warning his members to make their way back to Washington, Johnson said Monday: “I'm stating the obvious all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.”
    


How Johnson and Jeffries' once-collegial relationship has soured in the era of Trump and shutdown politics



            Johnson said he will give 36-hour notice to House members for a vote as soon as the Senate has final passage of the CR in the Senate.
    


            “At least some Democrats,” he said, “now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks.”
    


            House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats' health care demands, so it's not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson approve it.
    


            House Democrats are set to huddle as a caucus on Monday, according to a personal familiar with the discussions.
    


            Though the next few days will be critical, a source familiar with the matter said GOP leaders are optimistic about the funding bill's chances for passage in the House. And a Democratic source familiar expects some in the party will cross lines to support it, though it remains to be seen how many.
    


            Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature.
    


            The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30.
    


            The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture.
    


            That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray.
    


            The package does not include a guarantee from Republicans to extend the expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies that have been at the heart of the funding fight.
    


            As part of the deal struck between Republicans and the Senate Democratic centrists, there's expected to be a future Senate vote on the subsidies.
    


            Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump's increasing opposition in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.
    


            The deal also includes an agreement to reverse all of the federal firings during the shutdown and ensure that all federal workers get paid what they were owed while the shutdown occurred.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=us+national+news+site:cnn.com","‘Project Athena': What to know about the leaked plan written by Trump's NASA pick","https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/10/science/nasa-jared-isaacman-project-athena","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:07:37 GMT","


            A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump's on-again-off-again pick to run NASA, billionaire Jared Isaacman, outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency.
    


            Isaacman, who was tapped to be NASA administrator after Trump was elected in 2024, only to see his nomination retracted months later, was renominated for the top job last Tuesday.
    


            While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he said in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete.
    


            It nonetheless set off a flurry of speculation about how the space agency would function with Isaacman at the helm. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN.
    


            In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman said that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.”
    


            “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads.
    


            Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency.
    


            If enacted, many of the policies laid out could significantly alter the day-to-day lives of NASA workers and transform the 67-year-old agency.
    


            “I think it is presenting a more dramatic set of changes than many in the space community were expecting,” said Casey Dreier, the chief of space policy at the nonprofit exploration advocacy group Planetary Society, of the document.
    


            Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country.
    


            Isaacman still faces a confirmation vote in the Senate and would need Congressional approval for many of the objectives mapped out in the document.
    


            As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice flown to orbit on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA's top role.
    


            Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants.
    


            But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he's perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era.
    


            According to a source familiar with the matter, the original Project Athena document was more than 100 pages. Isaacman made only three hard copies of a truncated 62-page version and distributed them to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and his chief of staff. The leak — according to a recent Ars Technica report and a source who confirmed the account to CNN — looked to have been part of an effort by Duffy, who is temporarily running NASA, to spur controversy and potentially thwart Isaacman's renomination.
    


            CNN previously reported that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter.
    


            A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he's said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.)
    


            “If there is any friction, I suspect it is more political operators causing the controversy,” Isaacman said.
    


            Isaacman was renominated for the NASA post on November 4, one day after reports about the Athena document began circulating in the news.
    


            “I think (the people who leaked Project Athena) thought this would ruffle feathers amongst the delegations that care about human spaceflight,” said one former NASA official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private document. “I will tell you — it hasn't worked.”
    


            CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia and Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland — the home of Goddard Space Flight Center — offered the most detailed responses.
    


            Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.”
    


            “To protect our nation's innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration's chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said.
    


            Warner, whose state houses NASA's Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.”
    


            “The reported proposals to downsize or privatize key missions at Langley and Wallops would be a serious mistake, jeopardizing critical scientific capabilities and the talented workforce whose expertise keeps the United States at the forefront of aerospace research,” Warner's statement reads.
    


            No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman's confirmation.
    


            One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.”
    


            Much of that vision, the source familiar with the document told CNN, was intended to align NASA with SpaceX's goal of sending an uncrewed Starship spacecraft to the Martian surface next year.
    


            SpaceX's plan, which CEO Elon Musk discussed publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The thinking was that NASA could step in to provide support through the Olympus program at minimal cost to taxpayers, according to the source.
    


            The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel.
    


            Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for RealClearScience that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.”
    


            Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues.
    


            “Our competitors are not waiting. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. If America wants to lead, NASA must take on the hard problems again and do the near-impossible,” Isaacman and Gingrich wrote in the article.
    


            Project Athena also suggests setting up a demonstration mission to dock a nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft with a crewed vehicle in orbit, according to the leaked paper.
    


            Isaacman's nuclear vision also proposes that NASA centers working on projects like the Space Launch System rocket — including the Marshall and Michoud facilities in Alabama and Louisiana — shift their focus to nuclear electric propulsion development when the SLS program concludes.
    


            When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.”
    


            The source familiar with the document noted that it was crafted around the same time the Trump White House drafted the President's Budget Request, or PBR, which called for canceling NASA's SLS rocket and some other major projects that could have left multiple NASA centers without a cornerstone program.
    


            The source said that Isaacman began compiling the Project Athena document in late 2024 and updated it as he had conversations with policymakers. The source also said that Isaacman did not help draft the PBR.
    


            With this summer's “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research.
    


            Isaacman said November 4 on social media that he hopes to zero-in on those pursuits only after a “foundation” of lunar exploration has been built.
    


            When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his inaugural address while staying silent on NASA's ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon.
    


            Isaacman echoed Trump's Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA's moon program. However, questions about how he would fund such projects loomed.
    


            In the months since, however, the moon has emerged as the clear policy priority amid a renewed space race with China, which is aiming to land its taikonauts on the lunar surface by 2030.
    


            The recent push to bolster NASA's moon missions, including a $10 billion influx Congress gave the agency's human spaceflight efforts in July, “brings clarity to the topic,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.
    


            But Isaacman is back in the running for the top NASA job at a time when the agency's plans for a crewed moon landing, called Artemis III, are in flux.
    


            The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX's Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface.
    


            But some policy experts have grown increasingly concerned that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA's urgent timeline.
    


            Duffy recently signaled a willingness to boot SpaceX off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers.
    


            Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman's, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “Sean Dummy.”
    


            Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander.
    


            The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement.
    


            “The plan valued human exploration as much as scientific discovery,” Isaacman said. “It was written as a starting place to give NASA, international partners, and the commercial sector the best chance for long-term success.”
    


            The source familiar with the Project Athena document said some of the more controversial aspects of the plan warrant more explanation.
    


            One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation's ability to gather crucial environmental data.
    


            The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA's initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects.
    


            Such measures, calling for researchers to focus on purchasing data from the private sector, could mark a significant change for the agency.
    


            Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a pair of Mars missions were lost.
    


            And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman's Athena document suggests it can, he said.
    


            “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn't had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said.
    


            Isaacman's social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?”
    


            Isaacman has also publicly defended science programs such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which was slated for budget cuts in the PBR. And he stated he'd be willing to spend his own money to get the Nancy Grace Roman space telescope off the ground. “I was prepared to personally cover the cost to launch Roman — if that's what it took to get to the science,” Isaacman said in a June social media post. (That same promise appears in the Project Athena document.)
    


            “Anything suggesting that I am anti-science or want to outsource that responsibility is simply untrue,” Isaacman's November 4 statement reads.
    


            Among the other proposals in the Project Athena document are plans to hasten NASA's reorganization. The agency has already lost roughly 4,000 of its 18,000 employees as part of the Trump administration's deferred resignation program.
    


            Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.”
    


            Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been reeling from looming budget cuts and what employees have described as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership.
    


            Isaacman's document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA's boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency's approach to risk assessment.
    


            “We will ensure safety is at the forefront of our decisions but achieving the mission of NASA means accepting that some risks are worth taking,” the document reads.
    


            Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency.
    


            It would be unwise, he added, to start eliminating safety organizations — but they could be revamped to create a “healthy tension” between risk assessors and engineers seeking to push boundaries.
    


            However, he cautioned that “it's really hard to know in the moment if you're going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It's a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.”
    


            Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change.
    


            In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump's proposed cuts to research.
    


            Isaacman's renomination to the NASA chief job now presents “a good opportunity to engage on some of these proposals, particularly as they relate to science,” Dreier added.
    


            In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.”
    


            But he did not wish to debate the plan “line-by-line while NASA and the rest of the government are going through a shutdown,” according to the November 4 post.
    


            More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.
    


            In a social media post in June, for example, Isaacman wrote that he “didn't love” being approached by “people who thought they were uniquely NASA's savior.” He added: “I have little interest in doing the same.”

            President Donald Trump, embattled by America's growing affordability problems, has once again floated a unique solution: Sending Americans rebate checks for the tariffs that his administration has collected.
    


            “People that are against Tariffs are FOOLS!” Trump posted on Truth Social Sunday. “A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone.”
    


            It's a bold promise with several significant complications.
    


            Trump has frequently floated the idea of tariff rebate checks. Prior to this weekend's proposal, Trump in August had said Americans could receive a portion of the tariff revenue.
    


            “We're taking in so much money that we may very well make a dividend to the people of America,” Trump said at the time.
    


            While American importers foot the initial tariff bill, they've been passing along some of those added costs to consumers, meaning Americans are indirectly paying for tariffs, too.
    


            The idea sounds similar to stimulus checks that went out in the wake of the pandemic recession — once towards the end of Trump's first term, in 2020; and again in 2021 when former President Joe Biden was in office. But Trump suggested that these tariff rebate checks could be funded not by a general pool of taxpayer funds but instead from the money collected by US importers who pay the historic tariffs Trump has imposed on a vast number of goods from overseas.
    


            Trump's top economic adviser threw some cold water on the rebate checks.
    


            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was noncommittal about the proposal on Sunday in an interview with ABC's “This Week.” Bessent said no formal proposals have been made to distribute tariff revenue and suggested Trump's mention of a $2,000 payment “could come in lots of forms,” including making up for lost revenue from not taxing tips, overtime and Social Security payments.
    


            The Trump administration has collected more than $220 billion in tariff revenue, which includes a mix of various tariffs Trump has imposed and previous tariffs that were in place before Trump took office, according to the US Treasury.
    


            More than 163 million Americans filed tax returns in 2024, the IRS said.
    


            So a back-of-the-envelope calculation would put $2,000 stimulus checks at a total cost of about $326 billion. That's more than the tariff revenue America has collected since Trump's second term began.
    


            Trump said he would exclude wealthy Americans, but it's not clear where the cut-off would be and whether that could make up for the difference.
    


            Even with an income threshold of $100,000 — far from the highest income tax bracket — around 150 million adults would qualify. That would cost the administration roughly $300 billion, wrote Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, in a post on X.
    


            According to a Monday morning social media post, the president seems to think there would be enough money left after tariff rebate checks are doled out to help pay down the nation's nearly $40 trillion in debt.
    


            “All money left over from the $2000 payments made to low and middle income USA Citizens, from the massive Tariff Income pouring into our Country from foreign countries, which will be substantial, will be used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
    


            A White House official didn't specify what requirements would need to be met to qualify for a check. “The Administration is committed to putting this money to good use for the American people,” the official told CNN.
    


            Another complicating factor: The Supreme Court appears skeptical of the Trump administration's use of emergency powers to impose tariffs. About $100 billion of the total tariff revenue so far has been collected through this method.
    


            If the court rules against the Trump administration, it may have to return that money to businesses, which would significantly reduce the amount of tariff money available as a rebate for American households.
    


            It could also complicate the process of refunding businesses if money has already been distributed to individuals.
    


            Almost certainly not.
    


            Congress maintains the power of the purse, and past stimulus checks have required Congressional approval, and it's unclear if Trump has enough support to pass something like this.
    


            Although stimulus checks have proven politically popular in the past, they have come almost exclusively during recessions or emergencies. The American economy is in neither at the moment.
    


            Rebate checks could exacerbate rising prices at a time when Americans say inflation and affordability are their top concern. Sending out checks could give America's economy a sugar rush at the worst possible time and could ultimately ding American households if the Federal Reserve needs to hike its benchmark interest rate to counteract rising prices.
    


            That could lose Trump some key votes among fiscal conservatives in his own party.
    


            Even if the rebate checks get approval, don't hold your breath.
    


            During the pandemic, Americans who elected to receive direct deposit checks had the money in their bank accounts within about a week of the first stimulus package passing. Where it got much more dicey was for the Americans who elected to receive paper checks. That process took around 20 weeks.

            In a pivotal move, the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday said it is taking steps to remove the lengthy “black box” warning on many hormone treatments for women with menopause symptoms — a shift expected to give women more options for treatment and generate a flood of new prescriptions.
    


            Hormone therapy has long been on the market, but prescriptions plummeted after 2003, when the warning described increased risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, breast cancer and dementia.
    


            “After 23 years of dogma, the FDA today is announcing that we are going to stop the fear machine steering women away from this life-changing, even life-saving, treatment,” Makary said Monday in announcing the change.
    


            Prescribing requires nuance, FDA officials said Monday, especially around when women start hormone therapy. Some women still face some risks from hormone therapy, including women at increased risk of blood clots or who have previously had breast cancer.
    


            But for many women, the benefits may far outweigh the risks.
    


            “With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,” Makary posted on X Monday morning.
    


            It could take months for the labels to change, but drugmakers are “very excited” to make the update, Makary said. Label changes will include updated guidance that hormones should be initiated in women who are younger than age 60 or within 10 years of menopause to optimize benefits and risks, and removal of guidance to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time — clearing the way for women to stay on the treatments for years.
    


            “We want people to talk to their doctors, and we want doctors to have the right information, and part of that means removing these scary black box warnings and putting the nuanced discussion in the package insert of the medications,” Makary said.
    


Changes to ‘black box' warning on hormone therapy for menopause symptoms expected soon, FDA chief says



            Women's health experts praised the move to update the boxed warning to reflect newer scientific evidence around menopausal hormone therapy but said individualized discussions of risks and benefits will still be needed.
    


            Dr. JoAnn Manson, who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a past president of The Menopause Society, said the labeling change was overdue.
    


            “As a bottom line, I think given more than 20 years of class wide labeling of hormone therapy, it is time to get the labeling right, and some of these changes that are proposed are very well supported. Others may be controversial, but overall, it is a step in the right direction,” said Manson, who was one of the original investigators on the Women's Health Initiative study that spurred the label change.
    


            “Right now, this box warning is a one-size-fits-all summary that hormone therapy increases the risk of all these conditions,” Manson said. “It doesn't take into account, you know, whether it's local estrogen or systemic estrogen, the age of the woman, the type of the formulation.”
    


            Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said she is among many doctors who advocated for label changes for years.
    


            “Removing the scary boxed warning from local vaginal estrogen is a victory for women's health and for those who care for and about menopausal women,” Pinkerton said in a statement. “Regarding the removal of the boxed warning for systemic hormone therapy, which is absorbed into the bloodstream and has systemic effects throughout the body, we appreciate the FDA's thoughtful, nuanced approach. Discussions will be more complicated and need to be individualized, as different menopause therapies differ in potential risks.”
    


            The black box warning is the strongest type of alert the FDA puts on a drug label. Since 2003, labels of menopause treatments that contain estrogen – including pills, patches, sprays and creams – have warned that their use can increase the risk of uterine and breast cancers, as well as strokes and blood clots. The labels also warned about an increased risk of dementia for women over the age of 65.
    


            The black box warning, or boxed warning, was added after a large government-funded study, the Women's Health Initiative, found in 2002 that women taking estrogen pills after menopause had some higher health risks compared with women who took a placebo. The study participants had an average age of 63, so many were past menopause when they started the therapy.
    


            After the study and the label change, doctors became reluctant to prescribe them and prescriptions for hormone therapy for menopause dropped by more than 70%. In the late 1990s, more than 1 in 4 postmenopausal women were taking hormones to manage symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings and night sweats. By 2020, that number had dropped to about 1 in 25, one study found.
    


Black box warning on menopause hormone therapies should be removed, experts say



            The result has been undertreatment of symptoms that can be debilitating for women in midlife.
    


            “It's been a total horrible tragedy that so many millions of women have been deprived,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, a New York-based internist and author of the books “Don't Let Your Doctor Kill You” and “The New Hormone Solution.”
    


            “Hormone therapy is important because for about 10 to 15 years before you go into menopause, your hormones start leaving you. As your hormones start leaving you, you need more hormones. And you don't need hormone replacement – you need hormone supplementation,” Schwartz said.
    


            “Chronic illnesses like heart disease, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, cancer, they are diseases of aging, and one reason is the loss of hormones.”
    


            More recent analyses of the Women's Health Initiative, as early as 2010, have since shown that hormone therapy started in women younger than 60, or within 10 years of starting menopause, can more safely help manage menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and poor sleep as long as the women don't have specific contraindications such as a history of hormone-sensitive breast or uterine cancer.
    


Menopause symptoms cost billions in medical expenses and lost days of work, study suggests



            “To this day, I still have patients coming in telling me their obstetricians or gynecologists have said to them they shouldn't be taking hormones, because they're going to get cancer. And not only will they not get cancer, the hormones will protect them from cancer,” Schwartz said. “We have the data.”
    


            In July, the FDA convened a panel of experts to discuss the benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy for women. The panelists urged the agency to remove the warning label.
    


            In October, Makary told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an episode of the “Chasing Life” podcast that the agency was in “serious discussions” about what to do with the black box warning.
    


            “It's really a tragedy. It's maybe one of the greatest screw-ups of modern medicine,” Makary said. “It's resulted in 50 million women being denied this incredible therapy.”
    


            The FDA action follows a wave of policies introduced across the country to improve menopause care at the state level. Most of the legislation has been related to insurance coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace.
    


            “When we think about the timing of this announcement, it's not just the FDA making a move. It comes in the good company of now 19 states, red and blue alike, introducing more than 35 bills to improve menopause care,” said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women's Leadership Center at the New York University School of Law, who has been tracking menopause legislation.
    


‘A national movement': More than a dozen states consider laws around menopause care and training for doctors



            “All these things are happening at the same time, and that's in part because there is a loud and proud movement making these demands now, insisting that menopause care be equitable and treatments accessible, that menopause no longer be in the shadows and that we not be subject to misinformation,” said Weiss-Wolf, author of the forthcoming book, “When In Menopause: A User's Manual and Citizens Guide.”
    


            The removal of the warning on hormone for menopause has long been in the making, several experts who spoke to CNN said.
    


            “Back in 2014, the Menopause Society and other leading menopause experts had actually started a petition to the FDA to remove the label,” Weiss-Wolf said. “This is something that the menopause medical community has been asking for.”
    


            The action will change the landscape of care to make hormone therapy, especially estrogen, more accessible for midlife women, said Dr. Jayne Morgan, an Atlanta-based cardiologist and vice president of medical affairs at Hello Heart, an app that specializes in women's health and cardiovascular research.
    


            “The fact of the matter is – estrogen is one of the primary drivers of the heart. There are estrogen receptors on the heart, on the brain, in the bones, so it's like the fuel that drives our body. Once that fuel runs out, it's just like a car, the car begins to sputter,” Morgan said.
    


            “Women live about six years longer than men, but we spend about 25% of our lives in lower quality of life,” she said. “That's where hormone therapy can help.”

Fox News Digital spoke to Defending Education President Nicole Neily about schools across the country continuing to hide their DEI efforts from federal scrutiny and what her group is doing about it.

As universities across the country have been accused of trying to hide their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to avoid federal scrutiny, Fox News Digital spoke to a leading parents' rights activist about how serious the problem is and what can be done about it. 

""I look at… the responses to the Trump administration and the executive orders falling into three buckets,"" Nicole Neily, founder and president of the nonpartisan grassroots organization Defending Education, told Fox News Digital about the continuation of DEI activities despite the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate it. 

Neily explained, ""The first bucket are the proud resisters. I put Princeton, Harvard, schools like that in that category, where they're just going to, you know, ‘hashtag resist' and do their thing. The second bucket is, I think it's the biggest category, and I think they're the ones that are trying to put lipstick on a pig. They are renaming the departments. The DEI department is now the ‘belonging department.' The coordinator, the DEI dean, is now compliance dean or something like that. But those people are doing the same damn thing and just trying to wait the Trump administration out.""

Fox News Digital has extensively reported on schools in the first two buckets as defined by Neily, including at Washington University in St. Louis, where one of the nation's top medical schools was accused of moving the DEI office to a restricted floor rather than close it.

Earlier this month, Princeton University was hit with a scathing federal complaint over a DEI agenda that allegedly involved female students sharing ""gender-neutral"" restrooms with gaps in the stalls, as well as graduations segregated by gender identity.

At the University of Utah and University of Virginia, Fox News Digital reported on staffers being caught on hidden camera explaining their efforts to continue DEI efforts by simply rebranding or renaming them. 

""The third category are the schools that actually want to comply in good faith,"" Neily told Fox News Digital. ""I think a lot of schools, a lot of administrators, got pretty frustrated with the excesses of the DEI movement, and they're secretly relieved that they now have a little bit of air cover to wind those programs back. And they might hand wring and do a little performative 'this is the orange man's fault,' but at the end of the day, I think they really are relieved.""

Neily told Fox News Digital that the ""second bucket"" is the ""biggest and most challenging category."" She said she was recently at a university board conference where speakers on a DEI panel were openly calling for ""inclusivity work"" to be continued because the Trump administration ""only cares about"" Ivy League schools and ""they can't sue us all.""

""To me, that demonstrates real mens rea, which is Latin for a guilty mind,"" Neily said. ""I think that shows that these people are the real evildoers and those are the ones where I think, obviously, the Trump administration has spent a lot of time over the past few months going after Harvard, going after Columbia, like the real bad actors that are out there trying to, you know that clearly have to be cleaned up. But I think that there is a much more significant and long-term effort to uproot and eradicate the DEI that is just trying to hide in plain sight. And I think that's a really, really important mission.""

Defending Education recently sent a letter, first reported by Fox News Digital, to elected officials in all 50 states calling for a top-to-bottom audit of state laws at the K-12 level to ensure that no loopholes are being exploited, allowing schools to continue DEI efforts.

Combating DEI at all levels of education will require a ""whole of government"" approach, Neily told Fox News Digital, adding that it will be important to not let administrators ""whitewash their records"" or pass the blame onto someone else for policies they have supported.

Additionally, Neily expressed optimism that the tide is turning against DEI in terms of popularity.

""I think we're at a moment where there is kind of a perfect storm taking place in academia. This incoming freshman class this year is the largest freshman class that American universities will ever have… Clearly, we have seen polling over the past couple years demonstrate a massive loss in public confidence in the institutions of higher education at a time when costs are through the roof, the return on investment for sending your child to some of these schools is horrible. So I think a lot of people are really rethinking, is this the correct track for me, period?"" Neily said.

""We also have fewer international students coming in, thanks to the efforts of the Trump administration, and so I think what we're gonna see over the next several years is a number of universities that actually start to close. And how do those schools differentiate themselves in the marketplace?""

Neily said she has witnessed students ""vote with their feet"" and choose to attend schools that don't promote ""woke"" ideologies, particularly in the South as students are looking for a ""proper college experience.""

Earlier this year, Fox News Digital reported that several Southern states banded together to establish their own accrediting body for higher education in order to ""upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.""

""They don't wanna be surrounded by a bunch of pearl-clutching Victorian scolds that are going to reprimand them for using the wrong pronouns and for not wearing masks in the middle of the winter, and so we're watching people and some of those state schools in the South now, realizing, OK, we can get more out-of-state students coming in, paying higher out-of-state tuition,"" Neily said. 

""But it's also changing and altering what our campus life is like, and so we're also, from constituents in the South, they're now pushing for their in-state universities to put caps actually in the number of out-of-state students. And so, this is very much a kind of evolving landscape, but I think that there is a lot more change coming ahead in higher education. And for those higher ed administrators who have not started to really look in the mirror and think, what do we wanna be when we grow up? I think they're gonna be in for a world of hurt soon.""

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and other progressives are fed up with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after a group of senators, which did not include the Senate Democratic leader, voted with Republicans to take a step toward ending the government shutdown.

Progressive Democrats such as Khanna believe Schumer should be replaced as Senate minority leader.

“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Khanna wrote on X. “If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”

“If you're not willing to fight to stop premium hikes on 20 million Americans, then what are you willing to fight for?” he said in a separate social media post. “The Democratic Party needs to be strong. We need to stand up for the health care of ordinary Americans.”

Khanna added that he believes donors and the “establishment” will not like him speaking out, but he is confident that his social media following will back him.

Khanna's discontent comes after the Senate voted 60-40 to overcome the first procedural hurdle on the way to opening the government. The deal reached, which prompted eight Senate Democrats to vote with Republicans, included a December vote on the Obamacare healthcare subsidies that Democrats had called for and a pledge to reverse thousands of planned layoffs announced by the White House since Oct. 1.

The deal did not guarantee that any of the healthcare subsidies would pass. The House will still have to vote on it, though some Republicans had signaled their support for the tax credits during the shutdown.

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits running out and the prospect of renewed healthcare subsidies ultimately forced Democrats' hands on the shutdown.

“I again voted to re-open the government, resume vital services for Maine people, put people back to work, feed the hungry and secure an opportunity to avoid a harmful hike in health care costs,” Sen. Angus King (I-ME) wrote on X.

Other progressive Democrats also expressed their unhappiness with the concession publicly.

“The average monthly SNAP benefit is $177 a person,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) wrote on X. “The average ACA benefit is up to $550 a person/mo. People want us to hold the line for a reason. This is not a matter of appealing to a base. It's about people's lives.”

“Working people want leaders whose word means something,” she added.

Rep. Seth Moulton (D-MA) had more pointed words for Schumer, daring Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) to vote against the New York senator.

“Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership,” Moulton wrote. “If @ChuckSchumer were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote ‘No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare. Maybe now @EdMarkey will finally join me in pledging not to vote for Schumer?”

Democrats have been discontent with Schumer long before the government shutdown fueled the fire.

Earlier this year, Schumer withstood calls to step down after he supported a Republican spending bill that he called “certainly bad.” Multiple House Democrats, including Reps. Glenn Ivey (D-MD) and Delia Ramirez (D-IL), suggested he should step down.

“I respect Chuck Schumer. I think he had a great, long-standing career,” Ivey said then. “But I'm afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to get a new leader.”

Schumer said he supported the bill to avoid the “horror” of a government shutdown, which Democrats are now enduring.

In early 2018, Schumer faced more intraparty strife. Some Democrats, and President Donald Trump, accused him of “caving” to the pressure of the government shutdown, and without the immigration concessions that they wanted then.

“Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown,” Trump posted on X in 2018. “Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!”

Republicans dialed up the pressure on Schumer last month, labeling the government shutdown as the “Schumer shutdown.” As the days wore on, Schumer managed to keep Democrats away from compromise until Sunday.

WHAT DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID ABOUT VOTING TO END THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

And now, Democrats are hoping it's his last shutdown as Senate minority leader.

“Chuck Schumer has failed us,” Iowa state Sen. Zach Wahls, a Democrat who is running for Sen. Joni Ernst's seat, wrote on X.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The discovery of DNA was evidence of how deeply interconnected humans are, but the late scientist saw only difference.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

How do we reckon with the legacy of people who have done excellent work, but who have said or done terrible things?

Last week, James Watson died at the age of 97. Watson's scientific work was certainly excellent. He was chiefly known for publishing, with Francis Crick, the first description of the structure of DNA, a discovery for which they received a Nobel Prize in 1962 and which he described in his best-selling memoir, The Double Helix. In addition to his reputation for scientific innovation and leadership, however, Watson was notorious for his bigotry. For years, he made derisive comments about gay people, suggested that women were less effective scientists, and claimed that people of African descent were biologically inferior, and in particular, that they had lower inborn intelligence.

The root of reckon is “count,” and to ask what to make of a life like Watson's risks suggesting that the triumphs and sins of a human life can be quantified on the same numerical scale. How many racist comments must be subtracted from a Nature paper before the total is negative? Of course, human lives defy this type of mathematical flattening. We can add three and two to make five, but we cannot add scientific breakthroughs to bigotry and arrive at a tidy, incontrovertible sum. One deed sits stubbornly beside the other.

This complexity is particularly maddening in a scientist like Watson. He was a transformative leader in his field: He revitalized the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory into a scientific powerhouse, and he was instrumental in the initiation of the Human Genome Project. He also regularly acted with, as Cornelia Dean wrote in his New York Times obituary, “brash, unpleasant and even bigoted outspokenness,” making pseudoscientific assertions that led to his becoming, as Stat News put it, a “pariah” among his peers, forced into early retirement and stripped of honorary titles. Instead of seeing in our DNA evidence of how deeply interconnected we are—all part of the same family tree, all part of the same tree of life—Watson saw, or thought he saw, evidence only of fundamental difference.

As psychologists who study how genes influence human behavior—and, just as crucially, the limits of that influence—we cannot help but wonder how these strands of his intellect and character came to co-exist. Part of the problem might have been how a certain sort of scientific thinking can be fetishized. There's a danger in slipping between different conceptions of “reason.” The analytic problem-solving skills that are selected for and honed in a scientific career are not synonymous with sound moral reasoning. Watson made his biggest scientific discovery as a young man, only 25 years old, and his sense of his own abilities, his own specialness, seemed never to mature beyond a young man's bravado. It's morally perilous to assume that you are always the smartest person in the room, and that the specific ways in which you are smart are always the surest paths to wisdom.

Neither did Watson update, as genetics matured as a science, his sense of the limits of molecular analysis. As Watson and Crick noted in their original publication, the double-helix structure of DNA implicated a straightforward mechanism for how the genome changed and replicated, and that insight transformed biology into a mechanistic science. But understanding how DNA mutates and replicates has not similarly transformed psychology; the study of the mind has not been reduced to the study of molecules. Despite astonishing progress in molecular genetics since Watson and Crick's discovery, we are scarcely closer to understanding the genetics of human intelligence than we were in the 1950s, and are perhaps even further away from a consensus definition of what sort of thing “intelligence” even is. Watson made an error that has dogged human genetics from the beginning: He assumed that the discovery that we, too, are DNA-based creatures meant that sometime soon, all differences among people would be explained by biological mechanisms. Again and again, that assumption has turned out to be not only wrong but profoundly dangerous. In the 20th century, it justified eugenic violence; in the 21st, it has continued to justify racial inequality.

Read: The far right is becoming obsessed with race and IQ

Watson's life story also has been warped by the myth of the lone genius, or in the case of Watson and Crick, the lone geniuses. Watson and Crick's discovery of the double-helix structure was built on the work of Rosalind Franklin, who produced an X-ray image of the DNA molecule; of Friedrich Miescher, who first isolated what he called “nuclein”; and of Gregor Mendel, whose experiments with pea plants first revealed statistical laws of inheritance, to name just a few colleagues and forebears. Watson's work in Cambridge was also supported by a fellowship from what is now called the March of Dimes, established by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to fund scientific research into the treatment or eradication of polio. As with any scientific achievement, Watson could not have made his alone.

Watson and Crick's 1953 paper, with its neat hand drawing of the double helix, is still a thrilling read: What it must have been like to apprehend this structure for the first time! The discovery represents the peak of a cresting wave of scientific invention, industry, and investment. Watson deserves credit for how well he rode that wave, but not for the deeper forces that made his work, in that moment, possible. The discovery was a collective human achievement, the result of the sustained cooperation of many people, over many years.

To reckon with Watson's legacy, then, we propose celebrating what he wouldn't—or couldn't—recognize: the shared intelligence of the human race, which can produce miracles and wonders, even as each of us, individually, is so terribly fallible.

In this article

Warren Buffett laid out a plan to ""step up"" the pace of giving away his $149 billion estate to his children's foundations, while still allowing for a short period that lets Berkshire Hathaway shareholders gain confidence in incoming CEO Greg Abel.

Buffett, in a Thanksgiving letter that will become an annual tradition, said he needs to accelerate the disbursement of his Berkshire stock to his three children's foundations because of their own advanced ages and that by doing so it will ""improve the probability that they will dispose of what will essentially be my entire estate before alternate trustees replace them.""

Abel, 63, is set to take over for Buffett, 95, as Berkshire CEO at the start of the new year with the ""Oracle of Omaha"" remaining chairman.

""I would like to keep a significant amount of 'A' shares until Berkshire shareholders develop the comfort with Greg that Charlie and I long enjoyed,"" wrote Buffett, referring to longtime Berkshire vice chairman and his cherished business partner, Charlie Munger, who died two years ago.  

""That level of confidence shouldn't take long. My children are already 100% behind Greg as are the Berkshire directors,"" said Buffett.

Buffett owns about $149 billion worth of Berkshire based on shares held at the end of the second quarter, making him far and away the largest shareholder. Most of his wealth is in the original A shares which trade for around $751,480 a share.

He said 1,800 of those Berkshire A shares were converted into 2.7 million B shares and given Monday to four family foundations: The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and the NoVo Foundation. This donation is worth more than $1.3 billion.

""The acceleration of my lifetime gifts to my children's foundations in no way reflects any change in my views about Berkshire's prospects,"" added Buffett.

The note marks Buffett's first major communication since announcing plans to step down as CEO, signaling the close of a six-decade run that made him a household name and one of the most successful investors in history.

""As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet.'... sort of,"" Buffett wrote in the letter.

Abel, currently vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will take over writing Berkshire's annual shareholder letters — a tradition that Buffett began in 1965 and that has become essential reading across Wall Street — while Buffett said he will continue this Thanksgiving message.

In one of the most personal passages of the letter, Buffett gave a rare update on his health.

""To my surprise, I generally feel good. Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people,"" he wrote. ""I was late in becoming old ... but once it appears, it is not to be denied.""

Since taking control of Berkshire in 1965, Buffett has transformed a struggling textile mill into a $1 trillion conglomerate spanning insurance, railroads, utilities and consumer brands.

He devoted part of his letter to reaffirming Berkshire's durability, saying it is designed to withstand nearly any economic environment.

""Berkshire has less chance of a devastating disaster than any business I know,"" he said.

Berkshire held a record $381.6 billion in cash at the end of September, underscoring its unmatched balance sheet and cautious investing approach. It has also been selling equities for 12 straight quarters, reflecting Buffett's caution in a richly valued market.

The company's underlying businesses remain strong with operating profit jumping 34% in the third quarter. Still, Buffett acknowledged that Berkshire's sheer scale has become both its strength and its limitation.

""In aggregate, Berkshire's businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll,"" he wrote.

Berkshire's stock has risen roughly 10% in 2025, outpacing many defensive names but lagging the S&P 500 amid a tech-driven rally.

""Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management,"" Buffett said. ""Don't despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.""

Oops, something went wrong

Strategy Inc acquired 487 Bitcoin between Nov. 3 and Nov. 9, according to a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Nov. 10. The company purchased the coins at an average price of $102,557 per Bitcoin, spending approximately $49.9 million.

The acquisition was funded through the company's at-the-market offering program, which generated $50 million in net proceeds during the same period. Strategy sold shares across four preferred stock types: STRF stock generated $18.3 million, STRC stock brought in $26.2 million, STRK stock contributed $4.5 million, and STRD stock added $1 million, according to the filing. The company did not sell any common stock during this period.

The purchase brings Strategy's total Bitcoin holdings to 641,692 BTC. The company has spent $47.54 billion acquiring its entire position, reflecting an average purchase price of $74,079 per Bitcoin across all acquisitions.

Company chairman Michael Saylor announced the acquisition on X, confirming Strategy achieved a BTC Yield of 26.1% year-to-date in 2025. BTC Yield measures the percentage change in Bitcoin-per-share, calculated by dividing total BTC held by diluted shares outstanding.

At Bitcoin's closing price of $105,697.30 on Nov. 10, Strategy's holdings are worth approximately $67.83 billion. This represents an unrealized gain of roughly $20.29 billion compared to the aggregate purchase price. The company recently expanded its capital raising activities with Strategy's euro-denominated STRE stock offering, targeting European professional investors.

The 487 BTC purchase falls within Strategy's typical acquisition range for late 2025. Previous purchases included 850 BTC on Sept. 22, 196 BTC on Sept. 29, 220 BTC on Oct. 13, and 168 BTC on Oct. 20. The company completed a €620 million STRE offering on Nov. 6, upsizing the initial proposal by 121%.

Strategy maintains substantial remaining capacity across its ATM program. As of Nov. 9, the company can issue $15.85 billion in MSTR common stock, $20.34 billion in STRK stock, $4.17 billion in STRC stock, $4.13 billion in STRD stock, and $1.64 billion in STRF stock.

The company's exclusive use of preferred stock for this acquisition avoided dilution of common shareholders. This approach has drawn both support and criticism from analysts like Peter Schiff, who has questioned the company's Bitcoin-dependent business model.

Strategy's ongoing capital raising strategy throughout 2025 has enabled the company to maintain its position as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder globally and the largest treasury company overall.

Oops, something went wrong

A Manhattan jury has deadlocked in a closely watched federal case over whether an alleged MEV exploit on Ethereum amounts to criminal fraud.

On November 7, a New York federal judge declared a mistrial after jurors failed to reach a unanimous decision on the fate of brothers Anton and James Peraire-Bueno.

According to the Reuters report, Prosecutors say the MIT-educated pair pulled roughly $25M in cryptocurrency from the network in a 12-second on-chain transaction.

The trial ran for several weeks, focusing on how Ethereum blocks are built and whether the brothers' actions constituted sharp trading or a scheme that crossed into wire fraud and money laundering.

US District Judge Jessica Clarke dismissed the jury after days of failed deliberations.

Jurors told the court they were worn down by the case and struggling to agree. Some said the process had led to “sleepless nights,” according to notes shared in court.

Prosecutors have not said if they will bring the case back for trial.

The government argued the brothers spent months planning to interfere with Ethereum's validation process.

They were accused of exploiting MEV-Boost, the software most validators use to help decide how transactions are ordered.

In opening remarks, prosecutors described the method as a fast “bait-and-switch” meant to trick trading bots and pull funds away from other market players. The defense said the approach was new but fair in an aggressive on-chain market.

The Justice Department had promoted the case as a first-of-its-kind fraud and money-laundering prosecution when it announced the charges in 2024.

The case effectively became a public test of how US fraud laws apply to the maximum extractable value of the profit made by reordering blockchain transactions.

Coin Center raised early concerns in an amicus filing, arguing that prosecutors were trying to force “a novel and alien code of conduct” onto blockchain networks.

The group stated that this approach would stretch legal boundaries and could deter validators from participating.

Inside the courthouse, jurors appeared uncertain about key instructions and how to interpret the law. They sent several notes asking for guidance. After hours of discussion and no clear path forward, the judge declared a mistrial.

Reports stated that jurors were divided on how to apply the law, despite the facts of the 2023 transaction being largely undisputed.

That gap highlights the difficulty of integrating blockchain mechanics into traditional fraud rules.

Ether traded near $3,571 early Monday. Bitcoin hovered around $104,540.

Prices have been choppy in recent weeks on macro nerves and flow swings in US spot bitcoin ETFs. The mistrial itself did not trigger major moves.

The Southern District of New York now has choices: retry the case, seek a plea, or drop it.

Whatever prosecutors do next, key questions remain how far “honest validation” duties extend, and when protocol-level tactics turn into fraud.

Those issues will continue to hang over MEV practices and Ethereum's validator ecosystem.

While the altcoin season has yet to return, a few altcoins are showing stronger performance than the rest of the market in the second week of November. However, these same tokens also face the risk of triggering massive liquidations for short-term traders.

Which altcoins are they, and what risks are involved in trading their derivatives?

Short-term trader sentiment for XRP remains highly optimistic as Canary Capital prepares to launch its Spot XRP ETF on November 13.

Additionally, five XRP spot ETFs from Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, Canary Capital, 21Shares, and CoinShares have appeared on the DTCC list. This development strengthens investor confidence that multiple XRP ETFs could soon receive approval.

The 7-day liquidation map indicates a significant concentration of potential long liquidations, suggesting that many traders are anticipating an XRP price rally this week.

However, BeInCrypto's latest analysis reveals a sharp decline in new XRP addresses over the past week, indicating a weakening of interest from new investors. Moreover, the MVRV Long/Short Difference has dropped, increasing the likelihood of a price correction.

If XRP falls toward $2.10 this week, long positions could face more than $340 million in liquidations. Conversely, if XRP rises to $2.75, short positions may be liquidated for around $69 million.

The rally in Zcash (ZEC) shows no sign of slowing down in the second week of November. Although ZEC reached $750 before correcting to around $658, many traders still expect the price to climb toward $1,000.

The 7-day liquidation map reveals that short-term derivatives traders are allocating more capital and leverage toward long positions. This means they could face larger losses if ZEC experiences a correction this week.

If ZEC drops to $540, over $72 million in long positions could be liquidated. Conversely, if ZEC surges to $760, roughly $44 million in shorts could be wiped out.

Analysts warn that ZEC may be forming a classic parabolic uptrend after a 10x rally, possibly nearing the final stage of the pattern.

“Just sold 90% of my ZEC. I'm bullish on the privacy thesis, but parabolic charts rarely sustain in the short run without a meaningful retrace. Too much short-term FOMO imo,” investor Gunn said.

Starknet (STRK) surprised the market in the second week of November with a 30% daily surge, recovering losses from last month's sharp decline.

Several analysts suggest STRK may be breaking out of a long-term resistance line, potentially kicking off a strong new bull run.

Liquidation map data reflects this short-term bullish sentiment, showing a dominance of potential long liquidations over shorts.

However, CryptoRank reports that STRK is among the top 7 altcoins with major token unlocks this week. More than 127 million STRK tokens will be unlocked, potentially adding significant selling pressure and disrupting the plans of leveraged long traders.

If STRK falls to $0.128, approximately $14 million in long positions could be liquidated. Conversely, if it breaks above $0.20, about $1.78 million in shorts could be wiped out.

Oops, something went wrong

After 40 days of uncertainty, the US Government Shutdown is seemingly nearing an end. The US Senators struck a bipartisan deal to end the longest shutdown in American history. 

While over the past month and more, the macro financial markets remained bearish, the crypto market witnessed sharp volatility, with many tokens enjoying gains. Thus, BeInCrypto has focused on three tokens among these top performers that could continue their rally after the shutdown ends.

ZEC has emerged as one of the best-performing altcoins during the US government shutdown. As the privacy token narrative strengthened, investor demand surged, driving ZEC to record a remarkable 756% increase.

Currently trading at $634, ZEC appears poised to continue its upward trajectory toward the $700 mark. A successful breach could open the path to $800, with the next target at $1,000. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator suggests sustained inflows, supporting the likelihood of continued bullish momentum.

However, CMF levels are now in the saturation zone above 0.20, where reversals typically occur as profit-taking begins. If this trend repeats, ZEC could fall below $600, breaking through the $478 support and potentially sliding to $400 or lower, thereby invalidating the current bullish outlook.

VIRTUAL has become one of the most talked-about altcoins in recent weeks. The token has surged 101% since late October, reflecting strong investor confidence. As it nears a potential Golden Cross, market sentiment suggests that VIRTUAL could sustain its momentum amid rising interest in AI-powered crypto projects.

As one of the leading players in the AI Agent sector, Virtuals Protocol continues to attract attention from both retail and institutional investors. The upcoming Golden Cross — when the 50-day EMA crosses the 200-day EMA — could propel VIRTUAL beyond $1.54 and $1.65, eventually targeting the $2.00 mark.

However, if profit-taking intensifies among investors, VIRTUAL price may lose its current footing. A drop below $1.37 could push it toward $1.14, erasing recent gains and invalidating the bullish outlook.

SOON emerged as one of the top breakout tokens during the US government shutdown, soaring 462% since October 1. Its core strength lies in being a high-performance Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) Rollup ecosystem that scales blockchain adoption through cross-chain interoperability and Layer 2 integration across Ethereum and other chains.

The project's approach has resonated with users, driving sharp gains in its native token. Currently trading at $2.12, SOON shows bullish momentum, with the Parabolic SAR signaling an uptrend. Maintaining $2.03 as a support floor could allow the token to climb toward $3.00 in the near term.

However, profit-taking could trigger a short-term correction. If selling pressure intensifies, SOON price may drop to $1.39, with a potential decline to $1.04 if the support fails to hold. Such movement would invalidate the current bullish outlook.

The Chinese blockchain industry could almost double in size by 2027 to be worth $1.4 billion.

Wu Hai, CEO of the China Internet Investment Fund, made that prediction on Sunday, arguing that the integration with artificial intelligence projects will help the Middle Kingdom's blockchain sector surge by 71% from its 2024 $816 million high.

While that's about a tenth of the estimated US blockchain market in in the same year, Wu seemed confident that the sector is about to experience explosive growth.

“Our investment drives are helping the blockchain industry solidify its basic software and hardware foundations,” the CIIF chief told China's Cailian Press. “We are looking to promote high-quality development.”

The bullishness comes years after Beijing cracked down on the crypto industry and as the US market has been supercharged by President Donald Trump's pro-crypto policies. 

Wu said that blockchain investors were following a two-pronged strategy.

The first involves building key infrastructure and application platforms. And a second focuses on integrated application and “value scenarios.”

These scenarios include blockchain adoption drives in the government space, as well as finance, culture, and tourism.

AI-powered technical support service platforms are also set to adopt blockchain technology.

Wu said that Chinese blockchain investment, financing, and industrial development have already yielded “significant results in integration and application.”

This was particularly true of the enterprise services and financial services sectors, he said.

And Wu noted that many of China's blockchain companies were founded between 2017 and 2019, several years before their overseas competitors.

Wu added that last year saw investment flow into Chinese blockchain-powered services, financial companies, and agricultural projects.

But he indicated that over 90% of investors still back early-stage projects.

In 2019, President Xi Jinping called on the public and private sectors to “increase investment and accelerate blockchain development.”

Two years later, top Beijing policymakers included a comprehensive blockchain strategy in the country's 14th Five-Year Plan.

However, China's crypto purges have forced most businesses to focus on private blockchain network-powered solutions.

As a result, many of the country's most prominent blockchain players are most active in sectors like central and local government, as well as administration.

But in recent years, telecom providers have launched blockchain-powered 5G projects. 

China's judiciary uses blockchain for a fast-growing range of purposes, such as storing and verifying electronic evidence.

The CIIF is worth $15 billion. It was co-launched by the Chinese web regulator, the Cyberspace Administration, in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance.

The parties launched the fund in 2017 with the express aim of “supporting investments in the domestic internet industry.”

Like the volatile, hype-prone digital art market it briefly celebrated, the Seattle NFT Museum sometimes struggled to be taken seriously.

Billed as the world's first museum for NFTs, or “non-fungible tokens,” it opened in Seattle in 2022, when the NFT market was on fire and celebrities were paying fortunes for art that lived on cryptocurrency blockchains.

When the Belltown museum quietly closed its doors last December, on the heels of the global NFT market crash, some saw a fitting bit of real-world symbolism. 

“Shocking,” quipped a typical online commenter. “Literally no one saw this coming.” 

The snarky obituaries may be premature.

The NFT market is down but not out. Artists, including some in Seattle, say the technology is still bringing new audiences — and revenues.

The NFT Museum itself is doubling down. Its tech-industry founders say the closure is only temporary as they look for new, larger digs for the venue's dozens of TV monitors and other gear.

“There's still a lot of interest,” says co-founder Jennifer Wong. “A lot of the artists we showcased at the museum, especially locally, are still producing pieces today.”

Whether that actually results in a new NFT Museum is hardly certain. Wong and co-founder and husband Peter Hamilton don't have a reopening date. And these aren't easy times for art museums of any stripe.

But unpredictably has been a hallmark of the NFT space since 2014, when a Seattle-born digital artist named Kevin McCoy “minted” the first NFT as a way to protect ownership of digital artworks.

Until then, digital art's copyable nature made it hard for creators to prove ownership or make sales.

McCoy's idea, developed with technologist Anil Dash, was to link digital art to the same online ledger, or blockchain, used to verify and record individual cryptocurrency transactions.

Using that process, a creator could turn any digital content into a one-of-a-kind, or “non-fungible,” asset, whose authorship could be proved and, critically, whose ownership could be sold and tracked. 

McCoy, a graduate of Bothell High School and Whitman College, later described NFTs as “hippie meets tech libertarian.”

Through the late 2010s, an NFT art market spurred a growing trade in everything from high-end art to collectors “cards” like Bored Apes.

Global NFT sales hit $82 million in 2020. A year later, they were at nearly $20 billion.

McCoy, now an artist in New York City, said he knew NFTs had commercial  potential. “But seeing it actually happen — you're just, like, ‘Oh, my God.' “

Wong and Hamilton decided to open a museum after visiting several NFT galleries. They thought a physical space could make the virtual, esoteric art forms more accessible to a wider public.

They leased a ground-floor retail space in the Continental Place Condominiums, on Seattle's First Avenue, and put up 30 wall monitors as well as educational displays of NFT history and technology. Admission was $15, later changed to a suggested donation.

The museum opened in January 2022, with the first of what would be a dozen exhibitions. 

Reviews were mixed. Some visitors found the art derivative and the space sterile. “If I wanted to look at a bunch of TVs I'd go to Best Buy,” quipped one Yelp reviewer in April 2022.

Others criticized the substantial energy needed to “mint” NFTs. There was a small protest when the museum opened and a window was broken, but the issue faded after Ethereum, the main NFT blockchain, adopted a lower-energy process in late 2022.

Among local artists, some felt NFTs were a cryptocurrency scam and that tech component meant “that it wasn't real art,” recalls Amy Tipton, owner of Slip art gallery and founder of Belltown Art Walk.

But the museum had plenty of fans. Openings were often crowded affairs, with artists, techies and students. The museum was also a big draw for tourists, including some would-be haters.

“I decided to go to the Seattle NFT Museum specifically to laugh at how ridiculous it is, and I walked out absolutely blown away by how fun and interesting it was,” said an out-of-town tourist in a 2022 online review.

The museum also had a following among digital artists, and even some traditional artists.

Seattle “grunge” photographer Charles Peterson, whose work appeared at the museum's first show, found NFT technology “overwhelming,” and doesn't think art like his worked on the museum's screens.

But he couldn't ignore the new audience NFTs unearthed for his black-and-white images of famous Seattle bands. An NFT of his image of Kurt Cobain lying on a drum set brought $15,000.

“It was not bad money,” recalls Peterson, adding that NFT sales made up a “pretty major” share of his sales.

Peterson wasn't alone. Unlike in the traditional art market, NFTs can be set up to let artists earn money whenever their work is resold. And because sales were in cryptocurrency, artists prospered as crypto prices soared.

“We finally can make a really good living off of what we're doing and have a lot of respect,” Bellevue illustrator Robbie Trevino, whose work appeared at the NFT Museum, told The Seattle Times in 2022.

Although the NFT Museum didn't sell any art, Wong and Hamilton were mindful of the market's energy and direction.

As Hamilton told KING 5 News, “We're showing it for education, but certainly, we have works that are $500,000 in value up to $1 (million) or even $2 million in value.”

Within months of the museum's launch, however, there were signs that the party was over.

On NFT trading platforms, “snipers” were using bots to buy and flip promising tokens.

Maks Surguy, a Seattle tech worker and digital artist also featured at the museum, recalls making $5,000 on an NFT “in a matter of five minutes or so … because the bots were fighting for it.”

The NFT market was also getting saturated with knockoffs and bad art.

“There literally were factories … just spinning up [NFT] collections, every single day and just seeing what sticks,” said Art Min, a Seattle tech industry veteran who co-founded Phosphene, an NFT platform focused on Seattle-area artists.

In some cases, Min said, creators sold fraudulent NFTs, with made-up features, before vanishing with the funds — a scam known as a “rug pull.”

By May 2022, the NFT market was in free fall, as scams and a crash in crypto prices led collectors to dump their NFTs.

“I was seeing a lot of artists getting discouraged,” recalled Joana Kawahara Lino, who worked as curator at the NFT Museum. 

After the crash, neighbors said the place often seemed empty during the week.

Wong says the museum wasn't affected by the market drop. It continued to pull in visitors and was breaking even on costs, though that required donations and side gigs, including renting the space for events and for luggage storage for tourists. 

The latter, done via an app, sometimes meant lines of “tourists, very forlorn, with luggage, standing in front of the doors,” said Continental Place concierge James Brock. He says noise from events was also an issue.

Wong said “the main reason” for closing was that the lease was up and the museum needed more room. Despite NFT's crash and sketchy history, she thinks public interest remains for a brick-and-mortar venue, ideally downtown.

Fans of the museum hope she's right. They note the NFT market has modestly recovered somewhat — around $4 billion in sales this year — in part because crypto has rebounded.

Peterson, the photographer, says he's considering new NFTs of some of his lesser-known work — “something like Seaweed at the Odd Fellows Hall.”

But proponents aren't sure that means the world wants or will pay for an NFT museum.

Much of the NFT market has shifted toward more commercial uses, such as using tokens for loyalty programs, or as access to gaming.

Although NFTs succeeded in legitimizing and monetizing digital art, the concept itself may now be less compelling as a stand-alone art form, said McCoy, the NFT inventor. “NFTs have kind of returned to their native form of digital art,” he said.

And, as practical matter, any arts venture is a gamble these days, as even established institutions like the Bellevue Arts Museum fail and many galleries see more of their sales move online.

That paradox — an in-person space for a virtual form — may be the NFT Museum's biggest hurdle.

“It just seems weird there was a physical location for that,” said Erik Flatten, who owns the Black Cat Bar across First Avenue from the condo building.

Flatten isn't complaining. He loved the extra business when museum events ended and NFT enthusiasts piled into his bar. He also gives Wong and Hamilton kudos for attempting such an unlikely venture.

“It was open a lot longer than I thought it would be.”

Fact checked

By 99Bitcoins Editorial Team

With Bitcoin (BTC) facing heavy selling pressure, miners are being squeezed by shrinking margins, and many are now turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to open new revenue streams. However, the virtual mining game PepeNode (PEPENODE) is taking a completely different path, making mining not only lighter on resources but also more fun and rewarding.

As the first mine-to-earn crypto game, PepeNode has already raised $2.1M in early investor funding, built around a concept that turns traditional mining into a virtual experience. The project aims not only to redefine crypto mining but also to revive the GameFi sector, which many believe is due for a major resurgence.

Beyond mining its native PEPENODE token, players can also stack top meme coins like Pepe (PEPE) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) – and with more assets on the way, the game's shaping up to be a meme-coin-generating powerhouse.

However, there's a limited window left to join the current presale phase because in 26 hours, the next round will launch at a higher token price, making now the ideal moment to secure a position at a lower entry.

Energy costs vary drastically around the world. In some regions, crypto mining remains highly profitable thanks to cheap electricity, while in others, soaring costs have turned operations into a losing proposition. With BTC recently hovering near $100,000, miners in high-cost regions are starting to sweat as profit margins thin out.

For many, the solution has long been to relocate operations to countries with cheaper power, such as Iran, where it reportedly costs only $1,320 in energy to mine one Bitcoin. But that move comes with significant political, logistical, and regulatory risks that can quickly erase any advantage.

That's why more and more companies are pivoting toward AI and high-performance computing (HPC), leveraging their existing hardware, cooling systems, and power contracts to fuel the AI boom instead of crypto mining.

A prime example is CoreWeave, which began as an Ethereum mining firm in 2017. When Ethereum scrapped mining in 2022, CoreWeave repurposed its massive GPU fleet for AI and HPC workloads, turning it into one of the fastest-growing private tech firms in the U.S. 

Following its lead, other major miners, such as CleanSpark and Marathon Digital, have joined the shift. CleanSpark recently announced plans for AI-focused data centers, while Marathon reported $123M in Q3 2025 profits, largely driven by a strategic expansion into AI computing.

However, this isn't to say that Bitcoin mining is a lost cause, but it has become a game reserved for those with deep capital. Even players who can afford massive hardware setups are now looking elsewhere, trying to ensure their costly rigs don't go to waste as profitability thins out.

PepeNode, on the other hand, wants to bring mining back to the individual player – the kind who can open a laptop and start earning crypto again. But this time, it's designed for the modern era. Instead of a battle over capital, it's a game of skill and strategy, where success depends not on how much you can spend, but on how smart you play.

PepeNode's virtual mining game drops all the talk about hardware and power bills and instead drops players straight into an empty digital server room, where it's up to them to build their virtual mining empire.

To start, players first need to acquire PEPENODE tokens, which are currently only available through the ongoing presale. Once the game launches, these tokens become the lifeblood of the ecosystem – used to buy mining nodes and expand operations. Each node is unique, and combining the right ones strategically can dramatically boost hashrate and accelerate token generation.



The same PEPENODE tokens can also be spent to upgrade your virtual server room and improve equipment, transforming your setup into a more efficient, high-yield mining machine – all without requiring physical rigs or incurring additional electricity costs. It's like expanding your lot in FarmVille to grow more crops, except this time, you're harvesting real crypto.

To take things a step further, PepeNode introduces leaderboards, ranking players based on the strength of their mining setups. Those at the top can earn bonus airdrops in meme coins like PEPE, FARTCOIN, and potentially other major tokens as the project evolves.

In short, PepeNode transforms mining into a game of skill, strategy, and passive rewards – arguably the most fun way yet to earn top meme coins in crypto.

Crypto influencers like Crypto Tech Gaming and CryptoTV have been buzzing about the PEPENODE token, even calling it a potential 100x play as the project's presale heats up.



Their excitement stems from PepeNode's powerful tokenomics, where 70% of all tokens used for node purchases or facility upgrades are permanently burned. 

This creates a deflationary supply model, meaning that as more players join and spend tokens in-game, the circulating supply keeps shrinking, driving long-term value higher.

Since the game hasn't launched yet, investors currently have a rare opportunity to buy PEPENODE at presale prices before the burn mechanics and exchange activity kick in to push prices upward.

But time is running out. As mentioned, the current presale round is coming to a close soon, and with only a short window remaining, the next round will introduce a higher token price. For anyone looking to secure an early position, timing couldn't be more crucial.

To join the presale, head to the PepeNode site to purchase PEPENODE using ETH, BNB, USDT (ERC-20 and BEP-20), or even credit or debit cards.

PepeNode recommends using Best Wallet, which is widely regarded as the best crypto and Bitcoin wallet. PepeNode is listed on Best Wallet's highly accurate project screening tool, Upcoming Tokens, allowing you to buy, track, and claim in-app.

The token's smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, providing early adopters peace of mind about the security of its code.

(BMNR) Stock: Surge on Leading the Crypto Revolution with $398M Cash and Massive ETH Holdings","https://coincentral.com/bitmine-immersion-technologies-inc-bmnr-stock-surge-on-leading-the-crypto-revolution-with-398m-cash-and-massive-eth-holdings/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:30:14 GMT","

BitMine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR) has seen a significant surge in stock value, rising 6.07% to $42.67.





Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc., BMNR

This boost in value comes as the company announces its crypto holdings, which have now reached an impressive $13.2 billion. The company has amassed substantial amounts of Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), and other assets like Eightco Holdings stock, making it a key player in the cryptocurrency sector.

BitMine has positioned itself as the largest holder of Ethereum (ETH) globally. As of November 9, 2025, the company holds 3,505,723 ETH, valued at $3,639 per coin. This marks an increase in BitMine's holdings, having purchased an additional 110,288 ETH tokens during the past week, 34% more than the previous week.

The company's growing ETH collection accounts for 2.9% of the total supply, bringing it closer to its goal of securing 5% of the global ETH supply. BitMine's position as the world's largest ETH treasury solidifies its dominance in the crypto space, further enhanced by its ongoing investment strategy. This proactive acquisition strategy has been well received by the market, underlining BitMine's commitment to building a long-term crypto portfolio.

BitMine's financial strength is bolstered by its substantial cash reserves. The company now holds $398 million in unencumbered cash, a sharp increase from the previous $389 million. The rise in cash holdings further demonstrates BitMine's ability to fund its aggressive expansion strategy and investment into the cryptocurrency market.

With a strong cash position, BitMine is not only well-equipped to weather market fluctuations but also to seize new opportunities. The company's ability to balance substantial crypto investments with liquid assets places it in a favorable position for future growth. BitMine's cash reserves play a critical role in its ability to fund acquisitions and continue its market-leading presence.

BitMine continues to dominate the crypto space, with its daily trading volume reaching an average of $1.6 billion, ranking 8 among U.S. stocks. This level of trading activity places it ahead of major firms like Arista Networks, underscoring its significance in the financial market. Alongside its growing asset base, BitMine also leads in trading liquidity, attracting significant institutional capital.

The company's robust liquidity is a major factor in its success, contributing to its dominance in global crypto treasury markets. BitMine's strategic acquisitions, such as its stake in Eightco Holdings, enhance its portfolio and add diversification. As the crypto market recovers from volatility, BitMine's stock continues to benefit from growing investor interest and rising crypto values.

What Food Texture Teaches Us about Perception, Culture and Language

Kendra Pierre-Louis steps in as interim host and dives into the science behind why some foods—especially mayonnaise—can gross us out.

By Rachel Feltman, Kendra Pierre-Louis, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio

Rachel Feltman: Happy Monday, listeners! For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman.

Today, instead of our usual news roundup, I'm here to introduce you to our new interim host. I'm actually going on parental leave for a little bit, and I'll be gone until sometime in the spring of 2026, but the amazing, award-winning Kendra Pierre-Louis is here to fill in for me while I'm gone. And today we figured we would chat about who she is and what she likes to write about so that you could get to know her.

Kendra, welcome.

If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.

Kendra Pierre-Louis: Hey, Rachel. [Laughs.] I was gonna be like, “Thanks for having me.” [Laughs.]

Feltman: [Laughs.] Settle in. Make yourself comfortable.

So, Kendra, tell our listeners a little bit about who you are.

Pierre-Louis: I'm a climate reporter, like, mostly by training, and I've been working in climate for a decade now, almost. I think my first job was actually with you ...

Feltman: Yes, at Popular Science [laughs].

Pierre-Louis: At Popular Science. Woot, woot!

The most important thing, I think, to know about me is that I hate mayonnaise.

Feltman: [Laughs.] It's true that there are many accolades I could tack onto your name, but if someone had to say one thing about a journalist that would make me say, “Oh, that's Kendra,” it would be [laughs] “the one who really hates mayonnaise.”

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.]

Feltman: So [laughs], but this is—listeners might be confused about why we would bring this up in the context of you hosting Science Quickly, but it is something that you've really used to launch several really fascinating science stories. So yeah, tell us more about your history with mayo. How did this contentious relationship begin?

Pierre-Louis: I think I came out of the womb as a mayo hater. I just never liked it, and it just got more aggressive with age. Like, when I was quite young—I can't believe I'm gonna admit this—I could eat coleslaw, but only the coleslaw from KFC, which is 90 percent vinegar anyway. And then I think the turning point was: I was eight years old, and we were on a road trip back from Florida, and my mom handed me a sandwich, and I looked at her, and I said, “This doesn't have mayo in it, does it?” and she reassured me that it did not. And I bit into it, and it had Miracle Whip, and that's when I knew you people need to be stopped [laughs].

Feltman: [Laughs.]

Pierre-Louis: And by “you people,” I mean mayo lovers [laughs].

Feltman: Yeah [laughs].

Feltman: And, yeah, while we were working together at Popular Science you wrote a real manifesto against mayo that took you on, like, a really fascinating journey into the science of food and texture and perception. So tell us a little bit about some of what you've learned.

Pierre-Louis: Yeah, I think that story is called “Mayonnaise is disgusting, and science agrees,” and if I recall correctly, that may be the first time that, like, a third-party entity lobbied my editor for me to take down a story [laughs], which goes to show you, yet again, the impact and the weight of Big Mayo.

I've learned kind of two things. I've learned sort of more broadly, like, trying to understand—because I talk about mayo the most because it comes up the most. Like, you'll order french fries or something, and that'll come out drizzled with mayo, and, like, nowhere on the menu did it mention that it had mayo in it. But I actually don't like any savory, creamy foods, so no fettuccine Alfredo. I don't like butter. Tillamook cheese company just came out with Butternaise, which is a blend of butter and mayonnaise, and I think they just created it to kill me.

Feltman: [Laughs.] See, as someone who loves butter and mayonnaise, I have to agree that's a bridge too far [laughs].

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.] And so there are kind of two buckets, which is, like, the texture of the food itself, which I've dug into a lot, and how in the West in general—like there are a lot of words in, like, Mandarin, for example, related to the texture of food, and most Western languages, and English in particular, are not that colorful with our descriptions.

And the texture of food on its own is just, like, really fascinating. I like to toss out, like, little facts, like have you ever wondered why, like, so many sour candies tend to come with, like, a rough texture on them? And it's because we perceive foods as more sour if they're rough than if they're smooth.

Feltman: That's so interesting.

Pierre-Louis: Ice cream, for example, if you've ever made ice cream yourself, the batter is almost, like—you look at how much sugar you put in it, and you're like, “No one could eat this.” It's so much sugar, and it's because we don't perceive sweetness as well ...

Feltman: Mm.

Pierre-Louis: When foods are very cold.

Feltman: Oh, that's interesting. I—it's funny—I was reading a random article, and it referenced very matter-of-factly the time such and such actor gained weight by drinking microwaved Häagen-Dazs, and I was like ...

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.] My God. Oh, my God.

Feltman: I was like, “That does sound disgusting, but fundamentally, how is it different from a milkshake?” But I think, crucially [laughs], the milk that dilutes the milkshake and the fact that it's cold makes a big difference.

Pierre-Louis: Yeah, and that word you just used is kind of the other bucket that I've, like, really dug into, which is that, for people like me, there are foods that I don't like—like, I don't like ketchup, for example. But, like, I don't think about ketchup. It doesn't ...

Feltman: You're not disgusted by ketchup.

Pierre-Louis: Ketchup doesn't haunt me. It doesn't disgust me.

Feltman: Mm.

Pierre-Louis: Whereas mayo's really physically—like, it's not even—I would need to go through a lot of therapy and training to get to a place where I could eat it. The smell, everything about it—oh, God, like, I can't have it in my home.

Feltman: Mm.

Pierre-Louis: It's just, like—it is contaminating to me in a way that, like, ketchup is not.

Feltman: Yeah, well, and what have you learned about disgust?

Pierre-Louis: It's innate. It's built into us. Obviously, what we express disgust towards varies a little bit, but we tend to have kind of an innate disgust towards bodily fluids and death, the smell of death: two big things that are kind of hardwired into us. So I jokingly say that the reason I don't like mayo is it reminds me of pus, which no mayo eater [laughs] ever wants to hear.

Feltman: No, no, I don't wanna hear that.

Pierre-Louis: But that face you just made when I said “pus,” that's, like, a hardwired ...

Feltman: Yeah.

Pierre-Louis: Kind of disgust.

Feltman: Well, and I remember a story you wrote for PopSci that got into some of the descriptors for food textures that we lack in English, which has fascinated me ever since. I would love to hear some of your favorites.

Pierre-Louis: So the one that I talk about the most and the one that I love the most is the texture of boba or udon, or ramen has it. And it's, like, food that has, like, a bounce to it before it gives way ...

Feltman: Mm.

Pierre-Louis: So it's not quite chewy, 'cause boba isn't quite chewy—like, it does kind of, like, release at a certain point. And that is, like, top 10 of my favorite textures.

Like, the researchers actually categorize texture sort of more broadly [based on], like, the type of food. Like, there's crunchers, who prefer foods that, you know, are crunchy, so potato chips; smooshers, who like soft, creamy foods, like pudding or, I'm guessing, Alfredo sauce; suckers, who prefer, like, hard candy that dissolves slowly over time; and chewers, and they prefer foods that can be chewed for a long time, like gummy candy. And I'm 100 percent a chewer.

What is—like, of those four categories, chewers, crunchers, suckers, smooshers, which are you?

Feltman: That's a really good question. I guess if I had to pick one, I would be a chewer, but I feel like everything but [smooshers] seems on the table for me. Though I really [laughs]—I definitely know people who love a mush, and I don't have a—there are many mushes I enjoy; I love an oatmeal [laughs]. But yeah, I can't say that I think of that as a texture I crave [laughs].

Pierre-Louis: Yeah, I think I'm clearly a chewer and then cruncher, and then I tolerate being a sucker ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Pierre-Louis: But I'm not a smoosher at all. When I was in college my mom bought me a giant package of, like, instant oatmeal, and, you know, I was, like, a broke college student, so I had to eat it, and the way I dealt with it was I just ate it undercooked.

Feltman: Sure, yeah [laughs].

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.] I had great cholesterol that year, but—so there were pros and cons, but [laughs].

Feltman: So outside of your forays into food texture what are some of your favorite topics to cover?

Pierre-Louis: I love climate generally because climate touches everything, and so it's, like, this really interesting inroad into, like, the world at large. And I like the way climate brings you into contact with people. I love looking at solutions 'cause I feel like so much, when we're talking about climate change, it's looking at the problem, and I really enjoy looking at solutions within climate journalism.

Right now I'm also looking a little bit at, like, psychology ...

Feltman: Mm-hmm.

Pierre-Louis: A little bit, like, what allows people to normalize really terrible things ...

Feltman: Mm, yeah.

Pierre-Louis: And what allows people to sort of not fight back or to acquiesce in sort of—you know, kind of like the Stanford prison experiment ...

Feltman: Sure.

Pierre-Louis: But not that intensely [laughs].

Feltman: Yeah.

Pierre-Louis: More, more like in everyday scenarios, like the choice that people make to fight or to not fight.

And also, I'm kind of obsessed with fame at the moment, like, the psychology of fame, both as, you know, like, what makes us attracted to famous people? What is the power that fame holds over us? And not just, like, in terms of celebrity, but, like, we reproduce kind of fame over and over again. Like, the most popular kid at your high school was famous, right?

Feltman: Mm, right.

Pierre-Louis: A much lower level, obviously, but, like, it still reproduces that feeling, and what is that, and, like, why are we into it?

Feltman: Yeah, so you'll be at the hosting helm of Science Quickly for a few months. What stories are you most interested in pursuing while you're here?

Pierre-Louis: You've, you know, left some pretty big shoes to temporarily fill ...

Feltman: Nooo [laughs].

Pierre-Louis: So thank you for that [laughs]. The expectations are quite high.

I think there's a number of things. Like, obviously, we're in a really interesting time in terms of, like, public health.

Feltman: Sure, yeah.

Pierre-Louis: Unfor—I wish, maybe, we were in less interesting times.

Feltman: I'd love to live in uninteresting times, frankly [laughs].

Pierre-Louis: [Laughs.] What are they even like?

Feltman: Yeah, I don't know.

Pierre-Louis: I think I experienced them as a child.

So, like, there's public health, I think. Looking at a little bit, maybe, of the science behind extremism. And then sort of a little bit of light, a little bit of levity—it can't be dark all of the time. I love a good animal story.

Feltman: Yeah, we have fun here. We gotta cover the horrors, but [laughs] we, we also have a good time.

Well, Kendra, thanks so much for sitting down so our listeners could get to know you, and of course, they will be hearing you three times a week in their feed, so they're about to get to know you a lot better.

Pierre-Louis: Awesome. Thanks so much for having me, and I'm excited to be here.

Feltman: Well, that's all for today's episode, and that's it for me until 2026, so I'll toss it over to you.

Pierre-Louis: Tune in on Wednesday when we talk about griefbots, or how AI is helping people deal with the loss of their loved ones.

An international team of researchers has identified a new weakness in prostate cancer cells that could lead to more effective treatments for one of the most common cancers among men.

The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), was led by scientists from Flinders University in Australia and South China University of Technology. Their findings highlight two enzymes, PDIA1 and PDIA5, that play a key role in helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist existing treatments.

Enzymes That Protect Cancer Cells

According to the researchers, PDIA1 and PDIA5 act like molecular bodyguards for the androgen receptor (AR), a protein that drives prostate cancer growth. When these enzymes are blocked, the AR loses stability and breaks apart, causing cancer cells to die and tumors to shrink in both lab cultures and animal models.

The team also discovered that combining drugs that inhibit PDIA1 and PDIA5 with enzalutamide, a standard medication for prostate cancer, made the treatment significantly more effective.

""We've discovered a previously unknown mechanism that prostate cancer cells use to protect the androgen receptor, which is a key driver of the disease,"" explains senior author Professor Luke Selth, Head of Prostate Cancer Research and Co-Director of the Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute's Cancer Impact program.

""By targeting these enzymes, we can destabilize the AR and make tumors more vulnerable to existing therapies like enzalutamide.""

A Promising Combination Therapy

Lead author Professor Jianling Xie, who began the research at Flinders University, said the combination therapy worked well in both patient-derived tumor samples and mouse models, showing strong potential for clinical use.

""This is an exciting step forward,"" says Dr. Xie, now based at South China University of Technology. ""Our findings show that PDIA1 and PDIA5 are not just helpers of cancer growth but they're also promising targets for new treatments that could work alongside existing drugs.""

Disrupting Cancer's Energy Supply

The study also revealed that PDIA1 and PDIA5 do more than just protect the AR. They help cancer cells manage stress and maintain their energy production systems. When the enzymes are blocked, the mitochondria -- the cell's power generators -- become damaged, leading to oxidative stress that further weakens the cancer cells.

""This dual impact of hitting both the AR and the cancer's energy supply makes these enzymes especially attractive targets,"" adds Dr. Xie. ""It's like cutting off both the fuel and the engine at the same time.""

Next Steps Toward Safer Treatments

Professor Selth notes that while current PDIA1 and PDIA5 inhibitors are promising, they still need to be refined for patient use. Some existing compounds can affect healthy cells, so future studies will focus on designing safer and more selective versions.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Although treatments such as hormone therapy and AR-targeting drugs have greatly improved survival rates, resistance to these therapies remains a major challenge. This new discovery may help overcome that resistance and improve treatment options for men with advanced prostate cancer.

The research received support from Cancer Council SA, Cancer Council NSW, the Flinders Foundation, the Movember Foundation, the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, The Hospital Research Foundation, Cancer Australia, Masonic Charities Trust, the Australian Research Council, and several international funding organizations.

Aging trajectories are influenced by modifiable risk factors, and prior evidence has hinted that multilingualism may have protective potential. However, reliance on suboptimal health markers, small samples, inadequate confounder control and a focus on clinical cohorts led to mixed findings and limited applicability to healthy populations. Here, we developed biobehavioral age gaps, quantifying delayed or accelerated aging in 86,149 participants across 27 European countries. National surveys provided individual-level positive (functional ability, education, cognition) and adverse (cardiometabolic conditions, female sex, sensory impairments) factors, while country-level multilingualism served as an aggregate exposure. Biobehavioral factors predicted age (R2 = 0.24, r = 0.49, root mean squared error = 8.61), with positive factors linked to delayed aging and adverse factors to accelerated aging. Multilingualism emerged as a protective factor in cross-sectional (odds ratio = 0.46) and longitudinal (relative risk = 0.70) analyses, whereas monolingualism increased risk of accelerated aging (odds ratio = 2.11; relative risk = 1.43). Effects persisted after adjusting for linguistic, physical, social and sociopolitical exposomes. These results underscore the protective role of multilingualism and its broad applicability for global health initiatives.

Associations between number of spoken languages and BAGs across age cohorts (n = 86,149 participants). A) Odds ratio (OR) estimates from the cross-sectional analysis and B) relative risk (RR) estimates from the longitudinal analysis, both stratified by age. Across designs, results show that risk of accelerated aging increases with age among monolinguals. For individuals speaking one additional language, the protective effect weakens with age. In contrast, speaking two or more additional languages is linked to progressively stronger protection with advancing age.

Hamilton (Ham) Smith co-discovered type II restriction enzymes, molecular scissors that cut DNA at precise sequence sites, which proved to be an essential tool for the emerging field of molecular biology. For this work he shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Werner Arber and Daniel Nathans. Smith began a second career in 1993, when he agreed to collaborate with me on sequencing the genome of the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae. On its publication in 1995, it was the first complete genome of any organism.

That fortunate collaboration led to the first draft human genome sequence in 2001, and then to the first cell made from a synthetic genome in 2010. Smith was a scientist's scientist, working in the laboratory almost every day and quietly being an inspiration, friend and a collaborator to all his colleagues.

A wealth of discovery built on the Human Genome Project — by the numbers

A wealth of discovery built on the Human Genome Project — by the numbers

Born in New York City, Smith grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, where his father was a college professor. Smith discovered biology while studying mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to receive his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1956. Following his military service in the US Navy, and a medical residency at Henry Ford hospital in Detroit, Michigan, in 1962, Smith received a fellowship from the US National Institutes of Health to work with Myron Levine — a pioneer in infectious-disease research — at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Studying the bacteriophage P22, a virus that infects the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium, he mastered DNA isolation techniques that became an essential component of all his main contributions to science.

In 1967, Smith joined the microbiology department at Johns Hopkins. Beginning work on H. influenzae, he discovered a restriction enzyme by studying changes in DNA viscosity. He used several clever techniques to prove that the enzyme recognized a unique DNA sequence, long before the advent of DNA sequencing, and published two key papers in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1970 (H. O. Smith and K. W. Wilcox J. Mol. Biol. 51, 379–391 (1970); T. J. Kelly Jr and H. O. Smith J. Mol. Biol. 51, 393–409; 1970). His parents were driving to the grocery shop on 12 October 1978 when the news came over their car radio that Hamilton Smith at Johns Hopkins had won the Nobel prize. His mother told him that she looked at his father and said, “Do you suppose there is another Hamilton Smith at Hopkins?”

In 1993, Smith and I met at a conference in Bilbao, Spain. I had founded the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) in Rockville, Maryland, the year before and Smith agreed to join the science advisory board. At his suggestion, we decided to collaborate on sequencing the genome of H. influenzae using my idea of whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The method is dependent on achieving a perfect statistical Poisson distribution of the DNA fragments that cover the genome in a genomic sequencing library, and Smith developed techniques to achieve this. We sequenced 25,000 fragments and mathematically assembled them into the complete circular genome. After this, Smith joined TIGR and its successor firm, the J. Craig Venter Institute, where he stayed for the remaining 25 years of his career. We went on to collaborate on dozens of other genomes, including the Neisseria meningitidis genome that led to the development of the first meningococcal B vaccine that has saved thousands of lives.

After more than a decade of planning, the launch of the African Medicines Agency (AMA) is being celebrated in Mombasa, Kenya, this week at the Seventh Biennial Scientific Conference on Medical Products Regulation in Africa. The agency's establishment marks a pivotal moment in Africa's public health, at a time when the need for biomedical research conducted in Africa, focused on African health problems, has never been greater.

Africa holds higher levels of human genetic diversity than anywhere else on Earth, but this diversity has not been adequately studied. And many globally approved treatments and vaccines for diseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis are less effective, and can even be harmful in some people of African ancestry1,2.

Africa: tackle HIV and COVID-19 together

This year, cuts of billions of US dollars in international funding for biomedical research and health services in Africa have left millions of people without access to life-saving treatments or, in the case of researchers and health-care workers, unemployed. This demonstrates the immense vulnerability that comes with relying on funding from external donors.

What's more, Africa's phenomenal population growth and pace of urbanization is bringing fresh challenges — as well as opportunities — around health and disease. In Africa's cities today, the inhabitants of increasingly affluent neighbourhoods are demanding high-quality medicines and health care. But in low-income areas, high population density, inadequate housing and poor sanitation are facilitating the spread of respiratory and diarrhoeal infections3. And everywhere, inadequate diets, air pollution, smoking and physical inactivity are driving increased rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer4. By 2100, Africa is expected to host 13 of the world's 20 largest cities5, and such inequalities are likely to worsen.

In the context of all these challenges, the AMA is more than just another regulatory body. It represents a test of whether Africa can claim its rightful place in shaping the science that will help to determine the health of its growing population.

If the AMA ensures that preclinical models for drug testing reflect African biology, that African genomes are woven into drug discovery from the start, and that clinical trials conducted on the continent are rigorous, it will improve the health of billions of people of African ancestry. By helping to generate a more complete picture of human genetic diversity and the links between genetic variation, disease and treatments, it will also redefine standards around drug development and clinical trials globally.

Multiple studies spanning three decades have shown that individuals from different regions and ethnic backgrounds respond to medicines differently6. But although Africa holds around 18% of the world's population and accounts for 25% of the global disease burden7, the continent's genetic diversity is rarely considered in preclinical or clinical research8.

African biomedical data sets are hugely under-represented. Only 4% of the data in the Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB), a public database that provides information on the links between genes, drugs and diseases, come from individuals of African ancestry, for instance. 

Likewise, to test drugs, researchers globally are increasingly relying on in vitro models developed from human cells or tissues. These include 3D cell cultures called organoids that mimic the structure and function of specific organs or tissues, and liver microsomes, which are collections of subcellular fragments derived from liver cells. But most of these tools have been derived from samples obtained from individuals of European ancestry9.

And when it comes to clinical trials, under 3% of them are conducted in Africa (see ‘Poorly represented'). A study published last year found that, between 2015 and 2023, out of tens of thousands of phase I trials (which assess the safety, side effects and optimal dosing regimen of treatments) conducted around the world, only 17 were conducted in Kenya, only 12 in Nigeria and only 3 in Ethiopia10, despite these countries being among the leaders in clinical research in sub-Saharan Africa.

The result of all of this is the development of treatments that are ineffective or even detrimental for certain African populations. A compound called efavirenz, for example, was the key ingredient of first-line antiretroviral treatment in Africa and around the world until 201811. But Zimbabwean people with HIV who harbour certain genetic polymorphisms in CYP2B6, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing efavirenz, experience numbness in their feet and other symptoms of neurotoxicity when taking the drug12.

What's more, diseases that disproportionately affect African populations, such as sickle-cell disease — which affects roughly 1 in 100 people living in West Africa, compared with 1 in 15,000 people living in Western Europe13 — have tended to be neglected.

Both sickle-cell disease and Parkinson's disease contribute to about the same number of deaths globally each year, but whereas nearly 50,000 studies on Parkinson's disease have been published in the past five years (according to a PubMed search), only around 7,800 studies on sickle-cell disease were published in the same period. (Deaths from Parkinson's disease occur mainly in Asia, Europe and North America.)

Could Africa be the future for genomics research?

Could Africa be the future for genomics research?

To ensure that African genomic diversity — and African needs — are better embedded into all stages of drug discovery and development, the AMA must ensure that African pharmacogenomic data (genetic information that signals how individuals will respond to medications) are integrated into drug discovery. It must mandate or incentivize the use of in vitro models derived from cells or tissues obtained from individuals of African ancestry9,14. And it must incentivize drug developers to focus on interventions for diseases that disproportionately affect African populations.

To do this, the AMA should require that applicants for regulatory approval demonstrate how they have considered genetic variability relevant to African populations in preclinical and clinical trials. Variants in the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene family can affect the metabolism of drugs and toxins, for instance; variants in transporter proteins can influence how drugs are absorbed by, distributed in and eliminated from the body; and some variants of some genes, such as APOL1, increase people's risk of developing a disease. (The APOL1 variants G1 and G2 are more common in individuals of African ancestry and a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease.)

The AMA should require that investigators use models derived from cells or tissues from individuals of African ancestry in all toxicity, efficacy, drug-metabolism and pharmacokinetic studies (which examine what the body does to drugs over time) submitted to it for approval. Or, to incentivize those applying for regulatory approval to take their treatment to the next phase of testing, the agency should offer expedited review pathways or reduced application fees when preclinical studies use ‘Africa-relevant' tools.

In collaboration with African research institutions and global consortia, such as the Innovative Medicines Initiative, a public–private partnership involving the European Union and European life-science industries, the AMA should promote the creation of continent-wide pharmacogenomic databases.

Through partnering with African academic institutions, such as the Holistic Drug Discovery and Development Centre at the University of Cape Town in South Africa, and global funders, such as the Gates Foundation, the agency can help to drive the development of biobanks across Africa — facilities that collect, store and manage human biological samples. This would give more researchers across the continent access to Africa-relevant preclinical tools.

Ultimately, pharmaceutical companies, both in Africa and worldwide, could use these data and resources, in conjunction with artificial intelligence and other computational tools, to make predictions about how certain compounds will affect a given population. In fact, to encourage multinational drug developers to use such data sets and biorepositories, the AMA could help to ensure that open-access African data sets are interoperable with other platforms used in drug development, such as PharmGKB.

Alongside these steps to make biomedical research and drug discovery more relevant to African populations, the AMA needs to make it much easier for drug developers to conduct clinical trials on the continent.

Currently, drug developers wanting to work in Africa are hampered by insufficient or inadequate laboratories and infrastructure, a shortage of trained scientists who can run clinical trials, a lack of experts in research ethics and regulation, and variability in countries' laws and standards around the handling of biological samples.

The AMA can help to increase the number of phase I trials being conducted in Africa by fostering partnerships between Africa-based research institutions, such as the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi, and international funders. It could also work with some of Africa's continent-wide organizations, such as the International Vaccine Institute's Africa Regional Office, which was established last year in Kigali, Rwanda, to boost research and development (R&D) of vaccines on the continent.

To ensure that efforts in different countries are coordinated, the agency must help to develop a central database for clinical trials conducted in Africa, perhaps building on the work of the Clinical Trials Community Africa Network. This group of African research-ethics bodies, research institutions and pharmaceutical companies is coordinating a network of clinical trial sites and laboratories to harmonize clinical trials conducted in Africa.

As a central, umbrella organization, the AMA should coordinate the reviews of applications for clinical trials and thereby facilitate the design of large-scale, multicountry phase II studies, which assess the efficacy and safety of treatments. Such studies, when conducted independently in any one country, often lack the sample sizes needed to reveal clinically meaningful differences in how genetic subpopulations differ in their response to a treatment.

By harmonizing the regulatory environment across the continent, the AMA can help to facilitate phase III clinical trials (which aim to provide evidence of therapeutic efficacy and safety in thousands of patients in multiple countries), phase IV studies (evaluations of treatments in real-world settings), and the monitoring of fake medicines, too.

To promote a healthy ecosystem for biomedical research and drug and vaccine development in Africa, the AMA must beware some of the pitfalls that have hampered efforts of other continent-wide health initiatives, including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in its early years.

First, the AMA must not let Africa's diverse countries pull in different directions and erode people's trust in it or the medical products it approves.

Amazon Music is bringing fans together in a new app feature called “Fan Groups” that helps listeners discover, share and chat about music recommended by like-minded fans.

A beta version of the feature is rolling out in Canada on iOS and Android, Amazon said Monday.

With the addition of dedicated communities, the interactive Fan Groups feature gives listeners the ability to stream, discover and share without leaving the Music app.

Fans can explore and create groups and have conversations about artists, songs, genres and more. The groups are public, and can even be created by artists who want to connect with their fans.

The beta launch features several active groups created and populated by real fans across musical interests including indie rock, country, K-pop and workout playlists, according to Amazon.

Fan Groups will roll out to customers in the U.S. and additional markets worldwide beginning next year.

A year after launching Amazon Haul, the company is expanding the low-cost shopping service globally — escalating its challenge to Temu and Shein just as U.S. trade policies disrupt the economics of the import model used by the Chinese companies.

The service, which began in the U.S., has now expanded to 25 countries and regions, with the company rebranding Haul as “Amazon Bazaar” in a growing number of those markets.

For Haul's anniversary, Amazon is officially taking Haul out of beta and holding a two-day shopping event on Monday and Tuesday, Nov. 10 and 11. The company says the event will feature tens of thousands of items priced at $1 on the first day, followed by 11-cent “hidden treasures” on the second. 

The moves comes as Temu and Shein, who pioneered this form of online shopping, grapple with the U.S. decision to end the de minimis trade exemption. The policy previously allowed packages valued at less than $800 to ship directly from China to U.S. consumers duty-free.

Amazon has been reportedly been making greater use of its U.S. fulfillment network for Haul orders, minimizing the severe tariff impacts from direct-to-consumer shipments from China.

Haul gives shoppers a separate storefront to browse items that are typically priced under $20, and many for less than $10. After launching initially as a mobile-only service, it has since expanded to the web. Orders usually arrive within a week or two.

Amazon said customer visits to Haul have tripled since June and its product selection has grown by nearly 400% in the past year, with more than 1 million items under $10. To encourage larger orders, Amazon now offers 5% off orders over $50 and 10% off orders over $75.

Redmond, Wash.-based Kymeta, a mobile satellite communications company, announced Manny Mora as its new president and CEO, effective immediately.

The company, founded in 2012 with backing from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, is ramping up efforts to provide services across the U.S. Department of Defense and allied militaries.

Mora spent nearly 40 years with General Dynamics Mission Systems, leading the Virginia-based company's Space and Intelligence Systems. In this role he supported the company's partnerships with DOD, the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and others.

“As the defense community modernizes its command-and-control infrastructure, Kymeta is uniquely positioned to deliver mobile SATCOM solutions that perform in the most demanding environments,” said Nicole Piasecki, the executive chair of Kymeta's board of directors, in a statement. 

“Manny Mora brings the operational depth and strategic clarity to scale our impact and strengthen our role as a trusted partner to national security customers,” she added. 

Kymeta is riding tailwinds from an aerospace and defense sector being reshaped by advances in software systems, autonomous platforms, satellite communications, and AI. 

Kymeta was recently chosen by the U.S. Army as the multi-orbit satellite communications provider for its Next Generation Command and Control pilot. The initiative will use the company's Osprey u8 terminal technology to provide connectivity for military operators. 

“Our breakthrough technology is already transforming how defense and government customers communicate across domains,” Mora said in a statement. 

In taking the role, Mora replaces Rick Bergman, a former executive vice president at semiconductor giant AMD, who took the helm in April 2024.

Kymeta makes use of an innovative type of technology called metamaterials to build antennas that can be steered by software, without moving parts. Its hybrid cellular-satellite terminals enable communications in hard-to-reach areas — an application that's been of particular interest to defense customers.

The company also provides technology for emergency services, maritime operations, wildfire-fighting and other applications.

Kymeta raised $84 million in 2022. Total funding to date is nearly $400 million.

Google Maps is adding new AI features, including a builder agent and an MCP server — a tool that connects AI assistants to Google Maps' technical documentation — to help developers and users create interactive projects using Maps data and code. The company said it is using Gemini models across the board to power these features.

Among these new tools, the builder agent is a tool that, just like many other coding tools, lets you describe the kind of interactive map-based prototype you want to build in text and creates one for you. For instance, you can type “create a Street View tour of a city,” “create a map visualizing real-time weather in my region,” or “list pet-friendly hotels in the city.”

Once the code is generated, you can export it, test the preview project using your own API keys as needed, or modify the project in Firebase Studio.

The same tool also has a styling agent that lets users create a customized map to match a particular style format or theme. This could help brands create maps with specific color coding.

Google already provides map data grounding via the Gemini API. The company is now introducing a similar feature, called Grounding Lite, which allows developers to ground their own AI models using Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources.

With this feature, AI assistants can answer questions like, “How far is the nearest grocery store?” The company is also shipping Contextual View, a low-code Google Maps component that can provide visual understanding to users for such questions. The feature can show a list, a map view, or a 3D display as an answer.

Google is also adding a code assistant toolkit, the MCP server, which connects with Google Maps' documentation. Developers can use this connection to get answers about how to use the Google Maps API and data. Last month, the company launched extensions for Gemini's command line tool to let developers access Maps data.

The company is also trying to add more Gemini-powered features for Maps on the consumer side. Last week, it enabled users to use Gemini hands-free with Maps for navigation. For users in India, Google added incident alerts and speed limit data to the Maps app in select areas.

Carbon management startup Carbon Direct is buying another carbon credit startup, Pachama, the companies announced today.

Pachama laid off around 20 employees this summer as voluntary carbon markets softened. The company had attracted investments from a range of prominent names, including Amazon's Climate Pledge, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, and several celebrity angel investors, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laura Dern, and Serena Williams.

“The current uncertain and volatile financial, economic, and geopolitical climate, added to the anti-ESG agenda in the U.S., is indeed having an effect on corporate sustainability budgets,” Diego Saez Gil, CEO of Pachama, told Trellis when the layoffs happened. “The impact is especially acute in the voluntary carbon market, which was already in a moment of correction.”

Pachama had raised $88 million, while Carbon Direct had raised $60.8 million, according to PitchBook. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Pachama was focused on nature-based carbon credits, which typically result when forests are either restored or preserved. Carbon Direct, on the other hand, is more of a carbon market advisory and accounting firm, helping companies track and report their carbon footprints and then vet carbon credits to offset them.

The carbon markets have been roiled by uncertainty in the last few years, and not all of it has been the result of political whiplash in the U.S. and elsewhere. Voluntary carbon markets have come under fire for falling short of their promises. 

For example, a major investigation by The Guardian found that more than 90% of one verifier's credits did not actually result in any carbon reductions. One of the biggest challenges facing nature-based carbon credits is the question of whether forests protected by the purchases were threatened with destruction in the first place.

And while large companies have been dialing back their publicity around ESG measures, many are still interested in sticking to their net-zero promises. Carbon Direct customers include Microsoft, Shopify, American Express, JP Morgan, Alaska Airlines, and BlackRock.

Criminal and Civil liability are the two topics to focus on - you will find that non-human entities have very limited categories of crimes that apply to them. This is a key topic in the emergence of 'seemingly conscious' or 'seemingly unitary' AGI compute entities.Also worth noting that Common Law tends to be the primary mode of law globally, even in counties that are nominally Code Napoleon (aka Civil Law) countries.

You get the corporate entity first, and this is required to get the bank account.So, if the bank account was required to get the corporate entity formed, none would ever be formed, as the bank acct and the corporate authorization would forever be waiting for the other prerequisite to be complete.And no, AFAICT, there is no hard requirement for a bank account to maintain a corporation, although in practice it would make doing almost everything quite inconvenient.

But I think the boring answer here is that we sometimes need legal abstractions. If they don't exist, Microsoft is no longer a distinct entity; it's 200,000 people who for some reason talk to each other, and you can't really audit their finances, punish them collectively, or set any ground rules that apply specifically to their joint activities.This obviously has negative externalities, because while a corporation is easy to fine, it's hard to put in prison... but trying to approach it differently would be about as fun as modeling a CPU as a bunch of transistors.

There's nothing stopping the legislature (other than their own self-interest) from passing a law that executives and board members are criminally liable for the malfeasance of their entity. We already apply that logic to positions like a medical lab director.

reply

The problem is just that the board can usually claim they did not know, and that they have deep pockets to afford good attorneys. To get around the first thing, you have strict liability laws.Strict liability laws, though, are how you end up with the situation where barkeepers are criminally liable for selling alcohol to underage people, even if they could not have known the buyer was underage (and that's about the only instance of strict liability in criminal law). I personally find this very unjust and would rather that strict liability was not part of criminal law.

Historically and practically speaking, I get the impression that the boat stuff seems the least controversial and makes the most sense.  Incoherent to want to sue a river for flooding, but if a boat crashes into your house for example, then you'd like to be able to at least seize the boat without enduring the back-and-forth deflection between owners and operators.

reply

Only if/because they are reading too much into the concept of legal personhood. A thing being a person doesn't mean the thing is equivalent to a human or that it has every right that every human has. It generally just means that the law attributes certain rights and obligations to that thing because that is more convenient than finding the right human(s) to attribute them to in the circumstances.

reply

Why do you think this would be the case? I agree with the former but not the latter.

reply

The more logical reason is that if corporate personhood sucks and we have it anyway, then like it or not, now we need to extend it elsewhere just to level the playing field.  If anti-environmental interests can hide behind it as a justification that makes their fight easier, then let the environmental interests do the same thing.

Three replies now, all saying that this is nonsense (including this one). I would venture to say it's the other way around: if you are okay with a river having 'personhood' then that logically leads to being okay with a group of people having 'personhood'.Elephants, on the other hand, have a better case for 'personhood' than a river. An elephant has autonomy, is thinking, can feel pain, has emotions... a river has none of these things, nor does a corporation (even if the parts {humans} consisting of a corporation do).

Ok if we are already extending personhood to corporations, who with their sheer power transcend individuals, why not also extend that fiction to other entities that would actually need active protection?Wouldn't corporations do just fine and we would live in a better world if we stripped any form of personhood from corporations? The biggest collision area stemming from corporate personhood is its collision with other, actual persons. The only reason corporate personhood is a thing is because it allows corporate lawyers to pick from a bigger pool of personal rights in a perversion of the spirit of these original rights. Thus watering down the existing right.

Not at all.  It allows corporations to own property, enter contracts and appear as a plaintiff or defendant in lawsuits.  Without legal personhood it could do none of these.

And yet these things do basically go all the way back to the Roman empire, and I'm sure the extent and privileges of corporate personhood have been litigated once or twice since then.

Meanwhile Norway was occupied in WWII, and after that spent the next decades next to the Soviet Union, and then Russia. There's clearly been a long standing risk of actual invasion.

I don't see why Canada in particular needs such a large reserve force. This would jump Canada from number 127 to number 52 in terms of percentage of population in reserves, and bump it up to 17th in terms of absolute reserves size. For a nation with basically zero chance of invasion of its home soil and an extremely low risk of internal conflict, it's hard to imagine a scenario where anywhere near this many reservists would be required.

reply

Clearly the Canadian government doesn't feel the same way.  If they tried to conscript they'd quickly find themselves in a civil war (for the same reasons the US would), and one the Canadian capital clearly doesn't believe it'd win given how well it fared defending itself in 2022.Of course, bureaucrats aren't exactly known for their fighting prowess either.  This is mostly a statement that ""Toronto/Ottawa doesn't need the rest of the country, it can see to its own defense"", and to try and retain/engage the Elbows Up crowd (which, being the only reason the sitting government is in power, is completely understandable).

That dismisses the greatest security threats of the era with a word. Most people in that field think those threats are very well-founded. Should Canada take the risk that everything will be fine?I don't know much about Canada's current plans and how effective they would be.

While there's a lot of news and media about trade wars with the USA, the vast majority 85% of it remains under the free trade agreement. China does not even come close to a free and open market for us and their state sponsored corporate espionage is a real and growing danger.

I personally think that Canada can be our (US) greatest ally, but this is only true in the hard-power sense of the word if Canada does actually meet its defense obligations.Canada has a huge coastline, directly adjacent to our most significant threats (China & Russia), yet doesn't have a navy to speak of.We need Canada to step up to its own defense so we can keep being equal allies, otherwise Canada is a de facto protectorate and should pay for that privilege.

As a Canadian, why would it be condescending to suggest that at some point in the distant past, Canada and the U.S. could have been a single country had history played out slightly differently? There is nothing offensive about it, if anything the fact that it's a claim about a historical matter only highlights how the two countries have evolved separately and independently.Furthermore your other points are kind of bizzare. Spain and Portugal could absolutely have been a single country, and in fact they were under the Iberian Union. There are numerous other instances where the two countries came close to unifying.The historical possibility of a unified Belgium and the Netherlands is even stronger since those two countries had been unified twice.Germany and Switzerland however is a long shot, but at any rate I don't think anyone from Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain or Portugal would take offense or find it condescending that some historical event could have gone differently and reshaped all of Europe... taking offense to that suggestion as a Canadian, even during these times seems overly insecure and I don't think it's a sentiment shared by most of us.

Wars were fought. People died, generations were involved in discourse about national identity and where borders should be drawn.The US and Canada were both at one point British properties, so by some definitions, we also used to be unified. Then we weren't.Is it insecure? Maybe. The reality is that in a shooting war, we wouldn't last very long against the US, in all likelihood. Under these conditions, the least I can do is to push back against rhetoric that undermines our legitimacy as our own country.

It's definitely possible to intepret this the way Russia speaks about Ukraine - ""They shouldn't even be a country *except for a historical quirk"", but a charitable interpretation would be more along the lines of ""things could have gone slightly differently and we'd be countrymen, but instead we brothers from a different mother (country)"".

Essentially we are even closer than many people think in terms of history, but Canadian identity was seeded from the beginning with the idea of rejecting being ""American"". We are indeed your closest brothers and sisters because of history, but it's no quirk at all that we're separate -- it's the entire reason we stayed separate at all.You can also see the reverse play out -- what would become Alberta was settled by large numbers of American colonists moving to Canada, and to this day you can see the cultural impact of that in the politics and world view from the region.

And, as much as I'd like to focus on deteriorating Canada/US relations, it's likely a dual purpose. The Ukraine/Russia/NATO situation would be the second factor. OK, a triad, China/US is also on the radar. Whatever the weighting, it's pushed Canada to work on a mobilization framework, because the combined risk is high enough.Which means ""oh shit"" feelings are entirely appropriate, panic isn't.

For that to change would require generational shifts in culture and revenue generation and so on. If the US chooses not to defend them, they're exposing themselves to unacceptable risk. If the US chooses to defend, Canada isn't contributing within the same order of magnitude. If the US chose to attack, then more has gone wrong in the world than you could possibly cope with, having a few thousand more tanks, ships, and helicopters isn't going to save the day. It'd take decades to build up population, R&D infrastructure, resources, and so on, and there'd likely be a lot of pressure to not do those things and use the US military industrial complex instead.Not saying this is good for Canada, btw, just that the reality is they've kinda coasted on US coattails for decades now, and for better or worse, they're stuck. Which should in turn beg the question - if there's no practical or pragmatic point in spending a bunch of money on military preparedness and expansion, then why's that money being spent, and who's getting paid? Why are bureaucrats being militarized, instead of a discrete, well regulated military being created to meet whatever the need was?Strange politics.

The political faction all bureaucrats in the nation belong to can't find enough soldiers.  This is because they treat those soldiers with contempt- no young man wants to die for Ottawa.  Plus, the volunteer soldiers that come back from Ukraine are not going to be on Ottawa's side if domestic instability ramped up, but will be familiar with the tools of modern warfare.Ottawa is currently (and perhaps rightfully) paranoid of a domestic uprising just as much as it is of the US invading.  The US is strategically wrecking the economy of Canadian citizens only a few hours away and if those citizens violently insist on suing for peace Ottawa might lose its power forever.So, you do the next best thing- you take the faction with the political power in Canada (in this case, Ottawa bureaucrats) and tell them that if they want to keep their privileges, they must join the reserve.The fact that if any nation decided to actually attack they'd instantly flee (bureaucrats are not known for their courage under fire; that's why they're bureaucrats!) is a problem for future them.  What matters is that, to fuel the jingoism fire long enough to keep the bureaucrat faction in power, they need to be seen to be doing something, and this is that something.

Coinbase has announced the upcoming launch of a new token sales platform that will allow U.S. retail investors to participate in initial coin offerings (ICOs) for the first time since the token sale hysteria of 2017 and 2018, which eventually ended in disaster for many crypto speculators. The move to launch this platform comes just a few weeks after Coinbase acquired the investment platform Echo for $375 million.

ICOs were all the rage in 2017, as the then-relatively-new blockchain platform Ethereum appeared to have found its first major use case. While there are a few projects from this era of crypto that are still around, the hysteria around ICOs eventually turned into marketing-focused teams collecting investment from others, with not much more to show for plans than a whitepaper (if that).

The large amount of outright fraud occurring in the space at the time led to a regulatory backlash from the Biden administration, and Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather, and other celebrities were eventually charged with SEC violations regarding their promotion of dubious crypto tokens.

While the ICO market has been dormant in the United States since that time, there is now a push to bring back this type of activity under the crypto-friendly Trump administration via platforms like the new token offering facility provided by Coinbase.

Much of the fraud that was able to proliferate during the 2017 to 2018 ICO bubble came down to the lack of traditional investment standards being followed. To prevent that sort of environment from developing again, Coinbase says it will require projects to meet certain requirements to launch token sales and also use an algorithm to try to put newly-issued tokens in the hands of users who are in it for the long haul.

For example, the platform is intended to promote a wide distribution of the initial tokens and will punish token investors who tend to simply dump their allocations on the market as quickly as possible. Additionally, token issuers will be blocked from selling their allocations for at least six months, and the teams behind the projects will need to follow a disclosure policy regarding tokenomics and other attributes of the project related to credibility and trust.

Coinbase previously attempted to operate under its own token listing standards, but the SEC's view under chairman Gary Gensler at the time was basically that everything but bitcoin was a security. This eventually led to an SEC enforcement action against Coinbase, which has since been dropped.

They do, that's a known thing

— Larry Cermak (@lawmaster) December 7, 2020



Whether Coinbase can operate as a credible, neutral authority on new token sales is up to the discretion of its users. However, it should be noted that the crypto exchange previously took tokens from various projects for its Coinbase Earn project, where its users were provided with free tokens in exchange for reading about the associated projects. Put differently, Coinbase was provided with funds from token projects that were then provided to users as an incentive to sign up in exchange for creating promotional content about those same tokens.

Congress is also expected to pass its own standards and form of regulatory clarity to the crypto market in the form of the Clarity Act. That said, the odds of that passage occurring this year have dropped from a high of 87% to 21% since July, according to prediction market Polymarket.

This latest move from Coinbase is yet another example of the lines between crypto and traditional finance becoming increasingly blurred. Under this new structure, ICOs look more like initial public offerings (IPOs) with Coinbase acting as a gatekeeper of sorts in terms of which projects get the stamp of approval.

So, we now have a centralized financial institution operating an initial investment platform built on U.S. dollar-based rails (the platform uses the Coinbase-partnered USDC stablecoin from Circle) for projects that are increasingly looking more like traditional fintech than anything truly decentralized or operating outside of the traditional financial system.

It seems the crypto sector has moved far away from the original ideology Satoshi Nakamoto had when creating Bitcoin, as he pointed to “all the trust that's required to make it work” as the source of the problems with traditional finance that he intended to solve.

The third episode of It: Welcome to Derry arrived packed with flashback sequences as terrifying as they are illuminating. In Derry, circa 1908, a young boy visits a traveling circus that boasts a ghoulish sideshow and at least one creepy clown. On the way home, he meets a young girl and they become summer sweethearts—though at one point, they have a very alarming encounter in Derry's deepest, darkest forest.

Welcome to Derry fans will know, of course, that 1908 is one of Pennywise's “cycle” years—1935 is another one we hear about in the HBO series, which takes place in 1962. And the show makes it very clear who these kids grow up to be: General Francis Shaw, who's returned to Maine intent on unearthing the entity he met there for military purposes, and Rose, who now runs the Secondhand Rose shop in downtown Derry and has become a leader among the local Indigenous community.

io9 got a chance to talk to James Remar and Kimberly Guerrero, who play Shaw and Rose, about their roles in the show and the memories (both fond and frightening) that their Welcome to Derry characters share.



Cheryl Eddy, io9: It's perfect that Rose owns an antique store because she's so deeply connected to history. Why do you think it's important to have a character like Rose as part of this story?

Kimberly Guerrero: You need that sense of centeredness, that groundedness of what has come before. There was a civilization there before Derry—what was that civilization, and what was their interaction with the creature? Rose embodies that information that's been handed out from generation to generation to generation. And so the fact that she's in a secondhand store, not only with the embodied knowledge of her own people but also with the history of the people of Derry, and some of those people that have passed away too—it's a very grounding [place for her to be], and [she's] kind of the true north on the compass.

io9: We learn that Derry's Native American population has knowledge of the monster's origins and its powers. This is an angle we've never delved into before. What can you say about the way Welcome to Derry approaches the subject?

Guerrero: Finally, we finally get to unpack all of this mysterious Indian lore that's kind of undergirded a lot of the horror that we've got in the last few decades. What's so exciting about it is that when you actually do unpack it, there are powerful and mysterious elements at work. Our people understand those powerful, mysterious elements and our interrelation with the things that we can't see but that we know are there. And so we've made some pacts. We kind of understand how to mitigate these things.

I'm not talking about in the story; I'm talking about it in real life. Each reservation has their bad woods and has their place you don't go and has the protocol for how to deal with certain things. That's always rooted very much into being an Indigenous person on our land and understanding where we come from.

So all of that is fed into this story, and it's all connected through a Penobscot elder named John Bear Mitchell, who's our direct source, and we're able to make sure everything is very authentic and historically accurate.

io9: General Shaw, or Francis, as Rose calls him, has his heart in the right place, and he has a personal connection to the mission in Derry. He's also not close-minded to the supernatural. But do you think he's maybe a little blinded to the limitations of what he's trying to achieve?

James Remar: Blinded, certainly. I couldn't have put it better myself. But the funny thing about personality flaws or character defects is that generally, you are going to be blind to them. You're not going to know that you are this or that you're not that unless someone else tells you and you accept it.

I do believe that his heart is in the right place, [but] his heart has been buffeted by a lifetime of war and childhood trauma. And the only solace, the only kind and gentle times that he's experienced, was when he was frolicking with Rose after she saved his life from the demon It in the woods with a slingshot. After that, it's just been all about the military and moving forward in courage and not going backwards; not going to the past. Yet somehow the past has a way of asserting itself and it drew him back in. I think he was subconsciously blinded to what was actually happening and how he was being drawn back in. There's something that happens at the very, very last scene that I can't reveal that kind of lets you know that you haven't been forgotten. Derry remembers you.

io9: General Shaw mentions that at one point, he took an experimental drug that helped him remember his childhood in Derry. Are we talking LSD, MKULTRA kind of stuff? How deep did you dig into his military backstory?

Remar: He's got a chest full of medals. You don't get to be a lieutenant general in the United States Air Force by sitting around. I mean, he is a combat officer, he is a World War II and a Korean War veteran, and he is at the top of his class. He's among the best, which is why he is the tip of the spear of the Strategic Air Command, which we needed at the end of this second World War because 24 hours a day, seven days a week, we had B-52s circling the globe, getting ready to drop the bomb if the Russians attacked. We were living under a constant state of threat.

With espionage and the [Cold War], there was this whole thing about brainwashing. Brainwashing was all the rage, particularly with the Korean War and how soldiers there were brainwashed into becoming communists and becoming spies and turning on their own people. Mind control was huge back then and LSD was something that came [into use]. I feel that [General Shaw] could not order soldiers under him to do something that he wouldn't do himself—some of these brainwashing experiments and learn about LSD and truth serum. And that's where [he would say], “I'll go first.” That's the kind of guy I think he was.

io9: These two have a shared history and there's still chemistry between them despite their differences. How did you work together to get their reunion just right?

Remar: We both have to be these pillars of strength. And when you have an attraction to someone like that, the pillars have to lean a little bit. I feel like I messed up a little [in the scene where Francis and Rose reunite], because we shot the scene twice. The first time I was a little too taken with her: “Oh gosh, I love you from when I was nine years old.” I had to be a little bit rougher, so the finished product has me a little more contained and not as tender.

Guerrero: I think it's really incredible that—and the audience won't necessarily know this; it will be there in the subtext if you're watching really closely—but Francis is [Rose's] first love. Rose never married; Rose never had children. It's not that she didn't want to. It was just that her responsibility couldn't allow for a loss like she experienced when Francis was taken from her. She missed him and she understands [how Derry clouds memories]; she understands that once he goes, he won't remember her. It's not just the loss of him; it's that he won't remember. He won't be able to write because he won't remember me and he won't remember what we had. So that is, you know, a part of my heart that I've guarded and protected all these years. And when James and I talked about it, it was similar for him as well: he doesn't think [Francis]  married or had children.

Remar: In my office is nothing but military pictures and trophies. There are no pictures of my family on the desk. No wife, no kids.

Guerrero: I think we married our duty.

io9: But Francis kept the slingshot.

Remar: Great toy, that's a great weapon. That's David and Goliath; she saved my life with that thing.

Hispanic individuals with psoriasis were significantly less likely than non-Hispanic White patients to receive biologic therapy, a survey found. 

“Our analysis used filled prescriptions measured in the MEPS [Medical Expenditure Panel Survey] pharmacy data, providing a direct measure of access,” unlike a prior study reporting “higher biologic use among Hispanic/Latino patients,” the authors wrote. “These findings suggest a potential disparity in treatment access that warrants further study to inform equitable prescribing and disease management.”

The authors of this study were Alina S. Feng, BS, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Wilson Liao, MD, Department of Dermatology, UCSF. It was published online on November 2 in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Limitations include the study's cross-sectional design, reliance on self-reported data, and the relatively small group receiving biologics. Additionally, aggregation of non-Hispanic minorities limited subgroup assessment. Psoriasis severity data were unavailable.

This study did not receive any funding. Liao reported receiving research grants from Amgen, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Leo Pharma, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. No funding sources were reported for this study.

A recent study found that while social and behavioral drivers of diabetes were broadly shared between Southern California and the rest of the US, their importance varied by region. In Southern California, physical inactivity, lack of routine checkups, binge drinking, lack of insurance, and food insecurity emerged as top correlates, whereas nationally, obesity, food assistance, older age, and racial or ethnic minority status were key correlates.

“These findings suggest potential regional variation in the correlates of diabetes prevalence and underscore the need for further research to understand whether these differences are meaningful, why they exist, and whether they may inform more targeted interventions,” the authors wrote.

This study was led by Alexandra Descarpentrie, PhD, Department of Pediatrics, The Saban Research Institute, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California. It was published online on in JAMA Network Open.

Due to the ecological, cross-sectional design, the identified correlates indicate contextual associations rather than causal links, with potential for reverse causation. The outcome of self-reported diagnosed diabetes was also modeled and without medical confirmation. Using prevalence rather than incidence data prevented establishing temporal relationships between social and behavioral correlates and diabetes cases. The study could not distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes or account for undiagnosed cases.

This work was supported by The Southern California Center for Latino Health from the National Institute of Minority Health Disparities. Two authors disclosed serving as a scientific advisor or receiving personal fees and grants from various pharma companies and institutions.

Fresenius Kabi USA has initiated a voluntary nationwide recall of three lots of famotidine injection, USP 20 mg/2 mL (10 mg/mL, 2 mL vial), according to a company announcement posted on the FDA website. 

The recall affects the following lot numbers 6133156 and 6133194, with expiration dates of August 2026, and lot number 6133388, with an expiration date of October 2026.

The recall stems from “out-of-specification endotoxin results in certain reserve samples of one lot,” the company said. The two additional lots are being recalled as a precaution. 

Elevated endotoxin levels may lead to severe systemic reactions, including sepsis, septic shock, inflammatory and life-threatening immune responses, and potentially death. 

Nonserious adverse events have been reported in association with lot 6133156, including chills, altered mental status, changes in respiratory status, fever/increased body temperature, shivering, and shaking. 

Famotidine injection is indicated in some hospitalized patients with pathological hypersecretory conditions or intractable ulcers or as an alternative to the oral dosage forms for short-term use in patients unable to take oral medication for certain conditions, including active duodenal ulcer, benign gastric ulcer or gastroesophageal reflux disease, or maintenance therapy for duodenal ulcer patients at reduced dosage after healing of an active ulcer.

Clinicians should be alert for symptoms potentially related to endotoxin exposure in patients who have received the affected product; document use of the product in affected lots (if already administered) and monitor patients carefully; and inform prescribing clinicians and nursing staff so they can monitor for signs of endotoxin-related reaction.

Patients should be advised to contact their physician or healthcare provider if they experienced any problems that may be related to receiving the affected drug. 

Clinicians should check their inventory for famotidine injection USP 20 mg/2 mL vials; discontinue use, dispensing, and distribution of affected lots; and segregate and quarantine any affected units to prevent inadvertent use. 

For questions or product return coordination, contact Fresenius Kabi USA Quality Assurance at 1-866-716-2459 or email at productcomplaint.USA@fresenius-kabi.com.

Adverse events or quality issues related to this recall should be reported to Fresenius Kabi (1-800-551-7176) and to the FDA MedWatch program.

Elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were associated with an increased long-term risk for new-onset fractures in men, but not in women.

""When advocating for cardiovascular benefits of higher HDL levels, clinicians must concurrently evaluate and address bone health, especially in active aging men,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Richard Sutton, Lund University, Malmö, Sweden. It was published online on October 31, 2025, in Osteoporosis International.

This study was observational and did not imply that high HDL cholesterol levels caused new fractures. Vitamin D levels were not available for the analysis. Serum calcium and phosphate levels and bone mineral density were only measured at baseline.

This study did not receive any specific funding. One author reported receiving payment for lectures from Link and Swemac.

 November 10, 2025  

Almost 1 in 5 patients in emergency departments in England were cared for on trolleys or chairs in corridors this summer, a new report has found.

The All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Emergency Care said the rise in so-called corridor care left patients feeling “forgotten and vulnerable.”

The report, compiled by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM), found that treatment in corridors, waiting rooms, and other unsuitable spaces was not due to clinical need but because there was “nowhere else for these patients to go.”

Between 30 July and 13 August 2025, clinical leads from 58 type 1 emergency departments across England were surveyed about corridor care and the standards patients received.

The report found that 34.5% of respondents reported patients being cared for in ambulances outside their facilities. More than three quarters (78%) said patients were coming to harm due to the quality of care that could be delivered under current conditions.

The RCEM said it was not possible to provide high-quality care in corridors.

“It's a source of national shame,” said Dr Ian Higginson, president of the RCEM. “It's distressing, undignified, and it's putting lives at risk.” 

Record numbers of emergency attendances were seen last year, but the RCEM said overcrowding was primarily driven by system-wide undercapacity.

In 2024, 1.7 million patients waited more than 12 hours in A&E — more than 12 times the number recorded a decade ago. Ambulance handovers were dangerously delayed, with some patients left in vehicles outside hospitals and others brought into overcrowded departments without safe triage. 

Hospital bed occupancy has exceeded the safe threshold of 85% for years, averaging 93.1% in 2025. Nearly 13,000 beds were occupied by patients medically fit for discharge but unable to leave hospital. 

This “exit block” meant patients waited in emergency departments for hours, or even days, receiving care in unsafe and undignified spaces.

The greatest burden fell on older people, those in deprived areas, and patients with mental health conditions — widening existing health inequalities, said Rachel Power, chief executive of the Patients Association.

Financial inefficiencies linked to overcrowding, delayed discharges, and litigation now cost the NHS billions each year.

“Corridor care is a visible symptom of the pressures facing the entire system,” said the RCEM. This created a “bottleneck in hospitals,” with those requiring admission being cared for wherever space could be found. 

The RCEM estimated that 16,644 excess deaths occurred in 2024 as a result of long stays before admission, equivalent to 320 lives lost each week.

Patients and families described feeling forgotten, exposed, and vulnerable, while staff reported moral injury and burnout from working in ways that contradicted their professional values. 

Corridor care, the report said, had become a perennial issue — almost expected — eroding public confidence in emergency departments.

Public polling conducted on behalf of the APPG by Ipsos found that 58% of respondents in Great Britain were not confident that their A&E department would provide a timely service. More than a quarter (28%) doubted they would be treated in an appropriate clinical area.

A separate Age UK survey revealed that a third of people said they would be less likely to go to hospital because of the crisis. Over half (53%) said they would feel more anxious if treated there.

“Corridor care and long A&E waits are like a rot eating away the heart of the NHS,” said Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK. “It's a crisis hiding in plain sight which the government must face up to and take immediate action to resolve.” 

“Patients are being let down,” said Dr Rosena Allin-Khan MP, an emergency medicine doctor and chair of the APPG.

A single-arm phase 2 trial showed that patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) demonstrated meaningful clinical activity in pretreated patients with metastatic breast cancer and active brain metastases, achieving intracranial responses across all breast cancer subtypes.

The authors mentioned that ""the findings indicate antitumour activity of HER3-targeted therapy in heavily pretreated patients with active brain metastases of HER2-negative breast cancer"" and added ""HER3-DXd showed activity after previous ADCs [antibody-drug conjugates] and irrespective of the breast cancer subtype.""

This study was led by Rupert Bartsch, MD, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine 1, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. It was published online in November 2025 in The Lancet Oncology.

This study was limited by its single-arm phase 2 design, its small sample size, and the inclusion of participants with heterogeneous breast cancer subtypes and varied pretreatment histories. Additionally, although both local investigators and central radiology reviews were planned, this analysis included only investigator assessments, which could have introduced variability and bias in the evaluation of radiologic findings.

This study was funded by Daiichi-Sankyo and Merck Sharp & Dohme. Several authors reported serving in consulting or advisory roles and receiving research funding, honoraria, and travel support from Daiichi-Sankyo, Merck, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and various other sources.

For patients who suffer from persistent symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) despite therapy, the first step is symptom evaluation, said Kristle L. Lynch, MD, in a presentation at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2025 Annual Scientific Meeting.

Patients with persistent GERD who have cough and asthma, as well as those with hoarseness, globus, or other ear, nose, and throat concerns, may first undergo workup by other clinicians, said Lynch, who is a professor of clinical medicine and director of the Physiology and Motility Laboratory at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

With these patients, “given the low pretest probability of an acid reflux source, it makes sense to bypass a trial of acid-suppressing medication if symptoms persist and instead move on to consideration of upper endoscopy,” she said.

“If negative for damage or sequelae of reflux, this test is often followed by advanced reflux testing and high-resolution manometry, to help diagnose the cause of reflux and swallowing problems,” she noted.

For patients with heartburn, regurgitation, or noncardiac chest pain (and no other concerning symptoms), moving to an empiric trial of antisecretory therapy before endoscopy can be reasonable, Lynch said. But if symptoms persist, an endoscopy should be done before any advanced pH testing.

Advanced pH Testing Options

Advanced reflux testing options for persistent GERD after an endoscopy include catheter-based pH-impedance testing and wireless pH testing, said Lynch.

“Wireless pH monitoring offers improved patient comfort by eliminating the need for a nasal catheter, allowing individuals to maintain normal daily activities and diet during testing,” Lynch told Medscape Medical News.

“It also enables extended monitoring periods of up to 96 hours, enhancing the detection of intermittent acid reflux episodes,” she said. “However, unlike pH-impedance catheter-based testing, wireless pH measures only acid exposure and cannot identify nonacid reflux events.”

In addition, the wireless capsule may detach prematurely or cause mild chest discomfort, and its endoscopic placement adds procedural complexity with the need for anesthesia, as well as additional cost, she noted.

Catheter-based pH-impedance testing involves sedation-free catheter placement while the patient is awake, followed by monitoring for 24 hours, and involves assessment of bolus movement in tandem with pH measurements, Lynch said. The catheter monitors levels of acid refluxing into the esophagus and transmits this information to the smartphone-sized computer worn by the patient over the 24-hour period.

Unlike wireless testing, impedance testing allows for adjunctive measures of mean nocturnal baseline impedance (MNBI) and post-reflux swallow-induced peristaltic waves (PSPW), the latter of which is shown to predict response to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in patients with reflux.

Logistics include a concurrent manometry for the lower esophageal sphincter to optimize location, followed by a transnasal placement. Challenges associated with the catheter-based test include potential catheter migration and patient discomfort, she added.

Assessing pH Testing Results

After pH testing of either type, abnormal acid exposure time (AET) when the pH in the lower esophagus is greater than 6% supports a diagnosis of GERD; AET between 4% and 6% is considered borderline GERD; and AET less than 4% is considered normal and outside the bounds of pathologic reflux, as per the Lyon Consensus, Lynch explained.

Treatment for patients meeting the GERD criteria based on AET includes not only diet and lifestyle changes but also potential pharmacologics, including acid suppressants, alginates, gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists, and prokinetics. In some cases, anti-reflux surgery may be considered, such as magnetic sphincter augmentation, transoral incisionless fundoplication, or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, Lynch said.

But not all heartburn in patients with persistent GERD is acid-related, she said. Functional heartburn and reflux hypersensitivity can be seen in these cases.

Patients not meeting the criteria for GERD on advanced pH testing and diagnosed with reflux hypersensitivity or functional heartburn may be treated with neuromodulators or nonpharmacologic therapies such as hypnosis, diaphragmatic breathing, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or acupuncture, said Lynch in her presentation.

Overall, “advanced pH testing should be assessed within the framework of other investigations and the patient as a whole,” she emphasized.

Challenges in the Clinic

One of the biggest mistakes while diagnosing a patient with persistent GERD symptoms despite PPI therapy is always assuming their symptoms are driven by ongoing pathologic acid exposure, said Michael Kingsley, MD, a gastroenterologist specializing in gastrointestinal motility disorders and a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, in an interview.

He agreed with Lynch that patients with reflux hypersensitivity or functional heartburn are more likely to benefit from interventions other than a PPI, such as a neuromodulator.

But managing GERD in the clinic also requires making time to assess whether patients are taking PPI correctly and to counsel them on lifestyle modifications, he noted.

One of the current biggest challenges in GERD is how best to manage a patient who falls into the inconclusive range of not definitely normal or abnormal on pH testing, Kingsley told Medscape Medical News. 

“As alluded to in this talk, MNBI and PSPW are emerging metrics, both of which require a pH-impedance study (as opposed to a wireless pH study),” he said. “Further elucidating the ideal application and cutoffs of these metrics may provide additional tools for best treating patients who fall into the “inconclusive” range with standard metrics.”

Lynch and Kingsley disclosed no financial conflicts of interest.

Asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits jumped significantly on days when thunderstorms occurred, based on data from more than 4000 visits. The findings were presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI) 2025 Annual Meeting.

“Thunderstorm asthma is an environmental phenomenon marked by surges in asthma exacerbations during or shortly after storms,” Diala Merheb, MD, internal medicine resident at the University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, and colleagues, said in their abstract. However, documentation of this effect in areas of the US with high allergy burdens are limited, they noted. 

The researchers reviewed data from 4439 asthma-related ED visits between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2024, from three hospitals in Wichita, Kansas. Each visit was classified as occurring on a storm day or nonstorm day. A total of 38 thunderstorm days were identified using meteorologic records from the National Centers for Environmental Information. 

Overall, 14% of the asthma-related ED visits occurred on one of the 38 storm days, with a mean of 17.91 asthma-related ED admissions on storm days compared to a mean of 3.09 on nonstorm days.

“Storm days accounted for only 2% of calendar days but over 14% of asthma visits,” the researchers wrote. In a regression analysis, older age was a significant predictor of storm day ED asthma visits, but sex, zip code, and disposition were not significant predictors, they noted.

The findings were limited by several factors, including the focus on a single region. However, the results support storm-specific preparedness that includes education and modification of asthma action plans to support patients and ease healthcare burdens, the researchers concluded. 

The study received no outside funding. The researchers disclosed having no financial conflicts of interest.

Obesity and cancer are two major health challenges of our time, yet the link between them remains only partially understood. New research now highlights a molecular chain of events in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, revealing how leptin, a hormone produced by fat cells, signals cancer cells to grow. This leads to increased activity of the enzyme stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), which fuels the growth and motility of cancer cells. The findings from a study in The American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, provides insights into the obesity–breast cancer link and identifies potential new therapeutic targets to counter obesity-driven breast cancer progression.

According to the World Obesity Federation's 2025 Atlas, the global number of adults living with obesity is projected to reach 1.13 billion by 2030. Given the well-established epidemiological link between obesity and breast cancer, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying this association has become a major research priority.

By integrating transcriptomic, lipidomic, and functional analyses, we uncovered a crucial role of the leptin-SCD axis in breast cancer biology. Our data indicate that the combined upregulation of leptin and SCD identifies a subgroup of breast cancers with poorer recurrence-free survival. This metabolic signature could serve as a prognostic marker, helping to stratify patients according to obesity-related metabolic risk.""

Ines Barone, PhD, lead investigator of the study of the University of Calabria, Italy

The researchers found that blocking SCD activity abolished leptin-induced oncogenic traits, such as enhanced cell growth, motility, mitochondrial respiration, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecule production. Together, these findings provide a mechanistic explanation for how obesity can fuel hormone-responsive breast cancer progression.

Dr. Barone concludes, ""We were fascinated to see that selectively blocking SCD could almost completely counteract the pro-tumorigenic effects driven by leptin, revealing a striking vulnerability in this pathway. Our findings hold promise for patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, the most common subtype of breast cancer, as targeting SCD could limit disease progression in obese breast cancer patients.""

The brain is never completely at rest. Even without external input, it produces spontaneous neural activity that creates synchronized fluctuations across different regions - a process known as functional connectivity (FC).

Initially described using resting-state fMRI (Biswal et al., 1995), FC portrays the brain's intrinsic functional organization, which underlies cognition and behavior and is altered in various neurological and psychiatric conditions. Its evolutionary conservation (Gutierrez-Barragan et al., 2024, Nat Comm), how it aligns with anatomical connectivity (Suarez et al., 2020, TiCS), and how it overlaps with canonical networks (such as sensory, motor, and default mode systems; Smith et al., 2009, PNAS) highlight its key role in neural organization.

FC alterations are involved in conditions from Alzheimer's (Al-Ezzi et al., 2024, Comm Biol) to schizophrenia (Sheffield and Barch, 2016, Neurosci Biobehav Rev) and autism (Cai et al, 2025, J Biophotonic). They are thus a biomarker and a window into disease mechanisms at the same time.

Even though resting-state fMRI is the gold standard for human use, functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) has emerged as a helpful aid in preclinical research (Osmanski et al., 2014, Nat Comm). Its mix of high sensitivity and fine spatiotemporal resolution enables fUSI to overcome the typical constraints inherent to fMRI in small-animal models, opening new possibilities for the study of FC in both health and disease.

fUSI builds upon the principle of neurovascular coupling. Activation of neurons causes local blood vessels to dilate, increasing cerebral blood volume (CBV). Ultrafast Doppler sequences identify these CBV fluctuations with a high degree of sensitivity. The approach differs from traditional Doppler, which works by sequentially scanning tissue. Instead, fUSI captures entire planes at a rate of thousands of frames per second (Mace et al., 2011, Nat Methods).

This technique delivers:

Such properties make fUSI an ideal fit for studying spontaneous activity and inter-regional correlations that characterize FC in preclinical use cases.

Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) has revolutionized knowledge of large-scale brain networks, delivering special insights into their organization, plasticity, and dysfunction alike. Research in mice has demonstrated strong similarities with human neuroimaging, such as the existence of a default mode network (DMN) whose patterns of connectivity change according to brain state (Ferrier et al., 2020, PNAS).

Such an evolutionary conservation validates fUSI as a translational tool and highlights its ability to record dynamic network conditions, from resting states to sensory processing.

Aside from mapping resting-state activity, fUSI has provided insight into the neural mechanisms that underpin behavior. For instance, in learning and memory tasks, it has been able to trace the reorganization of connectivity among the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex - changes that reflect behavior like fear responses (Grohs-Metz et al., 2022, Behav Brain Res). By helping to visualize how networks become stronger or weaker over time, fUSI delivers insight into how memory consolidation and adaptive plasticity work.

The technology's sensitivity also applies to disease models, where it has revealed disrupted connectivity in neurological conditions. Among models of peripheral neuropathy (Anzibar Fialho et al., 2024, Sci Rep) and schizophrenia (Zhou et al., 2024, biorXiv), fUSI has been able to link circuit-level dysfunction to behavioral symptoms, and thus bridge the gap between molecular pathology and systemic brain activity. These findings position fUSI as a powerful instrument for understanding the mechanisms underlying disease and coming to know biomarkers for neural dysfunction.

In pharmacology, fUSI has shown potential for accelerating drug development by uncovering how substances such as opioids influence brain-wide connectivity. These “network fingerprints” are linked to therapeutic effects (e.g., analgesia) while setting them apart from side effects, providing a nuanced technique for assessing both drug action and safety (Mariani et al., 2024, biorXiv).

These use cases underscore fUSI's ability to propel fundamental neuroscience and clinical research spanning evolutionary comparisons and behavioral neuroscience to therapeutic innovation.

High-quality FC research requires more than sensitivity alone; it demands integrated tools for acquisition, analysis, and reproducibility alike. Iconeus offers a comprehensive workflow that has been customized for preclinical FC studies:

Iconeus is a Paris-based company, founded by the inventors of functional ultrasound, who have invented an easy-to-use functional ultrasound system for imaging cerebral blood flow and microvasculature. Its unique combination of sensitivity, speed and high resolution has enabled it to lead the field in preclinical studies on awake animals, and it is now being proposed for applications in clinical research too.

Iconeus is introducing functional ultrasound neuro imaging: a breakthrough imaging modality for brain activity monitoring based on blood flow imaging with ultra-high sensitivity.

For preclinical research, the portability and high versatility of their technology enables the study of brain activity at unprecedented scales and in a large variety of subject states: awake, behaving, freely-moving, resting-state and asleep conditions.

Iconeus' technology can be easily combined with other complementary modalities such as EEG headstage or optogenetics which are inherently difficult to combine with FMRI. Iconeus also offers key applications such as functional connectivity assessment between brain structures (connectomics) or stroke 4D monitoring. Building on years of preclinical expertise and research, they're now investing and supporting exciting new clinical applications.

			Don't miss:		

I saw a commercial the other day that really upset me. I just can't let it go. It wasn't anything political, controversial or distasteful.

Here's what it was: Lionel Messi — global icon, soccer's GOAT, the world's most famous athlete — walking from the parking lot into a Lowe's. That's right, the hardware store. It sounds like one of those wacky AI hallucinations, but this is an actual, honest-to-God, real-life sponsorship.

I find this pairing to be highly inconceivable. Insulting, really.

Because let's be honest: Lionel Messi does not shop at Lowe's. Never has, never will. And yet, that's what this ludicrous sponsorship is asking us to believe. I refuse.

Some celebrity athlete sponsorships make sense. Lebron and Gatorade, Shaq and Icy Hot, Charles Barkley and Subway. Others are a bit of a stretch, like Stephen Curry and CarMax, or Caitlin Clark and StateFarm. But I'll give those the benefit of the doubt — everyone needs to rent a car from time to time, and everyone needs insurance.

But this whole business with Messi and Lowe's, well, it's like a sponsorship between Prince William and Waffle House, or Jeff Bezos and Burlington Coat Factory. It beggars belief.

Pop quiz: It's Saturday morning. Where's Messi?

Packing Chase Stadium as he dons the flamingo pink of Inter Miami? Or how about training with the reigning world champion Argentine national team for the 2026 World Cup?

Nope. He's re-caulking the bathtub, and after that he's firing up the weed whacker and edging the lawn. C'mon.

Here's the deal, Lowe's. The next time I run into Lionel Messi renting a power-washer in Aisle 4, I'll eat crow. But until then, I refuse to buy into your chicanery for even one second. I refuse to waste any more time thinking or writing about this.

There's something admirable about your audacity, but I'm not buying it — I'm going to Home Depot.

Mauricio Pochettino says he would happily give President Trump the World Cup trophy if the U.S. wins the 2026 tournament.

U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that he would gladly let President Donald Trump lift the World Cup trophy if the U.S. achieves the historic feat of winning the tournament on home soil.

Should Pochettino and his squad triumph at the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the U.S. would become the first non-European or South American team to lift the trophy.

The tournament will take place partly on American soil, with the final scheduled at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, the same venue where Chelsea celebrated their 2025 FIFA Club World Cup victory.

Trump's previous appearance at the Club World Cup final drew attention when he remained on the stage during celebrations, frustrating players like Cole Palmer.

Speaking to the New York Post, Pochettino laughed off the hypothetical ceremony, calling it “typically American.”

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens debate who are the 2026 World Cup favourites. (1:58)

Federal infrastructure projects in Mexico for the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be completed in time for the start of the tournament in June, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Monday.

The projects include the renovation of the two terminals at Mexico City International Airport, and construction of a train line connecting the city with Felipe Ángeles International Airport in Santa Lucía, about 30 miles from Mexico City.

The World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which will stage 13 matches, five of them in the capital. Guadalajara and Monterrey share the other eight games.

According to the president, the federal government is investing $489 million into the renovation of the Mexico City airport.

""This is not only a time to see the best soccer but also a time to share with the world who we are, what Mexico is -- not only a country of immense cultural richness but also a country experiencing a historic moment,"" Sheinbaum said at a news conference.

Sheinbaum became Mexico's first female president last year.

She added that other federal projects will also be carried out in Monterrey, in northern Mexico, and in the western city of Guadalajara. She said those details will be released in the coming weeks.

Azteca Stadium, set to be the first venue to host three World Cup opening matches, has been closed for renovations but the investment is being made by a private company. Sheinbaum did not provide details about that project.

She said Mexico expects an additional 5.5 million visitors across the three host cities.

""It will be a very special time with a significant economic impact, but we will be ready in a few months,"" Sheinbaum said.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Brazilian superstar Neymar has been heavily criticised for his latest performance for Santos in a 3-2 defeat to Flamengo. Spanish newspaper Diario AS labelled the former Barcelona and PSG star ""slow"" and ""a disgrace"" and warned he faces a real battle to make Carlo Ancelotti's final Brazil squad for next year's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.

Neymar was back in the starting XI for struggling Santos on Sunday but failed to impress as the 33-year-old and his side tumbled to a 3-2 defeat at the Maracana. The match was Neymar's first start for two months and he came in for some rough treatment from AS after the game. ""Upon his return to the starting lineup, the Brazilian appeared slow and lacking rhythm, even hindering the plays of some teammates. He even protested against being substituted. If he doesn't regain his form soon, it will be difficult for him to wear the Brazilian national team jersey again in the next World Cup,"" read the report from the Spanish newspaper.

""The former PSG player was sidelined for almost two months with Santos due to a muscle injury that kept him out of seven matches. He briefly returned in the draw against Fortaleza before missing another game. This long absence was reflected in his performance against Flamengo. Even so, he showed glimpses of his quality with a dangerous free-kick and a header that almost resulted in the equalizing goal.""

Neymar was substituted towards the end of the game and appeared furious at being taken off. The Brazilian refused to watch the end of the match as Santos suffered another damaging defeat. Neymar's side remain in the drop zone after 32 games played and are now two points from safety. According to ESPN, Neymar plans to leave the club at the end of the season if Santos are relegated and has been linked with a move to Inter Miami, to reunite with former team-mate Lionel Messi. Santos president Marcelo Teixeira has said previously he does want Neymar to stay but has also warned that there are financial limits when it comes to negotiating a new contract with the club.

Neymar had some harsh words for the officiating after Santos' latest defeat. He told Globo: ""The referee is very bad. Besides being bad, with all due respect, he's arrogant. That's the word. Every time they go to the locker room they say that the captain is the one who can speak. When we go to speak, he turns his back and runs away. When I talk to him, he threatens me. It's complicated. I got a yellow card because he threatened me. He said: 'If you come near me, I'll give you a yellow card.' I said: 'Can't I talk to you?'""

Neymar returned to Santos after an injury-plagued spell in Saudi Arabia and had been hoping to regain form and fitness with his former club with a view to securing a place in Brazil's 2026 World Cup squad. However, he has again been left out of Ancelotti's most recent list, with the Brazil boss admitting he is ""close"" to deciding his final squad for the tournament. Ancelotti has also made clear Neymar may have to change position to regain his best form. The 66-year-old told reporters: ""I think he needs to play more centrally, not as a winger, because wingers in today's football are players you need to help defensively as well. When you play a little more centrally, the defensive work is much less than when you play as a winger. And I also think that a very talented player, closer to the goal, has more opportunities to score goals. [False 9] could be his ideal position.""



Neymar and Santos will continue their relegation battle at the weekend but face another difficult fixture next as they take on current league leaders Palmeiras. Meanwhile, Brazil will continue without Neymar over the international break when they take on Senegal and Tunisia in international friendlies.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal'}","soccer"

Roy Keane believes Liverpool can no longer be considered Premier League title contenders, saying their 3-0 thumping at Manchester City proves they are in a ""crisis"". Goals from Erling Haaland, Nico Gonzalez, and Jeremy Doku saw Pep Guardiola's City confirm themselves as the likeliest challengers to league leaders Arsenal, in what was a damaging defeat for the reigning champions.

All eyes were on the Etihad Stadium on Sunday as City and Liverpool aimed to not only dent each other's title hopes, but equally close the gap on an Arsenal side who were held to a 2-2 draw with Sunderland the previous day.

And on the 1,000th game of Guardiola's illustrious managerial career, it was City who outlined their title credentials, roaring past a Liverpool side for whom it looked like it was one game too many in their mini-revival following victories over Aston Villa and Real Madrid.

Haaland, Gonzalez and man-of-the-match Doku did the damage for City, who are now second in the table and just four points behind Mikel Arteta's Arsenal. Meanwhile, Liverpool remain eight points adrift of the Gunners, having lost a fourth consecutive away game in the league for the first time since 2012.

And such was the sluggish nature of Liverpool's loss at City that Manchester United legend Keane feels Arne Slot's men are now unlikely to defend the title which they claimed last season.

In the immediate aftermath of the match, Keane told Sky Sports: ""You can't be considering Liverpool for the title. That was a sore defeat. But this reminded me of [the] City of old. They were outstanding. They are back in the mix.""

He then said it is ""crisis time for Liverpool,"" adding: ""It's okay to lose to a club like Man City - it's a tough place to come. But to lose seven in ten - five league losses already - It has to be a crisis for a club like Liverpool.

""I thought Liverpool looked like a really weak team today. The manager said he was pleased with the second half, but the game was over! It's easy to play well when you're not playing for anything. 

""I thought [Slot's] assessment of the game was spot on. City looked stronger, technically better and more physical than Liverpool today. [Liverpool] still had moments, they've always got quality, but the goals they're giving away - their decision making  - was not good enough. There was a lack of intensity, a lack of energy. The subs, when they came on, looked really soft. I think it is a crisis for Liverpool.""

While Liverpool were second best for the majority of the match, they will feel aggrieved they did not register at least one goal in the game. 

The Merseysiders thought they had delivered a sucker punch in the first half when captain Virgil van Dijk headed home from Mohamed Salah's corner, but the goal was ruled out after Andy Robertson was adjudged to have been interfering with play from an offside position.

However, Netherlands international Van Dijk refused to get embroiled in a debate over the decision, saying ""it doesn't matter what he thinks about the incident.""

When asked about his disallowed goal after the final whistle, Van Dijk told Sky Sports: ""In football the officials are deciding the key decisions and we have to deal with it on the pitch. There is no point discussing this from my point of view. The reality is that we lost 3-0 and that is a big blow.

""It doesn't matter what I say [about the goal] because anything I say will be in the media and the whole international break will be about my comment on the decision. I just focus on the fact we lost. You guys can debate if it should have stood.

""It's about finding consistency and carrying on. Now we go to our countries, stay fit and be ready for a big run after. We are not going to give up whatsoever. We are in November and we are ready for a long season and a big fight.""

Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten delivered a powerful statement on Monday at the Nitto ATP Finals, where they kick-started their title bid with a commanding victory.

The second seeds shook off Christian Harrison and Evan King 6-4, 6-4 upon return to Inalpi Arena for the second straight year. Having fallen to the Americans in the Roland Garros quarter-finals earlier this year, Heliovaara and Patten responded with a 64-minute clinic in Turin, where they dropped just five of 45 service points, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

“We didn't do much wrong in our service games, we faced one break point in the whole match and came up with a great serve there,” said Heliovaara. “It was so fun to be on court… We were ourselves and enjoyed the moment. I'm just super happy to be here and playing well.”

Heliovaara and Patten, who are riding a five-match winning streak after triumphing in Paris, still have an outside chance of claiming ATP Year-End No. 1 Doubles Team presented by PIF honours. They are trying to make ground on British stars Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool, who fell to Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori in their respective opening match.

“I never thought I would have one win on the Tour, so to have 100 is something incredibly special,” said Patten, who recorded his 100th tour-level win.

After levelling their Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Harrison/King and improving to 1-0 in the John McEnroe Group, Heliovaara and Patten can look ahead to meetings with Joe Salisbury/Neal Skupski and Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic.

Sebastian Korda suffered a heartbreaking loss to end his season in the Athens semi-finals, but he is still very much a winner entering the offseason.

The American on Monday announced his engagement to longtime partner Ivana Nedved. 

""Forever and then some 🤍,"" Korda wrote in a post on Instagram.

A post shared by Sebi (@sebastiankorda)

Nedved has been a consistent presence for most of the 25-year-old's career, dating back to before Korda appeared in the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in 2021. 

The 25-year-old Korda won three matches in Athens to end his season on a high note and earned match point against Nitto ATP Finals competitor Lorenzo Musetti before falling short. He is the No. 48 player in the PIF ATP Rankings.

2025 Paulo Grand Prix: Every Max Verstappen overtake

2025 Sao Paulo Grand Prix: Tsunoda picks up penalty for tipping Stroll into a spin

Ferrari suffered a double retirement in Sao Paulo as both Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc sustained damage.

Lewis Hamilton was left devastated as unmanageable damage to his Ferrari saw him retire midway through the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, adding that he felt ""terrible"" for the team.

The Briton had failed to make it into the top 10 in Saturday's tricky Qualifying session, leaving him to start the race from P13 on the grid while his team mate Charles Leclerc found himself up in third place.

On his mission to recover positions, Hamilton got a strong getaway at lights out, but had to back out of an overtake on Fernando Alonso heading into Turn 1. The first lap chaos then led to Carlos Sainz making contact with the Ferrari's rear wheel and Hamilton subsequently reported that the “rear's not stable”.

After then tapping the rear of Franco Colapinto's Alpine, causing him to loose his front wing in the process, Ferrari confirmed over the radio that there was damage to the floor, which the seven-time World Champion attempted to manage for 38 laps before he was instructed to box and retire the car.

“After the hit, it felt like the rear suspension was broken, but they said that it seemed to be alright,” Hamilton explained afterwards. “But [there was] something, could be cross weight or something like that, and then there was the loss of downforce.

“I think we were losing 30 or 40 points of downforce so when you were going through the high speed, the thing was snapping. I was giving everything to try and keep up with the guys ahead of me.”

His difficulties were clearly visible as his car slid all over the track, and he previously warned his race engineer that he constantly felt as though he was on the verge of causing an accident.

With Leclerc also retiring due to damage caused by Oscar Piastri and Kimi Antonelli's coming together, Ferrari have now dropped 36 points behind Mercedes and four points behind Red Bull in the constructors' standings with just three rounds remaining.

Hamilton added: “This is definitely a weekend to forget. It's a shame because I love Brazil, and everyone in the team. Every single person in this team turns up every week and gives it their absolute best.

“To come away with nothing, to not finish a race for the second time in the year – it's really devastating. I feel terrible for the team. I'm sorry for my part in Qualifying, putting myself in that position. We'll get back up tomorrow and just give it another go.”

The series, from showrunner Felicia Pride and director-EP Debbie Allen, will follow the daughter of Jasmine Guy's and Kadeem Hardison's characters from the original.

	Hillman College will enroll a new class of students with Netflix's pickup of a sequel series to A Different World.


	The streamer has given a series order to the comedy, which has been in the works for more than a year (and included a very rare pilot order from Netflix). The show will star Tony Award winner Maleah Joi Moon  (Hell's Kitchen on Broadway) as Deborah, the youngest daughter of original series leads Whitley (Jasmine Guy) and Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison), who enrolls at the HBCU her parents attended.




	Felicia Pride (Bel-Air, Grey's Anatomy) is the showrunner on A Different World. Several alumni of the 1987-93 NBC series join Pride as executive producers, including Debbie Allen, Reggie Rock Bythewood, Gina Prince-Bythewood and Tom Werner; Mandy Summers also exec produces. Allen, who directed the majority of the original show's episodes, will helm the series premiere and two more episodes in the sequel's first season.

	“It is such an honor to be a part of bringing back this iconic show, one that I grew up on and which had a profound impact on my life,” Pride said in a statement. “I am so proud of the work we're doing to reimagine A Different World for beloved fans and new generations alike.”


A Different World was a spinoff of The Cosby Show that followed Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) to college. Bonet left the show after its first season, and the show retooled around a larger ensemble that featured Guy, Hardison, Dawnn Lewis, Darryl M. Bell, Cree Summer, Charnele Brown, Glynn Turman, Sinbad and Lou Myers. Bill Cosby is credited as the creator of the original series, but he is not involved in the sequel.  

	











	The logline for the sequel reads, “The series follows Deborah as she enters her freshman year at her parents' HBCU alma mater and finds their shadow difficult to escape. She sets out to build her own legacy — while having the time of her life — alongside a whole new generation of Hillman's best and brightest.


	Alijah Kai, Chibuikem Uche, Cornell Young IV, Jordan Aaron Hall and Kennedi Reece will star alongside Moon in the new series.


	“A Different World changed everything for us,” said the Bythewoods in a statement. “It was where we got our start as writers and where we found each other. This show has always been a part of our love story. To return to Hillman now and help reimagine this world for a new generation feels like a continuation of that legacy — one rooted in love, purpose, and possibility.”

The teaser beat previous records held by Taylor Swift and Bob Marley films.


													By
												

	Jessica Lynch



	The upcoming Michael Jackson biopic Michael has already made history — and it hasn't even hit cinemas yet.


	The teaser trailer for the Antoine Fuqua-directed film racked up more than 116.2 million views within its first 24 hours, making it the most-viewed music biopic trailer of all time and the largest trailer launch in Lionsgate history, according to analytics firm WaveMetrix. It now sits ahead of previous record holders including Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour (96.1 million) and Bob Marley: One Love (60.1 million).


	Set to premiere in theaters on April 24, 2026, Michael stars Jaafar Jackson — the late King of Pop's nephew — in the lead role. The film promises to explore Michael Jackson's complex legacy through both iconic performances and personal moments.

	“I'm humbled and honored to bring my Uncle Michael's story to life,” Jaafar Jackson wrote on Instagram. “To all the fans all over the world, I'll see you soon.”


	Producer Graham King, who spearheaded 2018's Bohemian Rhapsody, said Jaafar was the clear choice for the role after an extensive casting process. “I met Jaafar over two years ago and was blown away by the way he organically personifies the spirit and personality of Michael,” King told Variety in 2023. 


	“It was something so powerful that even after conducting a worldwide search, it was clear that he is the only person to take on this role. I am beyond thrilled that he has come on board to portray his uncle and cannot wait for the world to see him on the big screen as Michael Jackson.”


	The singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, also told the publication, “Jaafar embodies my son. It's so wonderful to see him carry on the Jackson legacy of entertainers and performers.” 

	











	The cast also includes Colman Domingo, Nia Long, Laura Harrier, Miles Teller, and child actor Juliano Krue Valdi as young Michael.

At the annual Music Tourism Convention, global delegates discussed new avenues for music tourism. 


													By
												

	Tere Aguilera



	Music tourism, a growing sector, is in the spotlight more than ever after Puerto Rico's tourism and economic boom following Bad Bunny's residency. 


	The ripple effects were among the topics of discussion during the annual Music Tourism Convention, which has been taking place for a decade and, for the first time, was held in the Caribbean, specifically on the island of Anguilla from Nov. 4 to 7.


	Governmental delegates, entrepreneurs and businesses from Canada, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the United States, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Argentina, Barbados, Saint Vincent, St. Maarten, Martinique, Trinidad and Tobago, the Grenadines, the Virgin Islands, Panama, and the Dominican Republic traveled to this British territory known for its pristine beaches, with the aim of sharing and exchanging ideas about the development of events and how to maximize entertainment resources.


	The great success of Bad Bunny in attracting tourists to Puerto Rico and boosting the island's economy sparked interest among neighboring countries and brought to mind Jamaica, which at one point did something similar with the Marley dynasty.


	Although local summer carnivals and festivals attract tourists to the Caribbean, the rest of the year remains underutilized. 


	“The cultural heritage of the Caribbean is very extensive, but it has not been utilized as it should be,” explained Davon Carty, CEO of Anguilla Music Production and Publishing, speaking about the host island, during one of the panels. “We have great musicians on the island besides our legendary star, Bankie Banks, so we want to showcase them to the world,” he added.


	Another important point discussed by attendees was the need to not only rely on their international stars to promote and publicize their territories but also to make venues and public spaces available to interested artists, equipped with the facilities needed for their performances or content creation.


	“In Miami, it seems like everything is Latin music, but it's not; we have many more musical movements that we want to promote,” explained Connie Kinnard, senior vp of the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. “We want to broaden the musical horizon. For example, electronic music, which is very strong,” she added. Meanwhile, John Copeland, director of arts and cultural tourism in Miami, spoke about various attractions that can be offered to tourists. “Now in Miami, we have tours to places where music videos have been filmed. Not just the homes of celebrities are attractive; there's so much to show people,” he said.


	From Canada, Allegra Swanson of Music Nova Scotia, a territory where the renowned Juno Awards take place, shared advice based on her experience: “Hosting an awards ceremony definitely boosts tourism and the economic development of a place, but it also allows talents to be showcased and important partnerships with sponsors to be formed,” she said. 


	From Saudi Arabia, Hala Alhedeithy, general manager of strategies at the Saudi Music Commission, led another interesting panel in which she spoke about integrating local talent into important activities in cities like Riyadh, where efforts are underway to make it an attractive destination. Lastly, Mexican Pablo Borchi Klapp, director of events and sponsorships at Sound Diplomacy — a company that not only produces the convention but also provides consultancy on the economic and social value of creative industries — shared his experience in organizing tours for tourists with a musical emphasis, which include visits to restaurants and venues showcasing various types of music.


	In 2026, Sound Diplomacy will produce the Music Cities Conventions in Kingston upon Hull in the United Kingdom and in Alberta, Canada.

Travis Scott delivered a major surprise for fans during the Japanese leg of his Circus Maximus tour over the weekend, bringing out Kanye West for an unannounced set at the Belluna Dome in Tokorozawa on Saturday (Nov. 8).

	Scott remained onstage as a hype man and support act throughout Ye's mini-set, which included hits like “Runaway,” “Heartless,” “Flashing Lights,” “Stronger,” and “All of the Lights.” The duo performed together in front of a packed Tokyo crowd as part of Scott's two-night Japan stopover.


	Scott previously hinted at a potential reunion with West during a Circus Maximus show in October, telling fans, “We might have to do something special.” 


	In April, La Flame spoke of his relationship with the controversial rapper in his Complex cover story. “S–t, man. That's my kid's uncle,” he said in the interview, which appears to have taken place in February. “That guy took me in when I was young, when I was like 19. He taught me a lot about music. And not even just ‘taught' me, but he allowed me to experience the creation of music.”

	











	The surprise performance comes just days after West made headlines for a sit-down with Israeli Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, where he addressed past antisemitic comments and expressed a desire to make amends.


	“I feel really blessed to be able to sit here with you today and just take accountability,” Ye told Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto in a video posted on social media. 


	“It's a big deal for me as a man to come and take accountability for all the things that I've said, and I really just appreciate you embracing me with open arms and allowing me to make amends. And this is the beginning and the first steps, and the first brick by brick to build back the strong walls.”


	West's last major live performance was his Vultures listening event earlier in 2025, while Scott continues to tour globally.

	“It is such an honor to be a part of bringing back this iconic show, one that I grew up on and which had a profound impact on my life,” Pride shared. “I am so proud of the work we're doing to reimagine A Different World for beloved fans and new generations alike.”


	Writers from the original series, Reggie Rock Bythewood and Gina Prince-Bythewood, return as executive producers alongside Mandy Summers and Tom Werner.

	











	“A Different World changed everything for us,” said the Bythewoods in a joint statement. “It was where we got our start as writers and where we found each other. This show has always been a part of our love story. To return to Hillman now and help reimagine this world for a new generation feels like a continuation of that legacy – one rooted in love, purpose, and possibility.”


A Different World followed Denise Huxtable (Lisa Bonet) and her new classmates at Hillman College, a fictional historically Black college. Though Bonet exited after one season, the show continued with the leading cast of Jasmine Guy, Kadeem Hardison, Dawnn Lewis, Darryl M. Bell, Sinbad, Charnele Brown, Cree Summer and Glynn Turman.


	The retooled second season continued to follow the students' lives, with the love story between Guy's Whitley Gilbert and Hardison's Dwayne Wayne at the center. Dwayne, famous for his glasses that flipped up, finally put a ring on it in the Season 5 episode “Save the Best For Last.” Though Whitley was adamant she didn't want children, she discovers she's pregnant in “When One Door Closes,” the penultimate episode of the series, and everyone is elated. However, things get somber when Dwayne reveals he's accepted a job in Japan, where he and his wife will raise their family — in a different world.


	The popular The Cosby Show spinoff ran for six seasons on NBC.


	Although no returning cast from the original series have been announced, we previously noted that conversations had been ongoing with key members. 


	A report this morning from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reveals production will begin on February 5 and will run until April 27.

Emma Heming and the daughters she shares with her husband, Bruce Willis, were spotted running errands together over the weekend.

Heming, 47, was photographed out and about in Santa Monica, Calif., on Sunday with Mabel, 13, and Evelyn, 11.

The model-actress was dressed casually in a white T-shirt, baggy blue jeans and red Converse sneakers, completing her look with a periwinkle sweater draped around her shoulders.

Eyeglasses rested on her makeup-free face, and she wore her long, brown hair down.

The girls were also dressed casually, with Mabel opting for a gray graphic T-shirt, blue jeans and sneakers, and Evelyn sporting a black tank top, orange-striped sweater, olive-green cargo pants and Crocs.

The sisters looked to be in high spirits as they smiled and chatted while walking a few steps behind their mom.

The blended Willis family announced in March 2022 that Bruce, 70, had aphasia and would therefore be retiring from his decades-long acting career.

They revealed his frontotemporal dementia diagnosis the following February.

In August, his wife lamented that she had made “the hard decision” to move him into a separate home, explaining that the movie star's neurodegenerative disease requires round-the-clock care in a quiet, comfortable and safe environment.

In response to the “loud” critics who were “quick” to “judge” the call she had made as his “caregiver,” she fired back, “If they don't have the experience of this, they don't get a say — and they definitely don't get a vote.”

Heming — who recently published “The Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope and Yourself on the Caregiving Path” — shared last month that the new living arrangement had been beneficial to their whole family, as it had given the couple's daughters the opportunity to be their high-spirited kid selves.

The author made sure to note that separate homes doesn't mean separate lives, as she often spends her days with Willis. Mabel and Evelyn also keep clothes, toys and arts-and-crafts supplies at his house, which is located nearby.

Actress Sally Kirkland has been hospitalized in Southern California, being placed in hospice at a hospital in Palm Springs, TMZ reports. She is 84 years old.

This comes after the Golden Globe winner was diagnosed with dementia last year, her representative Michael Greene told the outlet, adding that her former student and friend Cody Galloway is by her side.

A GoFundMe page was started for Kirkland in November 2024 by her friends to help her on her health journey after she “fractured her four bones in her neck, right wrist, and her left hip,” adding that, “while recovering, she developed two separate life-threatening infections.”

Her friends added that they were asking for support as Kirkland couldn't afford her care due to “bad advice from a financial advisor-business manager in 2007 during the market crash, Sally lost the bulk of her investments and the money she made during the peak of her career.”

On Friday, Nov. 7, her friends provided an update on the GoFundMe about Kirkland's condition. 

“Thank you for all your love and support. Sally is grateful for your kindness and love. Sally is on hospice now and is resting comfortably. Please hold and send the light for Sally,” they wrote. 

This came after they provided an update just over a month ago that she had “er a month after organizers shared that the 84-year-old actress had “a challenging few months.”

“Hi: Sally sends her love to everyone. It has been a challenging few months for Sally as her health continues to struggle,” the update on October 2 said. “She had a fall in the shower, when she was left unattended, injuring her ribs and foot, along with cuts and bruises. Sally is now receiving 24/7 care in a specialized facility that is providing wonderful safety and care. We are continuing to raise money to cover the gaps between income and care costs. Thank you for all the love, support, and care for Sally.”

I'm very sad to hear those news about my beloved costar, real legend,  Sally Kirkland. Sending ton of prayers & love💖🥹🙏 https://t.co/QmdcPgvgm3 pic.twitter.com/BtPXyne78s— Simonna (@Simonna) November 9, 2025

Singer and actress Simonna posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, after hearing the news. 

“I'm very sad to hear those news about my beloved costar, real legend, Sally Kirkland. Sending ton of prayers & love,” she wrote.

The two shared the screen in the 2019 short film “Robot Romance.”

Many fans also left sweet comments. 

‘Prayers for her and her family,” one person commented.

“🙏💞,” another fan said.

In 1988, Kirkland took home a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her role in the 1987 movie, “Anna.” She also won the Best Actress award at the 13th Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards, as well as the Best Female Lead award at the 3rd Independent Spirit Awards, plus a nomination at the Academy Award for Best Actress for this role. 

Kirkland earned a second Golden Globe nomination for her role in “The Haunted” (1991).

Along with “Anna,” Kirkland is well known for her roles in “The Sting,” “Best of the Best,” “JFK,” and “Bruce Almighty.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","SEE: Jim Carrey & His ‘Grinch' Co-Star Reunite Decades Later in Wholesome PHOTOS","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/jim-carrey-taylor-momsen-grinch-reunion/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:50:15 GMT","

Twenty-five years after spreading Christmas cheer in Whoville, Jim Carrey and Taylor Momsen reunited in the most heartwarming way. The pair, who starred together in the 2000 holiday classic “How the Grinch Stole Christmas,” came face-to-face again at the 2025 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony in Los Angeles.

Carrey, 63, and Momsen, 32, shared a sweet red carpet moment outside the Peacock Theater on Saturday, Nov. 8, smiling for photos and delighting fans who still cherish their unforgettable roles as the Grinch and little Cindy Lou Who. 

The nostalgic reunion instantly lit up social media, celebrating a full-circle moment for the beloved Christmas duo.

For the milestone event, Taylor Momsen, now the lead singer of the rock band Pretty Reckless, showed off her signature edge in a black lace dress with a thigh-high slit, layered under a sleek leather coat. 

She completed the look with calf-high boots, smoky eye makeup, and stacked silver jewelry.

Jim Carrey opted for a laid-back yet polished look, wearing a black-and-white striped blazer over a graphic T-shirt and tailored dress pants. 

The duo shared smiles and laughs on the red carpet before heading inside to celebrate the evening's honorees.

“We haven't seen each other since ‘The Grinch.' Twenty-five!” Momsen told reporters on the carpet, according to KNX News.

Both Carrey and Momsen took part in the ceremony celebrating Soundgarden's induction. Carrey, who once hosted “Saturday Night Live” when the band was a musical guest in 1996, gave a heartfelt tribute to induct the rock icons.

Momsen later joined Brandi Carlile, Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, and Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell on stage to perform “Rusty Cage” and “Black Hole Sun.” Her band, Pretty Reckless, had previously opened for Soundgarden on their final tour before Chris Cornell's passing in 2017.

Before their reunion, Taylor Momsen looked back on her “Grinch” experience during a recent episode of the “Call Her Daddy” podcast.

“Jim Carrey is the Grinch,” she recalled. “I didn't know who Jim was until the premiere, and someone had to point him out to me and go, ‘That's Jim,' and I went, ‘Oh, Jim.'”

When asked whether Carrey's transformation into the Grinch ever frightened her, Momsen said it never did. “He was never scary to me,” she shared. 

“To me, he was always Jim, and he was always in makeup.”

As “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” celebrates its 25th anniversary, the beloved holiday classic will return to select theaters on December 12 and is also available to stream on Peacock and Prime Video.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:entertainmentnow.com","The Original Cast of ‘National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation' Reunites: PHOTO","https://entertainmentnow.com/news/national-lampoons-christmas-vacation-cast-reunites/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 18:50:15 GMT","

Some of the key cast involved in “National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation” have reunited, sharing a photograph of them together online. The 1989 release, written by John Hughes and directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik, is widely regarded as a classic Christmas movie and a staple of the holiday season.

Juliette Lewis posted the image on Instagram to her personal account, which features Chevy Chase sitting on a chair, while Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, and Lewis all stand around him posing for the camera. It isn't clear from the post when the photograph was taken.

She accompanied the image with a holiday message, calling the rest of the cast her family. She said, “Merry Christmas from the Griswolds! Love my movie family.” 

“National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation” marked the final time that Hughes worked on a “National Lampoon” project and tells the story of Chase's character Clark Griswold as his attempts to have a normal family Christmas keep going awry. Chase, Quaid, and D'Angelo reprised their roles from previous movies, while Lewis replaced Dana Barron and Dana Hill in the role of the Griswold's daughter Audrey. 

This is not the first time that the cast of “National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation” have reunited. Both Chase and Quaid worked together on the 2024 film “The Christmas Letter.” They were joined by Hallmark star Kristoffer Polaha alongside Brian Doyle-Murray. 

Polaha had previously shared photographs of him attending a convention in New York City, where he grabbed photographs with both CHase and Quaid. 

“Last week was a whirlwind,” he exclaimed. “New York City was amazing and seeing all your shining faces was truly a joy for me. I love meeting you, hearing your stories, hugging your necks, and capturing a moment with you. Even I wanted my picture taken with a few actors whose work has impacted my life. I'll see you next year!”

Earlier this year it was also revealed that a new documentary about Chevy Chase is on the way and should release in 2026. “I'm Chevy Chase and You're Not” is directed by Marina Zenovich and is set to arrive on Sky Documentaries next year. Zenovich has previously won awards for the documentaries “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic” and “Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind.”

Howard T. Owens, co-CEO of Propagate Content, released a statement about the film. He said, “We're thrilled to have Sky join the exceptional team behind this definitive portrait of Chevy Chase.”

Owens continued, “Chevy is a complicated comedy legend, and Marina's unflinching approach captures that in a way only she can. Sky's commitment to bold, truth-driven storytelling makes them the ideal partner to help bring this story to audiences worldwide.”

Charli XCX has shared the first of what will apparently be many original songs for Emerald Fennell's forthcoming Wuthering Heights movie. “House” is a collaboration with composer and Velvet Underground co-founder John Cale. The accompanying video was directed by Mitch Ryan, who also helmed Charli XCX's belated “Party 4 U” clip earlier this year. Watch it below.

“A few years ago I watched Todd Haynes' documentary about The Velvet Underground,” Charli XCX wrote in a note posted to X last week. “As many of you know I'm a huge fan of the band and was really taken by the documentary. One thing that stuck with me was how John Cale described a key sonic requirement of The Velvet Underground. That any song had to be both ‘elegant and brutal.'”

She continued, “When the summer ended I was still ruminating on John's words. So I decided to reach out to him to get his opinion on the songs that his phrase had so deeply inspired, but also to see whether he might want to collaborate on any…I sent him some songs and we started talking specifically about ‘House.' We spoke about the idea of a poem. He recorded something and sent it to me. Something that only John could do. And it was… well, it made me cry.” Scroll down to read the whole thing.

Since releasing her album Brat last year, Charli XCX has become involved in several other film projects. She also pulled double duty as host and musical guest on an episode of Saturday Night Live. John Cale shared his last studio album, Poptical Illusion, in 2024 as well.

Wuthering Heights hits theaters on Saturday, February 14, 2026. Fennell's adaptation of the famed Emily Brontë novel stars Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff. The movie is scored by Anthony Willis, who also scored Fennell's first two features, 2020's Promising Young Woman and 2023's Saltburn.

Revisit Quinn Moreland's review “Todd Haynes' Velvet Underground Documentary Breathes New Life Into a Beloved Band.”

Charli XCX:

I got a call from Emerald Fennell last Christmas asking whether I would consider working on a song for her adaptation of Wuthering Heights. I read the script and immediately felt inspired so Finn Keane and I began working on not just one but many songs that we felt connected to the world she was creating. After being so in the depths of my previous album I was excited to escape into something entirely new, entirely opposite. When I think of Wuthering Heights I think of many things. I think of passion and pain. I think of England. I think of the Moors, I think of the mud and the cold. I think of determination and grit.

A few years ago I watched Todd Haynes' documentary about The Velvet Underground. As many of you know I'm a huge fan of the band and was really taken by the documentary. One thing that stuck with me was how John Cale described a key sonic requirement of The Velvet Underground. That any song had to be both “elegant and brutal”. I got really stuck on that phrase. I wrote it down in my notes app and would pull it up from time to time and think about what he meant.

When working on music for this film, “elegant and brutal” was a phrase I kept coming back to. One day whilst on tour in Austin, Finn and I went to the studio and wrote the bones for a song that would eventually become House. When the summer ended I was still ruminating on John's words. So I decided to reach out to him to get his opinion on the songs that his phrase had so deeply inspired, but also to see whether he might want to collaborate on any.

We got connected, we spoke on the phone and wow… that voice, so elegant, so brutal. I sent him some songs and we started talking specifically about House. We spoke about the idea of a poem. He recorded something and sent it to me. Something that only John could do. And it was… well, it made me cry.

I feel so lucky to have been able to work with John on this song. I've been so excited to share it with you all, sitting quietly in anticipation. And on Monday, it's yours. Love you all, let's fall in love again and again <3

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ufo","Between heaven and the unknown: how alien experiencers turn trauma into healing","https://cybernews.com/tech/ufo-uap-aliens-trauma-healing/","Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:49:49 GMT","

© 2025 Cybernews – Latest Cybersecurity and Tech News, Research & Analysis.

Science and the cosmic needn't be binary forces. When talking with Kelly Robertson, spiritual healer and lifelong experiencer, it becomes clear that they intertwine.

“In the simplest of terms, when there's a will, there's a way,” Kelly says when it comes to the topic of harnessing her abduction experience into helping others heal from theirs. 

When Cybernews sat down and video-called Kelly, who runs several online UAP groups and claims to have had a stable upbringing, she told me that “we are much more powerful than we think we are.”

It all started in a park in Arkansas when she was seven years old, when she saw a blonde girl named Alanis, whom Kelly describes as “absolute perfection.” Curiously, Alanis had her leg in plaster – but there were no signatures on the cast, which is unusual in that neck of the woods.

Kelly met Alanis's stare as she said, in a melodic voice, that she was from “a long way from here.” Standing just behind her was a man with albinism, which is when fight-or-flight kicked in.

Kelly was told not to worry, and as she ran home, Alanis called out, “Oh, but you'll see me again.” But that's not where the story ends. Later, Kelly remembered being taken aboard a ship, with a being that was blue and had a giraffe-shaped head.

On the walls of the craft were bodies, including a blonde girl with dark Mediterranean skin, which Kelly believed was her body in stasis. Kelly maintains the alien race had, by whichever means, tapped into her mind, and that she'd voluntarily come here to Earth to give it a look.

“When someone describes an abduction that feels completely real,” says Laura Merritt, a trauma therapist at Golden Path Therapy, “the body is responding to threat at a primitive level. The nervous system activates fight, flight, or freeze. In that frozen state, time slows down, the body feels paralyzed, and the person may feel they've left their body altogether.”

This directly correlates to Kelly's memories of paralysis, which she calls “interface,” and a therapist would call “the freeze response.”

Notably, Kelly helps in the community, especially if people feel ostracized and alone during an abduction. She says there's a lack of data to suggest how many humans have been abducted, but that it largely runs in families, claiming her grandpa saw a UFO “dumping out water and frogs” when he was younger.

And speaking of blood, as there is a unique and cosmic trope associated with the O-negative blood type, Kelly is a little cynical, stating that it might be a result of genetic engineering, given that, since the 1950s, more subgroups have appeared.

In terms of other cultures, Kelly cites India as an example of a place where it isn't deemed weird to believe in other layers of reality. In Hinduism, for example, there are fourteen “lokas,” or planes of existence. Texts like the Mahabharata and Ramayana describe flying machines and luminous beings.

Aliens, according to Kelly, are more likely to gauge the collective consciousness of a country like the US, especially when opinions are still quite polarized.

Religion isn't apart from science in this context:


I fully believe in the multiworld theory. There are nine dimensions in our realm – we can only perceive up to the fifth, the God one.


Kelly describes the other ones as frequencies, not places. She mentioned that during one of her abductions, there was evidence of a multitude of timelines presented to her on a screen that funnelled to two eventual outcomes – the high road and the low road. 

If collective consciousness allows us to take the high road, she says, we can avert disaster and circumvent being part of another layer of species that could be wiped out on Earth.

“We're a much more advanced version of AI,” Kelly adds. 

“A collective consciousness with the World Wide Web on steroids. It's quantum entanglement – Tesla proved that. I'm just the conduit.” Though the inventor didn't himself prove quantum entanglement, he often gets mentioned alongside Einstein when it comes to conversations about energy and radio waves.

Merritt interprets this kind of connection a little differently, however. 

“After a trauma, the brain looks for meaning,” she says. “For some, that meaning arrives as images of technology, light, or energy – metaphors that help the mind contain something too big to name.”

It appears that sometimes the sheer vicissitude of abduction can be troubling to talk about, even as Kelly experienced later with her future husband at 17. They were out driving a car, on an errand to pay a bill, when they saw a glaring light coming towards them, which eventually flooded the car.

Their radio stopped. They were both taken aboard a ship. Kelly saw a big machine with a multitude of instruments coming off it – advanced apparatus. Startled, she claimed her dad was gonna kick their asses. As a consequence, the alien beings backed away.

All these years later, Kelly now believes there was a sense of telekinesis going on, especially when she surrendered her will to fight. The leader subsequently inserted some instruments into her eye and nose, which explains her current bump on the bridge of her nose.

They got in the car and drove home. They never spoke of it again.

She says there's a lack of data to suggest how many humans have been abducted, but that it largely runs in families, claiming her grandpa saw a UFO “dumping out water and frogs” when he was younger.

And speaking of blood, as there is a unique and cosmic trope associated with the O-negative blood type, Kelly is a little cynical, stating that it might be a result of genetic engineering, given that, since the 1950s, more subgroups have appeared.

In terms of other cultures, Kelly cites India as an example of a place where it isn't deemed weird to believe in other layers of reality. In Hinduism, for example, there are fourteen “lokas,” or planes of existence. Texts like the Mahabharata and Ramayana describe flying machines and luminous beings.

Aliens, according to Kelly, are more likely to gauge the collective consciousness of a country like the US, especially when opinions are still quite polarized.

Religion isn't apart from science in this context:


I fully believe in the multiworld theory. There are nine dimensions in our realm – we can only perceive up to the fifth, the God one.


Kelly describes the other ones as frequencies, not places. She mentioned that during one of her abductions, there was evidence of a multitude of timelines presented to her on a screen that funnelled to two eventual outcomes – the high road and the low road. 

If collective consciousness allows us to take the high road, she says, we can avert disaster and circumvent being part of another layer of species that could be wiped out on Earth.

“We're a much more advanced version of AI,” Kelly adds. 

“A collective consciousness with the World Wide Web on steroids. It's quantum entanglement – Tesla proved that. I'm just the conduit.” Though the inventor didn't himself prove quantum entanglement, he often gets mentioned alongside Einstein when it comes to conversations about energy and radio waves.

Merritt interprets this kind of connection a little differently, however. 

“After a trauma, the brain looks for meaning,” she says. “For some, that meaning arrives as images of technology, light, or energy – metaphors that help the mind contain something too big to name.”

It appears that sometimes the sheer vicissitude of abduction can be troubling to talk about, even as Kelly experienced later with her future husband at 17. They were out driving a car, on an errand to pay a bill, when they saw a glaring light coming towards them, which eventually flooded the car.

Their radio stopped. They were both taken aboard a ship. Kelly saw a big machine with a multitude of instruments coming off it – advanced apparatus. Startled, she claimed her dad was gonna kick their asses. As a consequence, the alien beings backed away.

All these years later, Kelly now believes there was a sense of telekinesis going on, especially when she surrendered her will to fight. The leader subsequently inserted some instruments into her eye and nose, which explains her current bump on the bridge of her nose.

They got in the car and drove home. They never spoke of it again.

Redefining What “Free Psychic Reading” Truly Means

For decades, the term “free psychic reading” carried skepticism. Too many platforms promised free insight, only to hide costs behind paywalls or short “trial” minutes. The Psychic Experts have rewritten that story. Their philosophy is simple: free means free. Every user who logs in can enjoy a genuine session with a real psychic, not an algorithm or automated script.

“Our goal is to rebuild trust in an industry that has long needed it,” said Anthony C. Bedoya, Communications Director of The Psychic Experts. “When we say free psychic reading, we mean an authentic, full experience — not a teaser, not a trap. Just a real conversation with a certified psychic advisor who listens, understands, and provides honest guidance.”

In a time when artificial intelligence, automation, and rapid change dominate daily life, people are craving genuine human connection and emotional grounding. According to internal data from The Psychic Experts, the most common topics users bring to their advisors include:

“Is my partner my soulmate?”

“Should I change careers?”

“What does the future hold for my family?”

“How can I align with my true spiritual path?”

Each session of free psychic chat online creates a safe, private space to explore such questions — providing reassurance, self-understanding, and often, much-needed peace.

Rebuilding Trust in the Psychic Industry

Historically, the psychic industry has faced skepticism — often for good reason. Hidden fees, fake profiles, and manipulative tactics have made people wary. The Psychic Experts are leading a quiet revolution by setting new ethical standards. Their advisors are prohibited from using fear-based messaging (“You're cursed,” or “You must pay to lift this energy”). Instead, every free psychic reading focuses on empowerment, choice, and compassion.

That transparency has earned the-psychic-experts.com recognition as the most accurate psychic service provider in 2025 and a benchmark for authenticity in the intuitive wellness space.

A Revolution in Credibility: Certified Psychic Advisors You Can Trust

Unlike many “psychic marketplaces” that allow unverified freelancers to list services, The Psychic Experts require every advisor to complete a rigorous multi-stage vetting process before joining the platform.

That process includes:

Live accuracy testing — applicants perform real-time readings under evaluation by senior psychics and staff auditors.

Ethical screening — candidates must demonstrate empathy, integrity, and professional boundaries.

Background and identity verification — ensuring user safety and transparency.

Continuous quality monitoring — performance ratings and user reviews determine an advisor's ongoing eligibility.

Through this multi-layered certification, The Psychic Experts guarantee that every free psychic reading online connects users with vetted psychics who deliver compassion and truth, not manipulation.

Why Verification Matters

Anthony C. Bedoya, Communications Director at The Psychic Experts, explains:

“Trust is our foundation. When someone reaches out for guidance, they're often in a vulnerable emotional state. We take that responsibility seriously. That's why every advisor on our platform must prove not just their intuitive accuracy, but also their humanity and ethics.”

This dedication has earned the-psychic-experts.com a reputation as the most accurate and trusted psychic reading platform in 2025, with the industry's highest repeat-visit rate among users of free psychic chat services.

Human Intuition Meets Cutting-Edge Technology

While the psychics themselves are human, the platform supporting them is powered by some of the most sophisticated technology in the spiritual wellness space.

The Psychic Experts platform integrates AI-assisted matching tools that analyze user questions, topics, and emotional tone — then pair them with the most compatible advisor. This ensures that a user seeking a love psychic reading free won't be matched with a career-focused clairvoyant, and that each free psychic reading online chat no credit card experience feels deeply personal and relevant.

The company also deploys real-time analytics to maintain quality, detect anomalies, and ensure compliance with its no-upselling and no-pressure policies. This blend of intuition and innovation makes The Psychic Experts uniquely capable of providing accurate, accessible, and ethical guidance at scale.

Every free psychic reading and free psychic chat on the platform is protected by end-to-end encryption and GDPR-compliant privacy controls. Users can chat anonymously, delete session histories at any time, and never have to share personal details or payment information.

Key privacy features include:

Redefining Technology's Role in Spiritual Guidance

Unlike automated “fortune bots” used by some competitors, the platform guarantees that every free psychic chat online session connects users with a real human psychic.

Why Love Psychic Readings Matter in the Digital Age

Romance in 2025 is fast-paced and often confusing. Apps encourage endless swiping, and relationships form and fade within days. Amid the noise, people crave depth — the kind of understanding that can't be found in social media posts or algorithmic matches.

That's where The Psychic Experts stand apart. A love psychic reading free session helps users cut through emotional clutter, identify patterns, and rediscover trust. Certified advisors use empathy, clairvoyance, tarot, or astrology to illuminate relationship dynamics — empowering clients to make mindful, informed choices rather than impulsive decisions.

The platform's transparent approach helps bridge spirituality and psychology. Advisors are trained to provide spiritual reading insight while keeping sessions empowering, never manipulative. This dual focus on ethics and empathy allows even skeptics to explore spirituality in a modern, responsible way.

Human beings are wired for connection. When someone types a vulnerable question into a chat and receives an empathetic reply within seconds, the nervous system relaxes. That's why live psychic chat free minutes on The Psychic Experts platform can deliver such comfort. Instant feedback and compassionate communication activate emotional reassurance — something automated bots simply cannot replicate.

This immediacy makes free online psychic chat an essential part of modern self-care routines. Instead of waiting weeks for therapy appointments, users can talk to real psychics right when emotions are raw — turning crisis moments into opportunities for growth.

EPISODE PREMIERES SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 16 AT 8PM ET/PT

PROMO: https://youtu.be/DjVQKTdoNCE

 NEW YORK, NY – (November 10, 2025) – The Whole Story with Anderson Cooper, a six-time Emmy® Award-winning CNN Original, returns with a new chapter in CNN Senior Correspondent Donie O'Sullivan's Emmy®-nominated series of investigations into the pervasive surge of misinformation and its impact on American politics. “MisinfoNation: White Genocide” premieres Sunday, November 16 at 8pm ET/PT on CNN.

In this episode, O'Sullivan investigates why the narrative of an alleged “White genocide” in South Africa has gained traction among some Americans who fear changing demographics that are projected to soon make White people a minority in the U.S. The claim has even reached the White House, where President Trump cited it as justification for granting refugee status to White South Africans. Traveling to South Africa himself, O'Sullivan seeks out local voices to explore the country's deep-seated racial tensions and reveal the more complex reality behind the sensationalized rhetoric.

“The mainstreaming of White nationalist talking points in American discourse in recent years has centered on the conspiracy theory that White people in the U.S. are being deliberately ‘replaced,'” said O'Sullivan. “Claims about purported White persecution in South Africa have played a major role in stoking these fears and have been used as an attempted justification for major changes in the U.S. refugee program. We wanted to separate fact from fiction in what Americans are being told about post-apartheid South Africa and to understand what it means for all of us.”

In “MisinfoNation: White Genocide,” O'Sullivan meets a cross-section of South Africans grappling with their nation's legacy of apartheid and the racial inequalities that endure today. Among them is Errol Musk, father of Elon Musk, whose outspoken views mirror themes that have surfaced in American political discourse. O'Sullivan also travels to two communities built exclusively for White residents: one in South Africa's Orania and another in the Ozark Mountains of the United States, uncovering how these parallel movements reflect a shared ideology across continents.

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) slammed the Senate deal that could end the government shutdown, calling the compromise a Democratic “surrender” and taking aim at Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer‘s (D-NY) leadership over the past 40 days.

“Tonight's Senate vote on the federal government shutdown should have been a time for strength,” the governor, who is eyeing a 2028 White House bid, posted on X. “Instead we saw capitulation and  betrayal of working Americans. The American people need more from their leaders.”

Tonight's Senate vote on the federal government shutdown should have been a time for strength.Instead we saw capitulation and a betrayal of working Americans.The American people need more from their leaders.

The Senate voted 60-40 Sunday night after a group of seven Democrats and one independent joined Republicans to reopen the government via a stopgap funding bill through Jan. 30, 2026. The vote is the first step toward ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history.

The compromise will fund most federal agencies through January but does not guarantee the extension of healthcare subsidies, something that had been a sticking point for Democrats. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) promised to hold a separate vote to extend the subsidies by mid-December. No such promise was made by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA).

“Pathetic,” Newsom's office wrote on X. “This isn't a deal. It's a surrender. Don't bend the knee!”

Pathetic. This isn't a deal. It's a surrender. Don't bend the knee! https://t.co/beCuLi23aF

Even though Schumer came out against the deal, he has received backlash from within his own party for failing to keep members in line.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) also slammed the senior senator from New York on social media.

“Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Khanna wrote. “If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?”

Newsom, fresh off a Proposition 50 win last week that was largely seen as an indictment of President Donald Trump‘s policies, has been trying to stay in the headlines as he pivots toward 2028. He went to Texas to rally Democrats on Saturday before speaking Monday at a global investors' summit in Sao Paulo. He will then speak at the COP30, the annual global climate conference.

“I thought our immune system was woken up last Tuesday with the American elections,” Newsom said, referring to Democrats' wins in Virginia, New York City, and New Jersey. “I worry now, though, that sounds like some of my colleagues and friends in the United States Senate, some of my Democratic colleagues, just decided that we're playing by the old set of rules, not the new set of rules, and may have rolled over a little bit.”

WHAT DEMOCRATS HAVE SAID ABOUT VOTING TO END THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN

He added that Democrats need to “hold the line because I think America will become unrecognizable in a year or two unless we fight back.”

The eight senators who voted in favor of ending the shutdown included: Sens. John Fetterman (D-PA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Angus King (I-ME).","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The S&P 500 equal-weighted index, to be frank, has been a rather lackluster way to own the market in recent years.

During the last half-decade, it's up 63% while the tech-concentrated cap-weighted index you hear about more often is up 93%. In the last 12 months, the equal-weighted index has risen just 2% while the cap-weighted index is up 12%.

The underperformance has a simple explanation. Tech and tech-adjacent stocks have dominated the market, and since they're the largest by market capitalization, they contribute more to the returns of the cap-weighted index. The equal-weighted index, meanwhile, weights all of its constituents the same.

But with the tech sector and mega-cap stocks selling off this past week, it could finally be the equal-weighted index's time to shine.

Investors this week balked at lofty tech stock valuations and spending on AI — the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) is down 5.6% since November 3. The underperformance in tech has dragged down the S&P 500 cap-weighted index by 2.7% in that time.

Meanwhile, the cap-weighted index has fallen just 0.4%.

If investors' retreat from the tech sector continues, the equal-weighted index could be an effective way to hedge downside risk in the cap-weighted strategy, as its performance hinges on the direction of a select few stocks.

""At any point in time you could have a very big drawdown in these stocks, and that would not be unusual because these are volatile stocks,"" Hank Smith, the director & head of investment strategy at The Haverford Trust Company, said about AI-focused mega-cap stocks.

""I don't think a lot of investors understand the risk they're taking buying the S&P 500 index when you consider 10 names in a 500 stock index represent 40% plus of the index,"" he continued. ""Three names represent 25 give or take% of the S&P 500: Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple. That is extraordinary concentration.""

In addition to protection from over-concentration, there are reasons to believe the equal-weighted index could outperform the cap-weighted index going forward.

For one, while the equal-weighted index's recent performance has been relatively poor, it has actually outpaced the cap-weighted index by 1.05% on an average annual basis from 1989-2023, according to Invesco.

Smith also said that the equal-weighted index's low valuations also make it an attractive buy. Its 12-month forward PE ratio is around 22, while the S&P 500 cap-weighted index's is around 30. Invesco pointed out earlier this year that relative valuations between the two indexes are about as far apart as they have been in the last 20 years.

Finally, Smith argues that broadening economic growth — which has been largely supported by AI capital expenditures — would also benefit the equal-weighted index.

""If we're correct on our economic outlook, stronger growth would support that broadening out,"" Smith said. ""And that would suggest that maybe over the next 6 to 9 months, you might see better relative performance from the equal-weighted S&P 500.""

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Ripple Labs has become one of the world's largest cryptocurrency companies, but executives aren't stopping there, CEO Brad Garlinghouse told CNBC. Over the past year, the firm has ramped up efforts to bridge the Web3 world and an industry that has long been viewed as its foil — traditional finance.

In an interview with CNBC's ""Crypto World"" at the Ripple Swell 2025 conference in New York, Garlinghouse said his firm aims to offer a wide range of traditional financial services built on blockchain infrastructure, capitalizing on growing institutional adoption of digital assets.

A blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that logs transactions across a network of computers.

""I want to see Ripple invest in [the] future and get ahead of where that market's going,"" Garlinghouse said Tuesday. ""The assets we have been buying have been on the traditional finance side, so we can bring crypto-enabled solutions to that traditional financial world.""

Ripple has been on a nearly $4 billion acquisition spree in hopes of building a financial services powerhouse, in 2025 alone buying prime brokerage Hidden Road for nearly $1.3 billion in April and software firm GTreasury for more than $1 billion this fall. Last week, it launched Ripple Prime, a brokerage that will offer U.S.-based institutions access to over-the-counter spot market trading across several tokens, raised $500 million in fresh funding and lifted its market value to $40 billion.

Ripple's bid to deepen its push into traditional finance comes as institutional demand for digital assets grows the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities Futures Trading Commission dialing back digital assets regulations this year under President Donald Trump, a self-styled crypto champion.

Bank of America and Citigroup have begun actively exploring stablecoins, with Citi recently unveiling plans to launch a crypto custody service for clients in 2026. JPMorgan in June said it plans to introduce a stablecoin-like ""deposit token"" on Coinbase's public blockchain Base. Beyond dollar-pegged tokens, institutional investors have poured billions of dollars into spot Bitcoin ETFs since their U.S. debut in January 2024.

"" The United States used to lean out on crypto, and now we're leaning in, and I think people underestimate how big a shift that is,"" and the likely impact on the entire crypto market, Garlinghouse said.

On top of building out its own services, Ripple also aims to sign deals to lend its XRP Ledger technology to larger institutions' crypto pushes, according to Garlinghouse.

Such partnerships could prove a boon to XRP, the native token of the XRP Ledger, a decentralized blockchain aimed to service fast and low-cost transactions.  

"" The more we can build utility and really scale solutions that take advantage of XRP at the core, the more that will be uniquely good for the XRP ecosystem,"" Garlinghouse said.

XRP has traded sideways for much of 2025, even as ether and bitcoin sailed to record highs of about $3,900 and $126,000, respectively.

But while high-profile partnerships might push up the price of XRP, dealmaking with traditional institutions is likely to remain difficult due to stalled efforts to create guardrails for cryptocurrency companies and holders in the U.S., Garlinghouse said.

The crypto industry lobby was once hopeful that lawmakers would pass a sweeping digital assets market structure bill called the Clarity Act before the end of the year.

But with the U.S. government shutdown set to enter its sixth week, efforts to establish legislative guidelines for the industry have come to a halt.

""Until we have that [legal go-ahead], it's gonna be hard,"" Garlinghouse said. ""Banks are looking for and need that clarity for them to really lean in.""

Hong Kong is preparing to issue a new batch of government-backed digital green bonds, deepening its move into blockchain-based finance as it tries to position itself as a leading global hub for tokenized assets.

The offering, Hong Kong's third digital bond sale since 2023, will be denominated in US dollars, euros, offshore yuan and Hong Kong dollars, Bloomberg reported citing sources familiar with the issuance. Pricing could be finalized as early as today.

These are so-called digitally native bonds, meaning they are created and settled entirely on blockchain-based platforms. The infrastructure for this latest issue will come from HSBC.

The green label indicates that the funds raised will go toward environmental or climate-focused projects. The city has been pushing to become a blockchain hub, while facing competition from other regions including Singapore and Dubai.

Appetite for blockchain-based debt appears to be growing. Corporations have issued at least six tokenized bonds in the city so far, raising a combined $1 billion, according to the report.

Recent issuers include state-backed firms like Shenzhen Futian Investment Holdings and Shandong Hi-Speed Holdings Group.

S&P gave the notes an AA+ rating. According to the firm, risks tied to digital issuance are buffered by a fail-safe that allows the bonds to shift back into traditional systems if needed.

Damian McNamara, MA

 November 10, 2025  

Statin therapy remains a cornerstone for primary and secondary prevention of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), but prescribing based on patient phenotype identified through imaging may boost its effectiveness, according to a new study.

“While population-level primary-prevention trials have established the efficacy of statins, it remains unclear whether their benefit depends on the extent of underlying atherosclerotic disease. Our work addresses this evidence gap by assessing whether the treatment effect varies with disease characteristics,” lead investigator Bálint Szilveszter, MD, PhD, a researcher at the Semmelweis University Heart and Vascular Centre in Budapest, Hungary, wrote in an email to Medscape Medical News.

“Clarifying this relationship could enable more personalized and also intensified therapy,” Szilveszter added.

Each 10% increase in statin use was associated with a decreased risk for MACE, for example, among those with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), high-risk plaque, a calcium score of ≥ 400, or a segment involvement score > 4. In contrast, there was no link between patients with “any CAD” and lower risk for MACE. 

By contrast, “in asymptomatic individuals, routine CT screening is not recommended,” Szilveszter said.

The study was published online on August 5, 2025, in JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.

Szilveszter and colleagues studied 11,026 consecutive adults with stable chest pain referred for clinically indicated coronary CT angiography to assess CAD between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2020. The population had a mean age of 59 years and 55% were men.

The MACE composite endpoint included all-cause mortality, acute myocardial infarction, or revascularization for unstable angina.

Statin use was based on prescription fills in Hungary's National Health Service database. Sixty-six percent of patients were treated with a statin during the study period. Median follow-up was 8.3 years from the date of first statin use to an event or end of the study.

MACE was detected in 4.4% of patients, myocardial infarction alone in 0.9%, and all-cause mortality in 3.1%. Following coronary CT angiography, 14% of total patients stopped using statins, 11% started statin therapy, and 40% continued their statin regimen. The remaining patients were not treated with statins.

With each 10% increase in statin use, the risk for MACE was lowered in the presence of:

In contrast, results revealed no significant MACE reduction for “any CAD” (aHR, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.85-1.07; P = .411).

“Our message is not to restrict therapy but to better target and support statin use when anatomic disease is demonstrated,” Szilveszter said.

Whether coronary CT angiography can guide therapy in asymptomatic individuals remains under investigation, he added.

“Given radiation and contrast exposure and costs, we need to define the true cost–benefit and select subgroups in whom use may be justified in the future,” he said.

“Statins are widely prescribed. While it is clear that statin users improved some aspects of their lipid profile, the effects of health outcomes are not so obvious and there are some gaps in the knowledge,” Claudio Gil Araújo, MD, PhD, dean of Research and Education at CLINIMEX — Clínica de Medicina do Exercício in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, wrote in an email to Medscape Medical News.

There has never been a randomized controlled trial comparing statins, exercise, a combination of both, and controls, according to Abraço.

“And unfortunately, due to other interests, it will never happen. However, observational data suggest that those who are fitter will have modest or no benefit in reducing MACE from taking statins,” he said, citing a 2013 study in The Lancet by Peter Kokkinos, PhD, and colleagues that supports that finding.

“It's better to be highly fit or at least fit than not being fit and taking a statin,” Kokkinos, lead author and director of the Center for Exercise and Aging and professor at Rutgers-New Brunswick School of Arts and Sciences in New Brunswick, New Jersey, said in an interview.

Kokkinos and colleagues classified 10,043 veterans with dyslipidemia into four strata of fitness. They found significant protective effects against MACE with greater fitness levels, and statins conferred the most benefit among those who were least fit. Median follow-up was 10 years, during which 2318 patients died. The risk for death was 18.5% among those taking statins vs 27.7% among those not taking statins (P < .0001).

Therefore, even though the research shows an interaction between statins and reduced MACE risk, “once you go up to fit or highly fit, I'm not sure it matters,” Kokkinos said.

One potential limitation of the study by Kokkinos and colleagues is that the median age of the veterans was 59 years, so the interaction of statins, exercise, and risk for MACE later in life was not addressed in this study.

“I think it would have been similar; we had some people in their seventies and eighties. But, yes, we do not know this — I don't have that data,” Kokkinos said.

Asked to comment on the findings by Szilveszter and colleagues, Kokkinos said, “If you have some degree of CAD or a higher calcium score, then statins increase your survival rate.”

Kokkinos added that screening patients using coronary CT angiography makes sense. “Of course, the more you know about the severity of disease, the better off you are as a physician. As we get more and more technology, more high-resolution results, we are able to do that better and discriminate the different phenotypes.”

Regarding the controversial public health proposal that statins are so beneficial that they should be added to public water supplies, Kokkinos said, “I've heard that, but my research shows that we should try to have everyone exercise instead of putting statins in the drinking water.”

“Statins are not for everyone and should not be used as one-size-fits-all therapy,” he added. Instead, prescription of statins “should be treated more skeptically when it comes to people with no symptoms, no major coronary artery disease, or other risk factors.”

The JACC: Cardiovascular Imagingstudy was independently supported. Szilveszter, Abraço, and Kokkinos reported no relevant financial relationships.

The singer took viewers on a backstage tour of her daily talk show while running down the three LPs that are on constant rotation.

	By now you're surely aware that Kelly Clarkson can sing just about any song. The pop star and  talk show host has run the gamut from pop and rock to country and soul during her beloved daily “Kellyoke” sessions that open each episode of her daytime chat series. Over the years, she's taken on songs from Ariana Grande, theWhite Stripes, Dolly Parton, Lady Gaga, Coldplay, Heart and the Pixies, as well as fellow American Idol winner Carrie Underwood, My Chemical Romance and many more.

	So we know Clarkson has eclectic musical tastes, but what inquiring minds really want to find out is what are the singer's top three albums of all time? Luckily, on Monday's (Nov. 10) show, Clarkson spilled the beans on her royal trio. Taking viewers on a walk through the backstage of her series' studio, pointing to some of the pictures of her biggest influences lining the walls, Clarkson set the stage for the big reveal.


	Pointing to the framed cover of Lauryn Hill‘s Grammy-winning debut solo album, 1998's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Clarkson said if you don't like the Billboard 200 No. 1 smash “you're an idiot,” adding that the LP is one of the reasons she became a songwriter. She also noted that Americana legend Patty Griffin is her all-time favorite singer-songwriter and also shouted out Alanis Morissette, the Toadies and Aretha Franklin, among others.

	











	But when it come to her absolute favorites, there was no doubt, with Clarkson giving a jokey, no bones caveat: “I hope you like them. If you don't, you're dumb.”


	First up with Griffin's 2002 classic 1000 Kisses from the artist Clarkson loves so much that her fans have put together “secret” compilation albums of Griffin's music that have never been officially released.


	“I love her so much. Her storytelling, her voice, her tone, her musicianship… the timing. She just does everything so beautiful,” Clarkson said of the 61-year-old Maine native whose self-titled 2019 LP won the Grammy for best folk album. Clarkson recalled that former boyfriend musician Graham Colton introduced her to Griffin's music. “He was a great dude, but I wills ay the best part of that relationship was honestly him showing me this artist. I cannot thank him enough, she's changed my life,” Clarkson said.


	Number two on Kelly's list was U2‘s 1998 compilation, The Best Of 1980-1990. While there are other U2 albums she loves, Clarkson said this 14-song compilation featuring such indelible hits as “Pride (In the Name of Love),” “New Year's Day,” “With or Without You,” “I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For,” “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” “Desire,” “Angel of Harlem” and others is the bomb.


	“I saw them at Madison Square Garden and it was the most insane show of my life and it was like a spiritual experience,” said Clarkson, who noted that she appreciates the band's career-long struggle with the sacred and the profane. “Sometimes you're like, ‘is he talking about a woman? Is he talking about a relationship with God? Is he just stoned and having a good time?' I don't know but I'm in and I want to know more,” she said. 

	











	The third pick might be a surprise given Clarkson's pure pop roots, but holding up Hill's Miseducation, the singer said she had the CD — which she bought with her own money — cued up in her Walkman and did not leave her home except to go to school for days in order to listen to the album on repeat. “I was like, ‘this is the coolest thing,'” she recalled thinking. “It wasn't just the fact that she's an incredible vocalist. It wasn't even the fact that there's incredible [background vocals] and how they interact with each other and intertwine. It was so clever, but not so processed and thought out. It was, like, organic.”


	She also, of course, loved the “real, authentic” messages in the lyrics that, as a budding songwriter, taught her about the importance of writing with an authentic, believable voice. “This was a whole album story like something that will stand the test of time,” she said.

	There will inevitably be someone who spends three or four times more than face value to attend Hayley Williams‘ upcoming solo tour. They'll be faced with the choice of either forking over whatever hiked up amount ticket resellers will charge on secondhand sites, or sacrifice their chance to hear “Good Ol' Days” and “Parachute” live. But Williams has put some preventative measures in place ahead of the tour presale to ensure that those who share this experience are in the minority, rather than part of a larger collective of fans being exploited by scalpers and bots.


	“You shouldn't have to jump through hoops to buy tickets to see the show, but unfortunately, it's a broken and convoluted system,” Williams shared in a lengthy statement on Instagram. “My team and I are doing everything we can, and I am hopeful that the processes we've put into place will get as many tickets into the hands of my fans (at face value) as possible.”


	The Hayley Williams at a Bachelorette Party Tour will kick off in North America in March. In partnership with Openstage, a verified fan presale will be hosted with registration open from Monday, Nov. 10, at 10 a.m. ET through Tuesday, Nov. 11, at 10 a.m. ET. The sale will require two-factor authentication with fans verifying both their email address and phone number to gain access using a unique code. It isn't guaranteed that all verified fans will obtain tickets, but at least their competition in the queue will be each other, rather than bots and scalpers.

	











	“I want to get tickets into the hands of my fans, at a price that is as reasonable as I could get it,” Williams said. “I've had countless conversations with my team, and they've spent countless hours trying to find the best solution for fans to be able to buy tickets. It's been tough (to say the least), and unfortunately, there's just no way to guarantee that zero tickets get scalped. But we're doing our best.”

	











	If the presale sells out, those who weren't able to purchase one will have additional, if limited, chances to gain access. In the event that a ticket holder is unable to attend and wants to sell their ticket, resale will be available through a face value ticket exchange. This restricted redistribution method prevents tickets from being resold through Ticketmaster, AXS, and other ticketing platforms for more than their original cost. As an additional precaution, ticket transfers will be disabled in eligible states (sorry New York and Chicago fans), limiting potential instances for tickets to appear on secondary sites like SeatGeek and StubHub.

	Williams admits that the approach “won't be perfect,” but hopes it will be enough to ease some of the anguish around the ticket buying experience. “I can't wait to be back on the road and see all of your faces,” said the musician, who released her third solo album Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party in August. “We'll dance, scream, and cry together. Love you all. Take care of yourselves.”
