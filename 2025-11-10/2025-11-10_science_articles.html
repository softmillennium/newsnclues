(2025)Cite this article Aging trajectories are influenced by modifiable risk factors, and prior evidence has hinted that multilingualism may have protective potential. However, reliance on suboptimal health markers, small samples, inadequate confounder control and a focus on clinical cohorts led to mixed findings and limited applicability to healthy populations. Here, we developed biobehavioral age gaps, quantifying delayed or accelerated aging in 86,149 participants across 27 European countries. National surveys provided individual-level positive (functional ability, education, cognition) and adverse (cardiometabolic conditions, female sex, sensory impairments) factors, while country-level multilingualism served as an aggregate exposure. Biobehavioral factors predicted age (R2 = 0.24, r = 0.49, root mean squared error = 8.61), with positive factors linked to delayed aging and adverse factors to accelerated aging. Multilingualism emerged as a protective factor in cross-sectional (odds ratio = 0.46) and longitudinal (relative risk = 0.70) analyses, whereas monolingualism increased risk of accelerated aging (odds ratio = 2.11; relative risk = 1.43). Effects persisted after adjusting for linguistic, physical, social and sociopolitical exposomes. These results underscore the protective role of multilingualism and its broad applicability for global health initiatives.

Associations between number of spoken languages and BAGs across age cohorts (n = 86,149 participants). A) Odds ratio (OR) estimates from the cross-sectional analysis and B) relative risk (RR) estimates from the longitudinal analysis, both stratified by age. Across designs, results show that risk of accelerated aging increases with age among monolinguals. For individuals speaking one additional language, the protective effect weakens with age. In contrast, speaking two or more additional languages is linked to progressively stronger protection with advancing age.

Chemotherapy is our most effective tool at fighting many forms of cancer, but due to its mostly indiscriminate nature, healthy tissues are often caught in the crossfire between these radiative drugs and cancer cells. Scientists have made remarkable progress trying to limit the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy—even looking to the biology of extremophiles like tardigrades for inspiration—while others have investigated ways to fight cancer through different means entirely. In a new paper published in the journal ACS Nano, the team provides details of a cancer-fighting treatment known as near-infrared photothermal therapy, which relies on light and nanomaterials—specifically, tin-based two-dimensional nanoflakes, or SnOx (Sn is tin on the periodic table)—to essentially serve a fatal dose of heat via lasers to cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched. “Our goal was to create a treatment that is not only effective but also safe and accessible,” Jean Anne Incorvia, a co-author of the study from UT Austin, said in a press statement. “With the combination of LED light and SnOx nanoflakes, we've developed a method to precisely target cancer cells while leaving healthy cells untouched.” According to Wired, the system relies on near-infrared LEDs (NIR-LEDs) that emit light at 810 nanometers, which is the same wavelength that scientists use for photobiomodulation, used to stimulate cellular and healing processes. Once a sample is irradiated, the tiny nanoflakes get to work infiltrating cancerous cells, absorbing light, and transferring that light into heat to eventually destroy the cell. The entire system only costs $530 and can irradiate 24 samples at a time, meaning that near-infrared photothermal therapy could also be an affordable therapeutic option. “Our ultimate goal is to make this technology available to patients everywhere, especially places where access to specialized equipment is limited, with fewer side effects and lower cost,” Artur Pinto, a co-author of the study from the University of Porto, said in a press statement. A portable device could be placed on the skin after surgery to irradiate and destroy any remaining cancer cells, reducing the risk of recurrence.” The authors admit that there's more work to do. Today, cancer remains the second-leading cause of death worldwide, but it looks like a new light-based ally is ready to enter the fight. Are There More Humans on Earth Than We Thought?</p>

We may earn commission if you buy from a link. The remote Namorotukunan archaeological site in Kenya's Turkana Basin can be punishingly hot and arid, with Lake Turkana offering the only relief for a passing zebra or gazelle. Around 2.75 million years ago, the region was once covered by wetlands, which dried up into seemingly endless miles of grassland and desert. Stone tools found at the site, once inhabited by the Oldowan civilization of Lower Paleolithic Africa, show a period of technological evolution spanning some 300,000 years from 2.75 to 2.4 million years ago (this is one of the rare Oldowan sites over 2.6 million years old). Hominins are thought to have begun making tools over 3 million years ago, and other East African sites have turned up Oldowan artifacts that represent the most ancient systematic tool production system. The oldest evidence of toolmaking shows that percussive technology, meaning the pounding, grinding, or flaking of stone into objects such as spear points and blades. Many of the tools found at Namorotukunan had been flaked to create sharp edges. Sometime between 3.6 and 3.4 million years ago, a volcanic eruption reshaped the landscape around Namorotukunan, and a humid floodplain formed in its aftermath. Fossils of palms and sedges from before 2.8 million years ago suggest a high water level in the region. Wildfires swept across Turkana Basin, leaving behind microcharcoals from the vegetation they burned, while shrubs and grasses replaced plants that needed more water to thrive. Then, the entire expanse gradually went from submerged to nearly desiccated. Hominins who lived at Namorotukunan persevered in making these tools through all sorts of weather changes and natural disasters. These stones fracture consistently, making them easier to work with and showing that these ancient people understood the mechanical properties of rocks to some extent. The levels of rock in which artifacts were found helped give Carvalho and her team an idea as to which time period they were from. Most were found in rock strata made of sands and gravels which have long since fossilized, and while there has been some damage to these tools over the eons, their razor-thin edges were preserved. Also unearthed at the site were animal bones that show butchery marks most likely made by these same tools. “This period of aridification played a role in shaping the ecological context in which the behaviors of our human ancestors evolved.” Her work has appeared in Popular Mechanics, Ars Technica, SYFY WIRE, Space.com, Live Science, Den of Geek, Forbidden Futures and Collective Tales.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Long thought to be impossible, fingerprinting bullets is now possible thanks to a new electrochemical process that makes hidden ridges visible in seconds. However, all of that time, scientists haven't cracked arguably the most important problem facing fingerprinting: You can't pull prints off of bullet casings. Because of the intense temperatures, gas, and friction applied to a bullet when fired, biological residue (read: fingerprints) typically doesn't survive the process. If crime scene investigators could somehow lift prints off these littered casings... well, that'd be quite the smoking gun. A new study led by scientists at Maynooth University in Ireland might be making impressive headway on that very idea. As reported in the journal Forensic Chemistry, authors Colm McKeever and Eithne Dempsey wrote that a new electrochemical technique can draw chemicals to the surface of the casing when a low voltage is applied, filling tiny gaps between fingerprint ridges almost instantly. “Currently, the best case of forensic analysis of ammunition casings is to match it to the gun that fired it. The team tested this next-gen fingerprinting technique on brass, as it's the most widely used material for bullet casings (certain aluminum alloys and even steel are used in some cases), and found that this electrochemical process even worked on samples as old as 16 months. But the best part may be that at the heart of this technology is a device known as a potentiostat (which is what controls the voltage), and it can be as small as a mobile phone, meaning that future kits could be compact enough to carry into the field. The authors note that this study is only a proof-of-principle first phase in visualizing fingerprints on challenging surfaces. Further work will need to be done to shore up the technique's accuracy before it's exported around the world as a crime-fighting tool (time well spent, considering conventional fingerprinting doesn't exactly have a sterling success record). The team hopes that this process could also be applied to other metallic surfaces, including knives, coins, and other types of firearms. Are There More Humans on Earth Than We Thought?

Hamilton (Ham) Smith co-discovered type II restriction enzymes, molecular scissors that cut DNA at precise sequence sites, which proved to be an essential tool for the emerging field of molecular biology. For this work he shared the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Werner Arber and Daniel Nathans. On its publication in 1995, it was the first complete genome of any organism. That fortunate collaboration led to the first draft human genome sequence in 2001, and then to the first cell made from a synthetic genome in 2010. Smith was a scientist's scientist, working in the laboratory almost every day and quietly being an inspiration, friend and a collaborator to all his colleagues. Smith discovered biology while studying mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, and went on to receive his medical degree from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1956. Studying the bacteriophage P22, a virus that infects the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium, he mastered DNA isolation techniques that became an essential component of all his main contributions to science. Beginning work on H. influenzae, he discovered a restriction enzyme by studying changes in DNA viscosity. He used several clever techniques to prove that the enzyme recognized a unique DNA sequence, long before the advent of DNA sequencing, and published two key papers in the Journal of Molecular Biology in 1970 (H. O. Smith and K. W. Wilcox J. Mol. His mother told him that she looked at his father and said, “Do you suppose there is another Hamilton Smith at Hopkins?” We sequenced 25,000 fragments and mathematically assembled them into the complete circular genome. After this, Smith joined TIGR and its successor firm, the J. Craig Venter Institute, where he stayed for the remaining 25 years of his career. ‘Google Maps' for Roman roads reveals vast extent of ancient network DNA pioneer James Watson has died ― colleagues wrestle with his legacy An ATP-gated molecular switch orchestrates human messenger RNA export Africa finally has its own drug-regulation agency — and it could transform the continent's health DNA pioneer James Watson has died ― colleagues wrestle with his legacy Developmental maps of the brain trace when cell types emerge CMLR's goal is to advance machine learning-related research across a wide range of disciplines.

Assessing the sustainability of plastic chemical recycling requires realistic feedstocks and catalysts designed within sustainability-led frameworks (Plastic-to-X). We link catalyst design and systems analysis to study hydrogenolysis of high-density polyethylene (virgin and bottle caps; Mw = 100–200 kDa). We report Ru–Ni alloy nanoparticles (3–4 nm) supported on titania that yield up to 55% liquid C6–C45 products under optimized conditions, whereas monometallic Ru produces virtually no liquids  Operando spectroscopy and simulations reveal structure sensitivity: backbone scission follows dehydrogenation and hydrogenation cycles at defective alloy sites formed in situ. Integrating these mechanistic insights with life cycle and techno-economic analyses indicates profitable processing of plastic caps over the optimal catalyst (2.5 wt% Ru, 5 wt% Ni) with substantially lower CO2 emissions even when using green H2. Furthermore, within the Plastic-to-X framework, we identify a minimum average chain length threshold of C11 for product distributions as a  critical design  metric to reconcile environmental and economic objectives. Polyolefins, including high-density polyethylene (HDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP), are by far the largest contributors to plastic pollution, with an annual production rate equal to 350 Mt1. Collected goods are nowadays mechanically recycled into other plastic products with widespread applications delimited by regulations2 or culture3. Efforts to develop chemical routes−now handling < 1% of all plastic waste−are on the rise since they can produce monomers, fuels, chemicals, or materials, opening up other markets while contributing to sustainability4,5,6. Among these routes often applied to other complex feedstocks like biomass7, catalytic hydrogenolysis generates alkane streams (in contrast to hydrocracking, which also produces olefins and aromatics8) at mild conditions (200–300 °C, 10–30 bar H2), making it suitable for the production of gases, fuels, or lubricants9. After approximately half a decade of development10, polyolefin hydrogenolysis now requires more coordinated efforts from catalyst to process scales to determine conditions for environmental and economic sustainability11,12. A key aspect to consider is the influence of using green hydrogen, which is known to impose economic constraints to other environmentally benign processes13,14,15. Another factor is the potential to access many different product distributions, suggesting a large impact variability across scenarios that has led to a lack of clear target products; an issue that can be summarized as the Plastic-to-X question. Within this complexity, however, liquid range alkanes (C6–C45) may be preferred since they require less hydrogen than gases and currently offer more attractive prices16. This valuable direction aligns with seminal analyses using model polyethylenes (average molecular weight Mw < 100 kDa)16,17. Comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) focused on realistic waste streams can be used to identify environmentally preferred routes5,15,18,19,20,21. In the context of plastics, it has been shown that extending the material's lifetime via chemical recycling can lead to notable emission reductions in the plastics sector at the expense of higher costs when compared to the current fossil-based linear system22,23,24. Thus, pinpointing Plastic-to-X routes that satisfy the economy-environment nexus is relevant to guiding catalyst design. Supported monometallic ruthenium catalysts are considered reference materials for the hydrogenolysis of model polyolefins, particularly PP25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33 and LDPE30,34,35,36,37,38,39, and serve as a benchmark for the less studied HDPE40. With these reports revealing key mechanistic features, realistic feedstocks must now be prioritized to demonstrate the viability of this technology. Recent studies have shown that titania-supported ultrafine Ru nanoparticles exhibit high activity for commercial-grade HDPE (Mw = 200 kDa) and for plastic caps made from it; however, they favor methane formation41. This lack of selectivity control emanates from ruthenium's intrinsic high activity to promote terminal C–C scission (demethylation, yielding methane) versus the desirable secondary-secondary C–C scission (backbone scission, yielding progressively shorter multicarbon products)28,35. The addition of a second metal to form atomically controlled bimetallic structures42,43 with enhanced selectivity is a strategy that has proven successful in other processes involving hydrocarbons, such as hydrorefining of acetylene into ethylene44, propane dehydrogenation45, or ethylene epoxidation46. Recent works centered on model LDPE (Mw = 4 kDa, equivalent to ca. C150) have indeed observed reduced demethylation over a Ru-Co single atom alloy47 and Ru-Pt systems48,49. Nickel also shows promise as a ruthenium modifier owing to its low carbon footprint50 and higher preference for backbone scission in the hydrogenolysis of short alkanes51,52,53 and hydrocracking of HDPE54,55,56,57,58 or LDPE59. Nonetheless, Ni displays low activity in monometallic form thereby exhibiting complementary features to Ru. A recent model LDPE hydrogenolysis study using silica-supported Ru-Ni nanoparticles has signaled a reduction in the demethylation degree compared to monometallic Ru, though the lack of synthesis-structure-performance relations precludes its extrapolation to other plastics and catalyst architectures 60. In this regard, the adoption of advanced characterization techniques such as operando spectroscopy may represent a suitable step forward toward enhanced understanding in this field. Following this emerging approach, we integrate catalyst design with system-level analysis to investigate catalyst composition, structure, and performance for HDPE hydrogenolysis. We first develop titania-supported RuNi alloys nanoparticles (ca. 5 nm), yielding up to 16% liquid products under standardized conditions, compared to null for monometallic Ru, and rationalize their operation via operando monitoring of alloy formation coupled to experimental and simulation studies. Further optimization of operating conditions resulted in up to 55% liquid yield for the RuNi catalyst. Bridging these findings with life cycle and techno-economic analyses, we predict environmentally and economically sustainable processing of plastic caps even using green hydrogen. Furthermore, extending this analysis to the Plastic-to-X concept revealed a minimum average chain length threshold of C11 for hydrocarbon products to reconcile economic and environmental demands. Overall, this work highlights how studies aiming at the development of emerging catalytic technologies can largely benefit from a holistic approach. We devised a sequential impregnation method depicted in Supplementary Fig. 1 and described in detail in the Methods section to synthesize titania-supported nanoparticles with varying ruthenium and nickel content (XRuYNi, where X and Y stand for the wt% of Ru and Ni, respectively). Briefly, YNi catalysts (Y = 0–15 wt%) were first prepared by impregnation of the Ni precursor on TiO2 (anatase), followed by thermal treatment in flowing N2 and reduction in H2. The second impregnation added ruthenium (X = 0–2.5 wt%) to reach the final XRuYNi systems. In the first stage of this study, these catalysts were used to promote hydrogenolysis of commercial-grade HDPE with average molecular weight Mw = 100 kDa (HDPE100) to identify performance trends, and later of the more widely used HDPE200 and plastic caps (Supplementary Table 1). Experiments were performed in a parallel reactor setup and product quantification was possible via gas chromatography, as described in the Methods section and depicted in Supplementary Figs. First tests explored the reactivity of XRu and YNi catalysts separately. Monometallic XRu displayed very high conversion (defined as C1-C45 yield), promoting almost exclusively gaseous products even at reduced reaction times of 0.5 h (gray symbols in Fig. These results align with the high activity and tendency of Ru to promote terminal cleavage41. On the other hand, YNi displayed low activity with a tendency to promote liquid products. Variable Ni contents (Y = 0–15 wt%) and reduction temperatures (573–873 K) enabled a matrix of YNi catalysts with particle sizes between 6 and 20 nm where Ni(111) and NiO(111) facets predominated (Supplementary Figs. Following previous reports using nickel catalysts for other polyolefins54,57,59, catalytic tests revealed very modest conversions even at high Ni contents (e.g., < 10% C1-C45 yield on 15Ni), as reflected in Fig. Despite the low activity, selectivity toward liquid products (measured as the percentage of the converted fraction into the C6-C45 range) could reach values over 90% (e.g., 5Ni reduced at 573 K, Supplementary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Table 3) and conversion peaked for 5Ni catalysts reduced at 723 K (Supplementary Fig. These results reinforce that monometallic Ni catalysts tend to favor liquid products within their modest activity. a Yield of C1–C45 products versus Ru content, with lines corresponding to different Ni content. b Yield to liquid products (C6–C45) versus yield to C1–C45 products for catalysts containing 2.5 wt% Ru. c Product distributions from catalysts with 2.5 wt% Ru and 5 wt% Ni prepared by different synthetic routes. More details can be found in the Methods section and metal distributions in Fig. Reaction conditions: P(H2) = 20 bar, T = 523 K, stirring rate = 750 rpm, t = 0.5 h (XRu) or 4 h (XRuYNi), catalyst/plastic = 0.1, feedstock = HDPE100. d Product distributions obtained from different feedstocks (1 = HDPE100, 2 = HDPE200, 3 = caps) over 2.5 Ru and 2.5Ru5Ni catalysts under optimized conditions. Numerical values and reaction conditions are provided in Supplementary Tables 2, 5, 6, 9. The second stage focused on determining reactivity patterns within the XRuYNi family (Supplementary Fig. Figure 1a discloses that activity increases with X (Ru content), with catalysts containing 3 and 5 wt% Ni showing similar trends and superior to the 10 wt% case. Conversion and liquid yield were the two main criteria for catalyst selection, leading to the catalysts with 2.5 wt% Ru content being chosen for further analysis. Within this group, 3 and 5 wt% Ni content showed high conversion (80% to C1-C45, with 9 and 16% to C6-C45, respectively, Supplementary Table 2), giving a first indication of the enhancing effect of Ni on the production of liquids. When displaying conversion against liquid yield (Fig. 1b), the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst was chosen for further investigations as it attained the highest activity out of the XRuYNi materials and the highest liquid yield in the 2.5RuYNi group (83% yield to C1-C45, with 16% to C6-C45), clearly departing from the catalytic behavior of 2.5Ru (97% yield to C1-C5, 3% to C6-C45 after 0.5 h). The first indication of the need for a close interaction between nickel and ruthenium to achieve high liquid yields came after obtaining exclusively gaseous products over physical mixtures with similar Ru and Ni contents (Supplementary Fig. After these experiments, alternative synthesis routes were applied to prepare catalysts with 2.5 wt% Ru and 5 wt% Ni, targeting other catalyst structures. These routes are sequential impregnation in the reverse order (first Ru and then Ni) and flame spray pyrolysis, a method proven to achieve controlled dispersion of metals on oxides (Supplementary Fig. Figure 1c discloses that 2.5Ru5Niinv (inverse impregnation) gave  only 5% liquid yield (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 5 for other compositions following the same trend), whereas 2.5Ru5NiFSP (flame spray pyrolysis) was almost inactive. These results revealed structural sensitivity, as evidenced by themicroscopy analysis contained in Fig. The structure of the as-prepared 2.5Ru5Ni system consisted of well-dispersed nanoparticles (3-4 nm on average, Supplementary Fig. 11 for a larger field of view), resembling that of 2.5Ru (Supplementary Fig. 12), with Ru and Ni showing a high degree of co-location (Fig. Catalysts did not exhibit noticeable morphological changes after reaction, suggesting structural stability (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. On the other hand, 2.5Ru5Niinv presented a less intimate contact between metals, with aggregates ranging from dozens of nanometers (Fig. 2e) to nanoparticles (Supplementary Fig. In contrast, 2.5Ru5NiFSP displayed an uneven metal dispersion where nickel was highly dispersed while ruthenium formed aggregates of varying sizes (ca. The structural sensitivity of the reaction was evident from these results, recommending 2.5Ru5Ni as reference material for further exploration. Overall, these results underscore the relevance of matching scalable synthetic methods with optimal catalyst structure, since the simplicity and capacity of a synthesis route is a cornerstone feature for its industial feasibility63. Representative STEM-EDX elemental maps and HAADF-STEM images of the as-prepared (a, b) and used (c, d) 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst. Reaction conditions are the same as in Fig. Representative STEM-EDX elemental maps of (e) 2.5Ru5Niinv and (f) 2.5Ru5NiFSP after reaction. Additional maps and images are provided in Supplementary Figs. We then proceeded to an initial optimization of reaction conditions to maximize the yield to liquid products on the reference 2.5Ru5Ni by varying reaction time, temperature, hydrogen pressure, stirring rate, and catalyst-to-plastic ratio (Supplementary Fig. The maximum liquid yield obtained from these experiments was close to 55% for certain combinations of reaction conditions. Among them, T = 538 K, t = 6 h, P(H2) = 20 bar, stirring rate = 750 rpm, catalyst-to-plastic ratio = 0.1 were chosen due to the simultaneous high conversion (> 90%) and the mentioned high fraction of liquids, demonstrating the relevance of reaction engineering in this process. A parallel optimization for 2.5Ru using lower catalyst amounts resulted in a maximum liquid yield of ca. 25% at 85% conversion (Supplementary Fig. The role of Ni as promoter toward liquid products was reinforced when comparing the 2.5Ru and 2.5Ru5Ni catalysts at similar conversion levels, with 2.5Rsu5Ni still showing improved liquid yields (Supplementary Fig. Consecutive tests were performed over 2.5Ru5Ni under optimized conditions to check for reusability (Supplementary Fig. While the catalyst remained active, the conversion and liquid yields decreased slightly. This may be due to residual carbon material contributing to the measured catalyst mass (Supplementary Fig. 19b), resulting in the actual amount of catalyst in the reactor being lower. These results suggest that 2.5Ru5Ni can be reused, although further improvements to the recycling procedure are necessary. Results for hydrogenolysis of virgin HDPE with larger molecular weight (HDPE200) and post-consumer plastic waste (caps) over 2.5Ru5Ni and 2.5Ru using optimized conditions are presented in Fig. 2.5Ru5Ni displayed a higher liquid yield for HDPE200 and plastic caps than 2.5Ru while maintaining high activity. Hence, the ability of 2.5Ru5Ni to process various HDPE feedstocks warrants a deeper investigation into its catalyst structure. In view of the distinctive feature of co-location of Ni and Ru over 2.5Ru5Ni compared to the other materials with similar composition (Fig. 2), characterization efforts probed the potential formation of RuNi alloys in XRuYNi systems. Textural characterization indicated similar surface areas and pore volumes for the set of XRuYNi catalysts under study (Supplementary Table 10). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of as-prepared and used 2.5Ru5Ni did not show reflections corresponding to Ru nor Ni phases, suggesting low crystallinity or small crystallite size (Supplementary Fig. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of 2.5RuYNi materials after reaction revealed the predominance of oxidic Ru and Ni phases, likely due to exposure to air (Supplementary Fig. Elemental analysis disclosed Ni/Ru ratios slightly higher than theoretical ones, suggesting these materials have Ni-rich surfaces. Notably, 2.5Ru5Ni and 2.5Ru5Niinv exhibited similar values (4.8 and 4.3, respectively), pointing to a modest influence of the synthesis method on surface composition (Supplementary Table 11). For a detailed phase investigation, the fast Fourier transforms (FFT) of micrographs taken from different domains of used samples were analyzed (Fig. Electron diffraction patterns compatible with the (100), (002), (101), (102) and (110) reflections of the reference Ni1Ru1 as model for hexagonal closed-packed structure (hcp, with d-spacing 2.26, 2.10, 1.99, 1.54, and 1.30 Å, respectively) could be identified. Additional analysis also supported domains with Ni-rich alloys with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure (Ni0.8Ru0.2 taken as a reference) through the identification of reflections matching the (111), (200), and (220) planes with corresponding d-spacing of 2.07, 1.79, and 1.27 Å. These results provided the first support for RuNi alloys formation but required additional evidence due to the existence of other possible crystalline species with similar structures. For instance, metallic Ru hcp shows d-spacing values of identified planes close to those for the Ni1Ru1 alloy (e.g., d-spacing 2.33 vs. 2.26 Å for the (111) plane). Metallic Ni and Ni-rich hcp alloys also suffer from similar constraints (e.g., d-spacing 2.05 vs. 2.07 Å for the (101) plane). Precise identification of alloy compositions thus requires further characterization efforts. Red colored regions in Fig. 3b indicate the possible location of alloys considering these limitations. A more detailed analysis of the images revealed an unidentified semicrystalline phase (yellow colored) that could be assigned to partial amorphization of the TiO2 support at the surface (raw and additional images in Supplementary Fig. D and G bands typical of coke formation (1350 and 1580 cm−1, respectively) were absent in Raman spectra for the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst, with the spectra measured before and after reaction showing close resemblance (Supplementary Fig. a HR-TEM images and corresponding FFTs of 2.5Ru5Ni after reaction. Colored lines correspond to different phases, with red indicating the likely location of RuNi alloys (blue: TiO2, yellow: unidentified amorphous phase). Unmodified and additional images are provided in Supplementary Fig. 22. b DRIFTS upon CO adsorption on 2.5Ru5Ni with monometallic counterparts added for reference.

Reaction conditions: P(H2) = 20 bar, T = 523 K, catalyst/plastic = 1, feedstock = HDPE100. The subscripts x and y indicate relative metal content. A second evidence for the existence of RuNi alloys was provided by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) applied to CO adsorption after H2 reduction of 2.5Ru, 2.5Ru5Ni, and 5Ni (Fig. The monometallic nickel catalyst showed bands at 2053 cm−1 (linear configuration), 1920 cm−1 (bridge), and 1856 cm−1 (hollow)64,65. The 2.5Ru surface displayed a band centered at 1981 cm−1 to which linear, bridging, and three-folded configurations contribute66,67. Distinctive bands were observed for the bimetallic material, which displayed a first band associated with linear bonding on Ni (with a tail suggesting the contribution from metallic Ru), as well as with a new band centered at ca. These results indicate the emergence of new adsorption sites in 2.5Ru5Ni or modulated electronic structure of Ru/Ni species after alloying, leading to a distinctive interaction with carbon monoxide. With previous evidence strongly hinting to the formation of alloyed RuNi phases, operando characterization for the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst revealed the dynamics of alloy formation and its stability under operation. Normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra for the Ru K-edge (Fig. 3c) demonstrated progressive reduction until reaching a stable metallic character after 0.5 h, as revealed by the lower whiteline intensity and the pre-edge shift to lower energies. Results for the Ni K-edge (Supplementary Fig. 24) mimicked this behavior, disclosing Ni in a mainly metallic but partially oxidized form, which seems to be favored by the strong interaction with TiO2. The time evolution of the Fourier transform extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for the Ru K-edge (Fig. 3d) reveals that alloy formation starts during the temperature ramp (transition from Fresh to 0.0 h) and continues for the first 0.5 h of the reaction (from 0.0 h to 0.5 h), as suggested by the Ru-Ni contribution at ca. After this, the alloying process is completed, and the signal remains stable. XANES and EXAFS analysis for the 2.5Ru catalyst displayed only the reduction of the initial oxide phase without the peak at ca. 2 Angstrom, confirming this interpretation (Supplementary Fig. Complementary results obtained by operando synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD, Fig. 26) indicated the restructuring and alloy formation within the same period through the gradual shift of Ru reflections over time, also suggesting restructuring into slightly larger nanoparticles or with higher crystallinity prior to the reaction. Statistical analysis of microscopy images of the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst before and after the reaction exhibited a shift from 3 to 4 nm as the average particle size (Supplementary Fig. These results highlight the value of adapting advanced characterization techniques readily explored in other thermocatalytic reactions to the more experimentally challenging three-phase hydrogenolysis of polyolefin waste. Complementary analyses for 2.5RuYNi catalysts after reaction added a deeper understanding of their chemical environment (Supplementary Figs. XANES spectra of monometallic and bimetallic catalysts confirmed their predominant metallic character with some minor contribution from oxidic phases (Supplementary Fig. EXAFS spectra at the Ni and Ru K-edge for monometallic systems were consistent with a coordination number (CN) of 9.5 for Ni−Ni in the 5Ni catalyst, and 3.5 for Ru−Ru in the 2.5Ru catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 29 and Supplementary Table 12), coherent with the presence of metallic species68. The spectra from 2.5RuYNi catalysts showed the consistent presence of a peak at ca. 2.2 Å (Ni-Ru) in the Ni K-edge with CNNi−Ru = 1.1 and a peak at ca. 1.9 Å (Ru-Ni) in the Ru K-edge with CNRu−Ni = 2.1, suggesting the formation of alloys (Supplementary Fig. However, these low values indicate a limited Ru-Ni interaction, leading to alloys in the form of clusters or small nanoparticles rather than by dissolution of one phase into the other. The CNRu−Ni increased with the Ni content, suggesting a larger population of Ru alloying with Ni. Taking CNRu−Ni as a proxy for the abundance of alloyed sites, we could correlate liquid yield and CNRu−Ni (Supplementary Fig. 30), revealing that increasing CNRu−Ni leads to higher liquid yields. The decreasing trend observed for 2.5Ru10Ni may be attributed to the presence of poorly active Ni nanoparticles that interfere with the exposure of active Ru sites, as revealed by the emergence of Ni-Ni bonds (Supplementary Table 12). This correlation supports the catalytic role of alloyed sites. Herein, we explore temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) simulations to probe the cleavage of C–C bonds over monometallic and bimetallic catalysts, aiming to rationalize their distinct catalytic behavior. Heptane is used as a surrogate for HDPE to compare scission of terminal C–C bonds (yielding C1 + C6) and internal ones (yielding C3 + C4 or C2 + C5). As heptane and HDPE possess distinct physical properties, these results may not fully represent the initial stages of the reaction. Nevertheless, heptane is one of the HDPE hydrogenolysis products, allowing these experiments to provide an understanding of the latest stages of the reaction and possible reasons for the different selectivity obtained from Ru and RuNi systems. TPSR experiments consisted of saturating the catalyst surface with heptane and dosing hydrogen while a temperature ramp was applied (more details in the Methods section). Product formation was continuously monitored by mass spectrometry, with the results displayed in Fig. For the 2.5Ru system, such an approach provided an onset temperature of 383 K for methane formation, while no evolution of propane as a proxy for multicarbon products could be observed to any appreciable extent. This result suggests the intrinsic tendency of monometallic Ru catalysts to promote terminal cleavage, in line with product distributions obtained from HDPE (Fig. TPSR experiments over 5Ni yielded a parallel evolution of methane and propane starting at higher temperatures (onset 505 K). These insights are also aligned with the lower activity and larger selectivity to liquid products from HDPE (Supplementary Table 3). In contrast to the monometallic systems, 2.5Ru5Ni promoted the early evolution of propane (onset 393 K) over methane (onset 450 K), with other XRuYNi catalysts also featuring this behavior (Supplementary Fig. A control experiment over a physical mixture of 2.5Ru and 5Ni showed results similar to 2.5Ru, confirming the unique behavior of bimetallic catalysts (Supplementary Fig. This experimental indication of a distinctive mechanistic pathway over XRuYNi prompted the exploration of alloyed phases using density functional theory (DFT, PBE + D2) to assess reaction paths associated with C–C and C–H cleavage of heptane. Temperature programmed surface reaction of heptane as surrogate for HDPE on (a) 2.5Ru, (b) 2.5Ru5Ni, and (c) 5Ni after hydrogenolysis of HDPE100 with signals corresponding to methane (m/z 16), propane (m/z 44) and hydrogen (m/z 2). Dashed lines indicate onset temperatures. Reaction paths computed via DFT for the cleavage of heptane on (d) Ru, (e) RuNi, and (f) Ni models. Schematic energy profiles are shown for the key steps. Steps with reaction energies ΔE ≤ – 0.3 eV are marked in green (exothermic), steps with 0.3 eV > ΔE > – 0.3 eV are depicted in black (thermoneutral), and steps with ΔE ≥ 0.3 eV or high activation energies Ea ≥ 1.6 eV are marked in gray (blocked). Dashed circles indicate species from which hydrogenation into final products occurs. Additional information is provided in Supplementary Figs. Ru: blue, Ni: brown. Based on microscopy characterization and the lack of discernible reflections in XRD analyses (Supplementary Figs. 6, 20, 22), we employed models of defective surfaces including steps and kinks of the Ni(211) termination and defective Ru and RuNi(0001) (Supplementary Figs. 33, 34) to assess reaction paths associated with C–C and C–H cleavage of heptane (Fig. 4d–f, detailed mechanisms and analysis on other surfaces in Supplementary Figs. These defective structures may be transient and thus challenging to identify via experimental characterization techniques, with previous theoretical studies already pointing to their formation under reaction conditions comparable to those found in this reaction69,70,71,72. C–C cleavage on flat or stepped pristine Ru, RuNi, and Ni surfaces was found to be less favored than on defective sites (Supplementary Tables 13, 14). A common feature of all studied defective surfaces is the favored dehydrogenation of heptane over the C–C cleavage due to smaller activation energies (Ea) for C–H breaking. From the thermodynamic standpoint, the reaction energy (ΔE) for C–H bond cleavage and formation lies between − 0.28 and 0.28 eV for the three models Supplementary Fig. This suggests that heptane molecules can readily undergo fast and multiple dehydrogenation and hydrogenation cycles under reaction conditions. Another commonality among surfaces is the favored cleavage of terminal C–C bonds over the internal scission prior to heptane dehydrogenation. However, when considering the formation of an allyl group by two concomitant dehydrogenations of C7 leading to C7**, the internal C–C scission into C3** + C4 is favored over the terminal C–C cleavage of C7 (C1 + C6) on Ni and particularly on RuNi. In turn, the internal C–C scission is favored on RuNi over Ni, which is in line with TPSR results disclosing that the formation of propane occurs at lower temperatures (Fig. Once the C3** and C4 fragments are formed, C4 is dehydrogenated and C3** is hydrogenated to carry out further C–C cleavages, eventually leading to the formation of C1 products. In contrast, the formation of C3** is unfavorable on Ru due to its high activation energy (Ea = 2.29 eV, Supplementary Fig. Therefore, the preferential cleavage of internal C–C bonds observed in the RuNi and Ni (to a lesser extent) systems is attributed to the stabilization of allyl groups. This mechanism encompassing allylic intermediates may have been elusive in previous mechanistic studies due to the use of shorter reactant surrogates51. Thus, there is a need to revise mechanisms previously proposed for alloys and Ni-containing systems have relied on experimental observations, reaxFF molecular dynamics simulations, or stochastic modeling without providing atomic-level insights (Supplementary Table 15)49,54,60,73,74,75,76. Overall, our model describes how the Ru system performs heptane hydrogenation and dehydrogenation, followed by successive terminal C–C scissions of C7 and saturated C7-n fragments. These terminal cleavages are favored over any of the internal scission pathways. On the other hand, Ni-containing systems, and particularly the RuNi model, promote the internal C-C scission of heptane via the formation of allyl groups, which can be further cleaved and hydrogenated to form C1 products. Alternative models of RuNi systems exhibit behaviors reminiscent of Ru and Ni (Supplementary Fig. 36), which point to tight structure-performance relationships, in line with the experimental results (Figs. In a previously-reported screening of metal oxides for hydrogenolysis of polypropylene, titania showed the most marked synergistic effect with Ru, hinting to the possibility of strong metal support interactions (SMSI) besides the promotional effect of Ni33. The electron transfer from TiO2 to the Ru phase has been identified as a likely factor for enhanced selectivity to liquid products in low-density polyethylene hydrogenolysis, though operando characterization would be required to confirm this effect77,78. Additional simulations investigated the structural consequences of SMSI between metals and titania, leading to partial coverage of the Ru surface in view of the semicrystalline phase observed on some regions of the catalyst (Fig. Our results disclosed an adsorption energy (Eads) of heptane on the anatase TiO2 support used (Eads = – 0.68 eV) which is comparable to its adsorption on metallic Ru, RuNi and Ni surfaces (Eads = − 0.81 to − 0.88 eV). However, the active sites for heptane hydrogenolysis are located on the metal nanoparticles since both internal and terminal C–C cleavage are endothermic on anatase TiO2. These results suggest that TiO2 could facilitate hydrocarbon adsorption and thus promote cleavage on the metallic sites if the Ru-TiO2 interface is preserved. In this regard, adsorption of reactants could stabilize the titania phase and hinder its migration onto the Ru surface, hindering the formation of SMSI architectures. Previous analysis has focused on how catalyst structure influences C–C cleavage mechanisms in order to explain the differences in hydrogenolysis behavior. Nevertheless, the nature of the HDPE and the presence of additives may play a key role in influencing performance. Different results were observed in Fig. 1d for hydrogenolysis of HDPE100, HDPE200 and caps over the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst, showing that the processing of caps was most challenging. In contrast to virgin HDPE100 and HDPE200 polymer pellets, the plastics used in consumer goods also contain additives (e.g., colorants, stabilizers, flame retardants, plasticizers or slip agents for processing, among others). The exact composition of these materials is generally a trade secret, including additives among several thousands of reported compounds79. Hence, a preliminary study was performed using HDPE caps of different colors to explore the influence of additives (Supplementary Table 9). Clear caps showed the highest activity and liquid yield (66% yield to C1-C45, with 42% to C6-C45) over the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst. Other colors displayed variable performance, with conversion to C1-C45 between 24% and 57% and more modest liquid yields ( < 10%). Similar trends were observed over the 2.5Ru catalyst (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 9), suggesting that the performance variations originate from the different additives. These results highlight the importance of developing catalysts with enhanced robustness toward the diverse compositions of consumer-grade plastics. DFT simulations were used to provide a first assessment of the interaction between additives and the catalyst surfaces. Herein, we evaluated the interaction of long-chain amides often added to bottle caps as slip agents80. When considering the adsorption of a surrogate molecule (butyramide) on defective surfaces of Ru, RuNi, and Ni, butyramide binds more strongly to the active sites than heptane (Supplementary Table 16). This indicates that the presence of such additives may have a profound effect on catalyst performance for hydrogenolysis reactions due to active site poisoning or preferential reaction, potentially leading to byproducts such as ammonia that could interact with the catalyst surface41. The selectivity control achieved toward liquid products on XRuYNi catalysts led to a detailed analysis of a potential plant for processing 20 t h−1 of plastic caps using green hydrogen. Environmental and economic assessments were based on the plant layout in Fig. 5a, which includes catalyst regeneration and product separation to reach the product distribution obtained with 2.5Ru5Ni (Fig. 37 for a version with labeled unit operations according to the detailed description provided in the Methods section). Green hydrogen from water electrolysis powered by either off-shore wind or solar power was chosen as a case study, together with the fossil case based on steam methane reforming. The reference business-as-usual (BAU) equivalent consists of a multi-product system which accounts for the fossil-based production of the respective hydrocarbon products as well as the production and end-of-life of HDPE plastic caps. a Process flow sheet for recycling 20 t h−1 of plastic bottle caps via hydrogenolysis, including downstream catalyst recycle and product separation. b Global warming potential (GWP) for different sources of hydrogen, i.e., fossil hydrogen from steam methane reforming (fossil) and green hydrogen from water splitting produced in a proton-exchange membrane electrolyzer powered by either off-shore wind power or solar photovoltaic panels. The business-as-usual scenario (BAU) represents the case where caps are produced via the conventional route and incineration is applied as end-of-life treatment, whilst gas and liquid hydrocarbons are separately obtained from oil. c Sankey diagrams for the main contributions to the three scenarios displayed in (b), where the current mixed geographical origin of HDPE is considered. The diagrams illustrate the contribution of processes embedded in the supply chain of the three scenarios (cradle-to-gate), with background data from Ecoinvent 3.891 considering the geography “Global”. Only streams exceeding 5% are represented. d Production cost of the process described in a against the market price of the respective product portfolio. The margin between the total cost and market price indicates the potential profit. FOC = fixed operating costs, CAPEX = capital expenditures, RoW = rest of the world. Breakdowns are available in Supplementary Tables 17–22. Producing liquid fuels via HDPE hydrogenolysis implies that fossil carbon contained in polymers serves two sequential functions (i.e., virgin plastics and liquid fuels). Compared to the BAU case, which requires fossil carbon to satisfy both markets in parallel, the studied system deploys less fossil feedstock at the production level and embeds less overall end-of-life emissions. Extending the lifetime of the waste polymer via hydrogenolysis delays the carbon release to the atmosphere, thus implying a lower global warming potential (GWP) in a cradle-to-grave scope (Fig. The computation of the GWP for the three cases (fossil, wind, solar) revealed that the fossil hydrogen scenario almost matched the impact of the BAU, while renewable options are more advantageous, with wind yielding ca. 17% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Fig. In all cases, the larger contributors to carbon footprint were the conventional production of ethylene (67–75%), required for HDPE synthesis and based on naphtha steam cracking, followed by catalyst manufacturing (ca. 22%) due to mining and extraction as represented by Sankey diagrams in Fig. 5c and in Supplementary Fig. 38 for the case of BAU (see Supplementary Table 18 for a detailed breakdown). Hydrogen accounted for a reduced share of the carbon footprint, ranging from 11% (fossil) to 2% (wind). Interestingly, the corresponding techno-economic assessments providing total annualized cost of production (TAC, Fig. 5d and Supplementary Tables 19–22) predicted a favorable outcome from the fossil-free alternatives if products are sold at market price, with expected margin for profit ranging from 0.2 to 0.5 $ per kilogram of product (equivalent to 15–25% over the market price, where the composition of one kilogram of product would reflect the C1-C45 fractions obtained from the hydrogenolysis process). We noticed that, in contrast to other sustainable reactions burdened by the high fractional cost of green hydrogen13,14,15,81,82,83, green hydrogen accounted for less than 30% of the total cost for the solar and wind options. Instead, the collection and processing of plastic caps was the major cost contributor (waste HDPE is a trading commodity in Europe, hence the elevated price). This result points to the economic suitability of hydrogenolysis and the use of renewablegreen hydrogen, providing the first example of an environmentally and economically sustainable route for chemical recycling of polyolefins via hydrogenolysis. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis showed that increasing the cost of hydrogen and waste HDPE separately by 25% would still lead to a positive profit when considering the average selling price for hydrocarbons in 2019 (Supplementary Fig. Additionally, in periods of geopolitical uncertainty, the market price for hydrocarbons could undergo drastic variations—for example, the global average price of natural gas, gasoline, and diesel sharply increased in 2022 as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict—which could lead to even larger profits for the chemical recycling case, even when all OPEX parameters are set at their upper bound (Supplementary Fig. Similar sensitivity analysis for the GWP followed the same trend, predicting environmental gains under almost all possible scenarios (Supplementary Fig. Nonetheless, LCA and TEA have limitations that stem from assumptions and modeling choices. As the catalyst material greatly impacts both the hydrogenolysis cost and GWP, identifying more durable catalysts with low deactivation rates is essential for making hydrocarbon production even more sustainable and economically viable (Supplementary Table 27). The confirmed sustainability of HDPE waste hydrogenolysis for this product distribution leaves the question of which other product portfolios would also enable environmental and economic sustainability, raising the Plastic-to-X question. We tackled this challenge by assessing the GWP and economic margin for a series of 19 randomly generated product distributions, taking the BAU as reference system (Supplementary Table 28). To mimic the series character of this reaction, the distributions followed a lognormal form when gaseous products were more abundant, and a Gaussian distribution when liquid products were predominant (examples in Fig. The set of distributions were selected to span a variety of average chain lengths since this parameter later served as a descriptor for identifying main trends. The GWP and economic margin results can be found in Fig. 6b–d for the three considered sources of hydrogen (numerical values in Supplementary Tables 29–31). Since hydrogen consumption increases as the average chain length of the products decreases, an inverse relation between GWP and chain length was to be expected, as reflected in Fig. Calculations show that hydrogenolysis using wind hydrogen always displays environmental gains versus BAU, whereas solar hydrogen requires an estimated minimum chain length of C5 to this end, a threshold that rises to C10 for fossil hydrogen. a Examples of randomly generated product distributions based on lognormal (top) and Gaussian (bottom) distributions with indication of their average chain lengths (Supplementary Table 28 for all distributions). Evaluation of hydrogenolysis of plastic caps using hydrogen with either (b) fossil, c wind, or (d) solar origin, showing the gain in GWP compared to the equivalent BAU process (squares) and the margin for profit (circles) per kilogram of total C1–C45 products versus the average chain length of the randomly generated product distributions (see details in the Methods section). The primary y-axis (left-hand side) quantifies the GWP gains obtained by switching from BAU operation to the hydrogenolysis process that generates the same product portfolio. A positive gain indicates that we reduce the GWP of end-products relative to their BAU respective. The secondary y-axis (right-hand side) indicates the margin for profit obtained with the respective process. This unit quantifies the difference between the revenues obtained by selling the different products at market price and the cost of production. Negative values indicate that the cost of production is higher than the achievable revenues, while a positive margin translates to the potential profit obtained through the corresponding process. Minimum average chain lengths to achieve positive GWP gains and profit are indicated. For example, in the case of solar hydrogen, both environmental and economic feasibilities are achieved for chains longer than C11. Breakdowns are available in Supplementary Tables 29–31. The economic analysis disclosed higher breakeven average chain lengths than for the GWP evaluations, with a consistent threshold of C10-C11 across wind, solar and fossil options. Since sustainability encompasses both environmental and economic dimensions, we can thus provide a first guideline describing how hydrogenolysis of HDPE requires average chain lengths at least in the upper range of the gasoline fraction (C6-C12), regardless of the type of hydrogen used. A more detailed analysis of Fig. 6b–d shows a strong dependence on the average chain length at small values due to the sharp increase in market price from low-value gases (C1-C5) to light and heavy liquid fractions (Supplementary Table 19). This also leads to the plateau in GWP gains and economic margin observed at large average chain lengths, where the motor oil fraction contribution dominates. Overall, these results can guide catalyst design and reaction engineering efforts by establishing performance targets. In this study, we perform an integrated investigation encompassing catalyst design and systems engineering for the hydrogenolysis of realistic HDPE waste. We first impart selectivity control by developing alloyed RuNi nanoparticles (3-4 nm on average) supported on titania, yielding up to 55% liquid yields, compared to null for monometallic Ru, and with 2.5 wt% Ru and 5 wt% Ni as optimal composition. Operando studies disclosed the formation dynamics of Ru-Ni alloys upon exposure to operating conditions, highlighting the need to incorporate advanced characterization techniques used inother fields in thermocatalysis to chemical recycling of plastics. Experimental and simulation efforts disclosed performance-structure sensitivity in these bimetallic catalysts and their intrinsic ability to promote internal (based on allylic intermediates) vs. terminal C–C bond cleavage through a mediating dehydrogenation-hydrogenation cycle. When bridging these insights with environmental and techno-economic analyses, the sustainability of this technology for processing plastic caps using green hydrogen emerged. Furthermore, the contextualization into the Plastic-to-X framework revealed that product distributions with an average chain length in the upper range of the gasoline fraction (C6-C12) or larger allow uniting environmental and economic feasibility. This work highlights the sustainability potential of polyolefin hydrogenolysis and represents a guideline for future catalyst design efforts. Commercially available titanium oxide (anatase, Sigma Aldrich) was calcined in static air (5 h, 773 K, 5 K min−1) prior to its use as support during the synthesis. All catalysts were prepared by dry impregnation and sieved to < 0.2 mm particle size before use. For the monometallic Ni and Ru catalysts, only one supported metal is stated when referring to the catalyst. Bimetallic catalysts are denoted as XRuYNi, XRuYNiinv, or XRuYNiFSP depending on the method used for preparation (Supplementary Fig. The content of each metal is reported in front of the respective metal as a percentage by mass (X wt% Ru and Y wt% Ni). In a typical procedure, 0.500 g of titania was dry impregnated with 0.855 cm3 ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate (Ru(NO)(NO3)x(OH)y, x + y = 3) in diluted HNO3 (0.015 g cm−3, Sigma Aldrich) to obtain 2.5 wt% ruthenium content. The mixture was stirred (353 K, air) with a magnetic stirring bar to evaporate the solvent. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (1 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1). Nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in distilled water to prepare a 0.5 g cm−3 precursor solution (0.1 g cm−3 Ni concentration). Typically, 0.500 g of titania was dry impregnated with 0.153 cm3 (3 wt% Ni), 0.261 cm3 (5 wt% Ni) or 0.550 cm3 (10 wt% Ni) precursor solution to obtain the desired metal content. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (3 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1) and subsequently reduced under flowing hydrogen (5% hydrogen in argon, 3 h, 723 K, 5 K min−1). 0.500 g of the monometallic Ni catalyst was dry impregnated with 0.855 cm3 ruthenium nitrosyl nitrate (Ru(NO)(NO3)x(OH)y, x + y = 3) in diluted HNO3 (0.015 g cm−3, Sigma Aldrich) to obtain 2.5 wt% ruthenium content. The mixture was stirred (353 K, air) with a magnetic stirring bar to evaporate the solvent. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (1 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1). Typically, 0.500 g of the monometallic Ru catalyst was dry impregnated with 0.153 cm3 (3 wt% Ni), 0.261 cm3 (5 wt% Ni) or 0.550 cm3 (10 wt% Ni) precursor solution to obtain the desired metal content. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (12 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in flowing nitrogen (1 h, 573 K, 5 K min−1). 2.5Ru5NiFSP with nominal Ru and Ni contents of 2.5 wt% and 5 wt% was prepared by flame spray pyrolysis by pumping the mixture of precursors in the desired molar ratios for Ru (Ru(III)acetylacetonate, ABCR, 99%), Ni (Ni(II) 2-ethylhexanoate, STREM Chemicals), and TiOx (2-ethylhexanoate, ABCR, 6.4 wt% Ti) through a 0.4 mm needle at a flow rate of 6.0 cm3 min−1 and nebulized by a 6.0 L min−1 flow of oxygen at 1.5 bar. The mist was ignited by a supporting flame generated using 2.4 L min−1 of oxygen and 1.2 L min−1 of methane. Such particle-generating flames reach average flame temperatures of 2500–3000 K, with very fast cooling rates (ca. The resulting mixed-metal oxidic nanoparticles were collected on a glass fiber filter (GF/A-6) and used without further treatment. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy was carried out on a double-corrected microscope JEM-ARM300F (GrandARM, JEOL) operated at an acceleration potential of 300 kV (electron gun: cold-field emitter; ΔE ≈ 0.35 eV). In addition, HAADF-STEM and EDX analyses were also conducted using an FEI Titan Themis transmission electron microscope, equipped with a probe aberration corrector and a SuperX EDX system, operated at 300 kV. Catalyst powder was dispersed in ethanol onto a perforated carbon foil supported on a copper TEM grid. Nitrogen physisorption at 77 K was carried out using a Micromeritics TriStar II analyzer. Prior to the measurements, samples of ca. 0.1 g were degassed at 473 K under vacuum (10 Pa) for 12 h. The specific surface area (SBET) was estimated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, while the total pore volume (Vpore) was obtained at a relative pressure p/p0 = 0.98. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy was performed on a Rigaku ZSX Primus IV spectrometer equipped with a 4 kW Rh source and LiF (200), Ge, PET, and RX26 analyzing crystal detectors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted using a Rigaku SmartLab diffractometer with a D/teX Ultra 250 detector using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm) and operating in the Bragg-Brentano geometry. Data was acquired in the 20–80° 2θ range with an angular step size of 0.025° and a counting time of 1.5 s per step. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Horiba: LabRAM HR Evolution UV-VIS-NIR confocal Raman system comprising a 325 nm HeCd laser with 2.5 mW power, a 40 × objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.95 (Nikon PlanApo), and a fiber-coupled grating spectrometer (1800 lines per mm). Spectra were collected in a single run with 60 s acquisition time. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted with a Physical Electronics Quantera SXM spectrometer. Monochromatic Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) generated by an electron beam (15 kV and 49.3 W) was used to irradiate the samples with a spot size of 200 μm. The finely ground samples were pressed into indium foil (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and then mounted onto the holder. During the measurement, electron and ion neutralizers were operated simultaneously to suppress undesired sample charging. High-resolution spectra were obtained by using pass energies of 55 eV while the C 1 s signal at 284.8 eV was used for calibration. CasaXPS (Casa Software Ltd.) was used for all calculations, and relative sensitivity factors used for quantification were taken from the instrument. All spectra were deconvoluted into Gaussian-Lorentzian components with the application of the Shirley background. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was conducted at the Swiss-Norwegian beamlines (SNBL, BM31) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The X-ray beam was collimated using a double-crystal liquid nitrogen-cooled Si(111) monochromator84. A transmission geometry configuration was used for the analysis under ex situ conditions, using a one-element Si SDD detector with Peltier cooling. For the absolute energy calibration for XAS measurements, metallic Ni and Ru foils were measured. Finely ground samples were mixed with cellulose binder, pressed into a pellet, and then mounted onto the holder. Scanning was performed for both Ni (between 8230 and 9320 eV) and Ru edges (between 22020 and 23100 eV), and the step size was set to 0.5 eV, with a scan duration of 150 s. The beam size was set to 3 × 0.2 mm (horizontal × vertical). The resulting spectra were energy calibrated, background corrected, and normalized using the Athena program from the Demeter software suite85. k2-weighted extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were fitted in the optimal k- and R-windows using the Artemis program. An amplitude reduction factor (S02) of 0.81 and 0.85 were determined for Ni and Ru, respectively, using Ni, NiO, Ru, and RuO2 foils. Operando XAS and XRD experiments were performed at the same beam station, following this procedure: (i) the catalyst was mixed with HDPE100 in a 1:1 mass ratio and loaded in the quartz capillary with diameter of 1.5 mm, (ii) the sample was placed on the sample holder and flushed with pure H2 and pressurized to 20 bar, (iii) measurements were performed at room temperature (RT) for the fresh catalyst, (iv) heated to 523 K with 5 K min−1 and maintained for 2 h, (v) the system was naturally cooled down to RT and measurements were performed for the used catalyst. XRD data were collected with a Pilatus3 X CdTe 2 M low background detector using a LaB6(111) channel-cut monochromator, set at a wavelength of 0.319162 Å (ca. Averaging procedures and azimuthal integration were performed with the pyFAI software using NIST LaB6 powder as a standard. XRD data were averaged over 60 s. Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) measurements were conducted with a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. Signals were acquired with pre-equipped thermal conductivity detectors and an attached Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320 O mass spectrometer with Quadera software. Prior to measurements, samples of ca. 70 mg were saturated with 0.5 mL n-C7H16 and dried (293 K, 3 h, air) to remove weakly adsorbed heptane. In the subsequent surface reaction experiment, diluted hydrogen gas (5 vol% hydrogen in nitrogen) was dosed by a set of Bronkhorst digital mass flow controllers while applying a heating ramp (313 K to 1073 K, 10 K min−1). The effluent stream of the instrument was monitored online via the Quadera software to analyze the evolution of the reactants (H2 and n-C7H16) and C1-C7 products. Diffuse reflectance infrared fourier transform spectroscopy upon CO adsorption (CO-DRIFTS) was performed using a Bruker Invenio S Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The as-prepared catalyst (ca. 15 mg) was first dried in the cell and purged with He (20 cm3 min−1) for 0.5 h at 473 K to remove impurities. After cooling down to room temperature, the sample was exposed to CO (10% CO in He) for 1 h to achieve a CO-saturated surface. The sample was then flushed with He for 1 h to remove all remaining gas phase and physiosorbed CO. Spectra were continuously monitored and collected every 0.5 min. The catalysts were tested in a parallel pressurized batch reactor set−up (BuchiGlasUster, Switzerland) consisting of three 50 cm3 stainless steel reactors (Supplementary Fig. Each reactor was equipped with an electrical heating jacket, active cooling unit (chilled water system), mechanical stirring, temperature/pressure control systems and gas sampling lines (connected to pure hydrogen and nitrogen). Typically, 0.5 g of polyethylene pellets (Mw ~ 100 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.05 g of catalyst were added to a glass inset, and the combined weight was recorded. Prior to starting the experiment, the reactor was flushed with nitrogen and hydrogen before being pressurized with hydrogen to the desired pressure (20 bar, unless stated otherwise). The reaction parameters and individual steps were programmed into the SYSTAG Flexsys software before starting the experiment, and during the reaction, instantaneous measurements of the temperature, pressure and stirring torque were recorded to monitor the experimental conditions. The reaction mixture was heated and mechanically stirred for a set reaction time after having reached the set temperature (523 K, 750 rpm and 4 h, respectively, unless otherwise specified). Subsequently, the reactor was cooled to ambient temperature with circulating chilled water. For experiments involving the optimization of reaction conditions, the temperature, pressure, stirring rate and reaction time were set directly in the SYSTAG Flexsys program. Each set of conditions was tested in separate experiments. Different catalyst-to-plastic ratios were achieved by varying the amount of catalyst (0.025 g or 0.05 g) while keeping the HDPE amount constant (0.5 g). Catalyst reusability was evaluated for the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst at optimized reaction conditions. As described above, each experiment was performed with 0.5 g of polyethylene pellets (Mw ~ 100 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) and 0.05 g of catalyst. Approximately 0.03–0.04 g of catalyst could be recovered (20–40% loss) in each experiment, such that several experiments were performed to collect enough used catalyst for subsequent runs (i.e., three experiments for run 1, catalysts recovered and combined, two experiments for run 2). After reaction, the liquid and solid products remaining inside the inset were dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), sonicated (303 K, 0.5 h) and centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 rpm (4430 × g). Part of the liquid was filtered using a syringe for analysis with GC − FID, while the remaining liquid was decanted to recover the catalyst. Residual solvent was removed by vacuum drying (6 h, 353 K, 80 mbar). The catalyst was thermally treated in static air (2 h, 673 K, 5 K min−1) to restore accessibility to active sites, which had been reduced by carbon deposits and/or structural changes. The treated catalysts were sieved to < 0.2 mm particle size before use. The gaseous products were collected from the headspace of the reactor by connecting a sampling cylinder and analyzed using a gas chromatographer (HP Agilent 6890 GC) equipped with an Agilent J&W PoraPlot Q column (25 m × 0.53 mm × 20 μm) and flame ionization detector (FID) (Supplementary Fig. H2 was used as the carrier gas, and a heating ramp (308 K to 573 K, 5 K min−1) was applied while the inlet and FID were held at fixed temperatures of 573 K and 473 K, respectively. GC − FID calibration for C1 to C5 products was performed using a standard refinery mixture bottle (Agilent P/N: 5080–8755, Agilent Technologies Inc.) and following a procedure reported elsewhere86. Typically, the mixture bottle was connected to the GC inlet, and the line was flushed for two minutes to remove any residual gases. The sample was analyzed three independent times using the same GC method, and the response factors of each gas were calculated based on their concentrations and the corresponding peak areas in the FID chromatogram. After each experiment, the glass inset was removed from the reactor and weighed to determine the total amount of gas formed (mgas). Equation (1) gives the yield of each gas (Ci), where Ai is the GC − FID peak integration of a paraffin with i carbon atoms and m0 is the initial mass of plastic used in the reaction. Yields are reported for methane (C1) and other gases (C2-C5). The liquid and solid products remaining inside the inset were dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), sonicated (303 K, 30 min) and filtered using a syringe before analysis with GC − FID. Samples were analyzed in an HP Agilent 6890 GC (Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) equipped with an HP DB-5 HT column (15 m × 0.25 mm × 0.10 μm). A 1 μL aliquot of the sample was injected and a heating ramp was applied (313 K to 648 K, 4 K min−1), while the FID was held at a fixed temperature of 613 K. Initial and final hold times were set at 2 and 10 min, respectively. GC − FID calibration was performed using a certified reference mixture of C7 − C40 n-alkanes in hexane (1 mg cm−3, Sigma-Aldrich) and extrapolated up to C45 owing to the similar response factor of C25-C40 compounds in the motor oil range87. A blank run using only dichloromethane (DCM) was performed prior to each measurement to clean the column. The baseline shift observed in the second half of the program is attributed to the column bleed Supplementary Fig. The liquid yields were quantified using MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA). The baseline was found to be approximated well by the msbackadj function, tightly following the baseline of the measurement. A baseline fit was performed for each measurement due to the instrumental drift. For product quantification, the baseline function was subtracted from the signal, and trapezoidal integration was performed on the resulting signal. Calculations were performed on a mass basis, such that Eq. (2) gives the yield of a certain liquid fraction (Ci-Cj) for paraffins with i-j carbon atoms, where Ai-j is the peak integration area across the i-j range, RFi-j is the corresponding response factor, VDCM is the solvent volume used for dilution (50 mL), and m0 is the initial mass of plastic used in the reaction (500 mg). Equation (2) quantified yields for C6-C12, C13-C20 and C21-C45 products (Supplementary Fig. Separate areas were obtained across the time ranges [1.45, 14.7], [14.7, 33.7] and [33.7, 80] (in minutes) to consider the gasoline, diesel and motor oil contributions, respectively. Response factors of 0.2796, 0.2186 and 0.1174 mg mL–1 area–1 were used for gasoline, diesel and motor oil, respectively. Remaining C46+ hydrocarbons and solid products could not be characterized quantitatively through GC − FID due to the maximum temperature settings on the column and were thus considered as solid residue, as shown in Eq. This includes long-chain waxes as well as (unreacted) polyethylene. Overall, conversion refers to the yield of products in the C1–C45 range and selectivity refers to the fraction of each product within the C1-C45 range, always relative to the starting amount of polyethylene used in the reaction. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations were performed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP 5.4.4). The density functional of choice was Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE)90 supplemented with Grimme's D2 dispersion approach and our reparametrized values for metals91,92. Valence electrons were described with planewaves with a kinetic cut-off energy of 450 eV, while inner electrons were represented with projector augmented-wave (PAW) core potentials93,94. We used the Monkhorst-Pack method to generate a \(\Gamma\)-centered mesh with a reciprocal grid size narrower than 0.041 Å−1 to sample the Brillouin Zone95. Spin polarization was included in all simulations involving Ni due to the magnetic character of this element. Inpust and outputs for all DFT simulations can be found online in the ioChem-BD repository (Data Availability section)96,97. Lattice parameters for different bulk models of Ni, Ru, and RuNi materials were optimized with a kinetic energy cut-off of 800 eV. The energy required for a Ni atom to change from face-centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structures is 0.03 eV per atom, while Ru requires 0.12 eV per atom for the reverse transformation. This suggests that Ni may adopt a hcp structure when alloyed with Ru. We used a RuNi bulk from the hexagonal crystal system and space group 187 according to the Materials Project database98. Based on the optimized bulk materials Ni-fcc, Ru-hcp, and RuNi, different slab models were built to represent the catalysts under study (Supplementary Figs. 33, 34) containing steps and kinks due to the small size of the metal nanoparticles (Fig. We employed a p(2 × 6) slab with 18 atomic layers of the Ni(211) facet and p(6 × 6) slabs with 6 atomic layers of the (0001) surfaces of Ru and RuNi (considering both Ni- and Ru-terminated models, as shown by RuNi, RuNi-b, RuNi-c, and RuNi-d). Half of the atomic layers (the outermost ones) were allowed to relax, while the bottommost layers were fixed to their bulk positions. Moreover, a vacuum region of 15 Å was added between slabs and a dipole correction along the z axes was included100. In the case of Ru and RuNi models, only half of the atoms in the outermost layer of the (0001) termination were included to represent a stepped surface. These models were employed to assess key steps for the hydrogenolysis of heptane as a surrogate for HDPE, as displayed in TPSR experiments (Fig. The heptane molecule in the gas phase and clean surfaces were used as thermodynamic sinks. The climbing image nudged-elastic band (CI-NEB)101 was employed to locate the transition states, and their nature was confirmed by computing numerical frequencies with a step size of ± 0.015 Å. HDPE hydrogenolysis was assessed based on real experimental data on conversion and selectivity of the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst. Aspen Plus v12 was used with the PENG-ROB property method, which deploys the Peng-Robinson cubic equation of state and is suitable for non- or mildly polar mixtures containing hydrocarbons and light gases102. Bottle caps were modeled as a polyolefin mimicking consumer-grade polymers with a molecular weight of 200 kDa and an average input flow of 20 t h−1, following assumptions by Salah et al.103. The process flowsheet is included in Fig. 5a of the main text and Supplementary Fig. 37 and considers current experimental results for conversion and selectivity and detailed downstream separation blocks. A 5% catalyst loss was assumed after ten consecutive runs. HDPE (25 °C, 1.013 bar) and hydrogen (40 °C, 20 bar) are fed to the process in stoichiometric amounts before being mixed (M1) and heated to reaction conditions (250 °C) in H1. The reactor (R1) was modeled with the RStoic reactor block. It operates at 250 °C and 20 bar, with the 2.5Ru5Ni catalyst enabling the conversion and selectivity described in Supplementary Table 3 for the same conditions. The outlet stream is cooled down to 40 °C (C1) and depressurized to 1.013 bar (V1) before passing through a filter in the presence of n-hexane to regenerate the catalyst, which is recycled into the reactor (R1). The product mixture, which also comprises the used solvent and the unreacted raw materials, is sent to the downstream processing section of the process. To recover the liquid fraction in the filtered stream, the latter undergoes a flash separation, before being recompressed to 25 bar (via the pump P1 for the liquid stream and the compressor K1 for the vapor phase). The excess hydrogen, still present in the compressed stream, is recovered in a pressure swing adsorption unit (PSA). The remaining streams are mixed (M3) and cooled down to 40 °C (C2). The five hydrogenolysis products, i.e., methane, light gases, gasoline, diesel, and motor oil, are separated with high molar purity in six distillation columns (D1–D6), modeled with the DSTWU column model. The unconverted fraction of HDPE is recovered in the reboiler of column D6 and recycled into the reactor. The solvent used to regenerate the catalyst (n-hexane) is recovered in the condenser of column D4, recycled into the mixer M2 and then fed to the catalyst filter. Due to losses in the process, mainly in the recovery of products, a make-up of n-hexane is necessary. Heat integration was performed with Aspen Energy Analyzer v12 to design the corresponding heat exchange network integrating hot and cold process streams. To assess the economic and environmental potential of implementing hydrogenolysis of polyolefins at an industrial scale, a techno-economic and environmental assessment was carried out using the model described above. Mass and energy balance data were obtained from the corresponding simulation to calculate the cost and build the life cycle inventories (LCI). The techno-economic assessment (TEA) considered the total annualized cost (TAC) of producing the end-product portfolio and was calculated based on the cost factors and correlations in Sinnott and Towler104. The variable operating cost (VOC) includes the costs of raw materials, electricity, utilities and waste treatment operations, whilst the TAC is calculated as a function of the VOC, the fixed operating cost (FOC) and the annualized capital cost (ACC, Supplementary Table 32), as shown in Eq. The used values for parameters a, b, and n can be found in Supplementary Table 33 for each equipment type104. The ACC was computed considering a plant lifetime of 25 years and a 10% interest rate. Both the FOC and ACC were derived from the capital expenditures (CAPEX), which were calculated using cost correlations from Chapter 6 in Sinnott and Towler104. The CAPEX corresponds to the purchased equipment cost (C) multiplied by the installation factor, where the purchased equipment cost is calculated following Eq. (5) based on a sizing factor (S) and parameters (a and b) that are specific to each equipment unit. The inside battery limits cost (ISBL) is then calculated based on the purchasing cost (C) and typical installation factors for “fluids-solids” processes, according to the framework described by Sinnott and Towler104 of all plant equipment ( j = 1,…, M) following Eq. These factors account for piping ( fp = 0.6), equipment material ( fm = 1 for carbon steel and 1.3 for 304 stainless steel), equipment erection ( fer = 0.5), electrical installation ( fel = 0.2), instrumentation and control (fi = 0.3), civil engineering services ( fc = 0.3), structure and building services ( fs = 0.2), and lagging and paint services ( fl = 0.1). Here we consider that all equipment is made of carbon steel except for the reactor R1 and the PSA unit, which are made of 304 stainless steel as they involve H2. The total fixed capital cost (FCC) is then estimated from the ISBL to account for offsites (OS), design and engineering (D&E) and contingency (X) as shown in Eq. The annualized capital cost (ACC) is then calculated from the FCC and the annual capital charge ratio (ACCR), which in turn corresponds to the fraction that must be paid out each year to fully repay the capital investment cost, including principal and accumulated interest (i) over the plant lifetime (n). Both these units are calculated following Eqs. (8) and (9) below, and according to the variables described in Supplementary Table 32. Finally, the FOC is determined from the ISBL, FCC and cost of labor (CL), following the approach described by Sinnott and Towler104. It comprises expenses linked to operating labor (CL), supervision ( fsup = 0.25), salary overheads ( fso = 0.6), maintenance ( fmt = 0.05), property taxes and insurance ( fti = 0.02), rent of land ( frl = 0.02), environmental charges ( fec = 0.01), and general plant overheads (fpo = 0.65). It is calculated following Eq. The CL corresponds to four operators (three shift positions plus one operator for the solid catalyst regeneration section) with an average salary of USD 60'000 per person. All values of the TEA are expressed in USD 2022. Cost data was adapted to the selected year with the Chemical Engineering plant cost index (CEPCI) whenever not directly available. The CAPEX results are displayed in Supplementary Table 34 and the cost parameters used in the VOC are displayed in Supplementary Table 35. The global warming potential (GWP) of the different scenarios was calculated with the IPCC 2021 method for climate change which accounts for greenhouse gas emissions (including hydrogen and biogenic CO2) as well as short-lived climate forces for a 100-year timespan. The calculations were carried out in Brightway v2.4.3108. The assessment aims to evaluate the life cycle impacts linked to the production, consumption and end-of-life of one kilogram of end-product obtained, in a cradle-to-grave scope. Thus, the life cycle inventories (LCI) were defined for multi-product systems that account for the production and end-of-life of HDPE as well as the production and consumption of a portfolio of petrochemicals that substitute the products of hydrogenolysis in the global market. For the hydrogenolysis scenarios, the LCIs of the different end products consider the complete life cycle of HDPE, which includes the extraction of raw materials, the HDPE production steps, use phase, waste collection and sorting, chemical recycling via hydrogenolysis, and the end-of-life of the hydrogenolysis products. The latter is direct combustion for all hydrogenolysis products, given that they are used as fuels or products that are present in combustion engines (motor oil). The business-as-usual (BAU) equivalent consists of a multi-product system which accounts for the fossil-based production of the respective hydrocarbon products, as well as the production and end-of-life of HDPE (here, it was assumed that 30% of the waste polymer is incinerated and 70% landfilled). Supplementary Tables 36–38 contain the LCI data used in the LCA calculations. The techno-economic and environmental assessments were systematically repeated for a series of hypothetical product distributions at the outlet of the hydrogenolysis reactor (R1 in Supplementary Fig. This analysis was carried out to identify possible catalysts that would enable a margin for profit while reducing the environmental burden generated by the analogous BAU system. The framework consists of five steps executed in series. First, 19 hypothetical product distributions (ten normal and nine lognormal) were randomly generated based on inferred parameters, which ensure a feasible range for the products, i.e., all distributions were truncated between C1 and C50, the means were sampled between C1 and C40, and the standard deviations could range between ±2 and ±13 carbon atoms. In the second step, the conversion data for the hypothetical catalysts was derived from the obtained histograms and plugged into the RStoic reactor (R1) iteratively before each adapted simulation was run. The columns were adjusted to still meet the product specifications while yielding different amounts of them. More precisely, the distillation columns were activated or deactivated (by-passed) considering the specific product distributions in each case (i.e., the absence of methane at the outlet of R1 implied that D1 was by-passed). All columns operated following the same specifications as in the 2.5Ru5Ni case, considering a 0.999 recovery of the corresponding light key component and a 0.001 recovery of the heavy key component in the condenser; total condensers with liquid distillates were assumed. Only active columns were considered in the CAPEX and OPEX calculations for the different cases. In the third step, the heat exchanger network for each adapted flowsheet was then derived with Aspen Energy Analyzer v12. The CAPEX, OPEX, and TAC were calculated based on the mass and energy flows, following the described TEA methodology. Finally, the LCA was performed and the results of each product distribution were compared to their analogous BAU system, which corresponds to the conventional production of the issued product portfolio (i.e., C1, C2-C5, C6-C12, C13-C20, C21-C45) in the respective amounts as obtained in the reactor that follows the hypothetical product distributions, as well as the production and end-of-life of HDPE.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Scientists See ‘Eureka' Moments in Mathematicians' Chalkboard Writings Researchers spot the “tipping point” before mathematicians' moments of discovery “I've always been super intrigued by this tension between how abstract and conceptual mathematics is, on the one hand, and then just how physical the actual activity of mathematics is,” says Tyler Marghetis, a cognitive scientist at the University of California, Merced. In a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA, Marghetis and his co-authors borrowed theoretical tools from other fields to show it's possible. Often a period of instability precedes the tipping point. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing.

The researchers recorded six mathematicians at chalkboards as they each spent about 40 minutes working on two math proofs and thinking aloud. Observers made a note each time a solver shifted attention to other parts of the board by writing, erasing or pointing at equations, diagrams, or other inscriptions. In this way, the mathematician and chalkboard together acted as what cognitive scientists would call one extended and semiobservable mind. The researchers also recorded exclamations of insight (“I see!”). It's unclear where that unpredictability originated: Either a bubbling idea led solvers to connect puzzle pieces across the board, or solvers had grown frustrated and decided to physically forage for new connections, which sparked a solution. “I think it's a fun paper,” says Santa Fe Institute physicist and mathematician Cristopher Moore, who studies complex systems and was not involved in the study. “I only wish it helped me figure out how to have more insights,” he adds with a laugh. He'd like to see the study's statistical approach combined with deep interviews “to build up a rich corpus of what mathematicians were thinking at the time.” Georgetown University psychologist Shadab Tabatabaeian, the paper's lead author, imagines a “cool application” of their method: someday computer interfaces that track mouse or eye movements might know when not to disturb someone on the brink of a breakthrough or when to toss a new idea their way.

Iron fortification can help to treat anaemia, but most current fortificants are limited by low absorption and/or poor sensory properties. Here we introduce oat protein nanofibrils (OatNF) carrying ultrasmall iron nanoparticles that are engineered to carry iron in ferrous or ferric form. In a prospective cross-over stable-isotope absorption trial in young iron-deficient women (n = 52), OatNF reduced with sodium ascorbate carried mainly ferrous iron and showed high fractional absorption with water and with polyphenol-rich food, showing 1.76- and 1.65-fold higher absorption, respectively, compared with ferrous sulfate. When sodium hydroxide was used as the reducing agent, OatNF carried mainly ferric iron, which was also well absorbed and featured good sensory properties in reactive food matrices. OatNF hybrids offer a plant-based strategy for delivering highly bioavailable iron for food fortification. The worldwide prevalence of anaemia across all age groups is 24.3% (95% uncertainty interval 23.9–24.7), affecting approximately 1.92 billion people1,2,3,4. Dietary iron deficiency is the leading cause of anaemia-related years lived with disability, with a rate of 422.4 years lived with disability (95% uncertainty interval 286.1–612.9) per 100,000 population1. To reduce anaemia, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends use of ferrous iron salts for fortification of most foods5, but most iron fortificants remain poorly effective due to low bioavailability and poor sensory performance2,3,6,7,8,9. Therefore, developing a robust technology capable to deliver highly bioavailable iron in foods without causing negative sensory effects is still highly sought after8,10,11. For example, although the WHO has set a global nutrition target to reduce anaemia prevalence by 50% among women of reproductive age (15–49 years) by 2030 (ref. 12), the global prevalence of anaemia in this group of women remains stubbornly high, at 30% (27–33%)13. Symptoms of anaemia in women include fatigue, weakness, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, pallor and headache8. The recommended daily iron intake for young women is 18 mg (ref. 14), but this high requirement is most often not met through diet alone. To address this, iron fortification of staple foods is the recommended strategy to increase iron intake among young women5,6. The WHO recommends use of ferrous iron salts for fortification of most foods, with ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) considered the gold standard due to its high bioavailability and low cost5. However, incorporating ferrous iron into many foods is challenging because it typically causes undesirable sensory changes5. Furthermore, iron added to food is often poorly absorbed because of inhibitory compounds, particularly polyphenols and phytic acid6. Low iron absorption from fortificants also results in large amounts of unabsorbed luminal iron that may provoke gut inflammation and dysbiosis15,16. Finally, high amounts of absorbed iron may generate non-transferrin-bound iron, which may be pro-oxidant and toxic. To partially address this, compounds such as sodium iron EDTA (NaFeEDTA) have been developed, offering better absorption compared with ferrous salts when used in food matrices with inhibitory compounds5. In addition, ferrous bisglycinate is an aminochelated iron fortificant with proven efficacy in specific applications such as milk, but the WHO does not recommend it for large-scale food fortification owing to its high cost and sensory issues in foods6. Thus, despite these advances, finding a method to deliver highly bioavailable iron in foods without causing negative sensory effects is still highly sought after, and remains both a major challenge and a key area of research. Here, we introduce oat protein nanofibrils (OatNF) carrying ultrasmall iron nanoparticles as a promising strategy to provide highly bioavailable iron with enhanced sensory performance in foods and beverages. We show that, when sodium ascorbate (SA) is used as a reducing agent of iron salt precursors in the presence of OatNF, subnanometre nanoparticles of ferrous iron form on the surface of the OatNF (OatNF-SA-Fe), producing hybrids with superior iron delivery features. OatNF exhibited strong iron-binding, reducing and stabilizing properties during the synthesis of OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids, resulting in exceptional ferrous iron stability. In a prospective cross-over study in iron-deficient Thai women (n = 52), we used erythrocyte incorporation of oral stable iron isotopes17 to quantify the iron absorption and bioavailability from OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids. Each iron compound provided a dose of 4 mg of elemental iron in both the water and meal conditions; this dose was selected as it is representative of typical fortification levels. The OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids were highly absorbed, with a geometric mean absorption rate of 46.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 38.9–55.0%) when administered with water, 76% higher than absorption from FeSO4, which had an absorption rate of 26.3% (95% CI 21.4–32.4%). Similarly, when administered with a polyphenol-rich meal, the iron absorption from the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids was 65% greater than from FeSO4. We infer that the combination of OatNF and SA (at a 2:1 molar ratio to iron) enhances iron absorption, probably due to their reducing and stabilizing effects, as well as the relatively high content of glutamine in the OatNF. This conclusion is further supported by experiments using NaOH-reduced hybrids (OatNF-NaOH-Fe), which, in contrast to the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids, contain high ferric iron content. In addition, the OatNF-Fe hybrids demonstrated excellent organoleptic qualities, showing minimal sensory impact when added to common foods and beverages. These findings build on our previous research, in which we first proposed the use of nanosized iron as an iron fortification strategy18 and showed that nanosized ferric phosphate is well absorbed in both mice and humans19. Yet, in those studies, iron bioavailability remained lower than that of FeSO4, and, in humans, achieved only 72% relative bioavailability to FeSO4. We also demonstrated the high bioavailability of iron nanoparticle–milk-derived protein nanofibrils in rats20 and confirmed the safety of food amyloid fibrils as nutritional ingredients through in vitro and in vivo assessments21. Although these nanofibril studies were limited to mouse models and used animal-derived proteins, they provide the foundation for the present work, in which iron bioavailability in humans reached 176% relative to FeSO4. Given the above, we believe that the plant-based OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids introduced in this work may offer a breakthrough strategy for effective delivery of highly absorbed iron in fortified foods and beverages and may contribute to the mitigation of iron deficiency and anaemia on a global scale. Initially, oat globulin (OG), the primary oat protein, was extracted from oat flake powder and then incubated to fabricate OG nanofibrils under acidic conditions (pH 2) and heat treatment22. The colloidal dispersion of OG nanofibril was subsequently mixed with iron chloride and SA, yielding a translucent dispersion of iron–nanofibril (OatNF-SA-Fe) hybrids. The illustration of monomeric OG is based on UniProt P12615. b, Cryo-electron microscopy images of oat nanofibril and OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids before and after iron nanoparticle synthesis. d, EDS elemental mapping images of the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids, showing distributions of carbon (C), oxygen (O) and iron (Fe) and the corresponding dark field (DF) HAADF-STEM image. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) images (Fig. 1a) revealed that iron nanoparticles formed and were anchored onto the surface of OG nanofibrils. This iron decoration was more evident using high-angle annular dark field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images (Fig. Numerous bright dots are visible along the oat nanofibrils, representing iron particles. These are attributed to atomic number contrast between iron and the amino acid elements in the protein nanofibrils. Given the observed diameter of 4–10 nm for the OatNF, these iron particles were estimated to be at most 1 nm or less in size. This nanoscale size is probably due to ascorbate-mediated iron chelation that prevents iron aggregation into large complexes23. Remarkably, these subnanometre particles aligned along the fibrils (Fig. The presence and distribution of iron on these nanoparticles are further validated by elemental mapping using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis (Fig. To prove the role of SA–Fe chelation in forming subnanometre iron particles, we conducted a control study by mixing OatNF with FeCl3 and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Cryo-TEM and HAADF-TEM images (Supplementary Fig. 2) showed the formation of iron nanoparticles with sizes in the tens of nanometres, consistent with our previous study24. These particles were significantly larger than those in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, indicating that NaOH-reduced iron tended to aggregate into large complexes before nucleating on the OatNF surface and forming the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid. Furthermore, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also confirmed SA–iron chelation during the formation of iron particles in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid. Three complementary methodologies were used to assess this conversion across different length scales. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to determine the chemical state of OatNF-SA-Fe. Figure 2a shows the XPS Fe 2p spectrum of the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid peaking at 710 and 715 eV. Aside from Na and Cl, no other contamination was found in OatNF-SA-Fe compound (Supplementary Fig. 3a) indicating that iron is primarily present as non-oxide Fe(II) and Fe(III) species. Fitting of the Fe 2p region (Fig. 3c) revealed a remarkably high amount (~91 ± 5%) of bioavailable Fe (II) in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid. This high conversion rate is attributed to the subnanometre iron particles anchored on the OatNF surface that can be easily reduced by protein nanofibrils20. By contrast, the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid showed larger iron complexes on the fibril surface (Supplementary Fig. Fitting of the Fe 2p region (Supplementary Fig. 3d), based on peak constraints25, indicates that approximately 30–40% of the iron is present as Fe(II), with the remaining 60–70% as Fe(III), consistent with our previous study24. Multicomponent fitting was performed according to previous literature25. The Fe–O feature is clearly visible in OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid but is absent in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid. d, HAADF-TEM image of aligned iron particles on the nanofibril surface in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid. e, OatNF-SA-Fe dispersion at different concentrations of FeCl3 and SA. f, The fraction of ferrous iron in freshly prepared OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid (n = 3) and after exposure to air for 1 month (n = 2), demonstrating the stability of the ferrous state. g, Illustration of chelation, binding, reduction, stabilization and preservation of iron particles (green) on the OatNF surface. The X-ray crystallographic structure of the amyloid-forming fragment (Ala–Val–Try–Val–Phe–Asp) of oat protein reveals that surface amino acids (AAs), including aspartic acid and tyrosine, in OatNF may serve as specific sites for iron binding and reduction, respectively. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with STEM provides microscale insights into the Fe valence state in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid. The EELS spectrum at Fe L2,3 edges (Fig. 4p) displayed two peaks corresponding to L3 and L2 edges with a line separation of 13.2 eV. The Fe L3 edge exhibited two subpeaks: a main peak at 709 eV and a minor shoulder at 711 eV, corresponding to ferrous and ferric content, respectively26,27. 2d) demonstrated that rich iron complexes were well aligned along the OatNF surface, onfirming specific OatNF–iron chelation that probably facilitates the reduction of subnanometre iron complexes to a high ferrous content. The iron valence state was further investigated using a bulk colorimetric assay. Dispersions with varying SA-to-Fe ratios (Fig. 2e) appeared yellow when FeCl3 was in excess, mahogany with excess SA due to the formation of large insoluble complexes30 and translucent at an SA-to-Fe ratio of approximately 2:1. We applied colorimetric assay to measure the Fe2+/Fe3+ ratio (Supplementary Fig. 4a–e), indicating that extreme SA-to-Fe ratios resulted in low Fe2+/Fe3+ ratios due to SA–Fe chelation or SA depletion. We further investigated the ferric and ferrous content via colorimetric assay using ferrozine and ammonium thiocyanate (Supplementary Fig. 4f–o), confirming the high ferrous content in OatNF-SA-Fe dispersion. An appropriate SA concentration enables mild SA–iron chelation23 forming subnanometre iron particles that bind to OatNF. The alignment of subnanometre particles (Figs. 1b) suggests specific iron-binding sites on the OatNF surface. These sites are probably the carboxyl groups of glutamic and aspartic acids31,32, which are abundant in OG (Supplementary Fig. Subsequently these immobilized iron particles are reduced by amino acids on the nanofibril surface, including cysteine, tryptophan and especially tyrosine20, which is abundant in oat protein. Figure 2g also highlights the amyloid-forming fragments (Ala–Val–Try–Val–Phe–Asp) in oat protein, illustrating that aspartic acid facilitates iron binding and tyrosine contributes to iron reduction. This chelation–binding–reduction process achieves a 90% ferric-to-ferrous conversion. Furthermore, OatNF exhibits strong antioxidant activities, effectively stabilizing and preserving bioavailable ferrous complexes. The freeze-dried OatNF-SA-Fe retained a high ferrous content after 1 month of air exposure (Fig. 3e), demonstrating its exceptional long-term stability for practical applications in the iron fortification of foods. The safety of OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids is supported by extensive literature and recent findings. Hilty et al.18 demonstrated that nanosized iron as a food ingredient is safe, reporting no adverse effects in mice. Baumgartner et al.19 further confirmed its safety and high bioavailability in a clinical trial involving iron-deficient anaemic women. Iron–protein nanofibril hybrid materials have also been shown to be safe. Shen et al.20 provided strong evidence that iron oxide nanofibril hybrids fully dissolve during digestion, both in vitro and in vivo. Using small-angle neutron scattering with contrast matching, they showed that the iron nanoparticles completely dissolve in the stomach. Histological analysis in mice fed iron nanofibrils revealed no accumulation or uptake of intact nanoparticles—an important finding that indicates these particles do not persist in the body or pose a risk of organ toxicity. Xu et al.21 further demonstrated, through both cell culture and animal models, that protein nanofibrils are biocompatible and do not induce adverse effects. While earlier studies focused on milk- and egg-derived nanofibrils, this study uses OG nanofibrils and iron nanoparticles synthesized via a slightly modified reduction process. To address the impact of these modifications, we conducted an in vitro digestion study using the standardized INFOGEST protocol34 (Supplementary Fig. The results align with previous findings by Xu et al.21 and Shen et al.20 where oat nanofibrils were substantially degraded in the gastric phase due to pepsin hydrolysis and were completely digested during the intestinal phase, as observed by Xu et al.21. The iron nanoparticles, consistent with Shen et al.20, were fully dissolved in the stomach phase, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy. In conclusion, the cumulative evidence from prior studies18,19,20,21, together with new digestion data based on the INFOGEST protocol (Supplementary Fig. 5), supports the safety profile of both OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids. We next assessed the sensory performance of the OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids compared with several commercial compounds when added to three food and beverage matrices (water, apple juice and cow's milk yogurt 1.1% fat). To quantify their sensory impact, we first measured the colour changes induced by the various iron compounds 2 h after their addition to the three matrices. All compounds were added to the food and beverages at a fortification level of 2.5 mg Fe per 100 g of matrix. These iron compounds, although highly bioavailable, often cause colour and/or flavour changes in foods. As our ‘negative' comparators, we chose ferric pyrophosphate and ferrous bisglycinate, relatively non-reactive iron compounds used to fortify some foods that are particularly colour sensitive. When added to apple juice or plain yogurt, all compounds induced colour changes that were either below or only slightly above the method's detection limit. These changes were not visible to the naked eye. In water, by contrast, all compounds except ferric pyrophosphate, a water-insoluble inert compound, produced detectable colour changes. In this matrix, ferrous sulfate induced the most pronounced colour change, followed by OatNF-SA-Fe and ferrous bisglycinate, and then OatNF-NaOH-Fe and ferrous fumarate. The colour changes observed with ferrous sulfate and OatNF-SA-Fe, both soluble forms of iron, are probably due to the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) at neutral pH in the presence of oxygen, leading to the formation of suspended reddish ferric hydroxide. The colour changes associated with ferrous fumarate and ferrous bisglycinate can be explained by their intrinsic colour and solubility: ferrous bisglycinate, being highly soluble, yields a dark brown-green solution, whereas the poorly soluble ferrous fumarate results in a light-reddish solution. The absence of visible colour changes in apple juice and yogurt can be attributed to the low pH of these matrices (approximately pH 3 for apple juice and 4-4.5 for yogurt), which protects against oxidation, as well as to masking effects from the inherent colour or opacity of the matrices. a, The colour change impact of OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids compared with four commonly used iron fortificants: ferrous sulfate, ferric pyrophosphate, ferrous fumarate and ferrous bisglycinate after their addition to bottled drinking water, apple juice and plain yogurt, 2 h after mixing. The data are shown as mean values ± s.d. Data were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for each matrix, with Bonferroni correction applied for multiple comparisons. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001. b, The sensory performance of OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids in water, apple juice and yogurt compared with various commercial iron fortificants: ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, ferric pyrophosphate and ferrous bisglycinate. We then moved to investigate sensory performance of the various compounds by a group of trained panellists. To disentangle the colour change effects from the sensory perception, the study was run under red light except for yogurt, thus masking colour changes. We first attempted to quantitatively evaluate metallic taste as a discriminant on a linear scale, but the results did not show significant differences at the level of 2.5 mg of iron, indicating that the sensory impact of all the various compounds at a fortification level of 2.5 mg iron per serving is not significant when colour changes are made undetectable under red light. We then assessed whether changes (positive or negative) were detectable compared with the reference compound using the R-Index method. The number of panellists was 15 for water and 16 for both apple juice and yogurt. Therefore, the number of comparisons in the pooled data was 30 for water and 32 for apple juice and yogurt. Under the null hypothesis (no difference), the expected R-Index is 50 (random guessing) and the threshold was set so that the probability of observing an R-Index this high (or higher) by chance was < 5% (one-sided, P < 0.05). Thus, for water, the critical value was 61.9; for apple juice and yogurt, the critical value was 61.6. The results are shown in Fig. As expected, the R-Index values for ferrous fumarate and ferrous sulfate were consistently higher than cut-off in all three matrices, with the only exception being ferrous sulfate in yogurt. The R-Index values for ferric pyrophosphate and ferrous bisglycinate were lower in all matrices, with ferrous bisglycinate in yogurt approaching the critical R-Index value for a significant difference. The two study compounds showed intermediate results. The OatNF-SA was sensorially noticeable in water and apple juice and was not clearly differentiated from the reference sample in yogurt. The OatNF-NaOH could sensorially be perceived differently from the reference in water but was well masked in both apple juice and yogurt. We conducted a prospective, cross-over study in young iron-deficient women in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand, a region in Southeast Asia where women are at high risk of iron deficiency anaemia1. To measure iron absorption from the different iron compounds, we used a multiple iron stable isotope technique, allowing each participant to serve as her own control. The method is based on the incorporation of isotopic labels into erythrocytes 2 weeks after oral administration17. 4a, the 37-day study was designed so that each participant received six different dietary conditions. The three iron compounds tested were: (1) 57Fe-labelled OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, (2) 58Fe-labelled OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid and (3) 54Fe-labelled ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) as the reference compound. Each dose contained 4 mg of elemental iron, and all compounds were intrinsically labelled with stable isotopes during synthesis. The compounds were administered either in water or, to provide a polyphenol-rich inhibitory food matrix, mixed into açai puree with honey (Fig. a, Outline of the randomized-order, cross-over study design. b,c, OatNF-SA-Fe compounds dissolved in water (b) or mixed in açai puree (c) before administration.

During the screening phase, women aged 18–45 years with serum ferritin (SF) concentrations <50 µg l−1 (n = 52) were recruited. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Methods. Eligible participants received the three iron compounds with water on study days 1, 3 and 5. After a 14-day period to allow the iron isotopes to incorporate into erythrocytes, we collected venous blood samples to assess iron absorption from the first three conditions. Participants then received a second round of conditions, with the three iron compounds administered mixed into polyphenol-rich açai puree with honey on study days 19, 21 and 23. The order of the conditions was randomized for each participant for each block using a Python script. The sequences were generated so that each isotope was used only once in each block. After another 14 days, we again collected venous blood samples to measure iron absorption from the final three conditions. In total, 312 measures of iron absorption were conducted across the 52 participants. Figure 4d shows iron absorption from the three compounds in water. Geometric mean FIA from FeSO4 was 26.3% (95% CI 21.4–32.4%). The OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid was remarkably better absorbed than FeSO4, exhibiting a high FIA of 46.2% (95% CI 38.9–55.0%). Notably, iron from the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid was 76% better absorbed (that is, 1.76 times) than iron from FeSO4, which is fully water soluble and considered the reference compound for iron absorption. This finding may be due to the very large specific surface area of the subnanometre-sized ferrous iron in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, which enables rapid dissolution at gastric and duodenal pH during digestion, allowing greater uptake by the divalent metal transporter (DMT)-1 (ref. In addition, the SA (at a 2:1 molar ratio to iron) probably enhances iron absorption, due to its reducing effect35. The OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid showed a geometric mean FIA of 20.3% (16.1–25.7%). This corresponds to 77% relative bioavailability compared with FeSO4 (that is, 0.77 times) which is considered a moderate-to-high iron bioavailability value for potential iron fortificants5. 3d), and this includes very poorly water-soluble iron hydroxide and iron oxides, which typically exhibit absorption rates of <5% relative to FeSO4(ref. The high absorption of the subnanometre-sized ferric iron in the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid is also probably due to its very large specific surface area enabling rapid dissolution at low gastric pH, as previously demonstrated for non-hybrid subnanometre-sized iron oxides and phosphates18. Finally, the presence of OatNF may have contributed to the high FIA of both hybrids due to the high glutamine content in oat protein, accounting for up to 13% of the amino acid content (Supplementary Fig. Glutamine has previously been shown to enhance iron absorption in vivo36. Dietary polyphenols strongly inhibit iron absorption by forming unabsorbable complexes with iron in the gut lumen37,38. Previous studies have reported reductions in iron absorption from foods and supplements due to polyphenols ranging from 40% to 90% (refs. Our findings agree with these studies: the polyphenol-rich açai puree meal reduced iron absorption (Fig. However, absorption from the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids remained high at 13.4% (95% CI 9.8–18.3%), which was 65% higher than absorption from FeSO4, which was 8.1% (95% CI 6.1–10.6%). This suggests that the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid remains highly bioavailable even when incorporated into polyphenol-rich foods, underscoring its potential as an effective iron fortificant. 5 show the relative bioavailability of OatNF-SA-Fe, OatNF-NaOH-Fe and FeSO4 when administered with water and with açai puree, normalized for each individual participant. We introduce in this work a previously unexplored protein–iron nanoparticle hybrid system based on OatNF carrying ultrasmall iron nanoparticles. The synthesis can be tailored to produce either ferrous or ferric iron nanoparticles, depending on the choice of reducing agent used. When using SA, OatNF carries stabilized ferrous iron that is remarkably well absorbed in humans, with a mean fractional absorption of 46% in water—76% higher bioavailability compared with FeSO4, the reference compound. When using NaOH, OatNF carry mainly ferric iron, which is still well absorbed and shows superior sensory performance in reactive food matrices. The OatNF-NaOH-Fe control is particularly informative: by renormalizing the clinical iron absorption in Fig. 4a to the total Fe(II) present at the start, we find absorption efficiencies of 26.3% (54Fe), ~51% (57Fe) and ~58% (58Fe). This clearly demonstrates that protein nanofibrils effectively preserve Fe(II), independent of its starting concentration. By contrast, the primary function of SA appears to be enhancing the initial Fe(II) content, rather than affecting its preservation or absorption directly. Nonetheless, both ascorbate reduction of ferric iron in the gut lumen and increased enterocyte ascorbate43 may further contribute to the high bioavailability observed for OatNF-SA-Fe. OatNF exhibit several key advantages as an iron delivery platform for human nutrition: (1) This oat-based formulation is suitable for all populations, even those with plant-based diets, which typically have both inadequate iron intake and low bioavailability44,45. (2) OatNF provide efficient binding sites for subnanometre iron particles. This binding and alignment is probably due to the intrinsic protein affinity to form supramolecular complexes46,47. Our results clearly demonstrate that the exceptional bioavailability of iron observed in the OatNF-SA diet is due to the role of protein nanofibrils. Indeed, as evident from the analysis in both solid and dispersion by XPS and colorimetric assays, respectively (Fig. 4i,n), the initial amount of Fe(II) in the oat hybrids and iron sulfate is essentially identical. Therefore, the superior iron bioavailability observed for OatNF-SA hybrids can only be attributed to the differing fate of Fe(II) during digestion and absorption. (3) OatNF contain abundant reducing amino acids20 and a high content of antioxidant peptides48,49 that are capable of stabilizing subnanometre ferrous iron nanoparticles in the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids even during long storage (Fig. (4) the presence of OatNF nanofibrils maintains iron in a colloidally stable state, preventing aggregation and preserving bioavailability. (5) Because of their high solubility in water, acceptable organoleptic sensory features and pleasant oat flavour and aroma, OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids may be efficient iron fortificants for a wide variety of beverage and food matrices. The digestion and absorptive pathway of OatNF hybrids remains uncertain. Based on our INFOGEST experiment results, both oat nanofibril formulations underwent substantial degradation during gastric digestion due to pepsin hydrolysis, followed by complete digestion during the intestinal phase. Ferric iron is then probably reduced by duodenal cytochrome b (DcytB), a ferric reductase located on the apical surface of enterocytes, or by ascorbic acid in the case of the OatNF-SA-Fe formulation6. The resulting ferrous iron is probably absorbed through the conventional divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) pathway, along with any iron already present in the ferrous form. Given the complete digestion and dissolution observed in the INFOGEST experiment, and consistent with previous work by Shen et al.20, it is unlikely that intact OatNF hybrids are taken up via endocytosis, although we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that trace amounts may be absorbed this way. It is also possible—although less likely—that a small portion of iron remains bound to amino acids or peptide fragments after digestion rather than fully solubilizing. These iron–amino acid complexes, similar to aminochelated iron, could be absorbed through an alternative pathway50. For example, a study using DMT1-knockout Caco-2 cells51 found no iron uptake from ferrous bisglycinate, casting doubt on the physiological relevance of this mechanism. In summary, we developed a food-grade oat protein nanofibril-based iron compound for beverage and food fortification that delivers iron with exceptionally high bioavailability. This study demonstrates the potential of protein–iron nanoparticle hybrid systems for effective iron absorption in humans. In iron-deficient women, a key target group for iron fortification, the OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid demonstrated exceptional FIA. The geometric mean absorption was 46.2% when administered with water and 13.4% when given with a polyphenol-rich food matrix, achieving very high values of bioavailability corresponding to 176% and 165% those of FeSO4. Moreover, the OatNF hybrids exhibited sensory performance equal to or better than FeSO4 in fortified foods and beverages. These results make OatNF hybrids an innovative and highly effective approach to iron delivery in nutritional applications, which could contribute to reducing the global burden of iron deficiency and anaemia. The following materials were used: oat flour (Hafermehl grob, SWISSMILL), n-hexane (LiChrosolv, CAS-No: 110-54-3, Merck KGaA), NaOH (BioXtra, ≥98%, pellets, CAS-No: 1310-73-2, Sigma-Aldrich), NaCl (≥99.5%, CAS-No: 7647-14-5, Sigma-Aldrich), extracted oat protein, HCl (1.09057, CAS-No: 7647-01-0, Sigma-Aldrich, Reagent European Pharmacopoeia Standard), FeCl3, SA (Sigma-Aldrich 134-03-2; Reagent European Pharmacopoeia Standard), NaOH (1.09137, CAS-No: 1310-73-2, Sigma-Aldrich, Reagent European Pharmacopoeia Standard), hydrogen peroxide 30% (1.07298, CAS-No: 7722-84-1, Sigma-Aldrich, Suprapur) and 54Fe-, 57Fe- and 58Fe-enriched elemental iron powders (Chemgas). All reagents were of European Pharmacopoeia reagent grade. All steps were carried out with food-grade equipment in the pilot plant/food laboratory under food-grade conditions. The oat protein extraction followed our previous protocol22. In brief, oat flour was defatted with n-hexane (1:3 w/v) three times for 1 h, centrifuged at 5,000g for 15 min and air-dried for 24 h. The defatted powder was then dispersed in 1 M NaCl pH 10 (1:10 w/v) and gently stirred for 2 h at 20 °C before centrifugation (7,000g, 15 min, 20 °C). The protein-rich supernatant was diluted with Milli-Q water (1:6.66 v/v) and left 12 h at 4 °C without agitation to precipitate the dissolved OGs. After centrifugation (7,000g, 15 min, 20 °C), the pellet was resuspended in Milli-Q water and dialysed (molecular weight cut-off: 6–8 kDa, Spectra/Por RC membrane, Spectrum Laboratories) against Milli-Q water for 24 h to remove the salt. The dialysed sample was collected, frozen and subsequently freeze-dried to obtain the OG powder. To fabricate OG nanofibril, extracted OG was first dissolved in Milli-Q water (pH 2) at 2 wt%. The dissolved protein solution was then incubated at 90 °C in an oil/water bath for 18 h while stirring at 350 rpm. For OatNF-SA-Fe hybrid, the freshly prepared OG nanofibril solution (2 wt%) was first mixed with MQ water and FeCl3 solution (0.3 M). Then, the freshly dissolved SA (3 M) was added drop by drop, followed by a gentle mixing of the dispersion. For samples for clinical studies, the iron concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Dispersion with 4 mg iron was loaded in each Eppendorf and freeze-dried. The Eppendorf was then filled with N2, which was subsequently replaced with argon before shipping for clinical studies. For the OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrid, the freshly prepared OG nanofibril solution (2 wt%) was first mixed with MQ water and FeCl3 solution (0.3 M) and vortexed for 30 s. The dispersion was then carefully adjusted to pH 7 by adding NaOH (7.5 M) droplet by droplet. The final dispersion contained FeCl3 at 100 mM. For samples for clinical studies, the iron concentration was determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Dispersion with 4 mg iron was loaded in each Eppendorf, frozen and stored with dry ice before shipping for clinical studies. In clinical study, FeCl3 solutions were prepared by dissolution of 57Fe and 58Fe elemental powders in stochiometric amounts of 6 M HCl, followed by oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) with equimolar amounts of 30% hydrogen peroxide. For STEM imaging and analytical analyses, an aliquot of samples (5 μl) was deposited on 2-nm carbon-coated lacey grids (Quantifoil, D) pretreated by glow discharge (Pelco easyGlow) for 2 min to ensure the optimal material distribution. The excess fluid was removed with filter paper, and the grids were washed three times with distilled water and air-dried. The ambient temperature STEM measurements were performed using TFS Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and JEOL JEM-F200 (JEOL) instruments both operated at 200 kV and a double Cs-corrected JEOL JEM-ARM300F GrandARM ‘Vortex' (JEOL) instrument operated at 300 kV. All instruments equipped with cold-emission FEG sources were used in a scanning TEM mode. For imaging, the HAADF and circular bright-field detectors were used on all three instruments. A STEM probe with a diameter of approximately 0.25 nm was used (condenser aperture 70 μm, convergence angle 10.5 mrad). STEM illumination and acquisition parameters were chosen such that the low-angle annular dark field STEM and circular bright-field STEM detectors yielded the diffraction contrast information, whereas the HAADF-STEM detector provided the prominent atomic number contrast from the same probe position. The materials elemental content and its distribution in the specimens were assessed by EDS measurements using TFS Talos F200X (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with the SuperX EDS module using the Esprit I package for the evaluation and analyses of spectrum images. The corresponding STEM probe size was set to about 0.25 nm (convergence angle 10.5 mrad, condenser aperture 70 mm), providing the high-resolution imaging and simultaneously yielding sufficient electron probe current for high X-ray count rates. The studies were carried out using 5–7 mA of the emission current and energy dispersion of 0.15 eV per channel to include both, O-K and Fe-L23 edges in the spectra. Cryo-TEM samples were prepared in a Vitrobot Mark IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 22 °C and 100 % humidity. Three microlitres of sample were added on hydrophylized lacey carbon-coated copper grids (EMS), and the grids were plunge frozen into a mixture of liquid ethane and propane cooled by liquid nitrogen. The vitrified grids were clipped into AutoGrid sample carriers (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for automated loading. The sample morphology was verified using cryo-TEM to assess potential electron-beam-induced material damage. The data acquisition was carried out on a TFS Titan Krios (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operated at 300 kV of acceleration voltage and equipped with a Gatan Quantum-LS Energy Filter (GIF) and a Gatan K2 Summit direct electron detector (Ametek Pleasanton). The imaging of the vitrified materials on a cryo-stage constantly kept at 80 K was performed in an energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) operation mode using the TFS EPU software and K2 camera in a linear mode. XPS measurement was performed in a PHI Quantera system. Dried samples were pressed into In foil before measurement and measured at a pressure of 10−9–10−8 torr. The monochromatic Al Kα radiation was generated from an electron beam (24.8 W) with a 100 μm spot size. Charge neutralization was performed using a low-energy electron source. Peak fitting of photoelectron features was performed in Casa XPS using Voigt profiles with GL ratios of 40 following Tougaard background subtraction for the Fe 2p region and Shirley background subtraction for all other cases. For Fe 2p fitting, we used the approach described by A. P. Grosvenor et al. to constrain the relative peak positions25. Relative peak areas between main and satellite peaks were fixed between each analysed Fe 2pspectrum. Furthermore, the full width at half maximum was fixed to be identical between each main peak and its corresponding satellite peak. Binding energy was referenced to the single N 1s feature located at 499.7 eV, based on literature values for amide bonds52, using this peak as the internal charge reference. Colour change measurements were performed by adding amounts of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, ferric pyrophosphate, ferrous fumarate, ferrous bisglycinate (all food grade, obtained from Dr. Paul Lohmann, Emmerthal, Germany), OatNF-SA-Fe hybrids and OatNF-NaOH-Fe hybrids, containing 2.5 mg of Fe to either 100 ml of bottled water and apple juice or 100 g of plain yogurt 1.1% fat. All products were from the M-Budget line and were purchased at the Migros supermarket chain, Zurich, Switzerland. All fortified beverages and foods were prepared in triplicate. Colour change was measured after 2 h of standing at room temperature and compared with beverages or foods without added iron compounds. Absolute colour change (ΔE*ab) was determined using a spectral photometer (Chroma Meter CR-410, Konica-Minolta) in the Hunter Lab colour system, calculated as follows: where ΔL* (lightness), Δa* and Δb* (chromaticity coordinates) correspond to the difference between the sample (with added compound) and the not fortified matrix. The SPSS statistical programming environment (IBM SPSS Software, Version 28) and Microsoft Office EXCEL 2016 (Microsoft) were used for the data analysis. Comparisons were done using two-sided paired t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The participants were recruited from among the staff and students of the Department of Health Sciences and Technology at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Sixteen participants, with an average age of 25.9 years (median age 24), volunteered to participate in the study. By signing a consent form, they confirmed that they had no food allergies or intolerances and would follow the tasting protocol during all sessions. Commercial samples of bottled still water, cow's milk yogurt 1.1% fat and regular apple juice, all from the M-Budget line (Migros supermarket, Zurich, Switzerland), were used as matrices to test the sensory impact of different iron compounds. Four food-grade commercial iron compounds (ferrous sulfate, ferric pyrophosphate, ferrous bisglycinate and ferrous fumarate, all obtained from Dr. Paul Lohmann, Emmerthal, Germany) and the two comparators (OatNF-SA-Fe and OatNF-NaOH-Fe) were mixed at a concentration of 2.5 mg Fe per 100 g in a 100-g matrix. Two centilitres of the mixed samples were transferred to 4-cl cups. Ferrous fumarate and ferric pyrophosphate were insoluble in water and apple juice; OatNF-NaOH-Fe was only partially soluble. Therefore, all liquids had to be stirred by the panellists before tasting and were served at room temperature under red light to avoid colour bias. The yogurt samples were stored at 4 °C until the tasting session and were served with small spoons. All cups were labelled with three-digit codes, and the samples were presented to the panellists in a balanced design. The testing room temperature was about 22 °C. All participants attended a training session. This included an introduction to the tasting protocol and familiarization with different matrices containing a selection of iron compounds, as well as the evaluation methods. Iron sulfate was considered a standard compound because it is used as a reference in sensory training (ISO 8586 (ref. Panellists were instructed to take a sip, evaluate the sample and spit it out again, followed by neutralizing their palate with water and crackers. Liquid samples had to be stirred. The yogurt samples were served with small spoons. The panellists ranked four samples with increasing concentrations of iron sulfate in water (1, 2.5, 5 and 10 mg per 100 ml water), using the attribute ‘metallic'. The panellists were given feedback about their performance and were allowed to retaste the samples. The same concentrations were rated on a 100-unit line scale with respect to the metallic attribute, including selected compounds. For data collection, the concentration was restricted to 2.5 mg Fe per 100 g of matrix. Based on the pretests and training results, multiple difference testing was decided upon, as differences with only 2.5 mg of iron were found to be minimal and difficult to be rated on line scales. All six compounds were tested in their respective matrices and presented in blocks of seven samples. The bland matrix was presented as a reference. Panellists had to evaluate whether a sample was the same as the reference and whether they were confident in their decision (four levels: R sure, R unsure, not R unsure and not R sure). The panellists tested all samples in duplicate, including the reference, for a total of 14 samples per matrix. The tastings were conducted on two consecutive days. Results were pooled, and the R-Index was calculated54. The tables of Bi and O'Mahony55 were used to test for significance (P = 0.05, one-sided). The study was a single-centre, prospective cross-over stable isotope trial, conducted at the Institute of Nutrition of Mahidol University, in Nakhon Pathom, Thailand. All participants provided written informed consent before any study procedure took place. The study was conducted in Thailand, and the female participants (n = 52) were recruited among students and staff of Mahidol University in the Bangkok metropolitan area. To minimize biological and environmental confounding of FIA, we enrolled non-pregnant, non-lactating women aged 18–45 years with SF <50 µg l−1 and haemoglobin (Hb) ≥12 g dl−1, and excluded participants with inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP) >5 mg l−1), thalassaemia, recent blood loss/transfusion, chronic disease, tobacco use, recent antibiotic or supplement use, and chronic medications (except oral contraceptives). Body mass index and weight limits were applied to reduce interindividual variability in iron kinetics and dosing per body mass. These eligibility criteria were chosen to strengthen internal validity by removing known modifiers of iron absorption. Data on ethnicity and socio-economic status were not collected. Although recruitment from a university population may limit generalizability to other Thai women, it is unlikely to have introduced systematic bias in the physiological measurement of iron absorption. The recruitment inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) female; (2) age 18–45 years; (3) SF <50 µg l−1; (4) body mass index 18.5–24.9 kg m−2; (5) weight <70 kg; (6) signed informed consent. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) anaemia (defined as Hb <12 g dl−1); (2) presence of thalassaemia; (3) inflammation (defined as CRP >5 mg l−1); (4) cigarette smoking; (5) chronic digestive, renal and/or metabolic disease; (6) chronic medications (except for oral contraceptives); (7) use of vitamin, mineral and pre- and/or probiotic supplements in the previous 2 weeks; (8) blood transfusion, blood donation or important blood loss in the previous 4 months; (9) history of difficulties with blood sampling; (10) antibiotic treatment in the previous 4 weeks; (11) pregnancy (tested in serum at screening); (12) lactation in the previous 6 weeks; (13) prior participation in a study using stable isotopes or participation in any clinical study in the previous 30 days; (14) unable to comply with study protocol. During screening, about 2 weeks before the start of the study, we collected a venipuncture sample (6 ml) for the determination of Hb, SF, CRP, thalassaemia and pregnancy. Eligible women were invited to participate in the study. During the first phase, we administered the compounds on days 1, 3 and 5, diluted in 100 ml reverse osmosis purified water, along with 240 ml purified water as a drink. During the second phase of the study (days 19, 21 and 23), the same labelled compounds were readministered with identical amounts of water, accompanied with 30 g açai puree (The Rainforest Company) sweetened with 5 g honey (Doi Kham brand by Royal Doi Kham Food Products). The administrations took place between 7:00 and 9:00 after an overnight fast. We collected venous blood samples (6 ml) on days 1 (baseline), 19 (phase 1) and 37 (phase 2) to determine Hb, SF, CRP and erythrocyte isotopic composition. Body weight was measured on the same days. Hb, SF and CRP concentrations were measured at the National Healthcare Systems (NHealth) in Bangkok, Thailand, using an automated haematology analyser (Sysmex), a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and immunoturbidimetry, respectively. Anaemia was defined as Hb <120 g l−1. Iron deficiency was defined as SF <30 μg l−1, and inflammation was described as CRP >5 mg l−1. Whole blood aliquots were sent on dry ice to ETH Zurich, where their iron isotopic composition was measured in duplicate by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry56 (Neptune, Thermo Fisher Scientific). We based our power calculation on data from our previous iron absorption study that administered submicrometre-sized ferric phosphate to young women in Thailand19. To resolve a difference of 30% in FIA with a power of 80% and a 5% error rate, we estimated the sample size to be 44 participants. To account for a 20% participant drop-out, we recruited 52 participants. Circulating iron in the body was estimated based on blood volume, derived from body height and weight, and Hb concentration17. The SPSS statistical programming environment (IBM SPSS Software, Version 28) and Microsoft Office EXCEL 2016 (Microsoft) were used for data analysis. Data were examined for normality by use of the Shapiro–Wilk test. Normally distributed data were reported as the mean (s.d. ), and non-normally distributed data were reported as the median (interquartile range). Comparisons were done using two-sided paired t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple testing. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All participants provided written informed consent before any study procedure took place.

Scientific Reports volume 15, Article number: 37336 (2025) Cite this article The Santana Group in Northeast Brazil has yielded a remarkable discovery: the first filter-feeding pterosaur from the tropics, named Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. This new taxon provides key insights into the evolutionary history and ecological diversity of Ctenochasmatidae, a clade known for its specialized feeding adaptations. Bakiribu exhibits extremely elongated jaws and dense, brush-like tooth rows, similar to Pterodaustro but distinct in tooth cross-section and spacing. Paleohistological analysis of the teeth revealed well-preserved dentine and pulp cavities. Phylogenetic analysis recovers Bakiribu as the sister taxon to Pterodaustro, forming a clade more closely related to Ctenochasma than to Gegepterus, which is reinterpreted as a non-ctenochasmatine. Regarding some specific traits such as tooth density, elongation, and count, Bakiribu is intermediate between Ctenochasma and Pterodaustro, thus partially bridging a key evolutionary gap within Ctenochasmatinae. Taphonomic features support the interpretation of the fossil assemblage as a regurgitalite. This discovery brings crucial data for understanding biogeographic dispersal and ecological specialization within Ctenochasmatinae during the Early Cretaceous, and offers rare evidence of predator-prey interactions in the Romualdo Formation paleoecosystem. Together, these findings further underscore the importance of the Araripe Basin as a window into the Early Cretaceous biodiversity. The Araripe Basin in Northeast Brazil has long been recognized as a valuable site for paleontological research1,2,3,4, yielding numerous significant fossil discoveries from the Cretaceous Period across a wide diversity of taxonomic groups. Among these, the Santana Group stands out for its exceptional fossil preservation, providing valuable information about the morphology, ecology, and evolution of several clades, especially pterosaurs5,6,7,8,9. It has provided dozens of both toothed (ornithocheiriforms) and toothless (azhdarchoids) ornithocheiroid taxa, and hundreds of specimens overall10,11. Despite over five decades of pterosaur studies in this unit, no archaeopterodactyloid taxa had been formally documented from this unit until now12. Here, we present the first archaeopterodactyloid from the Santana Group, based on a very distinctive specimen from the Romualdo Formation. Ctenochasmatidae is a clade of pterodactyloid pterosaurs, which thrived during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous. Recent discoveries have shed light on the diversity and ecological adaptations of this group, particularly through the examination of new fossil specimens from various geographic regions and geological periods13,14. These pterosaurs exhibit a remarkable evolutionary trajectory, characterized by diverse morphological adaptations and a broad geographical distribution. Recent discoveries from China, South America, and Europe have significantly enhanced our understanding of their ecology and highlighted the dynamic evolutionary history of this lineage15,16,17. Ctenochasmatids thrived mostly from the Late Jurassic to the Barremian but declined progressively towards the late Early Cretaceous. Little is known about the later taxa and how the lineages moved and diversified between Laurasia and Gondwana. Indeed, the only Gondwanan ctenochasmatid taxa known from before this study are: the ctenochasmatine Pterodaustro guinazui, from the Albian of the San Luis province, Argentina, and the gnathosaurine Tacuadactylus luciae, from the Upper Jurassic of Uruguay; with other ambiguous material from Argentina and Chile as well18,19,20,21,22. Within Ctenochasmatidae, the subclade Ctenochasmatinae is distinguished by elongated snouts and numerous fine teeth, adaptations associated with their unique feeding strategies. The evolutionary trajectory of this group has been illuminated by discoveries such as Liaodactylus primus, from the Upper Jurassic of western Liaoning, China14, which demonstrates a notable ecological transition from fish-catching to filter-feeding within the clade. An extreme morphology can be found in the ctenochasmatine Pterodaustro guinazui, which exhibits a thousand hyper-elongated baleen-like teeth on the lower jaw13,23,24. The extreme morphology of Pterodaustro indicates a hyper-specialization towards filter-feeding23. To account for the distinctiveness of this form, the clade Pterodaustrini was defined by Andres et al. 25 as the “most inclusive clade containing Pterodaustro but not Ctenochasma”, and includes Beipiaopterus, Gegepterus, and Pterodaustro according to recent works26,27,28. Here we describe Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov., a new pterodaustrinin pterosaur from the late Aptian-early Albian Romualdo Formation of the Araripe Basin, Northeast Brazil. This taxon exhibits a mosaic of traits shared with both South American and European relatives, contributing to our understanding of their evolutionary history and paleobiogeography from a low-latitude Gondwanan context. The material described here comprises one part and its counterpart of a typical calcareous concretion from the Romualdo Formation, Araripe Basin, Northeast Brazil (Fig. The concretion contains two individuals of the new pterosaur species, along with four fossil fish (likely Tharrhias). The material was originally housed in the paleontology collection of the Museu Câmara Cascudo (MCC) at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Natal, Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil, under catalog numbers MCC1271.1-V and MCC1271.2-V. The specimen had been stored in the museum's collection for many years without formal identification, kept among other fossils originating from the Araripe region, unfortunately, without precise provenance and date of collection. Upon identifying this material as a new species, we contacted the director of the Museu de Paleontologia Plácido Cidade Nuvens (MPSC) in Santana do Cariri, Ceará state, Brazil, and facilitated an agreement to transfer one-half of the concretion (MCC 1271.2-V) to their collection. This initiative aimed to support the preservation of significant specimens (such as holotypes) within their region of origin, contributing to local development. Consequently, part of the material is still housed at the Museu Câmara Cascudo (MCC 1271.1-V), while the other part is currently deposited at the Museu de Paleontologia Plácido Cidade Nuvens under a new register number, MPSC R 7312 (originally MCC 1271.2-V).

C, Simplified stratigraphic column of the basin, colors differentiate the pre-rift, rift, and post-rift sequences2, from base to top. A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to investigate the relationships of the new species herein analyzed within Ctenochasmatidae. For this purpose, we have utilized as a basis a previous phylogenetic matrix26, with the inclusion of the species herein described, and revised codifications for the ctenochasmatids Ctenochasma elegans, Gegepterus changi, and Beipiaopterus chenianus (see Supplementary Material). The analysis was conducted under maximum parsimony, using the software TNT 1.529. The analysis was divided into two steps, following the same protocol as previous works26. New Technology Search (default parameters) was used for the first step, with random seed = 0. Subsequently, a Traditional Search swap was performed using trees from RAM (using TBR, 10000 replications, collapsing trees after search). All characters were treated with equal weight. A TNT file (in txt format) containing the data matrix, ready for analysis execution in TNT, is available as supplementary information. We sampled a portion of a tooth row from one of the halves of the calcareous concretion using an electronic Dremel® saw. The cut was perpendicular to the tooth axis and did not reach any cranial bone. We applied PaleoBOND® penetrant stabilizer to improve sample resistance. It was embedded into Araldite 2020® epoxy resin. The sample was later ground to a thickness of approximately 60 μm. It was photographed on an Olympus BX53M petrographic microscope with both parallel and crossed nicols, with the lambda compensator. We followed Cerda & Codorniú13 for tooth description. We followed Terra et al30. for carbonate rock classification.

C and D, Schematic drawings of MCC 1271.1-V and MPSC 7312, respectively. Scale bar equals 50 mm. The generic epithet comes from bakiribú (Kariri word for ‘comb'), in allusion to the typical comb-like dentition of ctenochasmatids. The specific epithet comes from waridzá (Kariri word for ‘mouth'). Together, the binomial name not only highlights the distinctive dental morphology of the taxon but also honors the cultural heritage of the Kariri people, Indigenous inhabitants of the region where the fossil was discovered. Based on position and orientation, fragments b, c, and d most likely belong to the same individual (Fig. Fragments f and g are tentatively regarded as part of the same individual (Fig. This fossil was preserved in a calcareous concretion of the Romualdo Formation, Araripe Basin, Northeast Brazil. This unit is late Aptian-early Albian in relative age31. The precise locality of this concretion is unknown, but the Romualdo Formation outcrops east-west along the Araripe Plateau between the states of Pernambuco, Ceará, and Piauí1,2. Ctenochasmatine pterosaur with the following combination of features, including autapomorphies (marked with an asterisk): jaws extremely elongate (estimated rostral index of ~ 12–16); teeth closely packed together (interdental gaps under tooth diameter); high tooth density (17.6 teeth/cm); high tooth count (between 110 and 142 per jaw, per side, as preserved; total estimate = between 440 and 568); teeth long and slender (elongation index surpassing 1:60); acrodont-like tooth implantation on both jaws*; and tooth crowns subquadrangular in cross-section*. Reconstruction of the type specimens of Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. A, close view of MCC 1271.1-V (main part). B, simplified schematic reconstruction of the holotype based on fragments a, b, c, and d. C, simplified schematic reconstruction of holotype based on fragments e, f, and g. Scale bar equals 10 mm. The material comprises a large number of dentate jaw sections jumbled together, lying close to four fish specimens. An indeterminate metatarsal and an indeterminate pedal phalanx are also present, as are some indeterminate bone fragments. It is difficult to determine the anatomical position of most jaw sections. However, four jaw fragments preserve the tip (Fig. The preservation of four jaw tips suggests the presence of at least two specimens, which together would account for two upper and two lower jaws. The three best-preserved jaw fragments (MPSC 7312a, c, and e) all preserve a slightly expanded tip, with fragments a and c being of similar size, and both slightly more expanded than fragment b (Fig. The fourth jaw tip (fragment f) comprises a smaller fragment, not so well-preserved. We accordingly interpret the larger tips (a and e; Fig. 4A-D) as upper jaws and the less-expanded tips (c and f) as lower jaws, based on the proportions seen in Ctenochasma elegans SMNS 81,803, wherein the upper jaw tip is slightly more expanded than the lower one32. Based on their close position and similar orientation, we tentatively interpret fragments a and b as belonging to a single individual (herein elected as the holotype; Fig. Fragment e, which represents a second upper jaw tip (and therefore a second individual), is chosen as a paratype. Fragment f is tentatively identified as belonging to the same individual as fragment e (Fig. Details of MCC 1271.1-V (main part) and respective schematic drawings. A and B, fragment e (paratype), a rostrum. C and D, fragment a (holotype), a rostrum. E and F, fragment d (holotype? ), a partial dentary symphysis. Scale bars equal 10 mm. The jaw sections are all elongated and dorsoventrally compressed, as is typical of ctenochasmatines. Most jaw sections are almost straight in orientation. Still, one fragmentary mid-section is slightly upcurved (Fig. 4E, F), indicating the presence of a slight upturn along the rostrum, similar to the condition seen in Gegepterus changi33. The jaw sections exhibit an extensive comb-like dentition, comprising a high number of slender, curved teeth. The teeth are oriented anterolaterally in the coronal plane and lateroventrally in the transverse plane. The teeth are quite closely packed together (interdental gaps are inferior to tooth diameter; see Fig. 4E, F), behind only those of Pterodaustro guinazui in which the teeth actually contact each other13. Preserved tooth density equals 17.6 teeth/cm. Estimated total skull length ranges from 9 to 12 cm (simple scaling based on Ctenochasma and Pterodaustro, respectively; see Tables S1-S3). The estimated total tooth count per jaw, per side ranges from 110 to 140 (see Tables S1-S3). The jaw sections lack alveoli, and the teeth seem to be attached to the bone in an acrodont-like style (Fig. This is similar to the condition seen in the upper teeth of Pterodaustro guinazui, and unlike other pterosaurs23,33. Still, Bakiribu differs from Pterodaustro in that such acrodont-like implantation is present on both jaws, rather than only on the upper jaw as in Pterodaustro (23,33). The base of the teeth is slightly expanded, in a petiolate-like style (Fig. Presumably, the teeth were attached to the jaws through connective tissue, as has been proposed for the upper teeth of Pterodaustro guinazui (23,33). In cross-section, tooth crowns are subquadrangular in shape, uniquely among ctenochasmatids (see Fig. In other ctenochasmatids, tooth crowns are nearly circular, as in the ctenochasmatines Gegepterus changi, Ctenochasma elegans, and Pterodaustro guinazui13,32,33, as well as other ctenochasmatids such as Balaenognathus maeuseri, Pterofiltrus qiui, and Feilongus youngi; or elliptical, such as in the gnathosaurines Tacuadactylus luciae and Lusognathus almadrava15,16. The thin section showed a tooth row preserved in a calcareous concretion with moderate taphonomic artifacts (Fig. There is no evidence of lithostatic compression. The concretion comprises a wackestone supported by ostracodes and foraminifera (Fig. Foraminifera are less abundant and zoned at the same layer as the pterosaurs and fish. Diagenetic micrite and calcite slightly damaged the specimen. Nonetheless, dentine was preserved, and general tooth morphology could be assessed. The tooth outline is subrounded to subquadrangular in transversal view. The interdental space is short. The pulp cavity has been preserved. Tooth histology of Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov.

The strict consensus tree (Fig. 7) has a consistency index of 0.355 and a retention index of 0.802. Bakiribu was recovered as the sister species of Pterodaustro guinazui in the strict consensus (Fig. 7), this relationship being supported by 5 synapomorphies: character 197(2), mandible main axis upturned; character 253(1), dentition extension surpassing 70% of jaw length; character 258(1) mesial teeth nearly touching (spacing under half of alveolar diameter); character 280(3), mesial tooth elongation surpassing 60 times width; and character 305(1), absence of upper alveoli. Time-scaled strict consensus tree showing archaeopterodactyloid intrarrelationships. The remaining portion of the tree is identical to that of Pêgas (2025).

Before this study, the Pterodaustrini (sensu Andres et al25.) were thought to comprise three taxa: Pterodaustro guinazui, known from hundreds of specimens from the Albian Lagarcito Formation of Argentina23,34; Gegepterus changi, known from two specimens (including skulls) from the Barremian-Aptian Yixian Formation of China33; and Beipiaopterus chenianus, known from a single specimen (lacking a skull) from the same formation (see26,28). Morphological features supporting the close affinities of Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi included an upturned rostrum and mandibular tips, a craniomandibular articulation posterior to the center of the orbit, an ascending process of the jugal anterodorsally inclined, and cheek alveoli set in grooves26,28. However, the current study does not find support for these features as synapomorphies of a clade joining Pterodaustro and Gegepterus to the exclusion of Ctenochasma. An upturned rostrum and mandibular tips, a craniomandibular articulation posterior to the center of the orbit, and an ascending process of the jugal anterodorsally inclined are all features that can be seen in Ctenochasma elegans32; moreover, the craniomandibular articulation actually lies beneath the anterior, not posterior, half of the orbit in Gegepterus. The last two features can be seen in Ctenochasma taqueti as well35,36. Furthermore, the groove that houses the teeth of Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi are not quite equivalent. The alveolar groove that is present in the lower jaw of Pterodaustro guinazui represents, in fact, a series of confluent alveoli, wherein each tooth contacts each other and no interdental gaps separate each tooth/alveoli (= aulacodonty; 13). This is distinct from the condition seen in Gegepterus changi, which is not aulacodont. In this form, the alveoli are individualized and separated by interdental gaps, though placed in a shallow lateral groove that runs along the dentigerous margin33. In other words, the lower alveoli of Pterodaustro guinazui are the groove itself, rather than being set in a groove as is the case with Gegepterus changi. It is thus clear that the grooves seen in the jaws of Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi do not correspond, and should not be coded as such. Following coding corrections about the aforementioned features, we presently recover Pterodaustro (and Bakiribu) as closer to Ctenochasma than to Gegepterus, which is recovered as a non-ctenochasmatine (Fig. The relationship between Ctenochasma and Pterodaustrini (= Pterodaustro + Bakiribu), to the exclusion of Gegepterus, is supported by: characters 34(1), jaw anterior region with subparallel lateral margins; and 151(1), craniomandibular joint located below the posterior half of the orbit. Moreover, Pterodaustro and Ctenochasma share several features that are absent in Gegepterus, such as: character 257(1), tooth spacing approximately even along jaws; 264(2), mesial teeth long axis sigmoidal; character 265(1), all tooth crowns procumbent; and character 281(2), mesial teeth elongation surpassing 20 times width. Gegepterus and Beipiaopterus are herein reinterpreted as closer relatives of Forfexopterus and related taxa (Elanodactylus and moganopterines) than to ctenochasmatines such as Pterodaustro (Fig. Gegepterus and Beipiaopterus share with Forfexopterus characters 382(1), coracoid distal end with distinct cotyles; and 489(1), fourth wing phalanx with an expanded distal tip. Beipiaopterus further shares with Elanodactylus and Forfexopterus characters 483(1), third wing phalanx subequal or longer than the first; and 484(1), third wing phalanx subequal or longer than the second (unknown in Gegepterus). Of note regarding Beipiaopterus is its fourth wing phalanx, previously misinterpreted as a third one - notice the curvature and expanded tip37 that render it indistinguishable from the fourth phalanges of Gegepterus and Forfexopterus (see33,38). It is presumable that the oddly hyperelongated element previously interpreted as a first phalanx actually represents phalanges 1 plus 2, with their articulation obliterated by breakage on the slab (see37). Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. shares with Pterodaustro guinauzi the very dense brush-like tooth row. Notwithstanding, the interdental space in Bakiribu (Fig. 5.E) is twice as wide as in Pterodaustro (Fig. 5.F), without teeth contacting each other in a row. Teeth in Bakiribu are also slightly quadrangular in cross-section compared to the “pencil-like” circular shape seen in Pterodaustro guinazui and Gegepterus changi, as well as non-pterodaustrinin ctenochasmatids such as Ctenochasma SMNS 81,80332, Balaenognathus maeuseri NKMB P2011-63339, Feilongus youngi IVPP V1253940, Huanhepterus quingyangensis IVPP V 907041, Moganopterus zhuiana HGM 41HIII-041942, and Pterofiltrus qiui IVPP V1233943. Tooth cross-section, quantity, and size remained plesiomorphic in ctenochasmatids relative to Pterodaustro and Bakiribu, which present numerous, dense brush-like tooth rows of extreme elongation. In certain ways, the dentition of Bakiribu is anatomically intermediate between the older Ctenochasma and the younger Pterodaustro, thereby showcasing an evolutionary transition within ctenochasmatines throughout space and time. More specifically, Bakiribu is intermediate between these forms in elongation, density, and count of the filamentous teeth; in these regards, values for Bakiribu are all higher than in Ctenochasma but lower than in Pterodaustro (Table S1). Despite the less dense tooth row in Bakiribu compared to Pterodaustro, it featured filamentous teeth on both the upper and lower jaws. This unprecedented high density of filamentous teeth on both jaws might have rendered Bakiribu enhanced, unique filtering capabilities. The pterosaurs and fish were preserved within a wackestone concretion rich in non-oriented ostracodes and foraminifera, similar to other Romualdo Formation concretions3,44. The co-occurrence of densely packed, semi-articulated, and fragmented pterosaur bones (predominantly aligned in subparallel orientation) together with a cluster of similarly aligned fish supports the interpretation of the assemblage as a regurgitalite, a mass of indigestible material expelled orally by a predator45. An alternative explanation is the floating carcass model, which posits that buoyant carcasses disarticulate through soft tissue decay before sinking (e.g.,46,47). However, this scenario fails to account for the observed bone breakage and the consistent alignment of elements. Regarding the alignment, the low-energy depositional setting of the Romualdo Formation would not facilitate hydraulic reorientation, and the absence of bone abrasion further indicates minimal post-mortem transport following decomposition. The configuration of the fish within the concretion adds critical taphonomic context. Their uniform orientation mirrors a feeding behavior commonly observed in extant piscivorous vertebrates, particularly birds. Most piscivorous birds typically ingest their prey whole, head-first. Swallowing fish head-first minimizes the risk of injury from backward-facing spines and fins while facilitating smoother passage down the predator's throat, reducing resistance and the likelihood of choking48,49,50. The tightly clustered arrangement of the fish, in close association with the pterosaur bones, further supports the regurgitalite scenario. Orally expelled material is often embedded in mucus envelopes that maintain cohesion during egestion, which also prevents the dispersion of skeletal elements and preserves their relative positioning within the mass51,52. The type of association observed in the concretion, combined with its mode of preservation, is unusual for the Romualdo Formation (see Saraiva et al.44). When considered alongside the taphonomic evidence above, these features strongly support the interpretation of the fossil as a regurgitated mass. There is no clear macroscopic evidence of digestive corrosion on the bones or scales. This suggests that the material was expelled shortly after ingestion, before significant chemical alteration in hard tissues could take place. Digestive etching is more characteristic of cololites and coprolites53, though it has been occasionally reported in regurgitalites (e.g.,54). Degrees of digestive modification within a single regurgitate can vary substantially: modern and fossil analogues document pellets containing minimally digested, sometimes nearly complete elements and/or articulated skeleton subsets, depending on prey type/size and short gastric residence prior to egestion53,55,56,57. Fracturing of the pterosaur bones most likely occurred during ingestion, as a result of mechanical processing by the predator. The absence of associated soft tissues is consistent with the hard-part bias of regurgitalites, produced by preferential digestion of soft tissues, and may have been compounded by post-burial alteration. Syntheses on bromatolites and regurgitates emphasise these preservational filters, which parsimoniously explain the association of nearly complete fish (likely more recently ingested) with mostly defleshed, fractured pterosaur rostra and teeth (ingested earlier) in our material58,59. Based on the spatial arrangement of the remains, it is plausible that the predator consumed the pterosaurs first, followed by the fish, and subsequently regurgitated a portion of the ingested mass, likely in response to mechanical discomfort or obstruction caused by pterosaur skeletal elements. Regurgitalites commonly record only a subset of the stomach contents, rather than the complete dietary inventory58,59. Consistent with this, studies of modern predators show that regurgitation often occurs without full gastric evacuation60. This framework explains the association of nearly complete fish with disarticulated and fractured pterosaur cranial elements in our specimen. Among potential predators in the Romualdo Formation paleoecosystem, spinosaurid dinosaurs and ornithocheiriform pterosaurs stand out as likely candidates, given their piscivorous adaptations and documented presence in the region61,62,63. Notably, direct evidence of pterosaur consumption by spinosaurids, a spinosaurid tooth embedded in an ornithocheiriform cervical vertebra, has been reported from the same formation64. Although large ornithocheiriforms are also present in the Romualdo Formation, their likely limited stomach volume may have precluded ingestion of such a substantial mass of bone and fish, with the possible exception of Tropeognathus mesembrinus, which reached wingspans exceeding 8 m65. Considering body size, feeding ecology, and existing evidence of pterosaur consumption, spinosaurids emerge as the most plausible producers of the regurgitalite described here, providing additional information on the group's dietary behavior and trophic interactions. Ctenochasmatids are well-represented in other Lower Cretaceous deposits, most particularly in the Jehol Group of China, as well as the Lagarcito Formation in Argentina66. The previous absence of ctenochasmatid remains in the Romualdo Formation, allied to the regurgitalite nature of the present discovery, suggests that the overall absence of ctenochasmatids in the Romualdo Formation may be attributed to environmental factors. It is plausible that the specimens described here are allochthonous, having been consumed by a large predator in a different environment and subsequently regurgitated within the Romualdo Formation depositional area, which comprises coastal to pelagic paleoenvironments (e.g.,3; Fig. Ctenochasmatids are overall associated with calm waters, such as lacustrine and lagoonal environments, being rare in fluvial deposits (e.g.,67) and seemingly absent from non-lagoonal marine environments until now. The Barremian-Aptian Yixian Formation, from China, where several ctenochasmatid species have been discovered (e.g., Gegepterus, Gladocephaloideus, Pterofiltrus), is characterized by lacustrine deposits, as well as the Aptian-Albian Lagarcito and Jiufotang formations, in Argentina and China, where respectively Pterodaustro and Forfexopterus were found. In turn, the Solnhofen Limestone beds (Upper Jurassic of Germany), from where Ctenochasma and Gnathosaurus stem, is mostly represented by calm lagoonal paleoenvironments68,69,70. Thus, ctenochasmatids are typically associated with calm water environments, which supports the allochthonous hypothesis. Artistic reconstruction of the filter-feeding pterosaur Barikibu waridza gen et sp. nov. in the Early Cretaceous Romualdo Formation environment. Author: Julio Lacerda. Bakiribu waridza gen. et sp. nov. represents the first unequivocal record of a ctenochasmatid pterosaur from the tropical latitudes of Gondwana and the first archaeopterodactyloid documented in the Romualdo Formation. Its unique combination of anatomical traits—particularly its very elongated jaws, dense dentition with long and slender teeth, subquadrangular crowns in cross-section, and acrodont-like tooth implantation in both jaws—sheds new light on the evolutionary trajectory of filter-feeding pterosaurs. The exceptional preservation of the specimen within a regurgitalite, alongside head-aligned fish remains, provides rare direct evidence of trophic interactions in the Early Cretaceous Araripe paleoecosystem. This discovery not only fills a paleobiogeographic gap in the distribution of Ctenochasmatinae but also underscores the significance of understudied, long-held museum specimens for revealing key evolutionary and paleoecological insights. Bakiribu adds to the growing evidence that the Araripe Basin serves as a critical window into Early Cretaceous biodiversity, ecological complexity, and continental-scale faunal exchanges. The specimens are housed in public research institutions and can be accessed upon request to the curators of the respective collections in which they are deposited (MPPCN and MCC).

By Rachel Feltman, Kendra Pierre-Louis, Fonda Mwangi, Alex Sugiura & Jeffery DelViscio For Scientific American's Science Quickly, I'm Rachel Feltman. Today, instead of our usual news roundup, I'm here to introduce you to our new interim host. I'm actually going on parental leave for a little bit, and I'll be gone until sometime in the spring of 2026, but the amazing, award-winning Kendra Pierre-Louis is here to fill in for me while I'm gone. And today we figured we would chat about who she is and what she likes to write about so that you could get to know her. If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by subscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. I was gonna be like, “Thanks for having me.” [Laughs.] So, Kendra, tell our listeners a little bit about who you are. Pierre-Louis: I'm a climate reporter, like, mostly by training, and I've been working in climate for a decade now, almost. I think my first job was actually with you ... It's true that there are many accolades I could tack onto your name, but if someone had to say one thing about a journalist that would make me say, “Oh, that's Kendra,” it would be [laughs] “the one who really hates mayonnaise.” Feltman: So [laughs], but this is—listeners might be confused about why we would bring this up in the context of you hosting Science Quickly, but it is something that you've really used to launch several really fascinating science stories. So yeah, tell us more about your history with mayo. Like, when I was quite young—I can't believe I'm gonna admit this—I could eat coleslaw, but only the coleslaw from KFC, which is 90 percent vinegar anyway. And then I think the turning point was: I was eight years old, and we were on a road trip back from Florida, and my mom handed me a sandwich, and I looked at her, and I said, “This doesn't have mayo in it, does it?” and she reassured me that it did not. Pierre-Louis: And by “you people,” I mean mayo lovers [laughs]. Feltman: And, yeah, while we were working together at Popular Science you wrote a real manifesto against mayo that took you on, like, a really fascinating journey into the science of food and texture and perception. So tell us a little bit about some of what you've learned. Pierre-Louis: Yeah, I think that story is called “Mayonnaise is disgusting, and science agrees,” and if I recall correctly, that may be the first time that, like, a third-party entity lobbied my editor for me to take down a story [laughs], which goes to show you, yet again, the impact and the weight of Big Mayo. I've learned sort of more broadly, like, trying to understand—because I talk about mayo the most because it comes up the most. Like, you'll order french fries or something, and that'll come out drizzled with mayo, and, like, nowhere on the menu did it mention that it had mayo in it. But I actually don't like any savory, creamy foods, so no fettuccine Alfredo. Tillamook cheese company just came out with Butternaise, which is a blend of butter and mayonnaise, and I think they just created it to kill me. See, as someone who loves butter and mayonnaise, I have to agree that's a bridge too far [laughs]. And so there are kind of two buckets, which is, like, the texture of the food itself, which I've dug into a lot, and how in the West in general—like there are a lot of words in, like, Mandarin, for example, related to the texture of food, and most Western languages, and English in particular, are not that colorful with our descriptions. And the texture of food on its own is just, like, really fascinating. And it's because we perceive foods as more sour if they're rough than if they're smooth. Pierre-Louis: Ice cream, for example, if you've ever made ice cream yourself, the batter is almost, like—you look at how much sugar you put in it, and you're like, “No one could eat this.” It's so much sugar, and it's because we don't perceive sweetness as well ... I—it's funny—I was reading a random article, and it referenced very matter-of-factly the time such and such actor gained weight by drinking microwaved Häagen-Dazs, and I was like ... Feltman: I was like, “That does sound disgusting, but fundamentally, how is it different from a milkshake?” But I think, crucially [laughs], the milk that dilutes the milkshake and the fact that it's cold makes a big difference. Pierre-Louis: Yeah, and that word you just used is kind of the other bucket that I've, like, really dug into, which is that, for people like me, there are foods that I don't like—like, I don't like ketchup, for example. But, like, I don't think about ketchup. Pierre-Louis: Whereas mayo's really physically—like, it's not even—I would need to go through a lot of therapy and training to get to a place where I could eat it. The smell, everything about it—oh, God, like, I can't have it in my home. Feltman: Yeah, well, and what have you learned about disgust? Obviously, what we express disgust towards varies a little bit, but we tend to have kind of an innate disgust towards bodily fluids and death, the smell of death: two big things that are kind of hardwired into us. So I jokingly say that the reason I don't like mayo is it reminds me of pus, which no mayo eater [laughs] ever wants to hear. Feltman: Well, and I remember a story you wrote for PopSci that got into some of the descriptors for food textures that we lack in English, which has fascinated me ever since. I would love to hear some of your favorites. Pierre-Louis: So it's not quite chewy, 'cause boba isn't quite chewy—like, it does kind of, like, release at a certain point. And that is, like, top 10 of my favorite textures. Like, the researchers actually categorize texture sort of more broadly [based on], like, the type of food. Like, there's crunchers, who prefer foods that, you know, are crunchy, so potato chips; smooshers, who like soft, creamy foods, like pudding or, I'm guessing, Alfredo sauce; suckers, who prefer, like, hard candy that dissolves slowly over time; and chewers, and they prefer foods that can be chewed for a long time, like gummy candy. What is—like, of those four categories, chewers, crunchers, suckers, smooshers, which are you? Pierre-Louis: But I'm not a smoosher at all. When I was in college my mom bought me a giant package of, like, instant oatmeal, and, you know, I was, like, a broke college student, so I had to eat it, and the way I dealt with it was I just ate it undercooked. I had great cholesterol that year, but—so there were pros and cons, but [laughs]. Feltman: So outside of your forays into food texture what are some of your favorite topics to cover? Pierre-Louis: I love climate generally because climate touches everything, and so it's, like, this really interesting inroad into, like, the world at large. And I like the way climate brings you into contact with people. I love looking at solutions 'cause I feel like so much, when we're talking about climate change, it's looking at the problem, and I really enjoy looking at solutions within climate journalism. Right now I'm also looking a little bit at, like, psychology ... Pierre-Louis: A little bit, like, what allows people to normalize really terrible things ... Pierre-Louis: And what allows people to sort of not fight back or to acquiesce in sort of—you know, kind of like the Stanford prison experiment ... Pierre-Louis: More, more like in everyday scenarios, like the choice that people make to fight or to not fight. And also, I'm kind of obsessed with fame at the moment, like, the psychology of fame, both as, you know, like, what makes us attracted to famous people? What is the power that fame holds over us? And not just, like, in terms of celebrity, but, like, we reproduce kind of fame over and over again. Like, the most popular kid at your high school was famous, right? Pierre-Louis: A much lower level, obviously, but, like, it still reproduces that feeling, and what is that, and, like, why are we into it? Feltman: Yeah, so you'll be at the hosting helm of Science Quickly for a few months. Pierre-Louis: So thank you for that [laughs]. I think there's a number of things. Pierre-Louis: Unfor—I wish, maybe, we were in less interesting times. Feltman: I'd love to live in uninteresting times, frankly [laughs]. So, like, there's public health, I think. Looking at a little bit, maybe, of the science behind extremism. Well, Kendra, thanks so much for sitting down so our listeners could get to know you, and of course, they will be hearing you three times a week in their feed, so they're about to get to know you a lot better. Thanks so much for having me, and I'm excited to be here. Feltman: Well, that's all for today's episode, and that's it for me until 2026, so I'll toss it over to you. Pierre-Louis: Tune in on Wednesday when we talk about griefbots, or how AI is helping people deal with the loss of their loved ones.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chronic fatigue syndrome leaves many people completely drained of energy and struggling to think clearly, and their symptoms often worsen after mental or physical exertion -- a reaction known as post-exertional malaise. Researchers studying shortness of breath in people with chronic fatigue have now found that these patients are much more likely to experience dysfunctional breathing. This irregular breathing pattern may be linked to dysautonomia, a disorder involving abnormal nerve control of blood vessels and muscles. By focusing treatment on these breathing irregularities, scientists believe it may be possible to ease some of the debilitating symptoms. All participants completed two days of cardiopulmonary exercise tests. During these sessions, the researchers monitored heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen uptake efficiency, blood oxygen saturation, and how much effort participants used to breathe. Dysfunctional breathing is often seen in asthma patients, but it can develop for many different reasons. Typical features include frequent deep sighs, rapid breathing, forceful exhalation from the abdomen, or chest breathing without proper diaphragm use, which prevents the lungs from fully expanding. It can also involve a lack of coordination between chest and abdominal movements, meaning the muscles that support breathing are no longer working smoothly together. "But we are sure patients can have dysfunctional breathing without being aware of it. Results showed that people with chronic fatigue syndrome took in roughly the same amount of oxygen as the control group -- their peak VO2 max was similar. Nine patients had both hyperventilation and dysfunctional breathing, a combination not seen in any of the controls. When both occur together, they can also cause chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, and (unsurprisingly) anxiety. The researchers believe that these breathing problems may worsen the effects of chronic fatigue or even play a direct role in post-exertional malaise. "Possibly dysautonomia could trigger more rapid and irregular breathing," said Mancini. "It is well known that chronic fatigue syndrome patients often have dysautonomia in the form of orthostatic intolerance, which means you feel worse when upright and not moving. These findings suggest that addressing dysfunctional breathing could help relieve some symptoms of chronic fatigue. The researchers plan to continue investigating how dysfunctional breathing and hyperventilation interact. "Breathing exercises via yoga could potentially help, or gentle physical conditioning where breath control is important, as with swimming," suggested Natelson. "Or biofeedback, with assessment of breathing while encouraging gentle continuous breath use.
