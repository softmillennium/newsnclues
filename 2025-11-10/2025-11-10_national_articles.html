                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“Tonight's Senate vote on the federal government shutdown should have been a time for strength,” the governor, who is eyeing a 2028 White House bid, posted on X. “Instead we saw capitulation and  betrayal of working Americans. Tonight's Senate vote on the federal government shutdown should have been a time for strength.Instead we saw capitulation and a betrayal of working Americans.The American people need more from their leaders. The Senate voted 60-40 Sunday night after a group of seven Democrats and one independent joined Republicans to reopen the government via a stopgap funding bill through Jan. 30, 2026. The compromise will fund most federal agencies through January but does not guarantee the extension of healthcare subsidies, something that had been a sticking point for Democrats. No such promise was made by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA). Even though Schumer came out against the deal, he has received backlash from within his own party for failing to keep members in line. Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) also slammed the senior senator from New York on social media. “Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Khanna wrote. “If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” Newsom, fresh off a Proposition 50 win last week that was largely seen as an indictment of President Donald Trump‘s policies, has been trying to stay in the headlines as he pivots toward 2028. He went to Texas to rally Democrats on Saturday before speaking Monday at a global investors' summit in Sao Paulo. “I thought our immune system was woken up last Tuesday with the American elections,” Newsom said, referring to Democrats' wins in Virginia, New York City, and New Jersey. “I worry now, though, that sounds like some of my colleagues and friends in the United States Senate, some of my Democratic colleagues, just decided that we're playing by the old set of rules, not the new set of rules, and may have rolled over a little bit.” He added that Democrats need to “hold the line because I think America will become unrecognizable in a year or two unless we fight back.” John Fetterman (D-PA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), and Angus King (I-ME).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Deal reached: GOP leaders are trying to push a funding bill as quickly as possible after the Senate took a key step last night toward reopening the government. Eight Democrats joined Republicans to advance a federal funding measure, which the White House endorsed, in exchange for a future vote on extending enhanced Affordable Care subsidies. This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process. • Ongoing impacts: An appeals court rejected the Trump administration's effort to block fully paying food stamp benefits in November, but many recipients are still in limbo. Senate Majority Leader John Thune says he hopes his chamber can pass the compromise government funding package within “hours,” as leadership sorts through whether any lawmakers will hold up the process. “All of us, Democrat and Republican who voted for last night's bill are well aware of the facts, and I am grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro-bill or anti-bill, not to stand in the way of ever being able to deliver the coming relief quickly. The American people have suffered for long enough,” he said. “I don't think it's in anybody's best interest to drag this out. Asked about the potential that Sen. Rand Paul, the only Republican who consistently voted with Democrats to block a short-term funding package, might hold up the process over a demand on an amendment related to agriculture appropriations, Thune responded: “We will cross that bridge when we come to it. When we hear from the Dems about whether or not they're ready to move, then we'll figure out the rest of it with our objector.” Here's a look at some of those lawmakers, none of whom are up for reelection in next year's midterms, and their rationale for ending the shutdown: Reports of staffing issues at Federal Aviation Administration faculties has gone up to 17 for the day Monday, according to the latest publicly available operations plans. New delays are reported for flights arriving or departing Nashville of 30 minutes. Las Vegas is also reporting delays averaging 45 minutes, according to FAA advisories. Delays for flights headed to Phoenix averaging nearly an hour. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport also has a short-staffed tower until 3 p.m. The FAA TRACON for Chicago is also without their normal number of controllers today. The city is getting hit with a snowstorm today which has affected air travel. An earlier ground stop was lifted for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, but delays are likely to continue. ET and the Air Route Traffic Control Center there, which deals with flights at high altitudes, is short-staffed until 1 p.m. TRACONs in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, New York, Newark, Orlando and two parts of Southern California are also short-staffed and some delays are expected. There have been 607 reports of short staffing since October 1, more than six times as many as were reported on the same dates last year. House Speaker Mike Johnson told House Republicans that he is hoping to vote on the Senate's deal to end the government shutdown on Wednesday, according to a source on Monday's House GOP conference call. Johnson also would not commit to holding a separate vote on the expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to a separate source on the call. The Wednesday projection from Johnson is to help members get back to Washington, DC, from their districts amid increasing flight delays and cancellations. “President Trump has wanted the government reopened since the first day Democrats shut it down,” a White House official said in a statement. The endorsement comes a day after eight Democratic senators joined Republicans to advance a measure funding the government into January in exchange for a promised vote to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. Speaker Mike Johnson plans to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona this week when the House returns for a funding measure to reopen the government after a weekslong stalemate, according to a source familiar with the plans. That delay drew fierce scrutiny from congressional Democrats, who pointed to other instances in which lawmakers were sworn in during shutdowns. Johnson repeatedly said he would officially swear in Grijalva when the Senate passed a funding deal and required the House to return. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, one of the Democrats who last night voted in favor of a funding bill to end the government shutdown, responded to fellow Democrats who have criticized the group for siding with Republicans on legislation that does not include a guaranteed extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies. “Staying in a shutdown mode was not getting us anywhere, and they need to train their fire on the people who are responsible — that's President Donald Trump, it's Speaker [Mike] Johnson, and it's the Republicans who have blocked every attempt to get health care. We need to be working together,” Shaheen said on CNN News Central. Some Democrats have called out Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for failing to keep Democrats united, including Rep. Ro Khanna, who said Schumer is “no longer effective and should be replaced.” Shaheen addressed those critics in an earlier appearance Monday on CBS Mornings: “House members who are critical should stay focused on what they can do in the House to ensure that we have a vote on health care,” she said. Johnson has not said if he would bring a bill extending health care subsidies to the House floor. Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said he will take “take anything that recognizes these hardworking men and women,” when asked during a news conference Monday for his response to Trump saying he would recommend a $10,000 bonus for air traffic controllers who did not take off work during the shutdown. Daniels said he is willing to work with the Trump administration “on any issues that are out there.” However, Daniels also insisted he did not want air traffic controllers to be used as political pawns. “Air traffic controllers have continued to show up during the shutdown,” Daniels said. We're hearing from a senator who caucuses with Democrats and broke ranks to advance a funding measure to potentially end the government shutdown. Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine said he voted with Republicans because Democrats' goals were stalled. And in the meantime, a lot of collateral damage was happening. People's lives were being hurt,” he explained on CNN's “The Situation Room” this morning. “And so the question I was wrestling with is, if the tactic isn't working and there were no prospects that it was going to work, then let's move on, not make a lot of other people suffer in order to get a goal that wasn't attainable,” King said. King went on to discuss the benefits of the current deal, including “three appropriations bills” that he said weren't in the “original discussion.” He noted that one of them related to agriculture would keep SNAP benefits “safe” until next year. He added that Senate Majority Leader John Thune has also agreed to bring a bill drafted by Democrats on Affordable Care Act subsidies to the Senate floor for a vote. Asked if he believes the government will reopen this week, King said, “I do.” President Donald Trump demanded Monday that all air traffic controllers “get back to work, NOW,” warning that those who don't would face penalties while promising bonuses for those who have worked during the government shutdown. For those Air Traffic Controllers who were GREAT PATRIOTS, and didn't take ANY TIME OFF for the ‘Democrat Shutdown Hoax,' I will be recommending a BONUS of $10,000 per person for distinguished service to our Country,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, going on to add that those who didn't work “will have a negative mark, at least in my mind, against your record.” Trump's own Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has said controllers were considering taking second jobs to make ends meet. He had previously cited controllers talking about driving for rideshare companies like Uber or delivering food on DoorDash to pay bills. Trump on Monday also urged any controllers who wish to leave to do so, without “payment or severance of any kind,” adding that they would be replaced by “true patriots.” “For those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,” Trump wrote. “If you want to leave service in the near future, please do not hesitate to do so, with NO payment or severance of any kind! You will be quickly replaced by true Patriots,” he added. “If you want to know what the real fallout of this shutdown is, it's not a budget line, it is the smallest and the most dangerous shift of all– when the most disciplined safety workforce in America is forced to think about survival instead of public safety.” More air traffic control staffing problems were reported this past weekend than any other weekend since the start of the shutdown, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Aviation Administration operations plans. Air traffic controllers must work without pay during the shutdown, and have now received two $0 paychecks. “Air traffic controllers must show up day in and day out, fully prepared to handle the stress, pressure and the weight of their responsibilities to the American flying public and their safety…” Daniels said. The Trump administration told the Supreme Court today that it will continue to fight to withhold full food stamp benefits to states during the government shutdown, keeping in play a high-profile case that would likely be dismissed if federal agencies are reopened. The Trump administration is fighting a lower court order that required it to use $4 billion from another fund to full pay for SNAP benefits. On Friday, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson halted that court order temporarily – effectively allowing the administration to pay reduced benefits for a few days while courts consider the fast-moving case. Those reduced payments are being paid for with separate contingency funds. What may happen next: For now, Jackson's order blocking the full payments remains in effect – despite the appeals court ruling – through Tuesday night. If the government shutdown is not ended by then, Jackson could extend her order, or the full Supreme Court could decide what to do with Trump's emergency request. If government funds begin flowing again by Tuesday, then the appeal pending before the Supreme Court would likely be dismissed as moot. “That proposal, if ultimately adopted by both Houses of Congress and signed by the president, would end the shutdown and moot this application,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer told the Supreme Court in his letter. It's a busy day in Washington, DC, following last night's breakthrough vote in the Senate, where a funding measure advanced and put Congress on a path which will potentially end the longest government shutdown in US history. We'll keep you updated on this throughout the day, stay with us. Delays are reported for flights heading to Phoenix averaging more than two hours. Las Vegas is also reporting delays averaging 45 minutes, according to FAA advisories. An earlier ground stop was lifted for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport but delays are likely to continue. ET and the Air Route Traffic Control Center there, which deals with flights at high altitudes, is short-staffed until 1 p.m. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport also has a short-staffed tower until 3 p.m. The FAA TRACON for Chicago is also without its normal number of controllers today. There have been 607 reports of short staffing since October 1, more than six times as many as were reported on the same dates last year. “At least some Democrats now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks,” he said. Johnson said he will give a 36-hour notice to House members as soon as senators have final passage of the continuing resolution, or CR, in their chamber and send it for a vote in the House. “And we look forward to the government reopening this week so Congress can get back, get back to our regular legislative session. Will be there'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” he said. Johnson did not say mention when he would swear in Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva of Arizona. Dozens of major airports have implemented a government-mandated 4% reduction in flights and air traffic control staffing just experienced its worst weekend since the start of the government shutdown. So it's possible you may not have the smoothest travel experience while flying right now. “You really have to be an informed traveler right now,” Clint Henderson, managing editor of The Points Guy travel site, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday. He suggests considering options other than flying, such as taking Amtrak or driving to your destination. A key group of eight Senate Democratic centrists broke with party leaders, striking a deal with Senate Republicans and the White House. As we've been reporting, an end could be in sight for the shutdown after eight Democrats joined with Republicans on a key vote to advance a federal funding measure. One couple's travel plans went from bad to worse as they were left stranded on a highway during the Chicago snowstorm Monday morning. Grace Butler and her boyfriend were traveling on I-57 near Onarga, Illinois, when the snowy conditions took over and visibility was slim. “No visibility, road is covered with snow and ice. Have lived in Chicago my whole life and never seen a blizzard this bad,” Butler said. As of about 6 a.m. CT, Butler said they were finally able to begin driving again and have passed many cars in ditches along the way. Get a glimpse at what the conditions looked like: Delays due to staffing problems are already reported Monday morning, despite a potential deal to end the government shutdown and after the worst weekend for air traffic control staffing since the shutdown began. Flights headed to DFW will wait on the ground an average of 76 minutes. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport also has a short-staffed tower until 3 p.m. The city is getting hit with a snowstorm today which will also affect air travel. The FAA TRACON operations controlling flights approaching or departing Chicago are also without their normal number of controllers today. There have been 602 reports of short staffing since October 1, more than six times as many as were reported on the same dates last year.</p>

Fox News Digital spoke to Defending Education President Nicole Neily about schools across the country continuing to hide their DEI efforts from federal scrutiny and what her group is doing about it. As universities across the country have been accused of trying to hide their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to avoid federal scrutiny, Fox News Digital spoke to a leading parents' rights activist about how serious the problem is and what can be done about it. I put Princeton, Harvard, schools like that in that category, where they're just going to, you know, ‘hashtag resist' and do their thing. But those people are doing the same damn thing and just trying to wait the Trump administration out." Fox News Digital has extensively reported on schools in the first two buckets as defined by Neily, including at Washington University in St. Louis, where one of the nation's top medical schools was accused of moving the DEI office to a restricted floor rather than close it. Combating DEI at all levels of education will require a "whole of government" approach, Nicole Neily told Fox News Digital. Earlier this month, Princeton University was hit with a scathing federal complaint over a DEI agenda that allegedly involved female students sharing "gender-neutral" restrooms with gaps in the stalls, as well as graduations segregated by gender identity. At the University of Utah and University of Virginia, Fox News Digital reported on staffers being caught on hidden camera explaining their efforts to continue DEI efforts by simply rebranding or renaming them. "The third category are the schools that actually want to comply in good faith," Neily told Fox News Digital. She said she was recently at a university board conference where speakers on a DEI panel were openly calling for "inclusivity work" to be continued because the Trump administration "only cares about" Ivy League schools and "they can't sue us all." While many universities are resisting the Trump administration's crackdown on DEI programs, others are complying in good faith. "To me, that demonstrates real mens rea, which is Latin for a guilty mind," Neily said. "I think that shows that these people are the real evildoers and those are the ones where I think, obviously, the Trump administration has spent a lot of time over the past few months going after Harvard, going after Columbia, like the real bad actors that are out there trying to, you know that clearly have to be cleaned up. But I think that there is a much more significant and long-term effort to uproot and eradicate the DEI that is just trying to hide in plain sight. Defending Education recently sent a letter, first reported by Fox News Digital, to elected officials in all 50 states calling for a top-to-bottom audit of state laws at the K-12 level to ensure that no loopholes are being exploited, allowing schools to continue DEI efforts. Combating DEI at all levels of education will require a "whole of government" approach, Neily told Fox News Digital, adding that it will be important to not let administrators "whitewash their records" or pass the blame onto someone else for policies they have supported. Additionally, Neily expressed optimism that the tide is turning against DEI in terms of popularity. "I think we're at a moment where there is kind of a perfect storm taking place in academia. This incoming freshman class this year is the largest freshman class that American universities will ever have… Clearly, we have seen polling over the past couple years demonstrate a massive loss in public confidence in the institutions of higher education at a time when costs are through the roof, the return on investment for sending your child to some of these schools is horrible. So I think a lot of people are really rethinking, is this the correct track for me, period?" "We also have fewer international students coming in, thanks to the efforts of the Trump administration, and so I think what we're gonna see over the next several years is a number of universities that actually start to close. And how do those schools differentiate themselves in the marketplace?" Neily said she has witnessed students "vote with their feet" and choose to attend schools that don't promote "woke" ideologies, particularly in the South as students are looking for a "proper college experience." Earlier this year, Fox News Digital reported that several Southern states banded together to establish their own accrediting body for higher education in order to "upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels." "They don't wanna be surrounded by a bunch of pearl-clutching Victorian scolds that are going to reprimand them for using the wrong pronouns and for not wearing masks in the middle of the winter, and so we're watching people and some of those state schools in the South now, realizing, OK, we can get more out-of-state students coming in, paying higher out-of-state tuition," Neily said. "But it's also changing and altering what our campus life is like, and so we're also, from constituents in the South, they're now pushing for their in-state universities to put caps actually in the number of out-of-state students. And so, this is very much a kind of evolving landscape, but I think that there is a lot more change coming ahead in higher education. And for those higher ed administrators who have not started to really look in the mirror and think, what do we wanna be when we grow up? I think they're gonna be in for a world of hurt soon."

The Metropolitan Police Department is investigating three homicides that took place in the city on Saturday, Nov. 8. Washington, D.C., saw three homicides on Saturday night in a mere six-hour time span as President Donald Trump declared victory over what he called a "crisis" of crime in the nation's capital. A teenager and two adults were killed Saturday in three separate incidents that the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) is investigating as homicides, officials said. The spree is unusual as Trump's crime crackdown in the district has seen a decrease in overall crime. "We have a very safe city now," Trump said last week. "The country is going to be safe. We do it one at a time." National Guard members are seen in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 5, 2025. Medics rushed the teen to the hospital, where he died from his injuries, according to MPD. Homicide detectives have since taken over the case. About four hours later, at around 6:52 p.m., officers reported finding another teen boy who had been shot in the 700 block of Newton Place, Northwest. Police said the teen was found inside a home there, with a gunshot wound to the upper body. Medics tried to save him, but he died at the scene. Less than two hours later, at around 8:48 p.m., officers responded to a shooting in the 1400 block of 14th Place, Southeast, where they found a woman suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, according to MPD. People gather at the Navy Yard metro station to protest the deployment of National Guard troops and federal immigration agents in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 5, 2025. According to MPD data, as of Nov. 10, there were 122 homicides this year in Washington, D.C. In August, the president deployed more than 2,000 troops to combat crime.

(AP Photo) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Democratic senators — eight in total — faced almost instant blowback from members of their own party as they voted to allow the Senate to move forward on compromise legislation that would reopen the government. Their decision Sunday night was labeled a “betrayal” and “pathetic” by some of the most prominent voices in the Democratic Party. “To my mind, this was a very, very bad vote,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana praised them Monday morning, saying they “decided to put principle over their personal politics.” She had made it a priority to extend subsidies for health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, but she had also expressed reservations about voting to shut down the government. In the end, she settled for a pledge from Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota to hold a vote in December on the health subsidies. It was our best chance to reopen the government and immediately begin negotiations to extend the ACA tax credits that tens of millions of Americans rely on to keep costs down,” she said at a news conference following the Sunday night vote. Durbin is another senator who will be retiring after a long Senate career. 2 position in Democratic leadership and broke ranks with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York after saying that the shutdown had caused too much pain for the American people. In a statement before the vote, Durbin, who argued that Republicans are still to blame for the shutdown, said, “This bill is not perfect, but it takes important steps to reduce their shutdown's hurt. For him, the deciding factor was language in the funding bill that prevents President Donald Trump's administration from conducting more mass layoffs — an issue that is particularly important for his state. He called the agreement a “moratorium on mischief” and said he was only able to get the agreement as negotiations reached a crucial juncture. “The kinds of just non-strategic mass firings and (reduction in force actions) that have traumatized federal employees since Inauguration Day, they can't do them anymore,” Kaine said. Hassan, a former governor, had been involved with negotiations from early on and emphasized that the threats to federal food aid had made the situation more urgent. Hassan said she “heard from families about the deep pain that the government shutdown has caused, made worse by a president who illegally and repeatedly chose to cut off help for families who are just trying to buy groceries.” “After weeks of bipartisan conversations,” she said Sunday, “I voted today to reopen the government so that we can get back to the work of helping Granite Staters.” The government funding bill refills funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, as well as ensuring that states that spent their own funds to keep it running during the shutdown will be reimbursed. He had been voting since the outset to reopen the government, yet he also played a key role in the negotiations, including often hosting senators for talks in his Capitol basement office. After Republicans rejected a proposal from Schumer to extend the ACA tax credits for one year, King said it showed that the shutdown was not working. Rosen has grown increasingly irate as the shutdown has worn on and Republicans refused to give in to Democrats' demands on the ACA credits. As air travel was increasingly affected by the shutdown, the economy of her home state of Nevada, a political swing state, was also under threat. In a statement, Rosen said that Trump and fellow Republicans “are weaponizing their power in alarming ways to inflict unimaginable pain and suffering on working people, like fully withholding SNAP benefits and gutting our tourism industry by grinding air travel to a halt.” Cortez Masto is another Democrat who has been voting to reopen the government. Fetterman, who was elected in 2022, has also been voting to reopen the government, breaking with his party as he does on many other issues. He has criticized Democrats for using the shutdown to demand concessions on health care. “I'm sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven't been paid in weeks,” he said on social media.</p>

Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett reacts after a federal judge halted the Trump administration's plan to send National Guard troops to Portland and another ordered the reinstatement of SNAP benefits. As the Trump administration adds federal law enforcement focus to Portland, Oregon, local officials in neighboring areas are pushing back on the Department of Homeland Security and investigating their own police forces for alleged collaboration. Unrest in the Portland area grabbed President Donald Trump's attention over the summer – and by late September – he announced deployment of troops to the "war-ravaged" city – an effort that Trump-appointed Judge Karin Immergut blocked in October. Washington County, an area home to about 600,000 people immediately west of Portland, declared a state of emergency last week in response to DHS' increased enforcement in the area. The move opens up $200,000 in emergency funding to help community organizations that serve impacted residents, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB). An immigrations rights group official was one of several residents to complain about ICE ramping up enforcement, telling OPB that her organization was receiving 100 phone calls on the matter daily and that broken glass is "everywhere" from ICE officers breaking car windows to detain occupants. County Commissioner Nafisa Fai told the outlet that residents may benefit from moratoriums on evictions and having their electricity shut off over nonpayment if breadwinners in their family are taken away by ICE. Meanwhile, in nearby Eugene – the state's third-largest city – the police department will reportedly be subject to independent review over allegations that officers aided or coordinated with federal immigration authorities. The Eugene Police Auditor, an agency independent of the force itself, will be conducting a "complete and thorough investigation," according to Eugene's CBS affiliate, citing an auditor's office official. The issue arose after residents complained that Eugene police were not following Oregon's sanctuary state laws. "Eugene Police Department has nothing to do with immigration, nor with raids [Wednesday]," said Melinda McLaughlin – adding that images on social media from the events of the week are not Eugene police officers. After a Eugene-area ICE raid last week, several lawmakers slammed the feds for "violent detentions" and allegations the suspects were not given full due process. Rep. Val Hoyle, D-Ore., Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., state House Speaker Julie Fahey, D-Eugene, and state Senate leader James Manning Jr., D-Eugene, said they were "alarmed" by ICE's enforcement actions. A Federal Protective Service police officer guards the gate of an ICE facility in Portland, Oregon. "This was only the most recent in a series of aggressive raids carried out across the state in recent months. We are working together with community leaders and local law enforcement to learn more and ensure that all of our constituents are accounted for," they said in a letter signed by several other lawmakers.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he is prepared to hold another face-to-face meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, signaling Moscow's interest in keeping diplomatic channels open even as it refuses to shift its terms for ending the Ukraine war. The offer was delivered to the state news agency RIA Novosti and first reported by Reuters on Sunday. "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and I understand the need for regular communication," Lavrov said. That is why we communicate by telephone and are ready to hold face-to-face meetings when necessary." The diplomatic movement comes days after a major Russian weapons test that raised tensions further, when President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia had conducted a "successful test of a nuclear-powered underwater torpedo." Two days later, on Oct. 31, the United States canceled a planned Budapest summit between President Donald Trump and President Putin following Russia's firm stance on hard-line demands regarding Ukraine.

(Mikhail Klimentyev, Kremlin Pool Photo via AP) Since early this year, the two sides have held several rounds of talks. On Feb. 18 in Riyadh, Rubio and Lavrov led delegations that agreed to restore normal diplomatic mission operations and set up technical teams. The pair met again on July 10 in Kuala Lumpur, where Rubio delivered what he called a "frank" message conveying Trump's frustration at Russia's lack of flexibility. On Sept. 24, during the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Rubio pressed Moscow again to take "meaningful steps toward a durable resolution," according to a State Department readout. A Russian journalist speaking from Moscow on condition of anonymity told Fox News Digital that the nuclear test should be read as political signaling. Nuclear test turmoil is a diplomatic lever and nothing more," he said.

(Russian Foreign Ministry Press Service telegram channel via AP) He added that the Kremlin remains committed to its objectives in Ukraine. "The Kremlin still wants to reach the objective of the ‘special military operation' and is going to play it at a steady pace until Ukraine crumbles or something else happens." Rumors that Lavrov had fallen out of favor intensified when he missed a major Kremlin meeting. But on Nov. 7, the Kremlin "dismissed speculation," Reuters reported. And it says a lot that Lavrov is not in disgrace. He added that Lavrov publicly addressed several issues yesterday, "so he is apparently sitting at the Foreign Ministry chair firmly." Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrives for an event in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Thursday, May 1, 2025. Lavrov also reiterated Russia's conditions for ending the war, Reuters reported. According to Reuters, he said, "No one questions the territorial integrity of Russia and the choice of the residents of Crimea, Donbas and Novorossiya," and noted that Moscow is waiting for U.S. confirmation that earlier "Anchorage agreements" on frozen assets remain in force. did not respond to a request for comment before publication time.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Senate cleared a major hurdle toward reopening the government Sunday night, when eight Democrats joined with Republicans on a key vote to advance a federal funding measure. There are still a number of steps ahead to end the historic shutdown – with lots of uncertainty on timing. But party leaders believe lawmakers will, indeed, end the stalemate this week. Now, senators need to agree on how long to debate before voting on the final bill. This could move quickly, or be held up by senators who want to drag out the process. For example, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who voted against advancing the measure, wants a vote on an amendment related to hemp grown in his state. Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it “remains to be seen” when the Senate will be able to vote on final passage of the bill, though he hopes it passes early this week. So that means if the government were to shut down again over the next few months, key federal food assistance known as SNAP would continue to be funded. Members of the House were advised to expect votes this week. House Speaker Mike Johnson has to sell this package to his razor-thin majority, and he'll likely need the president's help to muscle it through his fractious conference. Praising the Senate for reaching a deal to reopen the government and warning his members to make their way back to Washington, Johnson said Monday: “I'm stating the obvious all my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats in the House, you need to begin right now, returning to the Hill. “At least some Democrats,” he said, “now finally appear ready to do what Republicans and President Trump and millions of hard-working American people have been asking them to do for weeks.” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, however, has vowed to fight the package because it does not go as far as he wanted on Democrats' health care demands, so it's not yet clear how many House Democrats will help Johnson approve it. House Democrats are set to huddle as a caucus on Monday, according to a personal familiar with the discussions. And a Democratic source familiar expects some in the party will cross lines to support it, though it remains to be seen how many. Once passed in the House, the bill will go to President Donald Trump's desk for his signature. The full bill includes a larger funding package negotiated between the two parties and a stopgap through January 30. The broader legislative package would include three full-year appropriations bills that deal with military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch and the Department of Agriculture. That includes $203.5 million in new funding to enhance security measures and protection for members of Congress, in addition to $852 million for US Capitol Police, per a summary of the bill to fund the legislative branch provided by top Democratic appropriator Sen. Patty Murray. Behind the scenes, Senate Democrats who backed the deal to reopen the government said Trump's increasing opposition in recent days to extending expiring enhanced Obamacare subsidies – a key sticking point for the Democratic Party – forced them to change their position and accept a compromise to end an indefinite government shutdown, according to sources familiar with their thinking.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump's on-again-off-again pick to run NASA, billionaire Jared Isaacman, outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency. While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he said in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN. In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman said that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.” “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads. Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency. Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country. As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice flown to orbit on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA's top role. Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants. But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he's perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era. CNN previously reported that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he's said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.) CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.” “To protect our nation's innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration's chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said. Warner, whose state houses NASA's Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.” No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman's confirmation. One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.” SpaceX's plan, which CEO Elon Musk discussed publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel. Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for RealClearScience that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.” Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.” With this summer's “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research. When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his inaugural address while staying silent on NASA's ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon. Isaacman echoed Trump's Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA's moon program. The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX's Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface. But some policy experts have grown increasingly concerned that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA's urgent timeline. Duffy recently signaled a willingness to boot SpaceX off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers. Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman's, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “Sean Dummy.” Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander. The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement. One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation's ability to gather crucial environmental data. The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA's initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects. Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a pair of Mars missions were lost. And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman's Athena document suggests it can, he said. “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn't had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said. Isaacman's social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?” Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.” Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been reeling from looming budget cuts and what employees have described as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership. Isaacman's document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA's boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency's approach to risk assessment. Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency. However, he cautioned that “it's really hard to know in the moment if you're going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It's a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.” Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change. In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump's proposed cuts to research. In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.” More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A 62-page document written by President Donald Trump's on-again-off-again pick to run NASA, billionaire Jared Isaacman, outlines a sweeping, ambitious, and at times controversial plan for the space agency. While Isaacman has publicly acknowledged the leaked document, which is labeled May 2025 but was recently leaked to several news outlets, he said in a social media post that “parts of it are now dated.” He did not specify which portions were obsolete. A copy of the document was obtained and authenticated by CNN. In his statement, which was posted the day of his renomination, Isaacman said that “Project Athena,” as the paper is titled, “was always intended to be a living document refined through data gathering post-confirmation.” “I would think it is better to have a plan going into a responsibility as great as the leadership of NASA than no plan at all,” the statement reads. Among the proposed goals are revamping some NASA centers to focus on nuclear electric propulsion, establishing a new Mars exploration program, and embracing an “accelerate/fix/delete” philosophy to reshape the agency. Some lawmakers have also expressed concern about how Isaacman might seek to reform NASA campuses across the country. As a tech CEO — who made his fortune by founding payments company Shift4 at age 16 and has twice flown to orbit on self-funded SpaceX missions — Isaacman is an unorthodox pick for NASA's top role. Space agency administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics and public servants. But Isaacman has also garnered broad support within the commercial space industry, where he's perceived as an energetic outsider ready to usher NASA into a new era. CNN previously reported that Duffy has said privately that he would like to hold the space chief title permanently, according to a source familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for Duffy previously denied that he's said he wishes to remain in the NASA administrator job, and Isaacman said in his social media statement, posted after the “Project Athena” document was leaked, that he believes Duffy has “great instincts and is an excellent communicator.” (The spokesperson for Duffy did not offer comment for this story.) CNN reached out to nearly a dozen senators whose home states have NASA centers that could be pegged for major changes, according to the Project Athena document. Van Hollen said in a statement that he had met with Isaacman earlier this year and he “looks forward to another hearing to discuss further with him why the next space race and the search for habitable planets runs through Maryland.” “To protect our nation's innovation leadership, he must be more than a rubber stamp for the Administration's chainsaw approach to our space science initiatives,” Van Hollen said. Warner, whose state houses NASA's Langley campus, urged Isaacman to “engage with Congress and reconsider any plan that threatens these world-class facilities and the communities that depend on them.” No lawmaker reached by CNN indicated how they intended to vote on Isaacman's confirmation. One eye-popping proposal in Project Athena is to set up a new Mars program, dubbed “Olympus.” SpaceX's plan, which CEO Elon Musk discussed publicly in May, “was going to be a more-or-less free mission that SpaceX was going to do anyway,” the source said. The document also includes numerous mentions of setting up an expansive program to pursue nuclear electric propulsion — which involves powering spacecraft engines with electricity from small nuclear reactors. The technology could one day provide steady, long-lasting power for faster and more flexible deep-space missions, including Mars travel. Isaacman has pushed publicly for expanding such research, writing in an August op-ed for RealClearScience that he coauthored with Newt Gingrich that the space agency should focus on tasks and research “no other agency, organization, or company is capable of accomplishing.” Nuclear electric propulsion is an example of such a focus area, the op-ed argues. China and Russia are investing heavily in nuclear space technologies. When contacted for comment, a spokesperson for Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said Tuberville had not met with Isaacman yet but he “will, of course, ask about Marshall.” With this summer's “Big Beautiful Bill” expressly extending the SLS program through at least the next four missions, it appears Isaacman may delay implementing a bold new focus on nuclear electric propulsion research. When the Project Athena document was drafted in early 2025, Trump had already signaled a renewed interest in Mars — even mentioning exploration of the planet in his inaugural address while staying silent on NASA's ongoing efforts to return astronauts to the moon. Isaacman echoed Trump's Mars ambitions during a confirmation hearing in April, saying he intended to pursue exploration of the red planet in tandem with NASA's moon program. The Artemis III mission, which is slated to launch later this decade, currently hinges on SpaceX's Starship ferrying NASA astronauts down to the lunar surface. But some policy experts have grown increasingly concerned that Starship — the most powerful rocket ever built — is too large, novel and complex to meet NASA's urgent timeline. Duffy recently signaled a willingness to boot SpaceX off the project, saying he would ask the company and its chief competitor, Blue Origin, to show how they could expedite development of their respective lunar landers. Those remarks prompted an acerbic response from Musk, a friend of Isaacman's, who referred to the interim NASA leader as “Sean Dummy.” Isaacman has not publicly said whether he would support sidelining SpaceX from the Artemis III mission. But a source familiar with the matter said that Isaacman has expressed an intention to partner with whichever company most quickly produces an astronaut-worthy lunar lander. The Project Athena “plan never favored any one vendor, never recommended closing centers, or directed the cancellation of programs before objectives were achieved,” Isaacman said in his social media statement. One line item in the document, for example, states that Isaacman intends to take “NASA out of the taxpayer funded climate science business and leave it for academia to determine” — a proposal that critics say said could impede the nation's ability to gather crucial environmental data. The document also maps out similar policies that could be applied across many of NASA's initiatives, such as recommendations to embrace “science-as-service” for future projects. Similar policy philosophies have been tried at NASA, particularly in the 1990s during a “better, faster, cheaper reformulation,” Dreier noted. But enthusiasm waned for that approach when a pair of Mars missions were lost. And the commercial space industry may not be in a position to take up all the tasks Isaacman's Athena document suggests it can, he said. “It places a lot of faith on the commercial marketplace to deliver in ways that it hasn't had the chance to fully be tested on,” Dreier said. Isaacman's social media statement also acknowledges his “science-as-a-service” concept “got people fired up” but clarified that he intended to focus on purchasing data from Earth observation satellites: “Why build bespoke satellites at greater cost and delay when you could pay for the data as needed from existing providers and repurpose the funds for more planetary science missions (as an example)?” Isaacman said in his social media statement last week that he wishes to move away from rolling out piecemeal change and instead implement “a single, data-driven reorganization aimed at reducing layers of bureaucracy between leadership and the engineers, researchers, and technicians.” Extensive changes, however, could further disgruntle a workforce that has been reeling from looming budget cuts and what employees have described as political distractions and discordant communication from leadership. Isaacman's document also details myriad other plans to change how the agency operates — such as conducting a sweeping review of NASA's boards and committees to suspend any that “delay decision making,” and reimagine the space agency's approach to risk assessment. Former NASA astronaut and SpaceX advisor Garrett Reisman, who has long said he believes NASA may have become too risk-averse in the wake of the 2003 Columbia disaster, told CNN in a November 8 phone interview he was encouraged to see that Isaacman hopes to reevaluate that aspect of the agency. However, he cautioned that “it's really hard to know in the moment if you're going too far or not,” Reisman said. “It's a very difficult thing to do, so I wish him good luck.” Isaacman is generally well regarded across the space industry, where he has largely been viewed as a passionate leader who can enact visionary change. In an emailed statement, Dreier, the Planetary Society executive, acknowledged that the Project Athena document “was prepared in a different era.” NASA has since received billions of dollars for projects including lunar exploration, Dreier noted, and science advocates have demonstrated an outpouring of opposition to Trump's proposed cuts to research. In his social media post, Isaacman said that, if the Project Athena document becomes public, “I will stand behind it,” adding that he believes “there are many elements of the plan that the space community and NASA would find exciting.” More broadly, Isaacman has suggested he intends to enter the NASA job with an open mind and adjust course based on feedback.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) and other progressives are fed up with Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) after a group of senators, which did not include the Senate Democratic leader, voted with Republicans to take a step toward ending the government shutdown. “Senator Schumer is no longer effective and should be replaced,” Khanna wrote on X. “If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?” We need to stand up for the health care of ordinary Americans.” Khanna added that he believes donors and the “establishment” will not like him speaking out, but he is confident that his social media following will back him. The deal reached, which prompted eight Senate Democrats to vote with Republicans, included a December vote on the Obamacare healthcare subsidies that Democrats had called for and a pledge to reverse thousands of planned layoffs announced by the White House since Oct. 1. “I again voted to re-open the government, resume vital services for Maine people, put people back to work, feed the hungry and secure an opportunity to avoid a harmful hike in health care costs,” Sen. Angus King (I-ME) wrote on X. Other progressive Democrats also expressed their unhappiness with the concession publicly. “The average monthly SNAP benefit is $177 a person,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) wrote on X. People want us to hold the line for a reason. “Working people want leaders whose word means something,” she added. “Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership,” Moulton wrote. “If @ChuckSchumer were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote ‘No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare. Maybe now @EdMarkey will finally join me in pledging not to vote for Schumer?” Earlier this year, Schumer withstood calls to step down after he supported a Republican spending bill that he called “certainly bad.” Multiple House Democrats, including Reps. Glenn Ivey (D-MD) and Delia Ramirez (D-IL), suggested he should step down. I think he had a great, long-standing career,” Ivey said then. “But I'm afraid that it may be time for the Senate Democrats to get a new leader.” “Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. And now, Democrats are hoping it's his last shutdown as Senate minority leader. “Chuck Schumer has failed us,” Iowa state Sen. Zach Wahls, a Democrat who is running for Sen. Joni Ernst's seat, wrote on X.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Supreme Court building is seen, June 27, 2024, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether states can continue to count late-arriving mail ballots, which have been a target of President Donald Trump. The justices took up an appeal from Mississippi after a panel of three judges nominated by the Republican president on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the state law allowing ballots that arrive shortly after Election Day to be counted violated federal law. Mississippi is among 18 states and the District of Columbia that accept mailed ballots received after Election Day as long as the ballots are postmarked on or before that date, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The list includes swing states such as Nevada and states such as Colorado, Oregon and Utah that rely heavily on mail voting. An additional 14 states allow the counting of late-arriving ballots from some eligible voters, including overseas U.S. service members and their families, according to a filing from Democratic-led states that urged the justices to reverse the appellate ruling. A final ruling almost certainly will come by late June, early enough to govern the counting of ballots in the 2026 midterm congressional elections. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a Republican, told the Supreme Court that the appellate ruling “will have destabilizing nationwide ramifications” if left in place. “The stakes are high: ballots cast by — but received after — election day can swing close races and change the course of the country,” Fitch wrote. Trump has claimed that late-arriving ballots and drawn-out electoral counts undermine confidence in elections. In March, the Republican president signed an executive order on elections that aims to require votes to be “cast and received” by Election Day. The order has been challenged in court. A federal judge dismissed a similar challenge to Nevada's law, but the decision has been appealed. The Supreme Court is separately considering reviving a lawsuit filed by Rep. Mike Bost, R-Ill., and backed by the Trump administration that challenges Illinois' ballot receipt law. Some Republican-led states, including Kansas and North Dakota, have taken steps to stop counting late-arriving ballots. In Ohio, Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation that would require ballots to be received by Election Day, closing the window for mailed ballots. In the Mississippi case, Judge Andrew Oldham wrote for the appellate panel that Congress established a “singular” Election Day for members of Congress and presidential electors, “by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.” Judges James Ho and Stuart Kyle Duncan joined Oldham's opinion invalidating the Mississippi law. The ruling reversed a decision by U.S. District Judge Louis Guirola Jr., who had held that there was no conflict between the state and federal laws. “All that occurs after election day is the delivery and counting of ballots cast on or before election day,” wrote Guirola, who was nominated by President George W. Bush, a Republican.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This image released by Heritage Auctions shows the hat worn by Margaret Hamilton in “The Wizard of Oz.” (Heritage Auctions via AP)Margaret Hamilton Just in time for the theatrical release of “Wicked: For Good,” fans will get a chance to own memorabilia from the 1939 original film, “The Wizard of Oz,” and one item is especially witchy. Heritage Auctions is putting an iconic black hat that Margaret Hamilton wore as the Wicked Witch of the West up for sale. The wool hat is quite large, measuring nearly 14-inches high with a 19.5-inch diameter brim. It also has a 22-inch elastic chin strap worn by Hamilton during flying scenes to keep it secure. Designed by costume designer Adrian Adolph Greenburg, who went by Gilbert Adrian professionally, the hat was put to use after filming began because the one originally chosen didn't appear scary enough. “When Dorothy Gale becomes Dorothy of Oz, it's when she puts on the ruby slippers,” said Joe Maddalena, EVP of Heritage Auctions. Also hitting the auction block are a “The Wizard of Oz” book signed by Garland, who also wrote a lengthy inscription. It has autographs by other main cast members, including Toto's actual paw prints. Two different versions of Dorothy's ruby slippers will be auctioned. One, a right-foot shoe worn by Garland during rehearsals, is adorned with crimson-burgundy glass bugle beads. A replica of the ruby slippers made by Western Costume Company for the film's 50th anniversary, will also be for sale. The latter were made using Garland's original shoe form and have red sequins and rhinestone bows. These shoes, said Maddalena, “are as close as you're ever going to get to owning a pair of ruby slippers that weren't screen-used.” A handwritten letter written by “Oz” author Frank Baum on personal stationary and an organza blouse worn on screen by Garland will also sell. Last year, Heritage sold a different pair of ruby slippers from the film for $28 million.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? What a president for Gen Alpha might be like. The people who serve as president during one's childhood necessarily shape one's view of the office; my early conception of American political parties, for example, came largely from Presidents George H.W. Trump has been either serving as president or seeking the presidency for a decade at this point, and he has approached the job, shall we say, differently than his predecessors. From assuming control over congressionally appropriated funding to posting a video of himself bombing protesters with poop to demolishing the East Wing of the White House, Trump's actions in office have upended previous ideas about what constitutes presidential behavior. A newsletter about kids — for everyone, from senior correspondent Anna North. To find out how, if at all, Trump's break-stuff approach to the presidency has affected young people's ideas of who the president is and how a head of state should act, I reached out to teachers, students, and experts around the country. There's some evidence that Trump's consolidation of power is affecting how kids and teens growing up right now see the role of the president, with potentially disturbing consequences for the future of checks and balances. At the same time, some young voters who were kids during Trump's first term tell a different story — one of a historically unpopular leader whose time in office pushed them to imagine something different. Now a 20-year-old Florida college student who volunteers with the state's Democratic Party, she told me that the most important quality a president should have is integrity. “They're supposed to be a public servant,” she said. A lot of young voters cast their ballots for Trump in 2024, leading some to wonder if growing up during Trump 1.0 had pushed youth to the right. But experts say it's more complicated than that (a complexity that big Democratic wins among youth in 2025 may bear out). Now the next generation of Americans is looking for a candidate they can trust. “Gen Z and younger voters would be interested in someone that's actually responsive to them,” Alexandria Davis, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University (and Gen Z voter) told me. Kids start to have some conception of government as early as kindergarten, but really begin to understand politics in middle or high school, Christopher Ojeda, a political science professor at University of California Merced, told me last year. Now, many Gen Alpha voters, born between 2010 and 2024, are getting their political education during Trump 2.0. To some degree, the current occupant of the White House is shaping what young people see as presidential — and even what they see as legal. Shari Conditt, a high school government and history teacher in Washington state, asks her students to vote every Tuesday on a question of the day. She asked them recently if federal law allows the president to deploy National Guard troops without state approval, something Trump has tried to do in Illinois. However, 48.5 percent of Conditt's students voted that the move was permitted by law, while only 24.2 percent said it wasn't. For young people, “being socialized under the Trump presidency kind of sets a new precedent that the executive can effectively do whatever they want,” Davis said. Growing up in a time of extreme political polarization also means kids and young people may not be learning about bipartisanship. Kids and teens aren't necessarily learning that those branches can serve as checks on one another, because all three are pretty much moving in lockstep with Trump right now. For years, Conditt's students — in a purple congressional district that has elected both Republican and Democratic representatives in the past — would come to class eager to talk about current events, she said. College students may have a deeper sense than younger kids and teens that Trump's presidency, in particular, is abnormal. Among undergraduates Davis teaches at VCU, “there is an understanding that this is not necessarily how these things are supposed to work,” she said. “When I was really little, people would say they wanted to be president like Barack Obama,” Probst told me. They're not supposed to be using the presidency as a whim.” At the same time, a lot of young people are disillusioned with politics as a whole — not just with Trump. Gen Z voters “largely feel like both parties are not really fighting for them at all,” Davis said. “There is a sense of political alienation that younger voters, but specifically younger voters of color, feel about the political system.” A lot of Gen Z voters are struggling with very basic economic concerns, Davis said: “Will I be able to get a job and be successful in my life? They want to see a candidate who can relate to those fears, which might mean someone younger than today's political leaders, who simply haven't faced the same level of economic and global uncertainty as Gen Z. Among Davis's students, Zohran Mamdani comes up a lot as the kind of candidate they'd like to see in the future. Young voters, especially women, helped propel Democrats to victory across the country. Trump's gains with Gen Z in 2024, coupled with high-profile examples of young political operatives espousing virulent racism and antisemitism, have led some to wonder if growing up under Trump's first presidency had pushed a generation toward the radical right. But a more complex story is also emerging, one of young people worried for their futures and frustrated with the political process, but potentially eager for something different. In a spring 2025 Harvard Youth Poll, for example, just 15 percent of Americans under 30 said the country was heading in the right direction, and under a third approved of Trump or either party in Congress. Concerns about the economy pushed many Gen Z voters to support Trump last year, Davis said, but she's seeing that support change as fears over civil rights come to the fore. “Those things that were being considered in 2024 have kind of shifted,” Davis said. “I think we need to, as a whole, refocus on building the working class back up and lessening wage inequality in the United States,” she said. Whoever the next president is, however, Probst maintains an idea of what a president should be that is, in some ways, defined in opposition to Trump. “I don't want them making erratic claims or attempting to alienate groups of people using their personal social media,” she said. Children in the Chicago area are being traumatized by ICE patrols and use of tear gas as part of the Trump administration's “Operation Midway Blitz,” teachers and families say. Dozens of Head Start centers, including all centers in Little Rock, Arkansas, have closed thanks to a lack of federal funding during the government shutdown. American children have long used words like “satnav” and “petrol” thanks to Peppa Pig. Now, more British kids are apparently using Americanisms after watching Netflix and YouTube. My older kid is now revisiting old favorite Eerie Elementary, reading independently this time. We are also excited for Broken, the new picture book by X. Fang, who wrote the perfect We Are Definitely Human. Last month, I wrote about families getting landline phones for their kids. Reader Kate Ellen wrote from Wales to express surprise “because phone companies here are closing down landlines for private customers. We lost ours last year.” Without reliable cell phone service in the countryside, Kate Ellen has taught her kids to use the phone at a nearby nursing home if there's ever an emergency. “It may be because of my generation,” she wrote, “but even if our signal was better, I don't like this change, and I don't feel comfortable not having the landline.” Thanks to Kate Ellen, and a reminder that if you want to share questions or stories, or suggest topics for a future newsletter, you can reach me at anna.north@vox.com. ﻿The Court has made a hash of its religion decisions.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The court denied a request by the Trump administration to block a district court's previous ruling that full SNAP benefits were to be paid to all 42 million recipients during the shutdown. Moreover, the circuit court also issued a scathing criticism of the Trump administration, stating that the issues stemming from the lack of SNAP benefits distribution “could have been avoided.” And it was also critical of the administration's request for a stay to withhold SNAP benefits. “As the district court found, ‘this is a problem that could have been avoided. “The record here shows that the government sat on its hands for nearly a month, unprepared to make partial payments, while people who rely on SNAP received no benefits a week into November and counting,” wrote the First Circuit Court. “In light of these unique facts, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in requiring full payment of November SNAP benefits to effectuate the October 31 temporary restraining order after the government had failed to comply with it.” The court was also critical of the administration's request for a stay to withhold SNAP benefits, claiming that “the government has failed to show it is entitled to the extraordinary relief of a stay. It has not made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits. “We do not take lightly the government's concern that money used to fund November SNAP payments will be unavailable for other important nutrition assistance programs,” read comments by the First Circuit Court. “But we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the overwhelming evidence of widespread harm that a stay would cause right now, by leaving tens of millions of Americans without food as winter approaches, outweighed the potential monetary harm to the government and CNP, months into the future. However, due to last week's ruling by Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the circuit court's ruling was on hold from going into effect for 48 hours, which, at this point, would be late Tuesday night.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dick Durbin (D-IL), John Fetterman (D-PA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Angus King (I-ME), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) were the Democrats who joined the GOP in voting to break the filibuster. Many of them repeated the same talking points in their messaging, often pushing a class warfare narrative with frequent mentions of billionaires. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he was voting “no” because of the “Republican-made healthcare crisis.” “America is in the midst of a Republican-made healthcare crisis — a crisis so severe, so urgent, and so devastating for American families that I cannot support a continuing resolution that fails to address it,” Schumer said. Schumer's colleague from New York, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), echoed his sentiments about healthcare costs. “I cannot support this deal, which fails to address the needs of 20 million Americans facing skyrocketing healthcare costs,” she said in a post on X. She then elaborated with a message posted to her account. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) said he would not support the bill because it would “double healthcare” costs and cause “50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year.” “I'm voting no on the continuing resolution that would double healthcare premiums for 20 million Americans, kick 15 million people off Medicaid & allow 50,000 Americans to die unnecessarily every year,” Sanders posted. “All to give $1 trillion in tax breaks for billionaires.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has been an outspoken critic of the shutdown and has frequently mentioned healthcare costs resulting from the expiring Obamacare subsidies. She echoed those sentiments on Sunday night, explaining her vote against the bill by claiming the country was in a “healthcare emergency.” “I will not support a deal that does nothing to make healthcare more affordable,” Warren posted. A simple one-year extension of these tax credits would cost less than Donald Trump's $40 billion bailout for Argentina. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) said he was also voting against the bill because of healthcare costs that were “hurting the people” in his state. As I've always said, I will not support a government funding bill that continues to raise our costs, jeopardizes our health care, and hurts the people of my state.I'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for Americans who are counting on us to lower their… “As I've always said, I will not support a government funding bill that continues to raise our costs, jeopardizes our healthcare, and hurts the people of my state,” Booker said. “I'm urging my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up for Americans who are counting on us to lower their costs, and address the urgent, and–in too many cases–dire challenges people are facing in our country.” “I will not let up in this fight,” he added. “I just voted against this funding bill because healthcare costs are skyrocketing,” Kelly posted on his X account. “I have been clear on this from the beginning: I will not turn my back on the 24 million Americans who will see their premiums more than double if we don't extend these tax credits.” “At a time when prices are already too high, Americans are shopping for health insurance and experiencing such sticker shock that they are being forced to sign up for a crappy, overpriced plan or not signing up for insurance at all,” he added. Gallego then slammed Republicans for working to reopen the government because the deal agreed to Sunday night pits “working people against each other.” “It is disgusting that Republicans have put the country in the place where they are pitting working people against each other — a family at a food bank versus a family that relies on the premium tax credits to get good medical care,” Gallego said. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) also cited healthcare costs as a reason for her vote against the bill and blamed Republicans for the crisis. “I voted against this budget bill because it does not prevent health insurance premiums from doubling for so many Americans. In every other budget impasse or shutdown there were negotiations and compromise with the White House. On Sunday night, he said he was voting no because of high healthcare costs and, like his Democratic Senate colleagues, blamed it on Republicans.</p>
