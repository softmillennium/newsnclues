The Supreme Court has declined to hear a bid from anti-LGBTQ activist Kim Davis to challenge its landmark 2015 decision legalizing gay marriage nationwide. The High Court dismissed Davis's petition without comment on Monday. Further, one of the judges who ruled in the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, was replaced with conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Thomas indicated in his opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson that he wanted the Court to revisit Obergefell, and Davis's challenge directly cited Thomas's words. However, other conservative justices have indicated otherwise in recent months. Alito recently criticized the decision in a lecture, but said that he didn't think it should be overruled due to “respect afforded” to precedent. Davis, represented by right-wing group Liberty Counsel, had filed the appeal seeking to avoid paying hefty fees in relation to her anti-LGBTQ activism. Her legal counsel has argued that Davis's declining to issue a license to same-sex couples is a right afforded to her under the First Amendment, even though legal experts have said that public officials have those rights suspended in order to perform their roles on behalf of the government. Davis's legal challenge framed her as a “victim” of the Obergefell decision, adding that her case was a “unique opportunity” to revisit and overturn the decision. The Supreme Court's decision was praised by LGBTQ advocates. The Supreme Court made clear today that refusing to respect the constitutional rights of others does not come without consequences,” said Human Rights Campaign President Kelley Robinson in a statement.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Decision to advance bill that would reopen government has sparked furor from party and base; House speaker says he will call lawmakers back as soon as Senate holds final vote Senate Democrats who defected in shutdown vote: ‘This was the only deal' “What happened tonight is not the closing of a chapter. What the chapter does close is the damaging shutdown that is only getting worse, that is only going to impact more and more people,” said Angus King, the Independent lawmaker from Maine who caucuses with Democrats. “Congress has one month to engage in serious, bipartisan negotiations to extend the Affordable Care Act's expiring tax cuts for health insurance,” Hassan wrote in a statement, referring to the vote that GOP lawmakers promised Democrats. “My Democratic colleagues and I have been ready to work on this for months. Meanwhile, senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who was part of the small faction of Democrats in the upper chamber who voted in favor of the original House-passed funding bill on several occasions, said that “it should've never come to this,” referring to the ongoing 40-day shutdown. ““I'm sorry to our military, SNAP recipients, gov workers, and Capitol Police who haven't been paid in weeks,” he added. None of the Democratic senators who voted yes on Sunday's procedural motion are up for re-election in 2026. Christine Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi's daughter, has announced that she is running for a California state senate seat, ending speculation that she might run for the seat long held by her mother in the House. “Fighting for consumer rights, women's rights, gun violence survivors, immigrants and our most vulnerable communities against the threat we face.” Nancy Pelosi announced last week that she would not seek re-election. Her daughter is an attorney and Democratic party organizer, and is running for the seat currently held by state senator Scott Wiener, who is one of those running for Pelosi's congressional seat. In a development that is sure to breathe new life into the saga of the Epstein files, a spokesman for Republican House speaker Mike Johnson said he plans to swear in newly elected Democratic representative Adelita Grijalva as soon as the chamber returns to session, likely later this week. Grijalva was elected in a September special election to a seat representing southern Arizona that her late father, Raúl Grijalva, held for more than two decades. At the time, Johnson was keeping the House recessed in an effort to pressure Democrats to pass a government funding bill through the Senate, and said he would swear her in once he called the chamber back into session – which he would only do once Democrats renewed government funding. Grijalva is expected to be the 218th signature on a petition that will force a vote in the House on a bill to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier and convicted sex offender who died six years ago while facing sex trafficking charges. Epstein was a one-time associate of Donald Trump, and while campaigning last year, the president and his allies flirted with conspiracies that Epstein was at the center of a conspiracy to procure minors for abuse by global elites. An uproar began in July when the justice department announced that it would not reveal further details about the Epstein case, leading to a push by congressional Democrats to release files related to his prosecution, which they believe will shed more light on his ties. While Trump has sought to release some documents related to the case, he opposes release of the files, calling them a “Democrat hoax”. “There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us,” Johnson said. Donald Trump has threatened legal action against the BBC and welcomed the resignations of two of its most senior figures after a campaign against the broadcaster that reached fever pitch over criticism that its flagship documentary programme in 2024 used a misleading edit of a Trump speech. The report criticised BBC coverage on transgender issues, Israel's war in Gaza and an edit of a Trump speech from January 6 during the Capitol Hill insurrection. “Thank you to The Telegraph for exposing these Corrupt ‘Journalists.' These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. The leaked BBC report said the current affairs Panorama documentary had “completely misled” viewers by splicing two parts of Trump's speech together. Trump in fact gave conflicting advice that day to supporters, who he had called on to gather in the capital as part of his efforts to discredit his election loss based on false claims of widespread fraud. I'm grateful that the end is in sight, but I would encourage every member of this body, Democrat or Republican, pro bill or anti bill, not to stand in the way of our being able to deliver the coming relief quickly. The American people have suffered for long enough. The compromise bill that emerged yesterday funds the government through January, but does not include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that Democrats had demanded. As Democratic senators who broke ranks from their party continue to face heat from most of their colleagues, senator Jeanne Shaheen, of New Hampshire, defended her decision in an interview with CNN today. “We need to get the government open because we have millions of Americans who are suffering, whether it's because they're not getting their food benefits or because travelers can't get their flights,” she said. The lawmaker, who is retiring in 2026, said she was confident that Republicans were “willing to come to the table” when it comes to a vote on the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are notably missing from the bill Shaheen, and others, agreed to advance. We'll see if they are really going to work with us to make sure that Americans can afford their health insurance,” she added. Syria's president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, has arrived at the White House according to the press pool, who noted that he was due to enter through the West Wing, but ended up not getting eyes on his motorcade. A reminder, that the administration has began undoing US sanctions on Syria in May, ahead of Trump's first meeting with al-Sharaa in Riyadh. Today, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, announced the removal of a “black box” of warnings across hormone replacement therapy (HRT) – often estrogen and progesterone products that are prescribed to those contending with low levels of these hormones while experiencing menopause. “Millions of women were told to fear the very therapy that could have given them strength, peace and dignity through one of life's most difficult transitions,” Kennedy said. “We're challenging outdated thinking and recommitting to evidence based medicine that empowers rather than restricts when prescribed response started early, hormone replacement therapy transforms the lives of women.” Per our earlier post about the $2,000 payments that Donald Trump said he would dole out to Americans as the country collects tariff revenue, he's added that “all money left over” will be “used to SUBSTANTIALLY PAY DOWN NATIONAL DEBT” in a post on Truth Social. This, along with the payments themselves, defies Congress's control of government spending. While Trump can suggest how this money is spent, urging lawmakers to pass legislation that confers money to various groups and programs, federal law prohibits him from unilaterally deciding where funds go. The US supreme court announced on Monday it will hear a high stakes case about whether states can accept mail-in ballots that arrive after election day, even if they are filled out and mailed before then. The case, Watson v Republican National Committee, involves a challenge to a Mississippi law that allows ballots to count if they are received within 5 business days of election day. Sixteen states, as well as Washington DC, Guam, and Puerto Rico, allow a mail-in ballot from a domestic voter to count if it arrives in a certain timeframe after election day but is postmarked by the election. Donald Trump and Republicans have railed against the practice of allowing ballots to arrive after election day. Lawsuits against portion of the executive order are still ongoing. Johnson added that he would call all House members to return to Washington as soon as the Senate has its final vote. As of now, it's not clear how long that might take and if the lawmakers will be able to expedite the process using unanimous consent. We look forward to the government reopening this week so Congress can get back, can get back to our regular legislative session,” he said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Cold and snow take hold in eastern two-thirds of the US, from the Great Lakes to Florida and Texas Floridians have been asked to keep their guard up against iguanas plummeting out of trees and possibly hurting them as temperatures plunge in their state and other parts of the US. A winter storm warning went into effect on Monday, cautioning the public about wind gusts up to 30mph combined with up to 18in of precipitation, creating a phenomenon known as thundersnow. Weather experts in Florida warned residents to take the threat of falling iguanas seriously. The reptiles begin to feel sluggish when temperatures drop below 50F and can shut down entirely when they are lower than 40F. The snap will be brief but record-setting, according to meteorologists who say the blast of extremely cold Arctic air from Canada, uncommon this early in November, will extend much farther south and east than usual. In an advisory on Monday, the National Weather Service said temperatures would “tie or break many records across the south-east through tonight”. The Arctic air mass, described by CNN as “a full scale polar plunge”, was set to affect almost the entire eastern two-thirds of the US, and was already making travel conditions treacherous in Chicago and other midwest metropolitan areas on Monday morning. “For some of the major metro areas this snow is coming way earlier than average. Residents of Illinois, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsin were forecast to see the worst of the weather, while cold weather warnings were issued in Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky. Some of the earliest snow on record was recorded in Asheville, North Carolina; while an early freeze Monday into Tuesday was expected in numerous other southern states, from Texas and Oklahoma to Alabama and Georgia. According to AccuWeather, “by Tuesday night, the lake-effect engine will start to wind down”, with the cold air retreating north and pockets of more mild air spreading eastward from the Great Plains. On average, fewer than 5% of cyclones in any given year form in November, the final month of the season, and cooler sea temperatures inhibit strengthening.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Man thought to be using Eli Lilly product is ‘doing great', chief executive says The individual collapsed during Donald Trump's Oval Office event with pharmaceutical executives from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk on Friday, overshadowing the US president's announcement about cutting the price of weight-loss drugs. According to The Washington Post, the man, who is believed to be named Gordon, was a patient who was thought to be using Eli Lilly's weight-loss drug. He became faint, and if you've ever been in the Oval Office, you stand a long time, and it's warm. Thanks for your concern,” Mr Ricks said. Mr Trump had been unveiling a move to expand insurance coverage and cut prices for obesity treatments Zepbound and Wegovy. “It's a triumph for American patients that will save lives and improve the health of millions and millions of Americans,” the president said. Administration officials had touted the announcement, which has been praised by both Republicans and Democrats, as “historic”. However, the event quickly descended into chaos when the individual fainted, prompting Dr Mehmet Oz, a senior health official in Mr Trump's administration, to jump to the rescue. Robert F Kennedy Jr, the health secretary, swiftly walked away, although the White House has insisted he went to fetch help rather than running off as some have suggested. On Friday, Dr Oz said he had spoken to the mystery fainter after the incident and that he was “doing much better”. Mr Trump later told reporters the individual was “fine”. It has not been confirmed what caused the man to faint. Gavin Newsom, the California governor who is openly mulling a presidential bid, posted pictures of Mr Trump with his eyes shut on social media, branding him “the Nodfather” and claiming he had ended “wokeness”.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Relying on agents to archive their own messages via screenshots has the potential for error and abuse, experts say. Truthout is an indispensable resource for activists, movement leaders and workers everywhere. An agency within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) tasked with ensuring that electronic messages on the devices of its workforce comply with public records laws admitted last week that it has stopped using software to do so. Instead, ever since April, workers have been told to take screenshots on their own devices in order to abide by the law — a shift in policy that has a high potential for misuse and abuse, and which makes it much more difficult to track messages when requested in Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) inquiries. Since 2023, DHS has relied on a software archival tool called TeleMessage for that purpose. However, it was not replaced with new software — instead, DHS employees were “obligated to manually archive their messages,” via screenshots taken by themselves, “in accordance with existing” department policies. Following a FOIA request earlier this summer, OIC had told the group that it didn't have any of the texts it sought on file. The group sued in October, when DHS officials said those responses from OIC were made by mistake — text messages were indeed preserved, but because of their being kept intact via device screenshot, they weren't readily searchable, requiring a manual search instead. The revelation of the changes to how DHS is keeping track of its own communications — including its willingness to dismiss FOIA requests on account of its own inability to do so — has many open records advocates deeply concerned. “80 Years of US Federal Records Management Theory, Training, Regulation, and gosh darn it, patriotic democratic aspiration. Down the Tubes,” wrote James Cassedy on social media, a former National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) archivist. Others noted that the new system could easily be manipulated, and perhaps already has been. Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, blasted OIC for providing “inaccurate information” about whether or not the text messages the organization had sought were preserved. “We're talking about messages exchanged amid major national controversies — from the deployment of military forces on American streets to inhumane immigration crackdowns and deportations carried out in defiance of court orders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Convicted sex offender preparing documents requesting leniency, according to report In October, the US Supreme Court rejected Maxwell's appeal against her sex trafficking conviction. She is currently serving 20 years for trafficking underage girls to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein. The only option left to reduce her prison sentence is a commutation or pardon, granted by Mr Trump. “I am struggling to keep it all together as it is big and there are so many attachments,” she allegedly told her lawyer Leaf Saffian in an email seen by Politico with the subject line “RE: Commutation Application”. She added: “More coming to replace others... hopefully it will all make sense.” Mr Raskin also called for Todd Blanche, the US deputy attorney general, to testify about the commutation application in front of Congress. Days later, she was moved to a minimum security prison in Texas. The whistleblower also reportedly claimed Maxwell had received “concierge-style” treatment at Federal Prison Camp Bryan, which included customised meals and access to the exercise area after hours. Mr Raskin also claimed information from the whistleblower indicated Maxwell's guests could bring computers, and the warden helped organise visits which included “snacks and refreshments for her guests.” In emails to her friends, Maxwell said she was “much happier” after she was moved from a stricter prison in Tallahassee, Florida.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A car explosion killed at least 10 people near a metro station at the landmark Red Fort monument in Delhi, India, on Monday. More than 30 other people were “badly injured” in the blast, said Dr. Manish Kumar Jha, a physician at the local Lok Nayak Hospital. “Many are not in a position of recovering,” he told reporters. While the cause of the blast is not yet known, airports, railway stations, government buildings and heritage sites across the country have been put on high alert, according to the Central Industrial Security Force. ET), Delhi Police Commissioner Satish Golcha told reporters. “An explosion occurred in that vehicle. The passengers in the vehicle and people in surrounding vehicles were impacted,” Golcha said. At least six vehicles and three autorickshaws were set on fire, Reuters reported, citing Delhi's deputy fire chief. Emergency crews then arrived at the scene and extinguished the blaze – after receiving a call at 6:55 p.m. local time (5:55 a.m. ET), Sumit Kumar, a Delhi fire services official, told CNN. Survivors were taken to a nearby hospital. “The situation is being regularly monitored.” Residents recalled hearing a loud bang in the neighborhood. Our windows shook,” one resident who did not give a name told Indian broadcaster NDTV, according to Reuters. Another resident saw the flames from his house. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the relatives of those killed. Defense Minister Rajnath Singh described the explosion as “painful and disturbing.” “Praying for the speedy recovery of those injured,” he said on X.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump added that he will reward those who did not take any time off during the 41-day federal government shutdown, but it is not clear how many controllers could qualify. Trump said he would welcome the resignation of those who took time off. “All Air Traffic Controllers must get back to work, NOW!!! Anyone who doesn't will be substantially 'docked,'” Trump wrote on social media. The shutdown has led to shortages of air traffic controllers who, like other federal employees, have not been paid for weeks. Last week, Federal Aviation Administration chief Bryan Bedford said 20-40 per cent of controllers were not showing up for work on any given day at the 30 largest U.S. airports since the shutdown began. Asked about Trump's comments, National Air Traffic Controllers Association President Nick Daniels said Monday the union would appreciate anything that recognizes controllers and “we'll work with the administration or any issues that are out there. Air traffic controllers will continue to show up during this shutdown.” Travellers wait for their flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport on Sunday.Annabelle Gordon/Reuters ET, 3,480 flights were also delayed Monday after 2,950 flights were cancelled and nearly 11,200 delayed Sunday in the single worst day for flight disruptions since the government shutdown began on October 1. A November winter storm in Chicago is also disrupting air travel. The FAA is about 3,500 air traffic controllers short of targeted staffing levels. Many had been working mandatory overtime and six-day weeks even before the shutdown. The FAA late Sunday also said it was suspending general aviation traffic at 12 airports with air traffic control staffing issues including Chicago O'Hare and Reagan Washington National. Duffy has said he first wants to see air traffic control staffing and safety data improve. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Central Weather Administration (CWA) today issued a sea warning for Typhoon Fung-wong effective from 5:30pm, while local governments canceled school and work for tomorrow. A land warning is expected to be issued tomorrow morning before it is expected to make landfall on Wednesday, the agency said. For updated information on closures, please visit the Directorate-General of Personnel Administration Web site. It was moving west-northwest at 13kph, with maximum sustained winds of up to 137kph and gusts reaching 173kph. CWA forecaster Lin Ping-yu (林秉煜) said Fung-wong has slightly strengthened in the past three hours and is expected to pose a threat to waters near Pratas Island (Dongsha Island, 東沙島), the Bashi Channel and the southern Taiwan Strait, with a possible further increase in intensity. Extremely heavy to torrential rainfall is expected in mountainous areas of greater Taipei and eastern Taiwan, and the CWA is likely to issue a land warning tomorrow morning, Lin said. Fung-wong is forecast to approach and pass over Taiwan on Wednesday. Central and southern Taiwan, Hualien, Taitung and Penghu may see scattered showers with the possibility of heavy or torrential rain, Lin added. Even after the typhoon moves away on Thursday, northern Taiwan may still see significant rainfall, Lin said. Waves could reach up to 6m in southern Taiwan, the Hengchun Peninsula, southeastern regions and Penghu County, Lin added. Officials have raised concerns that Beijing could try to exert economic control over Kinmen in a key development plan next year                                        The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) yesterday said that China has so far failed to provide any information about a new airport expected to open next year that is less than 10km from a Taiwanese airport, raising flight safety concerns. Tropical Storm Fung-Wong would likely strengthen into a typhoon later today as it continues moving westward across the Pacific before heading in Taiwan's direction next week, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said. As of 8am, Fung-Wong was about 2,190km east-southeast of Cape Oluanpi (鵝鑾鼻), Taiwan's southernmost point, moving westward at 25kph and possibly accelerating to 31kph, CWA data showed. It is forecast to reach the South China Sea Almost a quarter of volunteer soldiers who signed up from 2021 to last year have sought early discharge, the Legislative Yuan's Budget Center said in a report. Typhoon forming: CWA A tropical depression is expected to form into a typhoon as early as today, the Central Weather Administration (CWA) said yesterday, adding that the storm's path remains uncertain. Some time around Monday next week, it might reach a turning point, either veering north toward waters east of Taiwan or continuing westward across the Philippines, the CWA said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Ukrainian military denied once again on Nov. 10 that Russian troops had managed to encircle the embattled city of Pokrovsk in eastern Donetsk Oblast, but admitted that logistics to keep supplying troops there are difficult. Major Andrii Kovalev, a spokesman for Ukraine's General Staff, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that logistics to Pokrovsk still exist, and the troops, including wounded soldiers, are being rotated in and out. Nearly encircled, Ukrainian troops have less than 10 kilometers to keep logistics flowing into the pocket, according to the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring website DeepState. Kovalev denied to Ukrainska Pravda that the last remaining supply routes are all in the Russian artillery and drones' control, which would mean they can strike any targets moving by. Memorial of Heroes, a Ukrainian memorialization and documentary project that records the stories of those killed by Russia's war against Ukraine, has had its YouTube channel deleted without the right to appeal. "Five times this month, our channel has been deleted," the project's deputy editor, Kateryna Maiboroda, wrote on Instagram on Nov. 10. According to Maiboroda, after the sixth and most recent deletion, the appeal option —previously followed by quick restoration — was withheld, with no immediate explanation. The Memorial of Heroes' channel, part of a larger project that includes a website, social media pages, and an event, hosted 18 documentary films and over 100 profiles in memory of fallen Ukrainian soldiers. "They are not only destroying our cities, but our memory, too," she said in an Instagram story in connection to the deletion. Ukraine's Special Operations Forces (SSO) said on Nov. 10 that they conducted what they described as "a successful" drone attack on a pumping station at an oil depot near the city of Simferopol in Russian-occupied Crimea. It stressed the importance of such attacks, explaining that the Hvardiiske oil depot, named after a village just 20 kilometers north of Simferopol, is "an important element of the fuel and logistics system" in Crimea that Moscow then supplies to military facilities and its army. Russian occupational administration head in Simferopol, Mikhail Afanasyev, has not commented on the drone attack or the SSO's claim. Ukraine's former military chief and incumbent ambassador to the U.K., Valerii Zaluzhnyi, wrote in an opinion piece published on Nov. 10 that a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine at all costs is "premature." Zaluzhnyi stressed in the lengthy article published on Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda that a comprehensive peace deal could take months, if not years, of tough negotiations. "It's hard to say whether those who try to push us to make certain decisions understand this," Zaluzhnyi wrote in his opinion piece, where he delved into diplomacy tactics that Ukraine and Russia are using. Russia's port town of Tuapse on the Black Sea was rocked by explosions overnight on Nov. 10, as local Telegram channels reported an attack by Ukrainian sea drones. Photos and videos uploaded by locals in the town and later published by major Telegram channel Astra show explosions and a resulting fire in the area of the town's port. The coastal town is home to a major oil terminal and refinery, and has been the target of Ukrainian strikes as recently as Nov. 2, when fuel exports out of the port were halted by drone attacks, as reported at the time by Reuters. At least one person have been killed and 15 others injured in Russian attacks against Ukraine over the past day, local authorities reported on Nov. 10. Russian troops launched 74 missiles and drones against Ukraine overnight, which included around 40 Shahed-type drones and two aeroballistic Kinzhal missiles, the Air Force reported on Nov. 10. It said it had intercepted 52 drones of various types in the eastern, southern, and central parts of Ukraine. In eastern Donetsk Oblast, regional governor Vadym Filashkin said that at least two people were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day. In northeastern Kharkiv Oblast, regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said that two women, aged 55 and 75, were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day. In central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, regional governor Vladyslav Haivanenko said an 83-year-old woman was injured by a Russian attack that involved heavy artillery and first-person view (FPV) drones over the past day. In southern Kherson Oblast, one person was killed and eight were wounded by Russian attacks over the past day, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin and his regional military administration. Russia has lost around 1,152,160 troops in Ukraine since the beginning of its full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces reported on Nov. 10. According to the report, Russia has also lost 23,552 (+7) armored fighting vehicles, 66,957 (+77) vehicles and fuel tanks, 34,349 (+9) artillery systems, 79,425 (+57) drones, and 3,993 (+0) units of special equipment.

STOCKHOLM, November 10. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky should end attacks on Russian regions and resume dialogue with Moscow, said Armando Mema, a member of the Finnish national-conservative Freedom Alliance party.

"Zelensky should stop attacks inside Russian territories; all Ukraine is under heavy attacks after the Moscow Region and others were attacked with drones. It makes no sense strategically for him to do so," he wrote on the X social media platform.

"A return to dialogue and diplomacy is the best thing he could do," Mema added.

The Russian Defense Ministry reported on November 7 that in response to terrorist attacks on civilian facilities, the Russian Armed Forces had carried out seven combined strikes on military sites in Ukraine using high-precision weapons and drones in the previous week. On November 8, Ukraine once again reported major damage to energy infrastructure, and imposed emergency blackouts. The Ekonomicheskaya Pravda media outlet reported, citing sources in the country's political circles, that the power generating company Centrenergo's report that all state-run thermal power plants had stopped operating sent Vladimir Zelensky's office "really hysterical."</p>

Photos and videos uploaded by locals in the town and later published by major Telegram channel Astra show explosions and a resulting fire in the area of the town's port. The coastal town is home to a major oil terminal and refinery, and has been the target of Ukrainian strikes as recently as Nov. 2, when fuel exports out of the port were halted by drone attacks, as reported at the time by Reuters. Municipal administration head Sergey Boiko had earlier posted on his official Telegram channel about the threat of attack from both air and sea drones, but later redacted the latter from the message. Later, the official Telegram channel of Krasnodar Krai confirmed the attack, claiming that four Ukrainian sea drones had been destroyed. Kyiv is yet to comment officially on the operation. Over 2025, Ukraine has escalated attacks on Russia's energy infrastructure, in particular oil refineries, identified as a vulnerable target for asymmetric strikes as the fighting along the front line continues. Meanwhile, with the continuing advancement of sea drone technology, first deployed in 2022, Kyiv has been able to target Russian military and energy assets on the Black Sea at increasing range and effectiveness. Francis Farrell is a reporter at the Kyiv Independent. Major Andrii Kovalev, a spokesman for Ukraine's General Staff, told Ukrainian news outlet Ukrainska Pravda that logistics to Pokrovsk still exist, and the troops, including wounded soldiers, are being rotated in and out. Later, the official Telegram channel of Krasnodar Krai confirmed the attack, claiming that four Ukrainian sea drones had been destroyed. Ukraine would like to order 27 Patriot air defense systems from U.S. companies and is looking to borrow the crucial system from its European allies in the meantime, President Volodymyr Zelensky said. Ukraine's military reportedly struck a Russian oil depot near the village of Gvardeyskoye in occupied Crimea late on Nov. 9, Russian Telegram media channel ASTRA reported. Zelensky said Kyiv will propose that the 20th sanctions package target "Russian legal entities and individuals that are still profiting from energy resources." "He has already successfully negotiated the release of 100 Hostages, and is going for an additional 50," Trump wrote on his Truth Social account. Names on the list include Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy for investment Kirill Dmitriev, Agriculture Minister Oksana Lut, and FSB agent Aleksey Komkov.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>"For several days, Belgium has been subjected to intense propaganda about allegedly 'Russian drones' that seeks to force it to lift its veto on the use of frozen Russian assets! Germany and the United Kingdom even offer to send them military equipment. NATO and the European Union are making every effort to create panic in Belgium and pressure its prime minister!" the politician wrote on his X page, calling such tactics "mafia-style." Most of Russia's €210 billion in sovereign assets frozen in Europe are blocked at the Euroclear platform in Belgium, which fears it would bear the impact of any Russian retaliatory measures. Earlier, Russian Ambassador to Belgium Denis Gonchar told TASS that expropriating Russian assets under any scheme would be considered "theft." He warned that Russia's retaliation "would be immediate" and force the West to "reckon with its losses." The EU states continue to discuss ways of further financing Ukraine, including the possibility of granting Kiev a "reparation loan" by seizing frozen Russian assets. Belgium demanded legal guarantees that any financial losses would be distributed among all countries of the bloc. The European Commission press service has repeatedly stated that expropriating Russian assets remains a priority.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The magazine has featured contributions from many leading international affairs experts. LAEL BRAINARD is a Distinguished Fellow at the Georgetown University Psaros Center and a Senior Fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Mossavar-Rahmani Center. The landmark meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping in October brought a respite to the trade war and led to some reciprocal deals. But it did not suggest any breakthrough in addressing the problems that have fueled tensions between the two countries in recent years. For much of this century, U.S. policy toward China rested on a calculated bet that the country's integration into the global trading system would drive its political and economic liberalization—in alignment with U.S. interests. But the second Trump administration is reversing that progress and offering a transactional, contradictory approach to replace it. It will only set Washington back relative to its chief rival. A better policy would double down on the United States' core strengths, not actively undermine them. In 1995, China accounted for less than five percent of global manufacturing output. Geopolitics compounded the domestic toll of economic dislocation: China was both a rising economic powerhouse and a strategic rival to the United States. Instead of embracing liberalizing reform (as so many in the West assumed was inevitable), the Chinese Community Party tightened its grip, strengthened state capitalism, and maintained significant controls on foreign inflows of investment, trade, and information. Its massive trade imbalances were the result not of market forces but of a dense web of nonmarket interventions—industrial subsidies, discriminatory rules, currency management, intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, and cyber-intrusions—which imposed immense costs on U.S. workers and businesses. It took a while for Washington to push back. Given the greater than threefold surge in Chinese imports between 2001 and 2008, the Bush administration could have invoked Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974—the “China safeguard,” negotiated specifically to protect U.S. industries from threats or disruptions caused by increased imports of Chinese goods—but it never did. The Obama administration used the safeguard once, on tires, but declined to apply it in sectors such as auto parts and solar panels, where state-supported Chinese manufacturers were undercutting Western innovators. Between 2001 and 2012, China's foreign exchange reserves soared from $212 billion to $3.3 trillion, and in 2007 its current account surplus swelled to more than ten percent of GDP, which contributed to the United States' lopsided deficit and the 2008 global financial crisis. What began as an effort to internationalize the renminbi morphed into a de-dollarization campaign, which picked up speed after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the ensuing Western sanctions. In 2018, it imposed tariffs on nearly half of U.S. imports from China. Although this sweeping approach led to higher prices on many products and greater imports from third countries, it started to loosen the codependence of the two economies. Rather than imposing duties across the board, it raised tariffs steeply on select Chinese imports in sectors vital to national security, clean energy, and technological leadership, in which China appeared determined to dominate global supply, and removed tariffs on inputs imported from other countries. The administration combined these defensive measures with offensive investment incentives for the domestic production of semiconductors, batteries, and clean energy technologies, secured through legislation. For the first time in decades, Washington married trade protection with industrial renewal and supply chain diversification. This strategy also recognized that maintaining the U.S. lead over China would require coordination with allies. Washington understood that it could not grapple with Chinese practices on its own. Trump returned to office in 2025 after a campaign that repeated his familiar rhetoric about China. But his second administration has not simply picked up where it left off. Instead, it has been reversing U.S. strategy on almost every front. The administration's tariff policy is driven by fiscal arithmetic rather than strategic calculus. It is imposing steep rates on all trade partners—not just China—in order to raise between $300 billion and $400 billion in annual revenue to offset the shortfall produced by new tax cuts. The majority of U.S. imports are industrial inputs, so U.S. manufacturers will face higher input costs than their foreign competitors as a result of the tariffs. General Motors and Ford are projecting several billion dollars in additional tariff costs this year, even after winning some initial relief. The administration has imposed duties on close allies with whom it has a trade surplus, such as Australia and the United Kingdom. Even Canada, a North American ally that joined Washington in setting 100 percent tariffs on Chinese auto imports in 2024, is facing high tariffs on many goods as a result of petty irritants, such as an ad about tariffs aired by the government of Ontario. Imports from China now face a smaller penalty, relative to imports from elsewhere, than they did before Trump began his second term—a puzzling reversal. Alongside raising costs and alienating allies, current policy is weakening the American innovation ecosystem. The administration's termination of incentives for innovation and investment in clean energy is a strategic setback in the race to dominate advanced AI, in which low-cost energy from multiple sources will be crucial to powering the expansion of AI data centers. Similarly, domestic investment incentives for electric vehicles, batteries, and alternative energy were designed to give U.S. auto companies a better chance to compete with China's surging EV producers. But the administration has suspended many of those incentives, jeopardizing key business investments and the high-paying jobs they were poised to create in factory towns. Ceding dominance of the EV industry to China also means ceding ground on advancements in autonomous vehicles and drones, as well as in battery technology, which is critical for grid storage and electronics. Under the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, signed into law in August 2022, the United States was on track to restore domestic manufacturing of advanced semiconductors—with its global share of production projected to reach nearly 30 percent by 2032, up from zero in 2022—and had attracted the world's leading advanced semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, to fabricate chips in the United States. But the Trump administration has converted final CHIPS grants that provided for “upside sharing”—that is, when companies receiving $150 million or more in federal funding shared a portion of their profits with the U.S. government when returns materially exceeded projections—into a government equity stake that no longer requires companies to meet advanced manufacturing benchmarks. So it came as a surprise when the Trump administration rescinded some restrictions in July after Beijing threatened to curtail rare-earth magnet supplies. Beijing has systematically strengthened its own export controls since the first Trump administration. Partly as a result, the second Trump administration has seemed willing to negotiate over certain key U.S. controls. In an August press conference, the president confirmed a deal under which American producers could obtain licenses to export chips to China by sharing 15 percent of the revenues with the government—another triumph of fiscal considerations over strategy. An emboldened Beijing tested American resolve again in October by expanding its restrictions on rare-earths exports. In the deal that emerged from the bilateral meeting later that month, the United States committed to a one-year delay on extending its list of restricted entities to majority affiliates in return for a one-year delay on China's rare-earths restrictions. This deal with Beijing crossed a decades-old redline maintained by U.S. administrations of both parties that national security technology controls are not on the table in trade negotiations. Moreover, if the president's public musings give any indication of future policy, it may be only a matter of time before he decides to put Nvidia's Blackwell chips on the negotiating table, which would be a serious own goal, ceding to China a key U.S. advantage in the AI race. Finally, the second Trump administration is undermining confidence in the foundations of dollar dominance, just as China accelerates efforts to challenge it. Dollar dominance is not merely symbolic: it underpins global demand for U.S. Treasuries and enables the selective use of sanctions to advance national security goals. It also allows the United States to borrow in its own currency at lower rates and save an estimated $100 billion to $200 billion a year in interest, which translates to lower rates on mortgages and car loans for Americans. Yet the administration's fiscal and institutional carelessness has begun to test investor faith. It signed into law a $4 trillion expansion of federal debt, despite a U.S. credit downgrade that weakened the dollar and raised the yields on 30-year U.S. Treasuries to more than five percent. Trump has called on the Fed to lower interest rates to reduce payments on the federal debt, even though investors would demand higher interest rates on long-term Treasuries if they expected the Federal Reserve to prioritize reducing debt payments over controlling inflation. Congress has been surprisingly acquiescent, considering that it originally delegated its own constitutional power over currency to the Federal Reserve and legislated a for-cause removal safeguard to protect the Fed from political interference. These actions jeopardize confidence in U.S. creditworthiness and institutional independence—key pillars of the dollar's global role. The fact that there is currently no single alternative to the dollar should be cold comfort at a time when foreign central banks are increasing the share of gold in their reserves to rival the share of U.S. Treasuries, and foreigners are hedging more of their exposure to dollar assets. Trump's economic strategy toward China is effectively unwinding the progress made not just by the Biden administration but also by Trump's first administration. Sweeping tariffs designed to maximize revenue are hurting American manufacturers and straining consumers. By weakening the country's world-class innovation ecosystem, eliminating advanced manufacturing and clean energy investment incentives, and reversing technology export controls, current policy is undermining key U.S. industries. Fiscal profligacy and political meddling in monetary policy are eroding the foundations of dollar dominance. A winning strategy for Washington—one that is truly “America first”—would impose targeted tariffs on Chinese imports so that Beijing does not have a chokehold on any node of the supply chain in strategic sectors. Maintaining U.S. tech leadership relative to China requires incentivizing private-sector investments in advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and rare earths. A smart U.S. economic strategy would also buttress, not bargain away, targeted export controls on advanced semiconductor technology to sustain the U.S. lead in frontier AI models for as long as possible. To sustain preeminence, Washington must reinforce its institutions, alliances, and incumbency advantages—not erode them.
