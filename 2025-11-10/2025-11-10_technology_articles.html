                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Coinbase has announced the upcoming launch of a new token sales platform that will allow U.S. retail investors to participate in initial coin offerings (ICOs) for the first time since the token sale hysteria of 2017 and 2018, which eventually ended in disaster for many crypto speculators. The move to launch this platform comes just a few weeks after Coinbase acquired the investment platform Echo for $375 million. ICOs were all the rage in 2017, as the then-relatively-new blockchain platform Ethereum appeared to have found its first major use case. While there are a few projects from this era of crypto that are still around, the hysteria around ICOs eventually turned into marketing-focused teams collecting investment from others, with not much more to show for plans than a whitepaper (if that). The large amount of outright fraud occurring in the space at the time led to a regulatory backlash from the Biden administration, and Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather, and other celebrities were eventually charged with SEC violations regarding their promotion of dubious crypto tokens. For example, the platform is intended to promote a wide distribution of the initial tokens and will punish token investors who tend to simply dump their allocations on the market as quickly as possible. Additionally, token issuers will be blocked from selling their allocations for at least six months, and the teams behind the projects will need to follow a disclosure policy regarding tokenomics and other attributes of the project related to credibility and trust. Coinbase previously attempted to operate under its own token listing standards, but the SEC's view under chairman Gary Gensler at the time was basically that everything but bitcoin was a security. This eventually led to an SEC enforcement action against Coinbase, which has since been dropped. Whether Coinbase can operate as a credible, neutral authority on new token sales is up to the discretion of its users. However, it should be noted that the crypto exchange previously took tokens from various projects for its Coinbase Earn project, where its users were provided with free tokens in exchange for reading about the associated projects. Put differently, Coinbase was provided with funds from token projects that were then provided to users as an incentive to sign up in exchange for creating promotional content about those same tokens. That said, the odds of that passage occurring this year have dropped from a high of 87% to 21% since July, according to prediction market Polymarket. This latest move from Coinbase is yet another example of the lines between crypto and traditional finance becoming increasingly blurred. So, we now have a centralized financial institution operating an initial investment platform built on U.S. dollar-based rails (the platform uses the Coinbase-partnered USDC stablecoin from Circle) for projects that are increasingly looking more like traditional fintech than anything truly decentralized or operating outside of the traditional financial system. Trump ran as the bitcoin president, but stablecoins and crypto grifting have taken priority. So far, West's foray into crypto has gone about how you'd expect. The world's most famous cryptocurrency just hit a new all-time high, but don't call it a comeback just yet. President Trump might be a fan of crypto, but companies in the industry still face state regulators.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norway has 40 000 in the Home Guard (Heimevernet) rapid reaction force of volunteer part time soldiers and a further 20 000 reserves. Meanwhile Norway was occupied in WWII, and after that spent the next decades next to the Soviet Union, and then Russia. There's clearly been a long standing risk of actual invasion. I don't see why Canada in particular needs such a large reserve force. This would jump Canada from number 127 to number 52 in terms of percentage of population in reserves, and bump it up to 17th in terms of absolute reserves size. For a nation with basically zero chance of invasion of its home soil and an extremely low risk of internal conflict, it's hard to imagine a scenario where anywhere near this many reservists would be required. If they tried to conscript they'd quickly find themselves in a civil war (for the same reasons the US would), and one the Canadian capital clearly doesn't believe it'd win given how well it fared defending itself in 2022.Of course, bureaucrats aren't exactly known for their fighting prowess either.

I personally think that Canada can be our (US) greatest ally, but this is only true in the hard-power sense of the word if Canada does actually meet its defense obligations.Canada has a huge coastline, directly adjacent to our most significant threats (China & Russia), yet doesn't have a navy to speak of.We need Canada to step up to its own defense so we can keep being equal allies, otherwise Canada is a de facto protectorate and should pay for that privilege.

We need Canada to step up to its own defense so we can keep being equal allies, otherwise Canada is a de facto protectorate and should pay for that privilege. Canadians are our closest brothers and sisters and it's just a historical quirk that we're separate countries at all. I think you could say this about any of those countries, although Switzerland's mountainous location means that it would always resist being part of a larger polity. As a Canadian, why would it be condescending to suggest that at some point in the distant past, Canada and the U.S. could have been a single country had history played out slightly differently? There is nothing offensive about it, if anything the fact that it's a claim about a historical matter only highlights how the two countries have evolved separately and independently.Furthermore your other points are kind of bizzare. Spain and Portugal could absolutely have been a single country, and in fact they were under the Iberian Union. There are numerous other instances where the two countries came close to unifying.The historical possibility of a unified Belgium and the Netherlands is even stronger since those two countries had been unified twice.Germany and Switzerland however is a long shot, but at any rate I don't think anyone from Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain or Portugal would take offense or find it condescending that some historical event could have gone differently and reshaped all of Europe... taking offense to that suggestion as a Canadian, even during these times seems overly insecure and I don't think it's a sentiment shared by most of us.

People died, generations were involved in discourse about national identity and where borders should be drawn.The US and Canada were both at one point British properties, so by some definitions, we also used to be unified. The reality is that in a shooting war, we wouldn't last very long against the US, in all likelihood. Under these conditions, the least I can do is to push back against rhetoric that undermines our legitimacy as our own country.

Under these conditions, the least I can do is to push back against rhetoric that undermines our legitimacy as our own country. Maybe the US should be part of Canada? It's definitely possible to intepret this the way Russia speaks about Ukraine - "They shouldn't even be a country *except for a historical quirk", but a charitable interpretation would be more along the lines of "things could have gone slightly differently and we'd be countrymen, but instead we brothers from a different mother (country)". Essentially we are even closer than many people think in terms of history, but Canadian identity was seeded from the beginning with the idea of rejecting being "American". We are indeed your closest brothers and sisters because of history, but it's no quirk at all that we're separate -- it's the entire reason we stayed separate at all.You can also see the reverse play out -- what would become Alberta was settled by large numbers of American colonists moving to Canada, and to this day you can see the cultural impact of that in the politics and world view from the region.

It is not a surprise that region can't find anyone else (in the rest of the economic zone over which it claims dominion) willing to die for its interests, especially when their interests have been revealed to be nothing but "loot the rest of the nation". OK, a triad, China/US is also on the radar. Whatever the weighting, it's pushed Canada to work on a mobilization framework, because the combined risk is high enough.Which means "oh shit" feelings are entirely appropriate, panic isn't. Which means "oh shit" feelings are entirely appropriate, panic isn't. If the US chose to attack, then more has gone wrong in the world than you could possibly cope with, having a few thousand more tanks, ships, and helicopters isn't going to save the day. It'd take decades to build up population, R&D infrastructure, resources, and so on, and there'd likely be a lot of pressure to not do those things and use the US military industrial complex instead.Not saying this is good for Canada, btw, just that the reality is they've kinda coasted on US coattails for decades now, and for better or worse, they're stuck. Which should in turn beg the question - if there's no practical or pragmatic point in spending a bunch of money on military preparedness and expansion, then why's that money being spent, and who's getting paid? Why are bureaucrats being militarized, instead of a discrete, well regulated military being created to meet whatever the need was?Strange politics.

This is because they treat those soldiers with contempt- no young man wants to die for Ottawa. Plus, the volunteer soldiers that come back from Ukraine are not going to be on Ottawa's side if domestic instability ramped up, but will be familiar with the tools of modern warfare.Ottawa is currently (and perhaps rightfully) paranoid of a domestic uprising just as much as it is of the US invading. The US is strategically wrecking the economy of Canadian citizens only a few hours away and if those citizens violently insist on suing for peace Ottawa might lose its power forever.So, you do the next best thing- you take the faction with the political power in Canada (in this case, Ottawa bureaucrats) and tell them that if they want to keep their privileges, they must join the reserve.The fact that if any nation decided to actually attack they'd instantly flee (bureaucrats are not known for their courage under fire; that's why they're bureaucrats!)

Countries are spending tremendous amounts of money on advanced weapons right now. In my short experience in public service, I met a great number of people who were not in lockstep with the so-called "values they try to force" (i.e. the political plans of the current government), so it seems they're not doing a great job of "forcing" those values if that's the plan. https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-caf-charges-terrorism-...The general response to this was amazement that the MP or RCMP actually did anything about it, given what occurs within those.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Amazon Music is bringing fans together in a new app feature called “Fan Groups” that helps listeners discover, share and chat about music recommended by like-minded fans. A beta version of the feature is rolling out in Canada on iOS and Android, Amazon said Monday. The groups are public, and can even be created by artists who want to connect with their fans. The beta launch features several active groups created and populated by real fans across musical interests including indie rock, country, K-pop and workout playlists, according to Amazon. Fan Groups will roll out to customers in the U.S. and additional markets worldwide beginning next year.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google Maps is adding new AI features, including a builder agent and an MCP server — a tool that connects AI assistants to Google Maps' technical documentation — to help developers and users create interactive projects using Maps data and code. Among these new tools, the builder agent is a tool that, just like many other coding tools, lets you describe the kind of interactive map-based prototype you want to build in text and creates one for you. This could help brands create maps with specific color coding. Google already provides map data grounding via the Gemini API. The company is now introducing a similar feature, called Grounding Lite, which allows developers to ground their own AI models using Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standard that lets AI assistants connect to external data sources. With this feature, AI assistants can answer questions like, “How far is the nearest grocery store?” The company is also shipping Contextual View, a low-code Google Maps component that can provide visual understanding to users for such questions. Last month, the company launched extensions for Gemini's command line tool to let developers access Maps data. Last week, it enabled users to use Gemini hands-free with Maps for navigation.

That is an absolutely bananas read of Zuck's place in American culture. These were not intended for the public. They really are just that up their own asses. I remember perhaps a decade ago, a coworker and I were watching a clip of Zuckerberg walking up to a group of employees and they started clapping for him. I mentioned how odd it was to see, and he thought it was perfectly natural to applaud the CEO of your company. We never applauded when our boss showed up, and I've never really been sure where the line is for which authority I'm supposed to cheer for merely from being in their presence. I haven't thought about it too much since then, but obviously it's stuck with me.As a society, we've all had our lips pretty firmly pressed onto the asses of the oligarchs for quite awhile, so it seems pretty natural that they think it's the natural order of things. As a society, we've all had our lips pretty firmly pressed onto the asses of the oligarchs for quite awhile, so it seems pretty natural that they think it's the natural order of things. Even in back in 2019 I have a hard time believing this was true. As a millennial, my facebook feed was overtaken by my parents generation in the early 2010s and the handful of peers I know who still use it regularly use it to communicate with that generation.Maybe he's counting Instagram usage as part of Facebook? Maybe he's counting Instagram usage as part of Facebook? I hadn't heard this before but googling it seems like a genuine commitment at the time[0]. I mostly feel like Zuck isn't making the world a better place, but this sounds really impressive as a commitment - any idea if this commitments been stuck to now we're around 10 years on? No, Zuckerberg did not set out consciously trying to "fracture society". He started out trying to provide a way to rate women at Harvard by how attractive they were, then by just trying to optimize revenue without any consideration for unintended consequences. Then kept going.Not understanding the failure mode is going to just lead to repeating the same mistakes at even grander scales, like what's happening now with AI.

Fucks sake...  that is an absolutely bananas read of Zuck's place in American culture. They really are up their own asses so much in this thread. Just the arrogance of these people absolutely kills me. It is also (and it surprises me that this ancient observation is so little cited), a highly visible example of"Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely".Watching at these people accumulate and hoard hundreds of billions of wealth, in a capitalist society where wealth equals power, and become ever more corrupt as they do so, simply demonstrates the point yet again. And we must suffer the consequences as they choose to corrupt the govt so they can accumulate more power instead of doing works to benefit all.Just for some perspective, I once calculated what it means to be rich. With 'only' $20million yielding 5%, you have $2700/day without even touching principle. There is no level of basic and even luxury needs that cannot be met with that kind of spending. OK, you want more, how about spending $25,000 per day, EVERY day for the rest of your life? That takes 'only' $200 million.Those people have hundreds of times the amount of money that could ever make a difference in their standard of living.The point is that once you reach past these levels, more money literally makes no material difference in your standard of living.

We know who Zuckerberg is. Non-tech-nerds just going on with their lives don't for the most part, even if they use apps from Meta. If they even heard the name, it was due to some negative news related to Facebook or Meta. https://today.yougov.com/ratings/entertainment/fame/people/a...Zuckerberg is 49, Sheeran is 169 (Taylor Swift is on 4; Bieber, Lady Gaga and Beyoncé are also more famous than Zuckerberg; the rest in the list are less famous) Zuckerberg is 49, Sheeran is 169 (Taylor Swift is on 4; Bieber, Lady Gaga and Beyoncé are also more famous than Zuckerberg; the rest in the list are less famous) Which, by definition, is incomplete when we're talking about the world. If we examined by country, it would fluctuate wildly. For example, in any country with soccer as the national sport, Ronaldo would crush Zuckerberg in popularity.Either way, the point (in which I think we're all mostly in agreement) is that Zuckerberg's comment falls somewhere between the absurd and the delusional. If you want to pick a different list of names, go right ahead. I'd say Tailor Swift is indisputable, though.

If you want to pick a different list of names, go right ahead. I'd say Tailor Swift is indisputable, though. That said, I'm not into music and assumed he was a footballer. When I was made aware of Ed Sheeran, he was already the biggest artist in the world. But that says something about me and my general disinterest for music and pop culture, not Sheeran's popularity. Zuckerberg probably is more well-known than Ed Sheeran. "Ed Sheeran", the name, may be more familiar, but what do typical people really know about the details of his life? Zuckerberg, on the other hand, had a movie made about him. At least everyone knows about Taylor Swift's dating life, if we want to compare to music celebrities.Still, imagine Prince William or Prince Harry have to be most well-known. They've been chronicled since birth. Especially when you look past an Americentric view and turn to the world stage. They've been chronicled since birth.

But when 70% of Millennials say they are pro-socialist, we need to do better than simply dismiss them by saying that they are stupid or entitled or brainwashed; we should try and understand why. And, from the perspective of a broken generational compact, there seems to be a pretty straightforward answer to me, namely, that when one has too much student debt or if housing is too unaffordable, then one will have negative capital for a long time and/or find it very hard to start accumulating capital in the form of real estate; and if one has no stake in the capitalist system, then one may well turn against it.But when he gives examples of the "iron grip" boomers have on power, he only talks about their control of universities and the government.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>More evidence has emerged to support the natural origin of comet 3I/Atlas. After several weeks of conspiracy theories, social media debates, and speculation on popular podcasts such as Joe Rogan's, this interstellar object is still a comet. What MeerKAT specifically detected were lines of radio absorption by hydroxyl radicals, that is, OH molecules, a pattern that would be consistent with typical comet activity. This is the phenomenon explained in WIRED a few days ago when the controversy about non-gravitational acceleration arose: When comets reach their closest point to the sun, they sublimate ice into space and receive a greater amount of radiation. This also causes them to alter their trajectory. The hydroxyl radical (OH) can absorb or emit radiation at specific frequencies (such as the 1665 and 1667 MHz lines) due to transitions in its energy levels. These OH spectral lines have been detected in nebulae, comets, and star-forming regions. OH helps astronomers map the star- and water-born regions of the universe because it can "glow" brightly at radio frequencies under certain conditions. MeerKAT attempted to detect radio signals earlier, on September 20 and 28, although it was unsuccessful. “Five weeks ago, I encouraged radio observatories like MeerKAT to search for radio emission from 3I/ATLAS given that the arrival direction of 3I/ATLAS coincided to within 9 degrees with the arrival direction of the Wow! “In response, I was assured that 3I/ATLAS will be monitored by radio observatories like MeerKAT.” Loeb acknowledged that "no radio detection of 3I/ATLAS has been reported so far, other than the OH absorption signal." Of course, continued monitoring of the object would need to be conducted to determine whether the OH production is constant or intermittent, along with factors such as the extent and structure of the tail, to reach more solid conclusions about its nature. (And he has already invited Kim Kardashian to join his research team.) "On March 16, 2026, 3I/ATLAS is expected to pass within 53 million kilometers from Jupiter. At that time, the Juno spacecraft will use its dipole antenna to search for a radio signal from 3I/ATLAS at low frequencies ranging from 50 hertz to 40 megahertz," he wrote. And don't forget to mark December 19 on the calendar—that's when the interstellar guest will reach its closest point to Earth.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“I wish there was a way to meet people organically who have the same interests. I feel like with social media, everybody is so superficial.” Recognizing a common pain point for many in their twenties, McBride teamed up with veteran startup founder Joe Einhorn to create Mmotion, an app that combines elements of location tracking with social discovery features to help people find new friends based on shared interests while also recommending nearby bars, restaurants, and other social hotspots. Now available in beta for users in NYC, the app diverges from traditional friendship platforms like Bumble BFF, instead competing more directly with apps like Snap Map and Find My. Instagram also recently entered the space with a new Map feature. Mmotion leverages geofencing and state tracking to follow users' movements, highlighting people with similar interests in the vicinity. Plus, users get a private log of all their location history, acting like a personal timeline so they can easily look back on all the spots they've explored. Once accepted, they can enter their interests, join “Circles” or groups they're interested in (such as those focused on hiking, attending basketball games, or visiting art galleries), and send friend requests to others nearby. Users are incognito by default, which Mmotion refers to as “Vault Mode,” and can be switched at any time. Additionally, if users prefer that only certain individuals on the app know their location, Mmotion offers a feature called “Personas.” This feature allows users to create up to three separate groups, enabling them to share more private locations like their home address with a select group of people while maintaining a more public persona. The app will operate on a monthly subscription model for users. While the exact pricing details weren't disclosed, Einhorn hinted that it will be affordable, stating, “It's not going to be more than a cup of coffee per month. For example, the basic tier only lets users join five Circles per city at a time. Another aspect of the app is its offering for local businesses. By featuring restaurants, bars, coffee shops, fitness studios, and more on the map, Mmotion aims to promote small businesses while also providing them with insights into their customer base. The app aggregates data from various sources, including Google, OpenStreetMap, and Apple Maps. This service would help businesses effectively target the right customers. In addition to subscription fees, the app will generate revenue through ads. The launch marks McBride's first time as a startup founder, positioning him alongside other athletes who have transitioned to entrepreneurship. Einhorn, meanwhile, is known as the founder and CEO of Fancy, a social e-commerce platform that competed with Pinterest. He also launched a luxury goods startup last year called Long Story Short. Mmotion plans for a wider launch in the near future when there's enough feedback from testers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The third episode of It: Welcome to Derry arrived packed with flashback sequences as terrifying as they are illuminating. On the way home, he meets a young girl and they become summer sweethearts—though at one point, they have a very alarming encounter in Derry's deepest, darkest forest. Welcome to Derry fans will know, of course, that 1908 is one of Pennywise's “cycle” years—1935 is another one we hear about in the HBO series, which takes place in 1962. And the show makes it very clear who these kids grow up to be: General Francis Shaw, who's returned to Maine intent on unearthing the entity he met there for military purposes, and Rose, who now runs the Secondhand Rose shop in downtown Derry and has become a leader among the local Indigenous community. Cheryl Eddy, io9: It's perfect that Rose owns an antique store because she's so deeply connected to history. Why do you think it's important to have a character like Rose as part of this story? io9: We learn that Derry's Native American population has knowledge of the monster's origins and its powers. This is an angle we've never delved into before. Guerrero: Finally, we finally get to unpack all of this mysterious Indian lore that's kind of undergirded a lot of the horror that we've got in the last few decades. What's so exciting about it is that when you actually do unpack it, there are powerful and mysterious elements at work. Our people understand those powerful, mysterious elements and our interrelation with the things that we can't see but that we know are there. We kind of understand how to mitigate these things. That's always rooted very much into being an Indigenous person on our land and understanding where we come from. So all of that is fed into this story, and it's all connected through a Penobscot elder named John Bear Mitchell, who's our direct source, and we're able to make sure everything is very authentic and historically accurate. io9: General Shaw, or Francis, as Rose calls him, has his heart in the right place, and he has a personal connection to the mission in Derry. But do you think he's maybe a little blinded to the limitations of what he's trying to achieve? I couldn't have put it better myself. But the funny thing about personality flaws or character defects is that generally, you are going to be blind to them. I do believe that his heart is in the right place, [but] his heart has been buffeted by a lifetime of war and childhood trauma. After that, it's just been all about the military and moving forward in courage and not going backwards; not going to the past. Yet somehow the past has a way of asserting itself and it drew him back in. io9: General Shaw mentions that at one point, he took an experimental drug that helped him remember his childhood in Derry. Are we talking LSD, MKULTRA kind of stuff? How deep did you dig into his military backstory? Remar: He's got a chest full of medals. You don't get to be a lieutenant general in the United States Air Force by sitting around. I mean, he is a combat officer, he is a World War II and a Korean War veteran, and he is at the top of his class. We were living under a constant state of threat. With espionage and the [Cold War], there was this whole thing about brainwashing. I feel that [General Shaw] could not order soldiers under him to do something that he wouldn't do himself—some of these brainwashing experiments and learn about LSD and truth serum. And that's where [he would say], “I'll go first.” That's the kind of guy I think he was. io9: These two have a shared history and there's still chemistry between them despite their differences. How did you work together to get their reunion just right? Remar: We both have to be these pillars of strength. And when you have an attraction to someone like that, the pillars have to lean a little bit. I feel like I messed up a little [in the scene where Francis and Rose reunite], because we shot the scene twice. The first time I was a little too taken with her: “Oh gosh, I love you from when I was nine years old.” I had to be a little bit rougher, so the finished product has me a little more contained and not as tender. Guerrero: I think it's really incredible that—and the audience won't necessarily know this; it will be there in the subtext if you're watching really closely—but Francis is [Rose's] first love. It's not that she didn't want to. It was just that her responsibility couldn't allow for a loss like she experienced when Francis was taken from her. And when James and I talked about it, it was similar for him as well: he doesn't think [Francis]  married or had children. Remar: In my office is nothing but military pictures and trophies. There are no pictures of my family on the desk. New episodes of It: Welcome to Derry arrive Sundays on HBO.

Vimpo shows how this feat was completed and demonstrates the server working in a brief video, embedded below. Key to this achievement was the bulb's BL602 RISC-V-powered microcontroller. Vimpo begins their quest by taking a knife to the unfortunate AliExpress-bought LED bulb. Oldies like me still find it jarring to see a lightbulb popped open without terrible consequences – but LEDs don't need to reside in a delicate vacuum. We then see the detached microcontroller with wires soldered individually to its headers. You can find Ucraft code resources on GitHub, plus a guide to building the server system on a Linux machine. Ucraft is gloriously compact, with a “binary size is approximately 46K bytes without authentication and 90K bytes with the authentication library,” says Vimpo. “Memory usage varies based on the number of active players. In the worst-case scenario with 10 players, heap usage will be around 70K bytes with authentication and 20K bytes without authentication.” However, the hacker is first to admit that Ucraft “lacks most, if not all, features of the vanilla server.” Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>After helping several enterprises document how work actually happens, Scribe has raised $75 million at a $1.3 billion post-money valuation to roll out Scribe Optimize, a platform that maps workflows across the enterprise to reveal where automation and AI will actually yield returns — instead of becoming another sunk cost. The new funding comes over a year after Scribe raised its $25 million Series B, capital the five-year-old startup has largely not needed to draw down, co-founder and CEO Jennifer Smith (pictured above, left) said in an exclusive interview. With this round, Scribe plans to accelerate the rollout of Scribe Optimize and related products, as enterprises struggle to determine where AI and automation will have the greatest impact. Many companies are racing to adopt AI, but Smith told TechCrunch that most still cannot answer a fundamental question: What should we automate first? Enterprises often try to find the answer through interviews, workshops, or by bringing in consultants, she said, approaches that take months and still miss much of what people actually do on a day-to-day basis. Very simply, it mines across workflows for what people are doing when they're at work, and then it abstracts those up into being able to show you in a single pane of glass, here are the actual workflows that are being done. Founded in 2019 by Smith and Aaron Podolny (CTO) (pictured above, right), Scribe started before the GenAI boom, and its current flagship product, Scribe Capture, helps automatically document how work is done. Those guides can be shared with colleagues or embedded in internal tools to reduce repeated questions, minimize errors, and expedite onboarding. The market of process documentation includes players including Tango, Iorad, UserGuiding, and Spekit. Nonetheless, Smith told TechCrunch that Scribe competes against the status quo of people manually recording workflows. “People are still using stopwatches to sit behind somebody and understand what this process is,” she said. To date, Scribe has documented more than 10 million workflows across 40,000 software applications. The startup said that it has more than 5 million users and is used by teams inside 94% of Fortune 500 companies. It counts teams at New York Life, T-Mobile, LinkedIn, Hubspot, and Northern Trust among its users. “It starts with the end user, and then goes up to their team lead, department lead, and then some kind of central function who are all interested in it for the question of, how do we scale, what we know, how to do, and how do we get better?” Jagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Well, LEGO has just dropped something that nails both: the Christmas Tree set is currently available on Amazon for just $26, off its original $44 price tag. This is the first time this festive set has gone on sale at the online retailer, and even LEGO's own website hasn't beaten it yet. This means you're able to adapt your display depending on your space whether you work with a spacious mantelpiece or a cozy desk corner. Designed for ages 12 and up, this set hits that sweet spot where it is engaging enough for teenagers and adults who love LEGO but will be accessible to younger builders who might want to tackle it with a bit of guidance. The construction process in itself is a holiday activity – one that you can work on solo during some quiet evening or make a group project with friends and family gathered around the table. Once completed, these trees easily transition into real home decor pieces: The larger one works beautifully as a tabletop centerpiece for your dining room or kitchen island, while the smaller configurations fit perfectly on bookshelves, windowsills, or office desks. Unlike other decorations that may feel fragile or dated, these LEGO creations bring a sense of playfulness and a modern aesthetic that appeals to design-conscious households. For parents who want to encourage creativity in their kids, this set provides just the right amount of structured building and imaginative play.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>“It's time for your lice check,” a woman who goes by “Ms. K” whispers directly into my ear as she starts running her fingers into my scalp and through each strand of hair. I'm in a dark room, Eastern flute music playing in the background as I sit across from my partner who's also having his hair caressed by a stranger. “OK kiddos, nobody wants to start their first day of school,” coos “Ms. “We're going to be really thorough, because a lot of critters and cooties can hide pretty well.” Our inspectors move on to drawing lines and circles into our heads with metal sticks before brushing our hair with combs as tingly, shivery sensations crawl from the back of my ears down to the middle of my spine. But after 10 minutes of leaning into the uncertainty and nearly falling asleep, our session ends as we're both “cleared” of lice and they tell us to “get back to class.” But I'm here to experience at Tinglesbar ASMR Spa & Collective in Toronto, Canada. Dubbed the world's first dedicated ASMR spa, I'm with a group of strangers pretending to be fifth grade students for a role-paying ASMR experience—and yes, I'm completely terrified. As a cynical person who hates viral internet trends transplanted to IRL scenarios (think Labubu milkshakes on sale at Erewhon), I thought I'd never be able to take this seriously, especially when it came to strangers touching me or whispering in my ear. ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response, is a sensation triggered by sounds, touch, feel, that send a tingly sensation through the body, usually around the neck and spine area. The term was technically coined in 2010, and since then, ASMR videos have skyrocketed on YouTube and TikTok, garnering billions of views. But Tinglesbar stands out for its role-playing offerings, which include Harry Potter role-play that aims to “un-petrify” you, a Fairy's Fortune role-play “offering sweet fairy whimsy and gentle answers from your mystical guide,” a doctor's visit that “blends light tapping, gentle examinations, and reassuring conversation to melt away tension,” and a 1940s beauty salon experience, in addition to the group hangouts. Despite the hype, it's not a phenomenon I've explored or taken seriously. Add the student role-play with a bunch of strangers who paid to do this, and it has me wondering: Can all these grown-ass people all just pretend to be children? And perhaps the most important question: Can I be converted into a believer? There's a table full of art supplies such as markers and paint, sounds playing from a speaker to imitate the ambience of a schoolyard, even snacks from our childhoods like Goldfish crackers and fruit snacks handed out to each of us in a brown paper bag. A woman in a smock and large tortoise-shell glasses introduces herself as Ms. G, our “art teacher,” and greets us all by asking us how our summer break was as we awkwardly smile back. To avoid breaking the ice with strangers, everyone immediately goes heads down into crafting. “How was the fourth grade for everyone?” Ms. G asks as we wonder who will speak up first. The others nod and smile; some say they weren't really athletic, but I'm relieved I could break the silence in what seemed like a room full of introverts. But as Ms. G continues to ask us about our favorite classroom memories and movies from our past, I start to notice that more of my “classmates” are sharing their experiences with one another, whether trading a nostalgic snack or comparing each others' artwork. As we craft, “students” in pairs are called into a room for the “lice checks.” To be clear, this isn't an actual check for lice but a teacher-student ASMR simulation. Each student that comes out after their check looks as if they'd enjoyed an hour-long massage, but it also melts the sort of awkwardness that's so common among adult strangers. It was a really nice experience,” our classmate Larissa Jhessin tells us. But once I got to that space, I did feel the goosebumps which, because of how new they were, put me in a realm of the unfamiliar and meditation. This is Jhessin's sixth time at Tinglesbar but her first in a group setting. As a college student who works full-time, she says she has been using ASMR for years to help her deal with high stress environments and to sleep. This is exactly what Tammy Lung envisioned when she had the idea to open Tinglesbar in 2018. Those “super soothing” sensations, which she couldn't define into a single concept pre high-speed internet days, were always part of her life, but they were also isolating because she didn't know if anyone else felt what she had. “It wasn't until like my early twenties I specifically looked on YouTube for makeup videos to help me fall asleep, and that's kind of when I found this term that kept coming up: ASMR,” Lung tells me. “It led me down a rabbit hole to all sorts of content, and I would just watch that every night throughout university to help me with stress or anxiety or sleep.” Some love the sounds of chewing and tongue clicks while others enjoy full narration, often in whispers or different accents. There's also a whole section of ASMR that focuses on the sounds and sensations of inanimate objects, for example, keyboard tapping, slicing vegetables, even a YouTube short ASMR video of a Labubu being sliced in half which has garnered 5 million views. “It's a lot of what you used to feel as a child in the form of care and comfort, and we don't get that as much. You don't get your hair brushed or back scratched,” she says. It's important “to relive the more simpler, gentler times of your life that you haven't been able to feel in a really long time and in a soothing, calming way,” Lung adds. For Milan Seki, a 32-year-old content creator who runs Invisible Strangers, a group dedicated to organizing meet-ups with introverts in Toronto, this is exactly the type of nostalgia she was hoping to experience while socializing with new people. “It really puts you in the moment, which I think we were all craving.” As a proud introvert, Seki told me that she did have some reservations before coming to a group ASMR role-play session but that the element of crafting and cosplaying was helpful to share a balance of socializing but also being immersed in an activity. “We have to be kids again,” she said, and I agree. We both wonder if our parents would enjoy the experience too. Check—but it does leave me wondering if anyone had left the role-play feeling weirded out. What's clear is that in this extremely antisocial era of AI chatbot companions, dating apps, and shitposting for engagement to feel social, my classmates and I very much organically started to talk to one another again, without a drink at the bar for the nerves or being introduced by a mutual friend. Perhaps sitting in a room full of strangers role-playing as children is the easiest way to meet people in real life again. Maybe letting someone you don't know caress your scalp away from the armor of your phone is the single most real thing you can do to feel human again. And while I personally may not necessarily be using ASMR as a daily sleep medicine, this experience taught me one thing: Even the most introverted of introverts crave companionship, even if it's in disguise.
