                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Four contenders will be reduced to one in African play-offs for the 2026 Fifa World Cup over this international window. After missing out on the continent's nine automatic qualification spots, Cameroon, DR Congo, Gabon and Nigeria travel to Morocco for a winner-takes-all mini-tournament. But, depending on their world ranking, the victorious nation faces one or two more matches in order to reach next year's tournament in Canada, Mexico and the United States. BBC Sport Africa explains how this stage works - and what comes next. Results against the sixth-placed side in eight of those groups were discounted because Eritrea withdrew on the eve of competition, leaving Group E with only five teams. Gabon had the best record, followed by DR Congo and then Cameroon. Nigeria only just sneaked in to the play-offs on goal difference, with Frank Onyeka's 91st-minute volley in their 4-0 win over Benin edging out Burkina Faso by a single goal. All three matches will be held in the Moroccan capital Rabat. New Caledonia and Bolivia are among potential opponents for the winners of African World Cup play-offs The United Arab Emirates and Iraq will play off for Asia's spot, while Bolivia, representing South America, and New Caledonia, representing Oceania, have already booked their places. Given Bolivia and New Caledonia are respectively ranked 76th and 150th in the world at present, that boosts the chances of Africa's representative advancing directly to a final. Nigeria boss Eric Chelle is under pressure to deliver World Cup qualification The Super Eagles had three different managers oversee their Group C fixtures and struggled when Victor Osimhen was absent through injury, only picking up four points from a possible 15 without their talismanic striker. Yet the West Africans are unbeaten in six competitive games under Eric Chelle as they bid to avoid missing out on successive World Cups. Cameroon are another heavyweight of the continental game who underperformed, finishing four points behind Cape Verde in Group D. The Indomitable Lions only won one of their five away games, which does not bode well for playing on neutral soil this month. DR Congo will be without injured Newcastle striker Yoane Wissa for the play-offs The bulk of Aubameyang's goals came when he netted four times against The Gambia last month before being sent off, although he is now back from suspension. As a result, the African side involved in next year's intercontinental play-off may know all of the sides they will potentially face in their World Cup group - should they make it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Three Gotham FC's standouts have received nominations for National Women's Soccer League awards. JERSEY CITY, N.J. – Three Gotham FC's standouts have received nominations for National Women's Soccer League awards. Forward Esther Gonzalez, defender Lilly Reale and goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger earned nominations after stellar campaigns that helped Gotham FC reach the playoffs. The inaugural NWSL Awards will be broadcast live on ESPN2 from San Jose on Wednesday, Nov. 19, celebrating the league's top players, coaches and performances ahead of the NWSL Championship. When she scored, Gotham probably won, providing much-needed excellence as the club battled injuries to key players throughout the campaign. The Spanish striker scored in seven of Gotham's nine regular-season wins and finished with 13 goals, second-most in the NWSL. Her four braces — two goals in one game — tied an NWSL season record. Gonzzlez's midseason scoring run was historic – she scored seven goals in a four-match span, equaling the league record for most goals in that span. She also became the third player since 2013 to score seven or more goals in her first seven games of a season, joining Alex Morgan (2022) and Sophia Wilson (2024). Her impact was immediate and often decisive: six opening goals, 11 first-half strikes (second-most in league history). Goalscoring only tells one part of a much larger story about a player's performance throughout the season, which is why Reale was nominated for rookie of the year/ The 22-year-old made a seamless transition from collegiate star center back to NWSL star fullback, putting together one of the most impressive all-around rookie campaigns in recent NWSL memory. In her first season, Reale started 21 matches and appeared in all 26, anchoring one of the league's best defensive units and becoming a regular U.S. women's national team call-up. She delivered on both ends of the field – scoring her first professional goal against North Carolina on April 13 and assisting fellow rookie Sarah Schupansky's tally in Gotham's 3-0 win over Washington, marking the club's first rookie-to-rookie goal since 2019. Her 12-tackle performance at Washington tied the NWSL record for most in a game since 2016. The reigning NWSL goalkeeper of the year, Berger delivered another record-setting campaign, marked by excellence with her feet and shot stopping, in her first full season with Gotham FC. She led the league in clearances/punches (33), headed clearances (4) and possessions won (69).

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MEXICO CITY (AP) — Federal infrastructure projects in Mexico for the 2026 World Cup will be completed in time for the start of the tournament in June, President Claudia Sheinbaum announced on Monday. The projects include the renovation of the two terminals at Mexico City International Airport, and construction of a train line connecting the city with Felipe Ángeles International Airport in Santa Lucía, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) from Mexico City. The World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, which will stage 13 matches, five of them in the capital. Guadalajara and Monterrey share the other eight games. Sheinbaum became Mexico's first female president last year. She said those details will be released in the coming weeks. Azteca Stadium, set to be the first venue to host three World Cup opening matches, has been closed for renovations but the investment is being made by a private company. Sheinbaum did not provide details about that project. She said Mexico expects an additional 5.5 million visitors across the three host cities. “It will be a very special time with a significant economic impact, but we will be ready in a few months,” Sheinbaum said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester United youngster James Overy could find himself in the unusual position of appearing at a World Cup before he has even made his senior debut for the club. The 18-year-old right-back has impressed at youth level since arriving at Old Trafford last year despite a long-term Achilles injury that sidelined him for eight months, but is yet to be handed a maiden first-team outing by head coach Ruben Amorim despite stepping up in training several times already at Carrington. That has not stopped Overy from progressing quickly on the international scene, having been handed his first senior call-up by Australia as part of an experimental squad for their upcoming friendly double-header in the United States against South American opposition in the form of Venezuela and Colombia. Socceroos boss Tony Popovic, the former Crystal Palace defender, is open to picking the teenager in his squad for next summer's World Cup finals in North America after Overy made a significant impression during the recent Under-20 tournament in Chile, where Australia failed to reach the knockout stages after placing third in their group behind eventual finalists Argentina, and Italy. “He's worth having a look at,” Popovic said this week. “I'm very open-minded about what that looks like for the immediate future and long term. Australia qualified for their sixth successive World Cup finals back in June following a 2-1 comeback win away in Saudi Arabia, having improved considerably under Popovic following the shock resignation of former head coach Graham Arnold last year. A World Cup call-up would cap a remarkably swift rise for Overy, who began his career in Australia with Perth Glory and featured in a friendly against West Ham before relocating to the UK with his family and playing for Devon-based non-league side Newton Abbot Spurs. He joined United's academy in May 2024 on an initial scholarship basis and later signed his first professional contract this summer. Overy - born in Australia - is also eligible to represent Scotland at international level and previously played for their U19s before a switch of allegiance.</p>

2026 FIFA World Cup Boston Host Committee officials revealed that local companies and other donors have “only pledged about” $20M to fund the tournament as the city continues efforts to cover costs, according to Shirley Leung of the BOSTON GLOBE. That is “just enough to cover the cost of FIFA-mandated requirements” that Gillette will need to host games, from a “new irrigation system to a grass field.” Congress is still the “biggest single source of funding,” agreeing to provide $46.6M to “cover security.” Leung notes that “goes a long way to explain why” Boston 26 is “anxious about not getting $20 million it had requested from Beacon Hill -- where House and Senate leadership are at odds over how much to contribute.” Leung: “And as they pass the hat among big companies around town, folks aren't eager to chip in.” Fundraising has been “a slog in part because there are other big celebrations here next summer that also need corporate support.” There is the Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on July 4 to mark America's 250th birthday. That will be followed by the return of Sail Boston's Tall Ships July 11-16. Leung: “Perhaps complicating World Cup fund-raising is President Trump's recent threat to ‘take away' the games from Gillette Stadium and relocate them if he felt that Boston was ‘unsafe' to host soccer festivities.” SponsorUnited founder & CEO Bob Lynch said that the “uncertainty might give some corporate sponsors pause” (BOSTON GLOBE, 11/10).</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Brazilian superstar Neymar has been heavily criticised for his latest performance for Santos in a 3-2 defeat to Flamengo. Spanish newspaper Diario AS labelled the former Barcelona and PSG star "slow" and "a disgrace" and warned he faces a real battle to make Carlo Ancelotti's final Brazil squad for next year's World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. The match was Neymar's first start for two months and he came in for some rough treatment from AS after the game. "The former PSG player was sidelined for almost two months with Santos due to a muscle injury that kept him out of seven matches. He briefly returned in the draw against Fortaleza before missing another game. This long absence was reflected in his performance against Flamengo. Even so, he showed glimpses of his quality with a dangerous free-kick and a header that almost resulted in the equalizing goal." Neymar's side remain in the drop zone after 32 games played and are now two points from safety. Santos president Marcelo Teixeira has said previously he does want Neymar to stay but has also warned that there are financial limits when it comes to negotiating a new contract with the club. Get expert previews, data-driven predictions & winning insights with GOAL Tips on Telegram. Neymar had some harsh words for the officiating after Santos' latest defeat. He told Globo: "The referee is very bad. Besides being bad, with all due respect, he's arrogant. When we go to speak, he turns his back and runs away. When I talk to him, he threatens me. I got a yellow card because he threatened me. Neymar returned to Santos after an injury-plagued spell in Saudi Arabia and had been hoping to regain form and fitness with his former club with a view to securing a place in Brazil's 2026 World Cup squad. However, he has again been left out of Ancelotti's most recent list, with the Brazil boss admitting he is "close" to deciding his final squad for the tournament. The 66-year-old told reporters: "I think he needs to play more centrally, not as a winger, because wingers in today's football are players you need to help defensively as well. When you play a little more centrally, the defensive work is much less than when you play as a winger. And I also think that a very talented player, closer to the goal, has more opportunities to score goals. Neymar and Santos will continue their relegation battle at the weekend but face another difficult fixture next as they take on current league leaders Palmeiras. Meanwhile, Brazil will continue without Neymar over the international break when they take on Senegal and Tunisia in international friendlies.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Atletico Madrid have officially confirmed the sale of a majority stake in the club to global sports investment company Apollo Sports Capital (ASC). While ASC will become the majority owner, the club confirmed that Miguel Angel Gil and Enrique Cerezo remain in their roles as CEO and chairman respectively, and will remain as shareholders. The artnership aims to strengthen Atletico Madrid's position among football's elite and support long-term success for its millions of fans worldwide. Financial terms of the transaction have not been disclosed. The investment from ASC is set to provide substantial new capital for Atletico's ambitious long-term plans. A key focus will be further investment in all of Atletico Madrid's teams, encompassing the men's, women's and academy sides, to enhance their sporting competitiveness. This ambitious project envisions a new sports and entertainment centre adjacent to the Riyadh Air Metropolitano Stadium. The club stated: "The aim of this project is to become a world-class destination for sport, leisure, culture, and community activity." With Apollo's extensive experience in the sports, media, and entertainment sectors, ASC aspires to create a "dynamic, transformative, and multidisciplinary urban center for the people of Madrid." Angel Gil, Atletico's CEO, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership. "Atletico de Madrid is one of Europe's great sporting institutions, and it is an honour for Apollo Sports Capital to invest in this historic club and its legacy of over 120 years. Miguel Angel has done an extraordinary job transforming Atletico, and it was essential for us to invest in support of the continuity of his leadership, as well as investing in the team and the local community," Givone stated. Gil acknowledged the contributions of previous partners, saying, "Atletico would not be where it is today without the support of Wanda Group, Quantum Pacific, and Ares, whose backing has strengthened us at crucial moments." This collaboration with ASC is designed to build on that foundation, driving "solid and sustainable growth" for the club. Atletico will serve as the flagship investment for ASC, with the firm explicitly stating that it is "not part of a multi-ownership strategy to control clubs." This clarifies that ASC's interest is specific to Atletico and the club's potential, rather than building a portfolio of clubs under common ownership. Other recent investments by Apollo Sports Capital include stakes in the Mutua Madrid Open and Miami Open tennis tournaments, in partnership with MARI, and a new company formed by Ari Emanuel and Mark Shapiro. Atletico Madrid currently sit in fourth place in La Liga, with 25 points from 12 matches, including seven wins, four draws, and one loss. Their recent form has been strong, with four wins and one draw in their last five league matches, including a convincing 3-1 victory over Levante in their most recent fixture, where Antoine Griezmann scored twice. The club also confirmed that the investment extends to its affiliated clubs, Atletico de San Luis and Atletico Ottawa, which will also become majority-owned by Apollo Sports Capital. The current shareholders - Angel Gil, Cerezo, Quantum Pacific Group and funds managed by Ares Management - will retain minority stakes across these entities. On the field, Atletico will return from the international break to face Getafe in La Liga on Sunday, November 23. The continued leadership of Gil and Cerezo, combined with the new financial backing, signals a commitment to both tradition and ambitious growth, aiming to solidify Atletico Madrid's position among Europe's elite clubs in the long term.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Every week, we will bring you key information and analysis on the biggest talking points, cutting through the noisy world of all things Madridista with reporting you can trust. The bad taste left by last week, in which Real Madrid fell to a Champions League defeat against Liverpool and drew with Rayo Vallecano in La Liga. “It's still November, there's a long way to go. As was the case in his pre-match media appearance on Saturday, Alonso seemed much more serious when talking to reporters. He is facing criticism from inside and outside the club because his side are not performing as desired. Madrid have failed to score in back-to-back games for the first time since May 2023, despite having three attacking stars in Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham. The Athletic has reported that some of them are uncomfortable with Alonso's approach and some of his footballing ideas, as the new manager looks to implement his style. He was not in the starting line-up, with Alonso choosing midfielder Federico Valverde at right-back as captain Dani Carvajal recovers from knee surgery. We reported in our last Inside Real Madrid column — before Alexander-Arnold's emotionally charged return to Anfield — that he was in week seven of eight of his full recovery. He produced two failed crosses, did not complete a pass in the opposition half, lost possession four times, and contributed one interception. The club have called for time and patience since his arrival from Liverpool in June. It has become clear that his adaptation is not going to be easy. Dean Huijsen's performance was once again a cause for concern — the Dutch-born Spain centre-back was replaced at half-time after receiving a yellow card. The 20-year-old has been asked internally to show more focus and intensity. By contrast, academy graduate Raul Asencio played well against Rayo. “We had other forwards on the pitch who can also create danger,” Alonso explained in his press conference. Alonso tried to improve his attack with Rodrygo, who came on for Eduardo Camavinga in the 79th minute. The Brazil forward has not scored a goal for Madrid since March 4 and has yet to score or assist in La Liga this season. Some players ended the match at Vallecas with physical problems. Madrid announced he had a muscle injury on Monday. Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was also examined this Monday after experiencing a strain in his right thigh. Madrid announced he had a muscle injury on Monday. Like Valverde, he is expected not to travel with Belgium for their upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Kazakhstan and Liechtenstein. He is set to be out for around 10 days and the club hope both players will be back in time for Madrid's next La Liga fixture away to Elche on November 23. Among them are Borussia Dortmund, who have shown concrete interest in the promising youngster. The defender is not expected to leave, as Madrid have a lot of confidence in him. He signed his latest contract renewal in October 2024, just after a serious knee injury that kept him out of action last season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Tyler Adams has withdrawn from the United States men's national team squad for upcoming friendlies against Paraguay and Uruguay due to an injury sustained while playing for Bournemouth on Sunday. U.S. Soccer announced on Monday that Adams and fellow midfielder Sean Zawadzki would not be joining up with the USMNT in Philadelphia this week for a training camp and Saturday's match against Paraguay. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino called in LAFC midfielder Timmy Tillman as a late replacement. TEAM NEWS: Timmy Tillman has been added to the November camp roster. Tyler Adams and Sean Zawadzki have been withdrawn due to injury. But in the third minute of Sunday's English Premier League match between Bournemouth and Aston Villa, he clashed heads with team-mate Adam Smith. U.S. Soccer did not specify whether his withdrawal was due to a problem stemming from the collision, but did say that he and Zawadzki were “withdrawn due to injuries suffered in their club matches this past weekend”. Adams' withdrawal depletes an already-depleted USMNT even further. Christian Pulisic, Chris Richards, Tim Weah, Malik Tillman (Timmy's brother), Antonee Robinson and other mainstays had already been omitted from the latest roster. All are managing, recovering from or sidelined by injuries. Weston McKennie was also left out of the squad, apparently so that he can continue to establish himself at Juventus under new coach Luciano Spalletti. The roster still has plenty of central midfielders. Tanner Tessmann, Aidan Morris and Cristian Roldan can all play in Adams' position, and probably will start there this weekend against Paraguay and/or next Tuesday against Uruguay. Overall, though, this squad is a shell of the one that Pochettino will hope to take to the World Cup next summer. Henry Bushnell  is a senior writer for The Athletic covering soccer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team head coach Mauricio Pochettino has revealed that he would happily hand President Donald Trump the World Cup trophy should they pull off an unlikely feat on home soil, laughing off the hypothetical extravagance of the ceremony as typically American. In the even of that historic achievement, there is every chance that Trump would find himself close by. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. "For sure, I will give [it to him if we] win. I will give him the trophy, and he can lift the trophy for sure, no problem for me,” Pochettino said in a recent interview with the New York Post. “I think the president was [at the Club World Cup] and supporting soccer at a massive event. “Maybe he's not a soccer person, and he was a little bit in a situation where he didn't know what to do [in the celebrations], but it was funny. Trump, who has involved himself in World Cup planning by leading the White House World Cup Task Force and pushing for the World Cup draw to be at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., is expected to have a significant presence at the tournament. Meanwhile, Mexican and Canadian leaders Claudia Sheinbaum and Mark Carney are also likely to appear throughout next summer. “Maybe we'll see now at the draw, if there is the possibility to meet him and to say hello,” Pochettino added. “In case, to meet him, I want to say thank you for everything that he's doing, for soccer America...I think that is great because he's showing his support for soccer.” Before the draw and a potential meeting with President Trump, Pochettino will lead the USMNT into the final two friendly matches of 2025, taking on Paraguay on Nov. 15 in Philadelphia and Uruguay on Nov. 18 in Tampa.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Watch the Game Highlights from Kansas City Current vs. NJ/NY Gotham FC, 11/09/2025 (1:19) In less than 48 hours this weekend, the league that practically trademarked chaos outdid itself with two stoppage-time equalizers, three extra-time matches -- and one that progressed to a penalty shootout -- and an upset of arguably the best team in league history. It was like the telenovela that is the NWSL crammed a marathon of new episodes into one binge-worthy weekend. 1 seed Kansas City Current, who smashed NWSL records for points (65), wins (21) and goals allowed (just 13). - (2) Washington Spirit vs. (5) Portland Thorns, Nov. 15, noon ET - (4) Orlando Pride vs. (8) Gotham FC, Nov. 16, 3 p.m. The Kansas City Current are the deepest team in the NWSL, but as head coach Vlatko Andonovski lamented after his team's loss on Sunday, "the game is totally different" when they're missing MVP and two-time Golden Boot winner Temwa Chawinga and breakout forward Michelle Cooper, and they only have "half of Bia" Zaneratto due to a sprained MCL. Debinha beat two defenders and played Nichelle Prince in behind for a one-on-one with Gotham goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger, but Prince shot at a savable height for Berger and then fired the rebound off the German goalkeeper. However, those opportunities were few and far between on Sunday. Kansas City is always happy to concede possession and strike on the counterattack, but Gotham kept the game in front of them and benefitted from their opponent's absence. The threat behind never materialized for Kansas City. Andonovski said "it was a game of margins," while Gotham head coach Juan Carlos Amoros said they "showed the best version of ourselves." Gotham has been hot and cold this season, but they were never going to repeat their pedestrian performance of the week prior in North Carolina that cursed them with the No. Kansas City was a shadow of itself on Sunday. Their defense, which was practically impenetrable in the regular season, made some rare but costly mistakes, including when center-back and potential NWSL Defender of the Year Kayla Sharples stepped too aggressively to a ball and got beat by Jaedyn Shaw for Gotham's opening goal in the 68th minute. Kansas City's attack too often sputtered in the windchill and temperatures below freezing. Current winger Ellie Wheeler's stoppage-time equalizer to extend the game was surprising given how Kansas City struggled to create opportunities. Gotham also advanced without Esther González (hip), who scored 13 goals this season, two fewer than Chawinga. This wasn't quite David beating Goliath -- Gotham is only two years removed from a championship, had one of the best teams last year, and won the first Concacaf title earlier this year -- but there is no getting around that this is a major disappointment and a failure for Kansas City. But Marta, the six-time world player of the year and greatest ever, isn't just any player. So, when the Orlando Pride captain picked up the ball in her own half with her team leading the Seattle Reign 1-0 and the allotted five minutes of stoppage time already passed, she ran, and ran ... and some 75 yards later, after she beat two defenders her junior and drifted near the corner, she defied conventional wisdom and turned her body inward to run toward goal. Marta hates kicking the ball to nobody, she later admitted. As if Marta hadn't entertained us enough with the encore to last year's tantalizing semifinal goal -- or with her dramatic protests caught in up-close, dizzying fashion by the new referee body camera -- she followed up after the game with a soulful rant about how people "talk so much s---" about the champions, and it motivates her. Watch your favorite events in the newly enhanced ESPN App. Learn more about what plan is right for you. Haley McCutcheon, hereby known as "McClutcheon" for her playoff goals, scored the game-winning goal for Orlando on Friday. Jacqueline Ovalle, new to this whole NWSL playoff drama as a then-world-record transfer in August, applied the sauce and served crosses into dangerous areas. Missing still is injured star Barbra Banda, but the Pride might have momentum on their side. Aubrey Kingsbury completes a legendary performance with her third save in penalties as Washington knocks out Racing Louisville. Is the very sight of Washington Spirit goalkeeper Aubrey Kingsbury intimidating to opponents in a penalty shootout? Spirit head coach Adrian Gonzalez asked after his team survived and advanced against a plucky Louisville team, drawing a laugh from the crowded press room. Kingsbury saved two penalties and Racing Louisville missed another on Saturday in the shootout. Racing's penalties were collectively poor, perhaps a sign of the pressure finally getting to a team playing its first playoff game in front of a raucous, partisan crowd after taking the game to the brink. But this wasn't Kingsbury's first rodeo. Washington needed her, too, on Saturday as star forward Trinity Rodman watched from the bench due to a recent MCL sprain, fullback Gabby Carle left the game with a hamstring injury, and emerging USWNT center-back Tara McKeown exited in extra time with an ankle injury that had her on crutches in the tunnel afterward. Rosemonde Kouassi and Gift Monday carried the offensive load for Washington, and the Spirit did just about everything right -- staying compact, winning second balls, limiting transition moments to hopeful long balls -- until they didn't. "If I'm honest with you, I think that [mental aspect] is more important than the tactics for me," Gonzalez said, adding that he and the players all work with sports psychologists. Their work includes mental preparation for penalties. Center-back and England international Esme Morgan embodied the Spirit's joyful resolve. The Spirit continue to do things the hard way in the playoffs: They needed extra time or penalty kicks twice last year and twice in their run to a 2021 NWSL Championship. "It's a crazy league," Morgan said after Saturday's match. "You can't switch off for one second, so we'll learn from it." Is Washington healthy enough to win it all? And while the trend is odd and borderline ludicrous at a macro level, Portland makes the most valid point. They began this season in eerily similar fashion to 2024: with a humbling loss in Kansas City followed by unsteady results. But things began to click when the calendar flipped to September, and Portland has lost only twice in nine games since including Sunday's quarterfinal victory over San Diego. The midfield triangle of Sam Coffey, Olivia Moultrie and Jessie Fleming has driven that success, and perhaps eased the sting of the team trading fan-favorite Hina Sugita in October. Guess who combined to create their lone goal on Sunday? What is so different about this Thorns team now? How has a Thorns team that lost multiple starters to injury in preseason, played without star Sophia Wilson (maternity leave), and wobbled into the summer break, outlasted that steamrolling Current team? "That takes time to build," said Thorns head coach Rob Gale on Sunday. "You don't wave a magic wand from the stands and suddenly it all comes together. It's a turnover of the group dealing with adversity. But they've stuck together throughout, and any time it got a little dicey or we had a bad result, we rebounded. "The bounce-back ability of this team has been absolutely outstanding all season long. No big cellies; we ain't done yet." It is the NWSL's most storied franchise, a place that World Cup champions and world-leading goal-scorers have called home. This rendition of the Thorns lacks the relative star power and dominance of those yesteryear teams, but Coffey and Moultrie are two of the holdovers from that 2022 squad. Maybe this Thorns team was written off in the summer. Maybe we've all been too distracted by Kansas City, and we have failed to recognize other brewing successes.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team play their final two friendlies of 2025 in the November international window as they take on 2026 World Cup-bound duo Paraguay and Uruguay. Coming off a win against Australia and a draw with Ecuador in October, manager Mauricio Pochettino will hope his squad can continue to build momentum, especially considering they won't play another game until March. Several players, including Christian Pulisic, Weston McKennie and Chris Richards, won't be in the team this time around, leaving Pochettino plenty of decisions to make as those on the periphery try to stake their claims for a spot on his 26-player roster. Luckily for him, quite a few players are in form. Sign Up to Get Informed With SI FC. Celtic picked up a convincing 4–0 win over Kilmarnock in Scottish Premiership action, with Trusty putting in a strong performance before heading over the Atlantic to join up with the USMNT. The 27-year-old completed the most passes in the match with a whopping 98, and chipped in with nine defensive contributions on what was an overall dominant day for the Scottish giants, who are still seven points back of league leaders Hearts.As a team, the performance proved a vital bounce-back after a 3–1 loss in Europa League action midweek against FC Midtjylland, where Trusty still stood out with 15 defensive contributions, even as his side was overwhelmed. While he plays in a four-man backline at Celtic, his rare call-up to the USMNT could see him try to fit into a three-man defense. Joe Scally has a critical camp coming up as he gets his first legitimate opportunity in Pochettino's build towards the World Cup. Luckily for him, he enters camp in good form. The 22-year-old played all 90 minutes for Borussia Mönchengladbach in a 3–1 victory over FC Köln. While Köln held most of the possession and controlled the match, Scally was balanced in his approach, helping his side secure a third win in a row. Defensively, he made three recoveries, two tackles and won five duels. Cristian Roldan continued to play a key role for Seattle Sounders FC in the MLS Cup playoffs, even as their season came to a close in a dramatic penalty shootout in Game 3 of the best-of-three series against Minnesota United.While Roldan won't have club soccer to return to this season after the November window, he had a match to remember in the 3–3 draw that preempted the 10-round penalty shootout. In the 90 minutes, he completed two dribbles and won 10 duels, while also setting up Jordan Morris's 88th-minute tying goal to send the series to a decisive shootout. Ricardo Pepi scored a clutch goal for PSV Eindhoven in the UEFA Champions League, finishing a chance in the third minute of second-half stoppage time to clinch a 1–1 draw with Greek giants Olympiacos. He continued that stellar form on the weekend as well, scoring his fourth goal of the Ligue 1 season in a 4–1 loss to Lens, but his performance lost some of his lustre when he was sent off in the 45th minute—his red card meaning he's suspended for Monaco's clash with Rennes post-international break.For the USMNT, that's potentially good news in a roundabout way, as there will be less pressure from his club side to manage minutes knowing he's going to have a watching brief on Nov. 22. Pochettino will certainly hope it's Balogun's goalscoring form that comes over to the international stage, rather than his ill-discipline.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>World Cup fever will descend upon Boston next summer, but who will pay for the potential $100-plus million price tag to host the games? So far, not enough players are stepping onto the pitch. Boston is one of 16 cities in North America to host World Cup matches, with seven games scheduled at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough between June 13 and July 9. Fans from around the world will be snatching up tickets, and some will likely be staying here for days, even weeks. Entertaining them all costs money, at least $100 million, and it's mostly on local organizers to foot the bill. Host committee Boston 26 had planned to raise much of it through corporate sponsorships. But so far, local companies and other donors have only pledged about $20 million, according to Boston 26 officials. That goes a long way to explain why Boston 26 is anxious about not getting $20 million it had requested from Beacon Hill — where House and Senate leadership are at odds over how much to contribute. And as they pass the hat among big companies around town, folks aren't eager to chip in. Many will come from abroad, and could stay for an extended period as their favorite team plays in the group stage, and perhaps beyond. The idea is to show them — and locals — a good time, with a “FIFA Fan Festival” that would host watch parties and lots of futbol-related fun over several weeks. Expect one centrally located main venue, potentially on City Hall Plaza, Boston Common, or Lawn on D in the Seaport District, along with other gatherings set up around the region. Mike Loynd, CEO OF Boston 26, compared hosting World Cup to having “seven Super Bowls in a month's time.” But with the tournament just seven months away, finalizing plans has been difficult because Boston 26 is unsure how much money it can raise, even as other host cities like Atlanta and Kansas City, Mo., have already unveiled elaborate fan fests. Fund-raising has been a slog in part because there are other big celebrations here next summer that also need corporate support. Even as World Cup winds down, Boston will be getting ready for what is expected to be a bigger-than-usual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular on the Esplanade on July 4 to mark America's 250th birthday. That will be followed by the return of Sail Boston's Tall Ships July 11-16. Meanwhile, Sail Boston's Tall Ships has been fund-raising for two years seeking around $4 million in sponsorships. Funders so far include Meet Boston, the region's travel tourism bureau, Hampshire House Hospitality Group, Fidelity, and Mapfre Insurance. Perhaps complicating World Cup fund-raising is President Trump's recent threat to “take away” the games from Gillette Stadium and relocate them if he felt that Boston was “unsafe” to host soccer festivities. That kind of uncertainty might give some corporate sponsors pause, says Bob Lynch, founder and CEO of SponsorUnited, a data platform that tracks sponsorship deals. “It's a great excuse for brands that are on the fence to be like, ‘Well, let's take our time,' ” he said. World Cup sponsorship deals are big-ticket items, likely in the millions of dollars, which means they can take longer to ink. The wildly popular soccer tournament, which takes place every four years, will ultimately attract billions of dollars in sponsorship and worldwide broadcast deals — money FIFA mostly keeps for itself. That means host cities are on their own to pay for World Cup-related events. Boston 26 can't go after just any corporate sponsor. They have to make sure they don't conflict with exclusive partnerships that FIFA has with brands like Adidas, Coca-Cola, and Unilever. It's a problem that other host cities are also grappling with, said Michael Rocha-Keys, CEO of EMW Global, an international sports marketing agency. He has been advising clients to get “creative” and find workarounds for which “you don't need FIFA's approval.” Some cities, for example, might organize fan festivals without the FIFA branding. Meet Boston generates its revenue from a surcharge on hotel rooms in Boston and Cambridge, which it plows back into boosting tourism. That's far less than the $37.5 million Boston 26 had asked from Governor Maura Healey to defray costs for transportation and fan festivities, and only half of the $20 million they ultimately requested. Boston 26 is worried that the decrease in state funding will affect transportation plans and how fun Fan Festival can be. That matters because business and civic leaders hope that successfully hosting the World Cup will lead to other opportunities for Boston to stage high-profile sporting events like the NBA All-Star game or NFL draft.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Craig Gordon is "absolutely" ready to start for Scotland in this month's crucial World Cup qualifiers against Greece and Denmark despite being current second-choice goalkeeper with Heart of Midlothian. An injury to Angus Gunn, who started Scotland's first four matches in the World Cup group stage, leaves head coach Steve Clarke with a decision to make over a replacement. Liam Kelly is also second choice for Rangers, while Scott Bain has been recalled - six years after earning his third cap - after playing regularly for promoted Falkirk following his summer move from Celtic. Asked whether he was primed to earn his 82nd cap in Piraeus on Saturday, Gordon replied: "Yeah, absolutely. "It's an unfortunate situation that we're in at the moment where there's not many goalkeepers playing first-team football." Clark had showed loyalty to Gunn despite the 29-year-old himself being frozen out at Nottingham Forest after his summer switch from Norwich City. Gordon's experience dwarfs that of the other remaining goalkeepers in Clark's squad, although the former Celtic and Sunderland number one did concede Bain is "a little bit ahead in terms of match practice". "We've played them quite a few times recently and mixed results," Gordon said. "It's going to be a real tough one, regardless of whether they're already out or not. Turning 43 next month, he knows this will be his last chance to play in a major finals and it would fulfill a lifelong dream to play on the biggest stage of all.
