Haas chiefs Gene Haas and Ayao Komatsu are both gearing up for Formula 1 outings as the team continue their 10th anniversary celebrations.

Haas have announced that team founder and owner Gene Haas, as well as team boss Ayao Komatsu, will get behind the wheel of Formula 1 machinery at the upcoming Goodwood Festival of Speed.

After marking their 200th F1 start at the recent Canadian Grand Prix, the US-led operation will continue celebrations with a series of activities at the annual motorsport gathering, which features a world-famous hillclimb.

This includes Gene Haas driving the 2023-specification VF-23 on Friday, July 11, with Komatsu also making an appearance in the following season's VF-24.

Haas revealed that the pair got their first taste of F1 machinery together during a private shakedown at Silverstone a couple of weeks ago, with Gene completing a handful of laps on the Stowe track configuration.

Kazuki Nakajima, Vice Chairman of Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, will kick off the four-day event by driving the VF-23 on Thursday, July 10, alongside Komatsu in the VF-24, before full-time Haas drivers Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon take over weekend driving duties.

Alongside their hillclimb activities, Haas will have a strong presence within the Ballroom Paddock, showcasing the VF-16 – the team's first F1 car – as well as the VF-25, which will be raced in the British Grand Prix just a few days before.

Haas' activities at Goodwood coincide with the Festival of Speed's celebration to mark the 75th anniversary of the F1 World Championship – several other teams and drivers up and down the grid are also set to attend the event.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Charles Leclerc praised Ferrari for their “great job” in delivering effective upgrades at this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, after he and the team returned to the podium places. Ferrari brought floor upgrades to the SF-25 at the Red Bull Ring in a bid to get their season back on track following an up-and-down sequence of races that swung between fighting for trophies to struggling for minor points. Having split McLaren pair Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in Qualifying, thanks in part to the Australian being hampered by yellow flags, Leclerc dropped to third at the first corner and held that ‘best of the rest' spot thereafter, with team mate Lewis Hamilton backing him up in fourth. Reflecting on Piastri's first-lap pass, and how his race unfolded from that point, Leclerc said: “I was not planning to try and overtake in Turn 1, actually. The team has done a great job in bringing those upgrades and we did steps in the right direction, but we are still missing a little bit of pace.” Asked if he feels like there is now “light at the end of the tunnel” for Ferrari, Leclerc replied: “I hope so! I mean, we are working in the right direction for sure – this weekend proves it. “I think we have done small steps in the right direction. Hamilton was also keen to “take the positives” from the weekend – pointing to both Ferraris finishing within half a minute of winner Norris after some much bigger deficits so far this year. “We've made progress as a team, which is really positive. “It's great for us to be the second-fastest team this weekend and to be so close to… we're not a minute down [on the leaders], which is really positive. “Obviously we can't do what the McLarens can do at the moment, but this is really I think down to the great upgrade that we had, and I think we had a better execution as a team this weekend.” As for whether he and Ferrari can use the weekend as a stepping stone to more success, Hamilton continued: “I can see Qualifying is getting better. I had massive understeer in the low-speed and massive oversteer in the high-speed – nothing I could do with my tools could fix that. Ferrari have moved back up to second in the Teams' Championship following Sunday's race in Spielberg, one point ahead of rivals Mercedes, who failed to score with Kimi Antonelli after the rookie ran into Max Verstappen's Red Bull on the opening lap.</p>

Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri secured a 1-2 for McLaren at the Red Bull Ring after a series of tense battles.

Lando Norris came out on top in a fierce battle with his McLaren team mate in the Austrian Grand Prix, crossing the line marginally ahead of Oscar Piastri as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took the final podium spot.

It was an action packed race at the Red Bull Ring, starting with Kimi Antonelli locking up and taking out Max Verstappen on the opening lap before Norris and Piastri began their intense fight for the lead.

The Australian momentarily took P1 on Lap 11 before Norris reclaimed it and later became the first McLaren to pit for fresh tyres, while Piastri elected to stay out for four more laps. His advantage of newer tyres disappeared as both contended with getting past backmarkers, ultimately leading to the Briton finishing just over two seconds ahead of his team mate.

Elsewhere, both Williams drivers retired from the race with mechanical issues, with Carlos Sainz unable to even start the Grand Prix as his rear brakes caught fire in the pit lane. It was a much better race for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, who maintained his Qualifying position of P8 to secure his first points of the season.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Lando Norris returned to winning ways at the Austrian Grand Prix after getting the better of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in a head-to-head scrap for victory – title rival Max Verstappen having been eliminated in a first-lap incident. Norris converted pole position into the lead at Turn 1 but soon came under intense pressure from championship leader Piastri, who launched several attacks and at one point muscled his way past, only for the positions to be swiftly reversed. After a particularly close call under braking for Turn 4, which saw Piastri lock up and almost run into the back of Norris, the Australian went slightly longer on his starting set of tyres in an attempt to build an advantage for the remainder of the race. In the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who travelled home pre-race for “personal reasons”, the upgraded Ferraris had quiet but fruitful races en route to a podium with Charles Leclerc and fourth-place result with Lewis Hamilton. The stewards later gave Antonelli a three-place grid penalty for his next race. Liam Lawson capitalised to convert his top-six grid slot into a top-six finish, ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Kick Sauber's Bortoleto, who scored his first F1 points after a monumental scrap with the two-time World Champion. A strong recovery from the back of the grid brought a third successive points finish for Nico Hulkenberg, and gave Sauber a double points reward, while Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10 places for Haas. Ollie Bearman followed team mate Ocon home in 11th, with Isack Hadjar 12th in the other Racing Bulls machine and Pierre Gasly dropping from points contention to 13th amid severe balance problems aboard his Alpine. Next up was Lance Stroll, whose eye-catching practice pace could not be carried over to Qualifying or the race, while Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) were the final drivers to cross the finish line. Tsunoda was hit with a 10-second penalty of his own for sending Colapinto into a spin earlier in the race, with Verstappen and Antonelli joined on the sidelines by Williams drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz – the latter unable to start after getting stuck on the grid. Following that dramatic clash with team mate Piastri in Canada last time out, Norris came back fighting when he hit the track at the Red Bull Ring – the Briton displaying rapid pace through practice before charging his way to pole position in Qualifying. Norris ended Q3 a whopping half a second clear of nearest rival Leclerc, with Piastri having to settle for third after being hindered by yellow flags on his final run, and reigning World Champion Verstappen also losing out to the caution down in seventh. As the anticipated two-stop race approached, amid rising air and track temperatures, it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Gasly, Hadjar, Colapinto, Bearman and Hulkenberg opting for softs. There was drama on the formation lap, though, with Sainz struggling to pull away from his P19 grid slot and getting left behind. Another formation lap followed some 10 minutes later, with Sainz sadly unable to take the start after returning his Williams to the pit lane, where it overheated. Alonso also noted the high temperatures, reporting that his seat felt like it was “200 degrees”. When the race eventually began, Norris made a strong enough getaway to retain his pole advantage into Turn 1, while Piastri swept around the outside of Leclerc for P2 and Russell went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris. As the field roared towards Turn 3, where Norris covered off Piastri, more drama ensued when Antonelli lost control of his Mercedes under braking and slammed into Verstappen's car – putting both drivers out of the race. Lawson was fortunate to avoid being a third retirement. Turn 4 was the scene for another heart-in-mouth moment a couple of laps later when Piastri – having remained within a second of his team mate – used the Drag Reduction System to get perilously close. With Gasly's soft tyres seemingly degrading, Albon continued his progress thanks to a clean move for sixth place under braking for Turn 3. On Lap 11, the lead battle kicked off again when Piastri used DRS to grab the lead from Norris into Turn 3. As the laps ticked by, Piastri remained glued to Norris' gearbox, having several sniffs at another overtake but not quite managing to find a way past. How much longer could his starting set of tyres hold on while running in the dirty air of his team mate? Lap 20 brought another flashpoint in a tense battle between Norris and Piastri, with the latter locking up heavily into Turn 4 and almost running into the back of his team mate. Norris subsequently took to the pit lane for a fresh set of tyres, while Piastri continued on his way. “The data looks OK to continue,” his engineer subsequently confirmed. Piastri decided that enough was enough at the end of Lap 24 and pitted for his own set of fresh hard tyres, coming back out some 5.5 seconds behind Norris. Leclerc and Hamilton pitted shortly afterwards, meaning McLaren were now back in their 1-2 positions. As the race settled down again, with Norris further extending his lead to 6.5 seconds, Piastri's engineer gave him some “feedback” from the McLaren pit wall. Splitting the Ferraris of Leclerc and Hamilton, fourth-placed Lawson and fifth-placed Alonso were now the only drivers yet to pit. With new tyres at his disposal, Hamilton soon worked his way past both drivers – including a bold move on the outside of Lawson at Turn 6. Then came more drama at Turn 4 when Tsunoda, having already engaged in battle with Stroll, tipped Colapinto into a spin. It was not much better for the other Alpine of Gasly, who was valiantly holding onto a points-paying position but faced huge problems in the cockpit. I'm about to spin every corner,” he shouted over the radio, with a swear word for good measure. Tsunoda was promptly given a 10-second penalty for the incident with Colapinto, before stops from Lawson and Alonso at the halfway mark meant every driver had now pitted – those two seemingly on course for the alternate one-stop approach. With 35 laps to run, Norris led Piastri by 5.3 seconds. Back at the front, Piastri was starting to put Norris under pressure again, reducing his team mate's advantage to three seconds with that tyre delta. “He's mainly quicker in high-speed,” Norris was told, along with some time loss through traffic. With the two-stoppers cycling through their final tyre changes, radio messages picked up Hamilton commenting that “I don't want to stop”, having reported that his rubber felt fine. No positions were lost when he returned to the track, at least. Norris was next in on Lap 52, followed by Piastri one tour later – both drivers taking on medium tyres and the positions remaining unchanged. However, Piastri's efforts to cut Norris' lead were hampered by traffic. From there, Norris managed the gap back to Piastri and calmly worked his way through more traffic – which involved Alonso and Bortoleto's feisty exchange – to seal the deal and bag the win, cutting his team mate's championship advantage to 15 points. Leclerc completed the podium over Hamilton, followed by Russell, a high-flying Lawson and Alonso, who narrowly beat Bortoleto to seventh via some brilliant late racing but could not take the shine off the Brazilian's maiden F1 points finish. As mentioned above, Verstappen and Antonelli both watched the race from the paddock after their first-lap collision, while Williams suffered one of their worst days of the season thanks to Albon and Sainz's double elimination. We [me and Piastri] had a great battle, that's for sure. The DRS [effect] is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well.</p>
