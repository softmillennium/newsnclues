                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New satellite images show continuing work at Iran's Fordow nuclear enrichment plant, which was struck by US B-2 bombers just over a week ago. The imagery was collected by Maxar Technologies on Sunday. Maxar said it “reveals ongoing activity at and near the ventilation shafts and holes caused by last week's airstrikes on the Fordow fuel enrichment complex.” Earlier this month, American B-2 bombers dropped more than a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites, while Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine hit the Isfahan site in central Iran. Albright assessed that the activity “may include backfilling the craters, as well as conducting engineering damage assessments and likely radiological sampling. Related article UN nuclear watchdog chief says Iran could again begin enriching uranium in ‘matter of months' However, there are yet no indications of any efforts to reopen any of the tunnel entrances,” Albright posted on X. On Sunday, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog said US strikes on Iran fell short of causing total damage to its nuclear program and that Tehran could restart enriching uranium “in a matter of months,” contradicting President Donald Trump's claims the US set Tehran's ambitions back by decades. The comments by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi appear to support an early assessment from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, first reported on by CNN, which suggests the United States' strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites last week did not destroy the core components of its nuclear program, and likely only set it back by months. While the final military and intelligence assessment has yet to come, Trump has repeatedly claimed to have “completely and totally obliterated” Tehran's nuclear program. CNN's Laura Sharman and Sophie Tanno contributed to this report.</p>

Israeli soldiers are ordered to treat crowds of Palestinians gathered to receive humanitarian aid in Gaza as a “hostile force” and communicate with the desperate aid seekers by opening fire, according to a new report citing soldiers who were deployed in Gaza. Haaretz, echoing reporting by Palestinians and humanitarian groups on the ground, reports that Israeli soldiers are told to shoot at crowds to prevent them from approaching an aid site before it's open. The fact that they are civilians doesn't matter, soldiers say, and military leaders pay no mind as to whether or not civilians are killed as a result. “Once, the mortars stopped firing, and we saw people starting to approach. Indeed, Palestinian officials and journalists have repeatedly reported Israel hitting crowds with tank fire and other heavy weapons, often causing hundreds of casualties at once, on a near-daily basis.​​ Israeli forces have killed at least 583 Palestinians and injured 4,186 more at sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the Gaza Ministry of Health has reported. Sources said private contractors are “making a fortune” by demolishing homes in Gaza, with the government paying out the equivalent of $1,500 per home. The Israeli military has claimed that they are simply firing “warning shots” at aid seekers. However, even if this were a legitimate practice, it seems to be yet another coverup from the military as soldiers say they've been instructed to open fire directly on civilians. Soldiers say that this and other practices have made Gaza into a combat zone unlike any other, where there are no rules about who constitutes a legitimate target or whether or not there are instances where soldiers should restrain from fire. “Technically, it's supposed to be warning fire — either to push people back or stop them from advancing,” one reserve tank soldier told Haaretz. Every time we fire, there are casualties and deaths, and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there's never a good answer. “No one stops to ask why dozens of civilians looking for food are being killed every day.” Under pressure from an array of McCarthyist anti-speech tactics, independent journalists at Truthout face new and mounting political repression.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump is threatening to impose higher tariffs on Japanese exports to the United States over what he claims is the country's unwillingness to buy American-grown rice. In other words, we'll just be sending them a letter, and we love having them as a Trading Partner for many years to come,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. The country bought $298 million worth of rice from the US last year, according to US Census Bureau trade data. However, it's unclear if Japanese officials involved in ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries have said they will stop buying rice from the US in the future. Representatives from Japan's embassy in the US did not immediately respond to CNN. A 2021 report published by the Office of the United States Trade Representative under former President Joe Biden stated that “Japan's highly regulated and nontransparent system of importation and distribution for rice limits the ability of US exporters to have meaningful access to Japan's consumers.” A source familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN that's what he was referring to in his post. Trump has said recently that his administration plans to send some foreign countries letters advising them of what their new tariff rates could be, following the pause of his April “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners. And in a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday, Trump singled out Japan as one of the possible countries set to receive a letter. “Dear Mr. Japan, here's the story: You're going to pay a 25% tariff on your cars,” he said. Trump's Truth Social message comes with just days to go until the July 9 deadline when his 90-day pause on those “reciprocal” tariffs expires. It's unclear what will happen to tariff rates for the dozens of impacted countries. Before Trump announced the pause, Japanese exports were briefly subjected to a minimum tariff rate of 24%.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A lieutenant colonel flying a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet was killed during the overnight aerial strike while on duty, the Air Force said on June 29. Russia launched a "massive" missile and drone strike across Ukraine early on June 29, unleashing 537 aerial targets, including 477 drones and 60 missiles, according to the Air Force.. The Air Force added that his aircraft was damaged while he was trying to shoot down the last one, losing altitude and crashing. "The work of Ukrainian pilots is extremely dangerous and risky, both when striking enemy ground targets and repelling air attacks," the Air Force added, saying that the F-16 pilots destroy dozens of Shahed-type drones. In his evening address, President Volodymyr Zelensky posthumously awarded Ustymenko with the Hero of Ukraine award. Russia has intensified its aerial campaign on Kyiv and other cities over the past month. Zelensky said that Russia has launched over 2,700, or roughly 9.5%, of the total number of Shahed-type drones deployed during the entire full-scale war in June alone. Though well protected with Western air defense systems compared to other cities, Kyiv has also faced a number of deadly attacks in June, with the June 17 missile and drone strike on Kyiv killing 30. The Air Force said that Ukraine had to use "all available means" to repel the Russian aerial attack overnight on June 29, including elite F-16 jets. Ukraine received its first batch of F-16 jets in the summer of 2024, but it has not revealed many details about how and where they are used in operations since they are a high-priority target for Moscow.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Suspect charged with 12 hate-crime counts over attack as officials say Karen Diamond died from ‘severe injuries' Karen Diamond died as a result of “the severe injuries that she suffered in the attack”, Boulder county district attorney's office said in a statement. She died on Wednesday, according to the Boulder Jewish Community Center. The Boulder county district attorney's office announced that after Diamond's death, it is filing additional charges – including first-degree murder – against Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, an Egyptian man charged in the attack. He was charged with trying to kill the eight people who were hurt when he threw molotov cocktails – bottles filled with flammable liquid that are ignited – as well as other people nearby. Soliman was being represented by public defenders who typically do not comment on their cases to news media. Soliman, who is also being prosecuted in state court for attempted murder and other charges, told investigators he tried to buy a gun but was not able to because he was not a “legal citizen”. Soliman did not speak during Friday's hearing, and he listened to translations provided by an Arabic interpreter through headphones. Soliman is reported to have been living in the US illegally with his family, and had posed a gardener and wore a construction vest to get close to the group before launching the attack, prosecutors allege. They say the victims were targeted because of their perceived or actual national origin. An attack motivated by someone's political views is not considered a hate crime under federal law. The attack attributed to Soliman came days after two employees at Israel's embassy in Washington DC were killed in a shooting incident outside the Capital Jewish museum. A suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 31, has been charged in the Washington DC attack, which is being investigated by the FBI as an act of targeted violence.</p>

Support justice-driven, accurate and transparent news — make a quick donation to Truthout today! Zohran Mamdani has said that billionaires shouldn't exist, repeating a longtime goal of the left as he affirmed his commitment to equality instead in an interview on Sunday. Do you think billionaires have a right to exist?” asked the NBC host, Kristen Welker, weirdly echoing the language used by pundits when discussing Israel. “I don't think that we should have billionaires, because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality,” Mamdani responded. Get the news you want, delivered to your inbox every day. Mamdani's viewpoint is one shared by many on the left, including politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), who have proposed policies like a wealth tax in order to ensure that billionaires pay their fair share back into society. Polls have found that such proposals are extremely popular across the political spectrum. However, the right has been fear mongering about Mamdani's political stances, with figures like President Donald Trump painting him as a radical communist — clearly as an insult meant to invoke the Red Scare. “When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King, from decades ago, he said: Call it democracy, call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth for all God's children within this country,” he went on. Mamdani's platform is centered around affordability in New York, with proposals like universal child care, establishing city-run grocery stores, and building affordable housing. To pay for these plans, he has proposed raising the state corporate tax rate and placing a 2 percent tax on those making above $1 million annually in New York City. This potentially explains why numerous Democrats, including leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York), are holding back on backing Mamdani, despite his historic campaign.

The Cessna 441 with six people on board crashed near Youngstown-Warren regional airport on Sunday morning, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. There were no survivors, Anthony Trevena, the executive director of Western Reserve Port Authority, said at a news conference. The victims were taken to the Trumbull county coroner's office, Trevena said, but he did not release their names. It was difficult to get to the site of the crash, the Howland Township fire chief, Raymond Pace, said. This is a extremely tragic situation, but it could have been worse,” Pace said, noting that there were three houses near the spot where the plane crashed. Publicly available flight tracking data showed that the plane's destination was Bozeman, Montana, said Michael Hillman, president of the aviation company JETS FBO Network. I can't say enough about them,” Hillman said at the news conference. “I'd give anything to rewind the day and take them to breakfast instead.”</p>

Canada and the U.S. are set to restart trade talks after Canada removed a tax on digital services that had angered Mr. Trump.Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press Prime Minister Mark Carney “caved” to Donald Trump when he told the U.S. President during a Sunday phone call he would be scrapping Canada's digital services tax on foreign tech giants, the White House said Monday. Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump's chief spokeswoman, told a press briefing Monday that Mr. Carney telephoned Mr. Trump to inform him that Ottawa would be cancelling the tax, two days after Mr. Trump threatened to walk away from trade talks and impose retaliatory tariffs over the levy, and one day before the first payment of the tax was meant to be collected. Mr. Carney, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said that talks between Canada and the United States on ending a damaging four-month trade war resumed Monday morning. He did not respond to a question about the “caved” comments and declined to explain what Canada received in return for scrapping the digital sales tax that targeted foreign tech giants, chiefly U.S.-based companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Airbnb and Uber. “It was a mistake for Canada to vow to implement that tax, that would have hurt our tech companies here in the United States,” she said, adding that Ottawa's concession is “a big victory for our tech companies.” Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, confirmed to Fox News on Monday morning that Canada-U.S. trade talks will restart. “Oh, absolutely,” he said, when asked if the two sides would immediately resume negotiations. It was only late Sunday, hours before the first digital services tax payments were due, that Mr. Carney's government announced it was scrapping the levy. The President then threatened on Friday that, if the tax remained in place, he would break off trade talks and impose more tariffs on Canada in seven days. The tax, which would have imposed a three-per-cent levy on digital services by major tech companies, was passed by Canada last year with the first payments due to be collected June 30. Robyn Urback: The digital services tax was bad policy, but killing it now makes us look terribly weak Prof. Geist said the digital sales tax was a “real card with billions of dollars in tax revenue” and Canada should have kept it in reserve. He said Ottawa should have announced it was delaying implementation of the DST while it was conducting trade talks with the United States. By scrapping the DST now, Canada has “given up what was a non-trivial card and they basically used it to get back exactly where they were a week ago,” Prof. Geist said. Talks will continue on a global measure, he said. After that, there may be a further renegotiation of the USMCA.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the day of the June 21 bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities, U.S. President Donald Trump gave phone interviews to six reporters from multiple news outlets.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/The Associated Press For reporters, it's hardly unusual to call sources on the phone to learn details or get quotes that will enliven their stories. In an almost unfathomable level of access, reporters who call President Donald Trump on his personal cell phone often get an answer – and an interview – from the leader of the free world on the spot. Just this week, Trump's lawyers threatened to sue CNN and The New York Times over their reporting on an initial government assessment of damage caused by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities. On the day of the June 21 bombing, Trump gave phone interviews to Jonathan Karl of ABC News, Kristen Welker at NBC News, Reuters' Steve Holland, Axios' Barak Ravid and both Bret Baier and Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel, according to an independent database of the president's media appearances. “I find it utterly remarkable,” said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush. Opinion: Trump's attacks on the media are eroding independent journalism This spring, when he was denied an interview with Trump for an Atlantic magazine cover story, Michael Scherer dialed Trump's number on a Saturday morning. When the reporter identified himself, Trump berated him for past stories he'd written. Trump answered his questions, and was gracious about it, he said. He just has a totally different approach to the press than any president I've covered.” In a subsequent story, Scherer and colleague Ashley Parker explored how the telephone is like a lifeline to the president. But the interactions are generally much more formal and structured. “There have been multiple times that people who work for the president have made clear that they weren't happy he was talking to me,” Scherer said. “But they don't get to make the decisions. Asked about the calls, White House communications director Steven Cheung said Trump “is the most transparent president in history, and we celebrate his willingness to fight back against Fake News media outlets who have shown a disgusting proclivity to lie about him and his administration. The American people are better served because President Trump engages with the press on a daily basis, and we are all so thankful for his leadership, which makes our jobs much more rewarding and gratifying.” ABC's Karl spoke with Trump by phone at least three times in June, according to social media and ABC reports. But he wanted to say this: tremendous success tonight.” About the calls, Welker told NBC's Seth Meyers recently that “sometimes you just have to take a chance and it works out.” The calls tend to be brief, often worth little more than a quote or two, said Brian Stelter, author of CNN's “Reliable Sources” newsletter. They hark back to Trump's real estate or “Apprentice” days when he could be depended upon by reporters for a pithy quote, he said. “At the same time, if you can get the president by phone, by all means you should,” he said. Opinion: Why the returning president is likely to become one of history's most consequential figures NBC's Yamiche Alcindor spoke to Trump on June 23, reporting that Trump had said the bombing represented “a great day for America. It's a great day for the Middle East and I'm very happy to have been able to get the job done.” That Trump even took Alcindor's call is noteworthy in one respect: The two clashed repeatedly at public news conferences during his first term, when she worked for PBS “NewsHour,” with the president once accusing her of asking a racist question. NBC wouldn't make Alcindor available for an interview. His administration is seeking to shut down government-run news outlets like Voice of America, and strip NPR and PBS of federal subsidies, both because he thinks their news products are biased against conservatives. He's involved in settlement talks after suing CBS' “60 Minutes” and settled a lawsuit against ABC News last winter. “Part of Trump's success is his raw authenticity,” he said. He's not a typical politician, and it shows every day. So [the phone interviews] fits with who he is. There are transcripts or video, sometimes both, available for 89 per cent of the interviews that Trump gave during his first term. That drop is entirely due to the increase in phone interviews, Frischling said. So while Trump has been talking on the phone to more reporters, it also means fewer public records available to check what he said. He can see a scenario where the number becomes so widely known that Trump will have to change it. Authors and topics you follow will be added to your personal news feed in Following.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Zohran Mamdani is promising servant socialism – making taxpayers pick up the tab for struggling professionals' class envy Some factors in this election are unique to New York's ethnic mix. Mamdani won the Hispanic vote, perhaps thanks to a backlash against Donald Trump's deportation policies, and as the first potential South Asian mayor of New York City (born in Uganda, he is of Indian descent) he did well among Asian New Yorkers, particularly Muslims. Mamdani's base is what has jokingly been called “the Commie Corridor” in Brooklyn and part of Queens, where young white progressives have created a bohemian culture similar to that of college towns. Mamdani also did well among affluent New Yorkers in the tier below the very rich, as Michael Lange has pointed out in The New York Times: “In tony, liberal neighbourhoods like Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, known for their tree-lines streets and multimillion-dollar brownstones, Mr Mamdani trounced Mr Cuomo by more than 35 points.” The claim that Mamdani won by campaigning on the issue of “affordability” is hard to reconcile with the fact that he did better among upper-middle-class white voters than among working-class and middle-class black voters. Metropolitan professionals are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the super-rich, whether as employees of major business, finance, law, and media firms, as nonprofit staffers or professors whose institutions depend on the charitable giving of the wealthy, or as civil servants in cities that depend on taxing a small number of wealthy individuals and enterprises. Nevertheless, as I can attest, having lived in Manhattan for half a decade in the 1990s, many professionals seethe with envy of the rich. No wonder New York is losing residents to Texas. The division between the metropolitan rich and metropolitan professionals plays out on multiple fronts: housing, transit, and domestic help. In cities like New York, even professionals making a few hundred thousand dollars a year cannot afford to buy one of the townhouses or luxury condos they covet in nice neighbourhoods. Instead, they are forced to pay crazy rents in order not to suffer the indignity of living far from Manhattan and commuting for an hour or more each day like lowly proles. The rich can Uber or Lyft their way everywhere, but that is costly for merely affluent professionals who may be forced to endure the forecast of hell that is the New York City subway system. In contrast, the typical professional-class household in cities like New York consists of two college-educated professionals, both of whom must work so that their joint income allows them to eke out a barely-comfortable existence in one of the priciest places on earth. The truly rich can afford to pay Mary Poppins along with Jeeves quite well. But metropolitan professional households with children and two full-time working parents with professional careers cannot afford to spend much on nannies and maids. They may be progressive in their attitudes toward trans rights and DEI, but professional couples in big cities rely on a pool of low-wage, mostly foreign-born domestic workers who can be paid low wages in cash, with no payroll taxes, no benefits and no retirement security. This explains the panic among metropolitan professionals caused by Trump's deportations. But without cheap illegal immigrant labour, the precarious finances of many two-earner professional couples would collapse. One way to keep the wages of menial servants low enough for professional households to afford them is to let taxpayers pick up the tab for many of their expenditures. Better yet, if the maid can drop her children off at a publicly-funded daycare centre on the way to clean the professional couple's apartment, the taxpayer's assumption of her childcare costs makes it easier for her to survive on her paltry wages. But everyone knows that is not going to happen, making it safe for progressive New Yorkers to pay lip service to high wages and unions while paying their menial servants in cash off the books in the black market for labour. A century ago in the US, the non-Marxist crusade in favour of municipal ownership of water and electric utilities was called “sewer socialism”. The 21st century Left has come up with something new: “servant socialism”.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Russia is seeking to halt Western military training programs for Ukrainian troops; mass protests in Serbia turn violent; and the trade war between the US and China cools down. These stories topped Monday's newspaper headlines across Russia. One of Russia's non-negotiables for a peace deal on Ukraine is that Western countries stop training Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel, Ambassador-at-Large of the Russian Foreign Ministry Rodion Miroshnik told Izvestia. Large-scale training programs for Ukrainian soldiers were launched by London and Brussels in 2022, and nearly 130,000 individuals have undergone instruction over the past three years. Although experts believe the suspension of these training initiatives is unlikely in the near term, Russia will continue to pursue their termination. All of this constitutes direct participation in the conflict. A genuine demonstration of intent to resolve the situation would be the cessation of these programs," Miroshnik told Izvestia. The United States is also participating by training Ukrainian troops at its bases in Germany, where they undergo accelerated instruction based on NATO standards to prepare for combat operations against Russia. "Any support provided to Ukraine that enables it to continue hostilities or plan terrorist operations does not contribute to conflict resolution and constitutes a hostile act against Russia," Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev told Izvestia. The actions of NATO and the UK show they are not interested in pursuing compromise or advancing negotiations on matters such as prisoner exchanges and the repatriation of bodies - processes that are already underway. Efforts to shift the situation are being met with hostility and new provocations, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs Grigory Karasin told Izvestia. On June 29, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic delivered a televised address to the nation following a large protest that took place the previous evening in the capital, which featured a number of violent incidents. According to official data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the protest drew 36,000 participants (independent observers estimated this figure at up to 140,000), roughly three times fewer than the largest protest in March. However, this time, clashes broke out between demonstrators and law enforcement officers. Analysts interviewed by Vedomosti warn that the protests in Serbia are becoming increasingly radicalized, raising concerns of a potential color revolution scenario fueled by internal frustrations and geopolitical narratives, even though the current movement may lack a unified direction. In response, police used force and other crowd control measures, which the opposition used as evidence that the protest had taken a radical turn. The latest protests were notably more aggressive with signs of increased pressure from demonstrators, deliberate provocations, and confrontations with security forces being clearly evident, and ultimately materializing, Program Manager at the Russian International Affairs Council Milan Lazovic told the newspaper. If future demonstrations follow a similar violent trajectory, it could be a sign of an impending "color revolution" in Serbia. This process is fluid, with tactics being adapted to the evolving domestic political situation. For instance, under the pretext of fighting corruption, young people are being actively mobilized, while a "Russian card" is provocatively played, with some suggesting Vucic is betraying Russia. There is also intense speculation surrounding Kosovo, with claims that Vucic is ceding ground there as well and may soon formally recognize the region's independence. Recently, protesters have appeared somewhat unorganized, lacking any clear objective, meaning there is currently no immediate threat to the government, Research Fellow at the Institute of International Studies at MGIMO University Anastasia Maleshevich said. According to official statements, the agreement enshrines a new baseline for tariff levels and likely entails the lifting of export restrictions on rare earth metals to the US and on ethane exports to China. The agreement itself will not be made public, and analysts remain cautious in assessing its specifics or the scale of mutual concessions. Despite a flurry of negotiations with numerous trade partners, Washington has not yet finalized deals with most of them. According to Trump's statements, Washington's tariffs on Chinese goods will now be set at 55%, while Beijing's duties on American imports will stand at 10%. "The announced 55% US rate still requires clarification, analysts believe Trump may have factored in existing tariffs dating back to his first term into this new figure," the newspaper writes. Judging by select official comments, the agreement appears to be a temporary measure designed to facilitate the continuation of negotiations wihout exposing either side to immediate risks from a further decline in trade volume. President Trump has also indicated that Washington is working on several other trade agreements, including an imminent deal with New Delhi. Hungary has successfully secured a relaxation of US sanctions that had hindered the expansion of its Paks Nuclear Power Plant. Experts interviewed by Kommersant believe that the project's implementation will boost Rosatom's reputation as a reliable international partner. Russia and Hungary signed agreements in late 2014 for the construction of two new units based on VVER-1200 nuclear reactors at the existing Paks Nuclear Power Plant. Rosatom confirmed that the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has decided to exclude certain activities of Russian banks and insurance companies from financial sanctions, specifically for projects related to nuclear energy, including Paks II. Sergey Rozhenko, Head of Energy Analytics at Kept, emphasized that the Paks II project is vital for Hungary's energy sector, as it will enable the country to produce up to 50% of its electricity independently of external suppliers. It is also significant for affirming Rosatom's standing as a dependable partner, and for demonstrating that Russia consistently fulfills its obligations, which is a particularly important quality in the nuclear industry. However, most sanctions remain in place, along with the informal self-censorship practiced by many companies. This has already spurred the development of alternative supply and financial chains, a process that now appears likely to be brought to completion," the expert noted. This trend has had a positive effect on inflation but a less favorable impact on the competitiveness of Russian exporters and the federal budget, Izvestia writes. The ruble's strengthening in Q2 2025 occurred independently of external factors or macroeconomic performance. Despite the suspension of ceasefire discussions on Ukraine, oil prices remaining below last year's levels, and clear signs of an economic slowdown, the ruble maintained its upward trajectory. Chief Economist at Gazprombank Pavel Biryukov told Izvestia, "In our view, the current supportive factors, tight monetary policy and subdued demand for foreign currency, may begin to weaken in the second half of the year. This could lead the ruble to revert toward more sustainable levels. Dmitry Vishnevsky, analyst at Tsifra Broker, also believes that the ruble is headed for depreciation in his take to the newspaper. However, by year-end, the ruble may weaken to 100-105 per dollar, driven by declining oil prices, rising imports, and potential monetary policy easing. We also foresee ruble depreciation against the yuan, with a forecast of 13-13.5 by year-end." TASS is not responsible for the material quoted in these press reviews</p>

CHOLPON-ATA /Kyrgyzstan/, June 30. /TASS/. NATO's defense spending spree will only hurt the alliance, leading to its ultimate collapse, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters after the Collective Security Treaty Organization's Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, as he called for more pragmatism in its approach.

"He can probably see – since he is such a wise sage – that the disastrous increase in spending of NATO countries will also lead to the collapse of this organization," Lavrov said, commenting on Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski's statement that Russia's military buildup would cause its downfall.

"Meanwhile, Russia – as President [Vladimir Putin] said the other day in Minsk after the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting – plans to reduce its military spending and be guided by common sense, rather than imaginary threats, as NATO member states do, including Sikorski," he pointed out.

NATO countries have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, according to the communique adopted following the NATO Summit held in The Hague on June 24-25. The alliance member states will allocate at least 3.5% of GDP by 2035, based on NATO's agreed definition of military spending, with 1.5% of GDP to be earmarked for protecting critical infrastructure and networks, ensuring civil preparedness and resilience, stimulating innovation, and strengthening the defense industry.

US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on June 20, said that the United States should not be subject to his demand for NATO member countries to raise military spending to 5% of GDP.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rock star refusing to sell mansion to anonymous property mogul who has already paid nearly $250m for four other Florida homes Jon Bon Jovi is standing in the way of a mystery buyer and one of the biggest real estate deals in US history. So far, the unnamed buyer, whose identity is a closely guarded secret, has paid roughly $250 million (£182 million) for four separate homes in Florida's Palm Beach – and is pushing for more. Palm Beach is a sought-after address for the US and international elite. “The buyer is looking for privacy and safety, and they want to be comfortable within their four walls. And as a result of that they buy their neighbours,” Dana Koch, a local agent of the Corcoran Group, told The Telegraph. Bon Jovi's home would be the fifth separate property to be added to a growing assemblage on the exclusive North Ocean Boulevard. The properties, which are five miles from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, so far include two ocean-front lots previously owned by William Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir. Mr Lauder is said to have listed them for a combined $200 million (£146 million) in 2023 before they were sold for an undisclosed figure earlier this year. The sellers, retired attorney Thomas Harvey and media executive Cathleen Black, had purchased it for $4.25 million (£3.1 million) in 2018, according to the Wall Street Journal. “They are what we call ‘make-me-move prices',” Mr Koch added. The property market in Palm Beach has been on an unprecedented upswing since 2020, with record deal after record deal. The area's luxury lifestyle, pristine beaches and exclusivity have attracted wealthy buyers at home and abroad, especially those relocating from high-tax states like New York. Ken Griffin, the enigmatic financier, turned heads with his plans to build the most expensive home on earth, a $1 billion (£730 million) mega-estate. He has spent more than $400 million (£292 million) since 2012 to piece together an ocean front compound in Palm Beach.</p>
