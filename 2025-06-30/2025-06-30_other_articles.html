                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>NEW HAMPSHIRE — Whether you're a believer or skeptic, World UFO Day on July 2 is an occasion to ponder unexplained phenomena seen over the skies of the Granite State over several decades. Together, those incidents more or less made it safe for Americans to talk about strange occurrences in the sky. The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion. This year alone, 17 reports have been made about strange sightings in the skies over New Hampshire. Some examples include a dark, silver disc, rotating with red and white lights, in Campton earlier this month. In Alton in May, a person reported seeing a cone-shaped object with lights that were not flashing or moving. Then, it traveled along the road and disappeared. On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph. It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. He thought the object he found on his ranch was similar to what Arnold had seen, or to the objects described in stories about flying saucers and discs, so he gathered some of the material from the wreckage, including rubber strips, tinfoil and thick paper, and deposited them with Sheriff George Wilcox, who in turn turned it over to the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Air Field. The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time. Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies. One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the military had seized the wreckage to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. 2025 brings an interesting new twist to the story.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ROYAL fans have spotted a bizarre detail in Meghan Markle's latest Instagram post where she is "picking" fresh fruit from her garden. The seemingly candid image of the Duchess of Sussex, 43, is captioned "Weekend plans: pick, snack, repeat", along with a peach emoji. However, wild conspiracy theories have emerged from users on social media questioning what has actually been captured in the photo posted to Meghan's lifestyle brand As Ever Instagram account. The mother-of-two can be seen reaching up to a tree full of fruits, but the apricot she has between her fingers is the only one that looks ripe. One Reddit user asked: "I'd like to know, in what parallel universe does a single apricot ripen on a tree when the rest are still green?" Another responded sarcastically: "Yes, amazing isn't it, despite all the other fruit being green, plus she's 'picking' from inside the tree, where the fruit often take slightly longer to ripen, she's found a perfect, glowing, ripe apricot." "Is it just me or is that fruit not even attached to the tree and she's just holding it in place to make it like she's picking it fresh off the tree?" Another stated: "She can't even fake plucking fruit from a tree properly. In defence, one person wrote: "She never explicitly said that she picked that one! This is not the first time perfectly captured shots posted by The Duchess of Sussex have been questioned by royal fans. Last month, she posted a image of their family beagle, Mia, sniffing a basket of fresh vegetables that were supposedly homegrown. People were suspicious, however, as they had no mud on them which is characteristic of produce grown at that time of the year after just being picked. At the beginning of the year, Meghan teased a new project by writing a near-perfect cursive digits of 2025, which also consisted of a blunder. But eagle-eyed fans also here noticed a clue that revealed it was not the first time The Duchess had attempted to write the numbers, as she walked past another 2025 written in the sand. A mistake in another of Meghan's As Ever posts, where a small black mouse cursor could be seen on the left edge of the image. ©News Group Newspapers Limited in England No. This service is provided on News Group Newspapers' Limited's Standard Terms and Conditions in accordance with our Privacy & Cookie Policy.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When two ultra-prolific solo projects join forces and collaborate, what do you call that? Or maybe they're just two lonely travelers whose paths happened to intersect for a brief moment. Superdestroyer is an anonymous bedroom punk situation from Columbus; his most recent LP, Hell is real and all your friends are here., dropped last month. PhonesWithChords, meanwhile, is the alter-ego of Tennessee resident Nick Webber, and he's released two albums, Let's Fall In! Now, Superdestroyer and PhonesWithChords have gotten together to make a collaborative EP called Surrealist Love Songs. Surrealist Love Songs drops next month, and its Bandcamp genre tags tell a story: “5th wave emo,” “bummer punk,” “downtempo.” The two artists have shared the new song “a psychic link in perpetuity.” It sounds like an old Saves The Day track that's being played on toy keyboards and recorded underwater. Below, you will find “a psychic link in perpetuity” and the Surrealist Love Songs tracklist. 01 “Together we form a circuit” 02 “emanating a resonant glow.” 03 “Once formed, it might be love” 04 “a psychic link in perpetuity” 05 “like loops stacked upon each other, with one another, forever” The Surrealist Love Songs EP is out 7/11 on Lonely Ghost Records.

It's years on from his dad's disappearance and, although his family are still grieving, they're starting to move on with their lives… but Dallas believes there's much more to what happened than meets the eye. Spending his time in haunted houses, paranormal hunting and getting stoned with his best friends, he's convinced that other life forms live among us, but when they uncover government secrets that his fighter pilot father left behind, they set off on a mission to find out the truth. “It's a throwback to Steven Spielberg movies and Stranger Things,” Casper Van Dien explains of the movie when we spoke to him last week about the movie. “The Six Million Man, Star Trek, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind… all these different things have meant so much to me and the last scene in Monsters of California feels like that for me,” he continues. “I just hope the movie makes people excited and inspires them. Monsters of California will be released on UK digital platforms 7 July 2025 Watch more horror trailers, exclusive video clips and interviews at the SciFiNow YouTube Channel.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Many West Virginia fans did not handle the news of Darian DeVries' sudden departure well. Two gut punches in just a few days. Tucker DeVries, who was already a likely NBA Draft choice ahead of the 2024-25 season, and who, off to a great start, had done nothing but enhance that draft stock, chose to postpone his multi-million dollar NBA career for a year by faking an injury, while also sabotaging his father's first season (also off to a great start) as a high major college basketball coach. And likewise, Darian was on board with stalling his son's professional career for an NIL deal worth far less than an NBA contract, while also risking a blemish on his coaching resume. Okay, that's not what they think at all, but it is effectively what one is saying in order to believe the nonsense that's out there. For his part, West Virginia AD Wren Baker seems to understand that lunatic fans are a net negative to his school, so he's having no part of their conspiracies. Baker says what really happened is what DeVries said happened — Indiana came calling after they announced Mike Woodson's retirement, and it was one of those rare opportunities he couldn't pass up. The only one that I'm aware of that he entertained at all was Indiana,” Baker said on Big 12 Today. Impartial national observers all agreed Indiana was the best available position. The facts conspiratorial West Virginia fans want to ignore are staring them right in the face:  Indiana is a more prestigious program, has better resources, is in a better conference, is closer to DeVries' Midwest roots, and it pays better. And Baker acknowledges it while squashing the sour grapes. I believe that for whatever reason, he felt like Indiana was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it was one of the few he would probably leave for, and it just happened to open at the wrong time.” No doubt frustrated by having to replace DeVries after just one season in Morgantown, Baker is taking the high road, and setting a good example for WVU fans to follow. “Coach DeVries did a really good job coaching the basketball team this year. “We should have been in the NCAA Tournament. I'm not somebody who cries and moans in public a lot, but that was an absolute travesty that team didn't get in. The Daily Hoosier –“Where Indiana fans assemble when they're not at Assembly”</p>
