                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An international research team, including scientists from the Institut de Neurociències at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), has developed a new solution to reduce the immune response triggered by neural prosthetics used after limb amputations or severe nerve injuries. Neural electrode implants are commonly used in prosthetics to restore communication between the device and the nervous system. However, their long-term effectiveness can be compromised by the body's natural immune reaction to foreign objects, which leads to the formation of scar tissue around the implant and can impair its function. Now, a recent study published in Advanced Healthcare Materials by researchers from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, the Università di Ferrara, the University of Freiburg, and Chalmers University of Technology, conducted as part of the European collaborative project BioFINE, reports a novel method to improve the biocompatibility and chronic stability of these electrodes. This innovation allows the drug to be released at the implant site slowly over at least two months, a critical period when the immune system typically mounts its strongest response. Biological tests showed that this approach reduces inflammation-related signals in immune cells, while maintaining the material's biocompatibility and mechanical integrity. Animal testing further confirmed that the dexamethasone-releasing implants significantly reduce immune reactions and scar tissue formation around the device. These findings suggest that the slow and localized release of dexamethasone from the implant surface could extend the functional lifespan of neural prostheses, offering a promising step forward in addressing the long-term challenges of implantable neurotechnology. This is a main step that has to be complemented by the demonstration in vivo that this coating improves the functional performance of chronically implanted electrodes in the peripheral nerves, for stimulating and recording nerve signals."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>New research from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and La Jolla Institute for Immunology, published today in Nature Microbiology, reveals an opportunity for developing a therapy against cytomegalovirus (CMV), the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the United States. Researchers discovered a previously unappreciated mechanism by which CMV, a herpes virus that infects the majority of the world's adult population, enters cells that line the blood vessels and contributes to vascular disease. In addition to using molecular machinery that is shared by all herpes viruses, CMV employs another molecular "key" that allows the virus to sneak through a side door and evade the body's natural immune defenses. The finding might explain why efforts to develop prophylactic treatments against CMV have, so far, been unsuccessful. This research also highlights a new potential avenue for the development of future antiviral drugs and suggests that other viruses of the herpes family, such as Epstein-Barr and chickenpox, could use similar molecular structures to spread from one infected cell to the next while avoiding immune detection. We found a missing puzzle piece that represents one possible reason why immunization efforts against CMV have been unsuccessful." Jeremy Kamil, Ph.D., senior author, associate professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Pitt Of the babies infected, one in five will have birth defects, such as hearing loss, or go on to have long-term health challenges. But a CMV infection during pregnancy presents significant health risks to the unborn child and could be deadly for people who are immunosuppressed, including organ transplant recipients. Because of the large size of its genome and its complicated molecular machinery, CMV long evaded attempts to develop prophylactic treatments. Similar to other herpes viruses, CMV relies on a protein called gH to enter cells of the vessel lining. But unlike other herpes viruses, which use a protein partner called gL to facilitate infection, the new study found that CMV replaces gL with another partner called UL116 and recruits a protein called UL141. The newly discovered GATE could become a potential vaccine target for CMV and other herpes viruses. "Previous attempts to generate a CMV vaccine have failed, but that was before we identified the GATE complex. We hope that new strategies targeting GATE will improve our chances to combat CMV infection, and also perhaps cleanse our bodies of this lifelong infection," said Chris Benedict, Ph.D., associate professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and co-senior author of the study with Kamil and LJI professor, president & CEO Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., MBA. "If we can develop antiviral drugs or vaccines that inhibit CMV entry, this will allow us to combat the many diseases this virus causes in developing babies and immune-compromised people."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A pioneering study has provided unprecedented insights into the immune response following pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation. Using cutting-edge spatial molecular imaging, researchers mapped how human immune cells interact with pig kidney tissue in transplanted organs, revealing critical early markers of rejection and potential intervention strategies. The study, led by Dr. Valentin Goutaudier and a collaborative international research team (Paris Institute for Transplantation and Organ Regeneration & NYU Langone Transplant Institute), highlights key molecular mechanisms that could shape the future of xenotransplantation. Researchers observed early molecular signs of antibody-mediated rejection as soon as Day 10 and peaking at Day 33, reinforcing previous findings that rejection begins rapidly but progresses over time. The study's innovative approach used a bioinformatic pipeline to distinguish human immune cells from pig structural cells, allowing for precise mapping of immune infiltration patterns. Notably, macrophages and myeloid cells were the most prevalent immune cell types across all time points, further confirming their role as key mediators in xenograft rejection. Combined with novel spatial insights into how immune cells interact with pig kidney tissue, this marks a major breakthrough - paving the way for more refined anti-rejection strategies. These advances come at a pivotal time as the first US-based clinical trials of pig kidney transplantation into living human recipients begin in 2025. With xenotransplantation poised to address the global organ shortage crisis, these findings bring researchers one step closer to making genetically modified pig kidneys a viable long-term solution. The next phase will focus on optimising anti-rejection treatments, refining genetic modifications in donor pigs, and developing early detection protocols to monitor and manage rejection responses. "Understanding the specific immune interactions at a molecular level allows us to develop targeted interventions that can prevent rejection before it escalates," explained Dr. Goutaudier. As scientific progress accelerates, researchers remain cautiously optimistic that genetically modified pig kidneys could become a routine transplant option within the next decade. However, regulatory approvals will require consistent demonstration of safety and efficacy in diverse patient populations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study by the Center for Redox Processes in Biomedicine (Redoxoma) led by Marilene Demasi from the Butantan Institute (São Paulo, Brazil) presents a valuable new experimental model for investigating the interaction between the proteasome and mitochondrial function. In eukaryotic cells, the proteasome is a protein complex responsible for eliminating damaged and nonfunctional proteins, thereby helping to maintain cellular balance and proper functioning. In recent years, studies have revealed that the proteasome and mitochondria are more closely connected than previously thought. The study revealed that deficiency in this system leads to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. This was evidenced by increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release and a lower peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) concentration. Prx1 is a crucial enzyme in the removal of peroxides. The most important thing about this work is that we've a yeast strain that can serve as a model for investigating proteasome deficiency in relation to mitochondrial metabolism, a model that didn't yet exist in the literature." The researchers are now working to understand why Prx1 levels decrease in cells with compromised proteasomes. "We don't yet know if there was a decrease in Prx1 gene expression, which is possible, since the proteasome also plays a role in gene transcription regulation, or if the protein oxidizes more. It may hyperoxidize and, as a result, be degraded more. To answer these questions, the group plans to conduct comparative transcriptome and proteomic analyses of the wild and mutant strains cultivated under respiratory conditions. Decreased levels of Prx1 are associated with proteasome impairment and mitochondrial dysfunction in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Last September, Alton Fry went to the doctor concerned he had high blood pressure. The trip would result in a prostate cancer diagnosis. "I've never been sick in my life, so I've never needed insurance before," said Fry, a 54-year-old self-employed masonry contractor who restores old buildings in the rural Appalachian community he's called home nearly all his life. Making sure he had insurance was the last thing on his mind, until recently, Fry said. Now, with a household income of about $48,000, Fry and his wife earn too much to qualify for Georgia's limited Medicaid expansion. To save money, Fry said, he's taking a less aggressive treatment route than his doctor recommended. "There is no help for middle-class America," he said. More than 26 million Americans lacked health insurance in the first six months of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The uninsured rate in the 10 states that, like Georgia, have not expanded Medicaid to nearly all low-income adults was 14.1% in 2023, compared with 7.6% in expansion states, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Under the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" — budget legislation that would achieve some of President Donald Trump's priorities, like extending tax cuts mainly benefiting the wealthy — some 10.9 million Americans would lose health insurance by 2034, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office based on a House version of the budget bill. A Senate version of the bill could result in more people losing Medicaid coverage, with reductions in federal spending and rules that would make it harder for people to qualify. But that bill suffered a major blow June 26 when the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan official who enforces the chamber's rules, rejected several health provisions — including the proposal to gradually reduce provider taxes, a mechanism that nearly every state uses to increase its federal Medicaid funding. In KFF poll results released in June, nearly two-thirds of people surveyed viewed the bill unfavorably and more than half said they were worried federal funding cuts would hurt their family's ability to obtain and afford health care. The House-passed bill would represent the largest reduction in federal support for Medicaid and health coverage in history, she said. The United States is the only wealthy country where a substantial number of citizens lack health insurance, due to nearly a century of pushback against universal coverage from doctors, insurance companies, and elected officials. This year, KFF Health News is speaking to Americans about the challenges they face in finding health insurance and the effects on their ability to get care; to providers who serve the uninsured; and to policy experts about why, even when the nation hit its lowest recorded uninsured rate in 2023, nearly a tenth of the U.S. population still lacked health coverage. After lobbying from physician groups, President Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned plans to include universal health coverage in the Social Security Act of 1935. Then, because of a wage and salary cap used to control inflation during World War II, more employers offered health insurance to lure workers. In 1954, health coverage was formally exempted from income tax requirements, which led more employers to offer the benefit as part of compensation packages. But eventually, problems with linking health insurance to employment emerged. "We realized, well, wait, not everybody is working," said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at the Columbia School of Social Work who studies the impact of social policies on access to care. Yet subsequent efforts to expand coverage to all Americans were met with backlash from unions who wanted health insurance as a bargaining chip, providers who didn't want government oversight, and those who had coverage through their employers. There's Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for people with low incomes and disabilities, both created in 1965; the Children's Health Insurance Program, created in 1997; the ACA's exchange plans and Medicaid expansion for people who can't access job-based coverage, created in 2010. The lack of a cohesive system means that, even though Americans are eligible for health insurance, they struggle to access it, said Mark Shepard, an associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. No central entity exists in the U.S. to ensure that all people have a plan, he said. Over half of the uninsured might qualify for Medicaid or subsidies that can help cover the costs of an ACA plan, according to KFF. But many people aren't aware of their options or can't navigate overlapping programs — and even subsidized coverage can be unaffordable. When she started her job in December 2023, she didn't want to spend nearly 10% of her income on health insurance. So Almonte, 23, who also needed to see a doctor, investigated her employer's health offerings. By then she had missed the deadline to sign up. "Now I have to wait another year," she said. In January, Camden, Alabama, resident Kiana George, who's uninsured, landed in an intensive care unit months after she stopped seeing a nurse practitioner and taking blood pressure medications — an ordeal that saddled her with nearly $7,000 in medical bills. George, 30, was kicked off Medicaid in 2023 after she got hired by an after-school program. It pays $800 a month, an income too high to qualify her for Medicaid in Alabama, which hasn't expanded to cover most low-income adults. She also doesn't make enough for a free or reduced-cost ACA plan. George, who has a 9-year-old daughter, said she "has no idea" how she can repay the debt from the emergency room visit. "It hurts, but I'm just gonna take my chances," she said. Health insurance is fundamentally a financial product, intended to protect the policyholder's pocketbook from accidents or illnesses. Researchers have known for decades that a lack of insurance coverage leads to poor access to health care, said Tom Buchmueller, a health economist at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. "It's only more recently we've had really good, strong evidence that shows that health insurance really does improve health outcomes," Buchmueller said. Research released this spring by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that expanding Medicaid reduced low-income adults' chances of dying by 2.5%. In 2019, a separate study published by that nonpartisan think tank provided experimental evidence that health insurance coverage reduced mortality among middle-aged adults. In late May, the House narrowly advanced the budget legislation that independent government analysts said would result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage and reduce federal spending on programs like Medicaid by billions of dollars. A key provision would require some Medicaid enrollees to work, volunteer, or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month, starting at the end of 2026. Most Medicaid enrollees already work or have some reason they can't, such as a disability, according to KFF. House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended the requirement as "moral." A Senate version of the bill also includes work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid recipients. Fiscal conservatives argue a solution is needed to curb health care's rising costs. The U.S. spends about twice as much per capita on health care as other wealthy nations, and that spending would grow under the GOP's budget bill, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a think tank that supports less government spending on health care. To do that would entail, for instance, doing away with the tax break for employer-sponsored care, which he said fuels excessive spending, raises prices, and ties health insurance to employment. He said the bill should cut federal funding for Medicaid, not just limit its growth. The bill would throw more people into a high-cost health care landscape with little protection, said Aaron Carroll, president and CEO of AcademyHealth, a nonpartisan health policy research nonprofit. "There's a ton of evidence that shows that if you make people pay more for health care, they get less health care," he said.

In February, McKenzie started seeing double, but canceled an appointment with an ophthalmologist because he couldn't come up with the $300 the doctor wanted in advance.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that helps clinicians identify brain activity patterns linked to nine types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, using a single, widely available scan - a transformative advance in early, accurate diagnosis. It also enabled clinicians to interpret brain scans nearly twice as fast and with up to three times greater accuracy than standard workflows. Researchers trained and tested the AI on more than 3,600 scans, including images from patients with dementia and people without cognitive impairment. This innovation addresses a core challenge in dementia care: identifying the disease early and precisely, even when multiple conditions are present. As new treatments emerge, timely diagnosis helps match patients with the most appropriate care when it can have the greatest impact. The tool could bring advanced diagnostic support to clinics that lack neurology expertise. Diagnosing dementia typically requires cognitive tests, blood draws, imaging, clinical interviews and specialist referrals. Even with extensive testing, distinguishing conditions such as Alzheimer's, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia remains challenging, including for highly experienced specialists. StateViewer was developed under the direction of David Jones, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist and director of the Mayo Clinic Neurology Artificial Intelligence Program. Every patient who walks into my clinic carries a unique story shaped by the brain's complexity. StateViewer reflects that commitment - a step toward earlier understanding, more precise treatment and, one day, changing the course of these diseases." To bring that vision to life, Dr. Jones worked alongside Leland Barnard, Ph.D., a data scientist who leads the AI engineering behind StateViewer. "As we were designing StateViewer, we never lost sight of the fact that behind every data point and brain scan was a person facing a difficult diagnosis and urgent questions," Dr. Barnard says. "Seeing how this tool could assist physicians with real-time, precise insights and guidance highlights the potential of machine learning for clinical medicine." It then compares the scan to a large database of scans from people with confirmed dementia diagnoses and identifies patterns that match specific types, or combinations, of dementia. StateViewer displays these patterns through color-coded brain maps that highlight key areas of brain activity, giving all clinicians, even those without neurology training, a visual explanation of what the AI sees and how it supports the diagnosis. Mayo Clinic researchers plan to expand the tool's use and will continue evaluating its performance in a variety of clinical settings.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a multi-institutional study published in Science Direct, researchers revealed that testing urine-based tumor DNA (utDNA) can help predict which bladder cancer patients are at higher risk for recurrence after treatment. This study analyzed utDNA from patients in the SWOG S1605 trial, who were treated with atezolizumab, an immunotherapy drug. Researchers used the UroAmp test to examine urine samples from 89 patients at the start of treatment and from 77 patients three months later. It means we may be able to tailor therapy sooner, reduce unnecessary delays and help patients avoid major surgery without compromising the quality of their care." Robert Svatek, MD, MSCI, professor and chair of urology at the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) A nationally recognized urologic oncologist with the Mays Cancer Center at UT Health San Antonio, Svatek is the leading expert in bladder cancer and a member of SWOG, also known as Southwest Oncology Group. The SWOG S1605 study was a phase 2 clinical trial testing atezolizumab in patients with high-risk bladder cancer that didn't respond to BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) treatment, the main immunotherapy to treat early-stage bladder cancer. Samples were collected from participants before treatment and again three months later. Researchers used the UroAmp assay, a non-invasive urine test that detects bladder cancer–related mutations, to analyze utDNA and generate a genomic profile for each patient. They found that utDNA levels were linked to how well patients responded after six months and how long they stayed cancer-free over 18 months. Patients who don't respond to immunotherapy may face the difficult decision of either continuing therapies that spare the bladder but carry high risks of recurrence or undergo major surgery that removes the bladder and profoundly impacts one's quality of life. This study offers new hope for patients with high-risk bladder cancer by showing that a urine-based DNA test can help predict who is more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. By identifying treatment response early, this approach could guide more personalized, bladder-preserving care and reduce the need for major surgery.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Citrate is essential for the metabolism and development of neurons. Building on data from the recently completed RESOLUTE and REsolution flagship projects, scientists at CeMM have comprehensively studied the function and structure of the membrane transporter SLC13A5, experimentally investigating 38 mutant variants. Their findings, published in Science Advances (DOI 10.1126/sciadv.adx3011) shed new light on the mechanisms of this disease and lay the foundation for further research into epilepsy and other disorders. In the citric acid cycle-often referred to as the "hub" of cellular metabolism-organic substances are broken down to generate chemical energy, while also producing various precursors for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and critical signaling molecules involved in inflammation and cell development. In neurons, citrate plays an especially important role. As a so-called "neuromodulator," it influences neuronal activity and is therefore present in relatively high concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid. Accordingly, neurons express high levels of the SLC13A5 transporter to facilitate citrate uptake. When this transporter is not fully functional, it can lead to SLC13A5 Citrate Transporter Disorder-a severe form of epilepsy associated with impaired brain development (scientifically referred to as developmental epileptic encephalopathy, DEE). This condition is caused by mutations in the SLC13A5 gene. However, until now, little was known about which mutations are involved, how they affect the molecular function of the transporter, and how they influence disease progression. To address this knowledge gap, scientists at CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences performed a technique called "deep mutational scanning" (DMS), analyzing the effect of nearly ten thousand different genetic mutations on the function of the SLC13A5 transport protein. The dataset was further enriched by computational analyses of protein stability, and 38 mutated SLC13A5 variants were selected for experimental investigation. "In addition, by computationally analyzing the mutant variants, we assessed protein stability across different conformations and established an evolutionary conservation score for all variants," adds co-first author Evandro Ferrada, now at the University of Valparaíso in Chile. Especially in rare diseases such as SLC13A5 citrate transporter deficiency, a specific form of epilepsy, this approach helps us uncover molecular disease mechanisms. At the same time, we gain valuable insights into the impact of variants that also occur in the general population – an important step toward a more comprehensive understanding of genetic diversity and its impact on human health."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ribosomes are tiny molecular machines inside all living cells that build proteins, and ribosome biogenesis is the complex, multi-step process by which they are made. During brain development, neural stem cell proliferation relies on active ribosome biogenesis to meet high protein demand. This process involves the concerted action of numerous ribosomal RNA processing factors and assembly proteins. Studies have shown that precise regulation of ribosome biogenesis is essential for normal brain development and tumor prevention. However, the mechanisms underlying cellular adaptation to m6A modification and their impact on protein synthesis machinery have not been well understood. In a study published in Science Advances, a collaborative team led by Prof. ZHOU Tao from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof. SHEN Bin from Nanjing Medical University has revealed that VIRMA, a protein highly expressed in the embryonic brain and various cancers, regulates brain development by modulating ribosome biogenesis. Using conditional knockout mice and neural stem cell models, the researchers explored the role of VIRMA in brain development through comprehensive biochemical analyses and multi-omics sequencing. Through RNA and m6A sequencing and proteomics analysis, the researchers revealed that VIRMA depletion led to a significant reduction in m6A levels on mRNA, directly impacting the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Specifically, VIRMA depletion prolonged the half-lives of mRNA involved in ribosome biogenesis, thereby impairing key steps in this process. These disruptions ultimately resulted in severe developmental defects. To evaluate the broader relevance of these findings, the researchers performed preliminary analyses using human breast cancer (MCF7) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cell models. They observed comparable defects in ribosome biogenesis in VIRMA-depleted cancer cells, suggesting a potential conservation of this regulatory mechanism across cell types. Wu, M., et al.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Gene therapy for sickle cell disease may help improve a major contributing factor to stroke risk in patients, reports a new study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Many people with sickle cell disease experience increased brain ischemia, where oxygen is not delivered properly to brain tissues, potentially leading to strokes. Findings from three patients in a gene therapy clinical trial showed that gene therapy treatment significantly improved blood flow in the brain. These results demonstrate that people with these risk factors may benefit from gene therapy and should be considered for future clinical trials of gene therapy. We saw that after gene therapy, elevated blood flow speed in the brain came down to normal levels. This is the closest physiological evidence we have that gene therapy could be effective for patients with neurovascular disease who are at risk of or have had a stroke." Akshay Sharma, MBBS, MSc, corresponding author, St. Jude Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy A small but significant percentage of patients with sickle cell disease are at an increased risk of stroke due to the condition's impact on blood flow in the brain. The crescent "sickle" shape of red blood cells characteristic of sickle cell disease cannot move through small blood vessels, including those in the brain. When those vessels become clogged, that region in the brain does not receive enough oxygen. Brain ischemia is when a region of the brain is greatly deprived of oxygen, creating a significant risk factor for stroke, which can result in long-term damage. "If the bus is going too fast, passengers can't get off the bus, and oxygen is not delivered. However, if the bus slows down so passengers can safely hop off, as happens when hemoglobin levels rise, then oxygen gets properly delivered to the brain tissues." Each patient's brain blood flow improved significantly, decreasing anywhere from 22% to 43%, reaching mostly normal levels, which appeared stable over time. Hydroxyurea, the most common treatment for sickle cell disease, has only a small effect on brain blood flow, and while blood transfusions have a stronger positive impact on brain blood flow, the effect is transient because the patient must continually receive new transfusions for it to last. The researchers found gene therapy has a more substantial and long-lasting protective effect on the brain than either of these treatments. Bone marrow transplants also normalize brain blood flow over the long term. While gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation were not compared directly in the study, the results suggest both treatments produce a similar return to normal blood flow in the brain that is durable over time. This study of three patients provides preliminary evidence for gene therapy's effect on stroke risk and requires follow-up studies to confirm the result. However, it adds to a growing body of evidence that gene therapy should be considered as a treatment option to protect brain health in patients with sickle cell disease. Historically, given the high-risk nature of their disease, these individuals have been excluded from gene therapy trials. "Until now, we only had one option that had a long-term impact on blood flow in the brain: bone marrow transplantation. But now we may also have gene therapy as another viable method to protect against neurovascular disease in people with sickle cell disease."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A global analysis reveals that bacteria in food animals and humans are sharing resistance genes through the use of agricultural antibiotics, highlighting an urgent need to rethink farm drug regulations. Study: The ionophore resistance genes narA and narB are geographically widespread and linked to resistance to medically important antibiotics. In a recent article published in mSphere, researchers examined the global distribution of ionophore resistance conferred by two genes, narA and narB, and their genetic linkages to genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). They found that 2,442 bacterial isolates from 51 countries contained narAB, often in conjunction with genes that confer resistance to critical human antibiotics. These results highlight the significant risks of co-selection for human-relevant AMR through the use of ionophores in agriculture. The study identified narAB in human-derived isolates across multiple continents, directly challenging regulatory assumptions that these genes stay confined to farm environments. However, recent studies have raised concerns that ionophores could indirectly promote AMR through co-selection. This can occur in two ways: through physical linkage, where the genes are located near each other on the same piece of DNA (like a plasmid), or when they are present in the same genome of a largely clonal bacterial species. One focus has been on the narAB operon in Enterococcus faecium, which provides resistance to several ionophores and has been found on plasmids carrying vancomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistance genes. Co-selection could occur if such genes are transferred together, even in the absence of direct antibiotic pressure from MIAs. Despite these signals, the full geographic spread and the consistency of AMR associations of narAB have remained largely unquantified. Resistance beyond expectations, narAB-positive isolates carried resistance to last-resort drugs like daptomycin through mutations (liaR E75K), not just common antibiotics. The search focused on annotated bacterial genomes containing narA, and only isolates also containing narB were retained, resulting in 2,442 qualifying genomes. These were analyzed for host organism (such as human, poultry, or cattle), bacterial species, associated AMR genes, and country of origin. They calculated the average number of resistance genes and mutations per genome. They used statistical association tests to determine if particular AMR determinants were more likely to occur in narAB-positive isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Genes and point mutations with strong associations were flagged as potential evidence of co-selection. The researchers also visualized the geographic spread and host species using maps and bubble plots, summarizing the prevalence of narAB in different bacterial species and host organisms, including humans. Their analysis focused on presence/absence trends, given uneven global sampling, and did not attempt to compare prevalence across countries. (A) World map showing the geographic distribution of narAB. (B) Distribution of narAB amongst bacterial and host species. Bubble size is proportional to the number of detected isolates. Four bacterial species are excluded due to total sample sizes of less than 5 (Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria innocua, and Streptococcus agalactiae). showed narAB signals but were excluded from analysis due to small sample sizes, suggesting broader potential spread. The study found narAB genes in 2,442 bacterial isolates from 51 countries, demonstrating global presence across all continents except Antarctica. The genes were identified in 10 bacterial species, predominantly Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Genomic analysis revealed that narAB-positive isolates contained an average of 8.26 additional AMR genes and 2.13 point mutations conferring resistance. Mutations associated with resistance to drugs like daptomycin and ampicillin were also detected. In E. faecalis, 13 AMR genes, including all vanA cluster genes (linked to vancomycin resistance), showed strong positive associations with narAB. In E. faecium, narAB was associated with 11 AMR genes and 4 resistance-linked mutations. These findings reveal a strong statistical pattern suggestive of co-selection, where ionophore resistance genes are genetically linked to AMR genes relevant to human health. The evidence supports the idea that ionophore use in agriculture may unintentionally select for broader AMR, including resistance to critically important antibiotics. This research received support from both Perdue Farms and a Canadian government grant, a reminder that industry collaboration can drive critical AMR surveillance. This study challenges the long-standing assumption that the use of ionophores in livestock is unrelated to human antimicrobial resistance risks. The widespread detection of narAB in multiple countries, bacterial species, and even human-derived isolates suggests that ionophore resistance is not confined to animal agriculture. The consistent genetic associations between narAB and resistance to medically important antibiotics, especially in Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, highlight how genetic linkage provides a clear pathway for co-selection, where ionophore use may indirectly promote clinically relevant AMR. A key strength of the study is its global scope, using a large publicly available dataset to provide comprehensive genomic and geographic insights. However, uneven sampling limits the comparative assessment of prevalence across countries. Additionally, although the study reveals associations between narAB and AMR genes, it cannot definitively establish causality or the primary directionality of gene transfer; however, transfer from farm animals to humans appears most likely. Overall, the findings suggest ionophore use may pose an underrecognized AMR risk, emphasizing the need to reconsider how such antibiotics are regulated and highlighting that even drugs not used in human medicine can contribute to the broader AMR crisis.
