(AP) — President Donald Trump will visit a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades on Tuesday for what's expected to be the site's official opening, showcasing what critics are condemning as an inhumane makeshift prison camp and what supporters are embracing as a national model for aggressively ramping up detention and deportation efforts. Florida officials have raced to erect the compound of heavy-duty tents, trailers and temporary buildings in a matter of days, as part of the state's muscular efforts to help carry out Trump's immigration crackdown. The facility is located at an isolated airfield about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of downtown Miami and is surrounded by swamps filled with mosquitoes, pythons and alligators. Ron DeSantis confirmed on Monday that Trump will attend what's expected to be the official opening of the facility, which is estimated to cost $450 million a year. He added that “I think by tomorrow, it'll be ready for business.” The site's remoteness hasn't stopped hundreds of environmentalists and immigrant advocates from coming to protest what they say is a cruel political stunt that will threaten the treasured and ecologically sensitive wetlands. State officials say the installation, which could ultimately house 5,000 detainees, is critical to support Trump's mass deportation agenda, which has resulted in a record-high number of detentions, totaling more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019. State officials have commandeered the land using emergency powers, under a years-old executive order issued by DeSantis during the administration of then-President Joe Biden to respond to what the governor deemed a crisis caused by illegal immigration. By relying on executive orders, the state is able to sidestep purchasing laws and fast-track the project, which critics have said amounts to an abuse of power. “Governor DeSantis has insisted that the state of Florida, under his leadership, will facilitate the federal government in enforcing immigration law,” a DeSantis spokesperson said in a statement. “Florida will continue to lead on immigration enforcement.” Immigrant advocates, environmental activists and Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands held a protest near the airstrip Saturday. Hundreds of demonstrators lined part of U.S. Highway 41 that slices through the marshy Everglades — also known as Tamiami Trail — as dump trucks hauling construction materials lumbered into the airfield. Cars passing by honked in support as protesters waved signs calling for the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to Native communities and endangered species. In Big Cypress National Preserve, where the airstrip is located, 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, as well as burial grounds and ceremonial sites, remain. “We are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal aliens,” said Noem in a written statement provided to the AP. The facility is meant to help the Trump administration reach its goal of more than doubling its existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds. A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation bill approved last month by the U.S. House of Representatives includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. A U.S. official said immigrants arrested by Florida law enforcement officers under the federal 287 (g) program will be held at the facility, as well as immigrants in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. Under the revived 287 (g) program, local and state law enforcement officers can interrogate immigrants in their custody and detain them for potential deportation. Agencies across all 67 Florida counties have signed more than 280 such agreements, more than a third of the 720 agreements ICE have reached nationwide.

A DHS officer stands guard outside the Robert Young Federal Building during a march in solidarity for a peaceful interfaith Prayer Walk for Family Unity, June 18, 2025, in Los Angeles. WASHINGTON (AP) — The top military commander in charge of troops deployed to Los Angeles to respond to protests against immigration raids has asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth if 200 of those forces could be returned to wildfire fighting duty, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Monday. President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of about 4,000 California National Guard troops and 800 active duty Marines against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom in early June to respond to a series of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles. The federal troops' domestic deployment raised multiple legal questions, including whether the administration would seek to employ emergency powers under the Insurrection Act to empower those forces to conduct law enforcement on U.S. soil, which they are not permitted to do except in rare circumstances. The Marines, however, are primarily assigned to protecting federal buildings. The Insurrection Act has not been used. California has just entered peak wildfire season, and Newsom has warned that the Guard is now understaffed due to the Los Angeles protest deployment. The top military commander of those troops, U.S. Northern Command head Gen. Gregory Guillot, recently submitted a request to Hegseth to return 200 of the National Guard troops back to Joint Task Force Rattlesnake, which is the California National Guard's wildfire unit, the officials said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet announced publicly. Trump has contended that “there has been an invasion” of migrants entering the country without legal permission.</p>

Powered and implemented by FactSet Digital Solutions. Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss Republicans' effort to pass President Donald Trump's budget bill and offer clarification on how it would impact the deficit. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are warning they have serious issues with the Senate's version of President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" as it's currently written. "Even without interest costs, it is $651 billion over our agreed budget framework," the statement read. The Senate is currently working through the bill and is expected to finish sometime later Monday or even on Tuesday. The House Freedom Caucus is criticizing President Donald Trump's tax bill. The Senate bill would add an extra $1 trillion to raise the debt limit, compared to the House version and permanently extend certain corporate tax cuts in President Donald Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that the House only extended temporarily. It also includes several specific new additions aimed at easing Senate Republicans' own concerns with the bill, including a $25 billion rural hospital fund to offset issues with Medicaid cuts, and a tax break for whalers that appears aimed at Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. The Senate is operating under a mechanism called "current policy baseline," which would effectively zero-out the cost of extending TCJA tax cuts by calculating them as the de facto operational policy rather than calculating the cost as if they were not in place. Absent congressional action, TCJA tax cuts expire at the end of 2025. Reps. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., and Eric Burlison, R-Mo., both House Freedom Caucus members, said the bill could face steep odds — even fail — in the lower chamber if changes were not made. Both said it could fail in a House-wide procedural vote before lawmakers could even contend with the measure itself. A rule vote is traditionally taken to allow for debate on legislation before lawmakers weigh in on it. President Donald Trump is pushing Republicans to pass his agenda (Alex Brandon/AP Photo) Norman said Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had done a "good job," but added of the Senate, "They've got fighters... but we've just got to have certain things that comply with our House version." Burlison said it could depend on the fate of an amendment by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., which would significantly hike the Medicaid financial burden for states that expanded their Medicaid population under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Scott's proposal could add hundreds of billions in savings to the plan, in addition to the nearly $1 trillion the Senate plan already saves in Medicaid spending. It's probably going to take more spending reductions than that, but that would get the majority of us there," Burlison told Fox News Digital, without commenting on House GOP leaders. "All Republican Senators should vote YES on Senator Rick Scott's very reasonable 'elimination of theft from Medicaid' FMAP amendment," Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., posted. Fox News Digital reached out to Speaker Mike Johnson's office for comment on House Freedom Caucus members' comments. Notably, key provisions originally in the House bill were stripped out of the legislation for not being "Byrd-compliant." Rep. Eric Burlison said some support could hinge on an amendment by Sen. Rick Scott. They're aiming to have a bill on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July. A GOP aide told Fox News Digital, "The Senate version contains more in Byrd-compliant savings than the House, and correctly scores extending current tax policy as revenue-neutral — and assumes the kind of growth that was also massively underestimated last time around." Senate Republicans argue the bill would lead to $1.6 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years — above the House Freedom Caucus' demanded $1.5 trillion threshold.

'Hannity' panelists Matt Towery and Robert Cahaly discuss the American people's thoughts U.S. strikes on Iran. U.S. women's soccer legend Abby Wambach admitted in a recent podcast interview that President Donald Trump and his administration are "geniuses" in at least one thing. Wambach, along with author Glennon Doyle, opened up about what she called a "complicated" relationship with the U.S. and lamented that Trump and his officials were able to get their voters to rally and elect him as president once again in 2024. She spoke to MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace on her "Best People" podcast. "And being a person who represented this country, and I consider myself very patriotic in many ways, and yet my relationship with my country is very complicated because of all the things that go on inside our administration, the things that we are seeing. "But I do believe that one of the things that Trump and the administration are geniuses at is getting people to believe they are a part of this community. Wambach said that when someone is trying to develop so-called "team culture," what Trump and his administration have done in that development is a "very smart way to do it." President Donald Trump waves to supporters in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Feb. 17, 2025. However, Wambach believes some Trump supporters are having second thoughts. "I think that you are seeing some folks going, ‘Wait a second I didn't sign up for all of this,' and that is laughable to me because he wasn't hiding the playbook. They just didn't believe, I think part of them probably felt like, ‘Oh the playbook is just like that is just never going to happen, right like that is too far down that is never going to happen. Let's just get him in office he is a good businessman.' I also think there is probably a sector of people that are like, ‘Yeah we want all of this stuff to happen.' "There is, I think there is a smaller version, but I do think some of the folks that voted for him are probably questioning their vote and also embarrassed to go back on it. It is once you get entrenched in that community, it's like if you get out where do you go, it is almost like there is no place for folks who actually want to jump ship to land because they can't see themselves in all of our world." Trump touted his poll numbers earlier this month, saying his approval rating was "the highest it's ever been." Supporters fly their flags as they wait for President Donald Trump's motorcade to pass by after arriving at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida on March 28, 2025.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>• Authorities identify suspect: Investigators have confirmed the identity of the suspect found dead on Canfield Mountain on Sunday as 20-year-old Wess Roley, according to a law enforcement official. Roley is believed to have started a brush fire before shooting at responding firefighters, the Kootenai County sheriff said. • Two killed, one injured: Two firefighters were fatally shot and a third was out of surgery and stable as of Sunday night, the sheriff said. • Fire still burning: The blaze that prompted firefighters to respond has scorched about 26 acres with no structures damaged, officials said. Two firefighters were killed and one was injured after responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain, which authorities believe was intentionally set by a suspect who then opened fire on responding firefighters. The injured firefighter was out of surgery and in stable condition as of Sunday night, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris. The fire at Canfield Mountain has grown to 26 acres as of Monday morning and a haze of smoke can be seen lingering in the area. The brush fire authorities believe was intentionally set by a suspect who then opened fire on responding firefighters, killing two and injuring a third, has grown overnight. Firefighters are contending with tricky terrain, the agency said Sunday, with numerous snags and steep areas to navigate as they work. There's no such thing as a typical arsonist. People commit arson for different reasons, Ed Nordskog, an arson investigator with the LA County Sheriff's Department, previously told CNN. Psychologists point to some common characteristics: problems communicating, impulsive behaviors, difficulty expressing emotions and an interest in fire paraphernalia. Roughly 20% of human-caused wildland fires in the US are set deliberately, but motives can vary widely. For some, it's a means to an end. These are usually the one-and-done arsonists, Nordskog said. In urban areas, arson occurs every day for a variety of reasons, Nordskog said, citing dumpster fires, car fires and people burning garbage in alleys. Many unhoused people accidentally set fires while cooking or trying to keep warm, he said. Mental health and substance use issues can also contribute to the cause of these fires, he noted. “A true wildland serial arsonist has the power of an atomic bomb at their fingertips. No criminal in the world has that kind of power.” Regardless of why an arsonist starts a fire, they have no control over how big it gets. As climate change creates increasingly dangerous fire conditions, arsonists hold the power to do a lot more damage, experts say. Investigators are likely working to understand the motivation of the Idaho suspect who they believe started a brush fire before shooting at responding firefighters in what authorities describe as a planned ambush, a former intelligence official told CNN. “Right now, behind the scenes, there's a lot of work going on to really understand who this individual is and what motivated them to carry out this attack,” Shawn Turner, former US national intelligence communications director, said Monday. First, investigators will be looking at “whether or not there was some sort of tension; some sort of strife, conflict between local law enforcement and this individual,” Turner said. The ambush appears to have been “a fairly complex attack where he intended to harm more people than he did,” Turner said. Residents of Coeur d'Alene lined the highway on Sunday to honor two firefighters killed in an ambush while responding to a fire. “It was very moving to see all the people that came out. Even after the procession was done, people kept coming out,” Bill Buley, assistant managing editor for of the Coeur d'Alene Press, told CNN's MJ Lee. Many stood in silence, waving flags or holding one another in comfort as a stream of vehicles passed by, Buley said. People know who these front-line guys are and hold them with a great amount of respect. The suspect's cell phone was instrumental in helping law enforcement track and stop the threat during Sunday's ambush shooting that killed two firefighters near Idaho's Canfield Mountain, one expert said. “At 2:00, the firefighters called and said they had been ambushed,” Steve Moore, a retired FBI supervisory special agent, told CNN. “Either way, they had actually resolved this within 90 minutes. And the rest of the time was determining a safe way to clear that mountain … to get to the location of this cell phone, which they thought, correctly, was important evidence,” he said. The killing of two firefighters while responding to a fire near Idaho's Canfield Mountain on Sunday has shaken the Coeur d'Alene community, an act Kootenai County Commissioner Bruce Mattare described as “unheard of” and hard for residents to comprehend. It's so tragic,” Mattare told CNN's Rosemary Church. “The people we lost were absolutely top-notch professionals. People are still trying to process exactly what happened.” The firefighters were responding to a brush fire, later named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, when they were ambushed, officials said. The attack triggered a massive response from local and federal agencies, including the Idaho National Guard, which offered to provide a Black Hawk helicopter, Mattare said. “The overwhelming support from other jurisdictions was unbelievable. People came together, and we were able to stop the situation fairly quickly.” The attack has sparked questions about emergency response protocols. “You want to avoid having a knee-jerk reaction,” he said. “It's absolutely devastating, but the procession and the number of people coming out to show their support have been overwhelming. A man believed to have fatally shot two firefighters after starting a brush fire on Idaho's Canfield Mountain was found dead Sunday evening –– ending what authorities describe as a sniper attack on fire personnel and responding police. Law enforcement located the gunman by tracing his cell phone signal, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a news conference Sunday night. He is believed to be the only attacker, Norris said. Fire crews are staging a range of resources to fight the wildfire law enforcement believes was intentionally set by a gunman in order to ambush firefighters on Canfield Mountain on Sunday. Aircraft, heavy equipment, water tankers, engines, firefighting crews and a specialized incident management team have been ordered and are expected to begin work Monday on what's been named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, according to an update by the Idaho Department of Lands. The fire, reported early Sunday afternoon, has grown to an estimated 15 to 20 acres, “with numerous snags and steep terrain,” the department said. Here's a timeline of the events, according to Norris: “We lost two outstanding professionals of the highest quality,” he said. “This is not who we are as a community,” Mattare said, adding that Coeur d'Alene was “a place that's comprised of caring people.” Kootenai County officials will not publicly provide identification details of the two deceased firefighters, Sheriff Bob Norris said. A third firefighter from Coeur d'Alene Fire Department is “fighting for his life, but he is in stable condition,” Norris said. There is a belief that he ran and shot,” the sheriff said. The wildfire on Canfield Mountain has scorched approximately 20 acres, Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris said Sunday, but firefighting efforts were delayed by an exchange of gunfire. No structures were lost in the fire, Norris confirmed. Authorities believe the suspect intentionally started the fire as part of “an ambush,” Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris told reporters on Sunday. Kootenai County Sheriff Robert “Bob” Norris confirmed the deaths of a firefighter from Coeur d'Alene and another from Kootenai County in a news conference on Sunday. A third firefighter from Coeur d'Alene Fire Department is out of surgery. The man found dead with a firearm on Canfield Mountain is believed to be the only shooter in Sunday's attacks on police and firefighters, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said in a news conference. “We have one dead shooter,” Norris said, while noting, “There is no threat to the community at this time.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The $14.6 billion crackdown spanned all 50 states and included charges ranging from opioid trafficking and telemedicine fraud to transnational identity theft schemes. Authorities said they seized over $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency, and other assets. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the takedown “delivers justice to criminal actors who prey upon our most vulnerable citizens and steal from hardworking American taxpayers.” The healthcare fraud bust under President Donald Trump and his appointees marks a major step above efforts by the Justice Department under the Biden administration, which uncovered $2.75 billion in false claims last year, resulting in 193 defendants charged. The announcement came as Senate Republicans advanced the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sweeping tax and spending package that proposes major changes to Medicaid reimbursements. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Rand Paul (R-KY) voted to move the bill forward. “These criminals didn't just steal someone else's money — they stole from you,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ's Criminal Division. Among the major alleged schemes was a transnational criminal ring accused of submitting $10.6 billion in fraudulent Medicare claims using the stolen identities of over 1 million U.S. residents. In Arizona, a United Arab Emirates-based billing company allegedly defrauded Medicaid of $650 million, targeting Native American and homeless patients for addiction treatment scams. In Indiana, Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, announced charges in 13 cases, including hospice workers and nurses accused of stealing drugs from dying patients. Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said a new “fraud war room” would deploy artificial intelligence tools and prepayment reviews to detect fraud before money is released. “We're stopping stolen taxpayer money from leaving the door,” Oz said.</p>

Carson Branstine was already a fan favorite before she entered the first round of Wimbledon against the top-ranked women's tennis player in the world, Aryna Sabalenka. Branstine, of Canada, starred at Texas A&M and helped the Aggies to a national championship before she turned pro. She was able to make the final bracket for Wimbledon after she tore through the qualifying rounds, defeating one-time U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu, Raluca Georgiana Serban and Lois Boisson. Carson Branstine goes up against Aryna Sabalenka in the first round of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London on Monday, June 30, 2025. However, what captured the attention of social media before the match against Sabalenka was her status as a fashion model. Branstine is signed with Wilhelmina Models and the Neal Hamil Agency. She opened up about funding her tennis dreams through modeling in an interview with reporters ahead of Wimbledon earlier this month. Carson Branstine returns the ball to Aryna Sabalenka during their first-round women's singles match at the Wimbledon Tennis Championships in London on Monday, June 30, 2025. "I love being in front of the camera during a shoot. I didn't want to ask my parents for anything — I wanted everything to come from me and from my tennis," she said, via Clay. "I wasn't signed by these agencies because of my tennis — it was for my look. Modeling and tennis are weirdly similar – you are an object a lot, and people sometimes forget you're a person too." While Branstine fell to Sabalenka in straight sets, she gave the Belarusian a run for her money in the second set, losing 7-5. 194 in the world before going up against Sabalenka.

Ron DeSantis joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the mission behind a new ICE detention facility in the Everglades as construction begins on 'Alligator Alcatraz.' President Donald Trump will head to Florida on Tuesday for the official opening of an immigration detention camp in the Everglades that is surrounded by alligators, aptly dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," Florida Gov. "We have the president of the United States coming down tomorrow to tout what Florida has done," DeSantis said at a Monday news conference, according to the Miami Herald. "I think by tomorrow it will be open for business," he added. DeSantis authorized the construction of an illegal immigrant detention center on a 30-square-mile property in the Everglades' swamplands of Miami–Dade County under an emergency order. A drone view shows the area surrounding the construction site of the state's forthcoming "Alligator Alcatraz" ICE detention center at Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport as people rally against it in Ochopee, Florida, on June 28, 2025. The detention center earned its name due to its location in the heart of the Everglades, which is home to massive reptiles such as alligators and pythons. "This is an airport that's already there," DeSantis said Wednesday during an event with the media. "Clearly, from a security perspective, if someone escapes, you know, there are a lot of alligators you're going to have to contend with. No one's going anywhere once you do that. It's a safe and secure as can be." Environmentalists and Democrats have come out against the detention center, including lining up along Highway 41, which runs through the Everglades, to protest its construction Saturday. Protesters held signs declaring, "Another stupid plan to abuse people & the Everglades," "No Alligator Alcatraz" or signs demanding ICE is pushed "out of Florida," photos show.

Colin Cowherd compares Rodgers' career with Brett Favre, and asks if Rodgers will be successful with the... The Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins reportedly made a trade involving All-Pro defensive backs on Monday with the beginning of training camp weeks away. The Dolphins agreed to trade cornerback Jalen Ramsey, tight end Jonnu Smith and a 2027 seventh-round draft pick to the Steelers for safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and a 2027 fifth-round pick, according to multiple reports. Miami Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey, #5, reacts against the New England Patriots during the second quarter at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on Oct. 29, 2023. It had been known that Ramsey was looking to be traded. A reunion with the Los Angeles Rams was at one time rumored to be a possible option for Ramsey. He won a Super Bowl there in 2021. Additionally, not only does the team receive the three-time All-Pro, but they also get a Pro Bowl tight end in Smith to add to the offensive depth and give Aaron Rodgers another target. Pittsburgh Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, #39, watches the action against the Buffalo Bills at Acrisure Stadium in Pittsburgh on Aug. 17, 2024. Ramsey had 60 tackles and two interceptions in 17 games last season. Smith had a career-high 88 catches for 884 yards and eight touchdowns. The Dolphins received Fitzpatrick, who started his career in Miami. Miami Dolphins tight end Jonnu Smith, #9, runs with the ball after a catch during the first half against the Cleveland Browns at Huntington Bank Field in Cleveland on Dec. 29, 2024. He put together three All-Pro seasons with the Steelers. Last year, he had 96 tackles and an interception in 17 games.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The ruling has now prompted the justices to vacate multiple decisions from lower courts in cases involving health benefits and birth certificate policies for people who identify as transgender. In an order list issued Monday morning, the high court overturned appellate rulings that previously blocked state-level bans or coverage restrictions for transgender-related care in North Carolina, West Virginia, Idaho, and Oklahoma. The high court also declined to take up a separate appeal from Kentucky, where families challenged the state's similar law banning transgender procedures for minors. In Skrmetti, the Supreme Court held that Tennessee's law did not discriminate based on sex or transgender status, giving states wide latitude to regulate medical procedures offered to minors. The ruling did not address transgender status more broadly, and it did not interfere with the precedent set in the 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision, which said employers cannot discriminate against people based on gender identity. Circuit Court of Appeals must now reconsider its prior ruling that North Carolina and West Virginia violated the Constitution by refusing to cover certain treatments for transgender people through state insurance programs. Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit will reexamine a similar challenge in Idaho, and the 10th Circuit will revisit its decision blocking Oklahoma from banning gender changes on birth certificates. Monday's actions come as the justices continue to weigh whether to take up additional cases, including challenges to school sports participation rules in Arizona, Idaho, and West Virginia that restrict biological boys from competing on girls sports teams. A decision on whether to grant review in those cases could come as soon as Thursday, when the high court is set to release another orders list. While Monday's order was expected in light of the latest precedent shift, it underscores how Skrmetti is reshaping the legal landscape on transgender issues and raising the stakes for appeals involving schools, healthcare, and identity documentation.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Norway's national lottery has apologized after thousands of players were mistakenly told that they had won large sums in the Eurojackpot draw due to a coding error. Norsk Tipping receives the prize amounts from Germany in euros, then coverts them to Norwegian kroner. However, it was during the conversion that an error occurred and winnings were multiplied by 100, rather than divided by 100, the company said in a statement Friday. Norsk Tipping sent messages and push notifications to customers that showed the wrong, inflated winnings, before later issuing a correction. “Norsk Tipping sincerely apologizes to everyone who was notified of an incorrect prize amount,” it said. “No customers have been paid the wrong prize,” it added. In a separate statement on Saturday, Norsk Tipping CEO Tonje Sagstuen also apologized for the error. “I have received many messages from people who had managed to make plans for holidays, buying an apartment or renovating before they realized that the amount was wrong,” she said. But I understand that it is a small consolation,” added Sagstuen, who later stepped down and was replaced by acting CEO Vegar Strand. The company then sent out another apology message signed by Strand. “On Friday evening, thousands of Norwegians were mistakenly told that they had won a large prize in Eurojackpot. This was an error that affected many and which we take very seriously,” it read. “We deeply regret what has happened, and on behalf of us at Norsk Tipping I would like to apologize to everyone who was affected by this,” said Strand, who added that the company was “working intensively” to make sure that something similar doesn't happen again.</p>

Hayle Mayer, left, and Corporal Addison Merrell, watch fireworks at the Washington Monument while attending a military parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Washington. WASHINGTON (AP) — Only 36% of Democrats say they're “extremely” or “very” proud to be American, according to a new Gallup poll, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people. That includes all four years of Republican President Donald Trump's first term. “Each generation is less patriotic than the prior generation, and Gen Z is definitely much lower than anybody else,” said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. “But even among the older generations, we see that they're less patriotic than the ones before them, and they've become less patriotic over time. That's primarily driven by Democrats within those generations.” America's decline in national pride has been a slow erosion, with a steady downtick in Gallup's data since January 2001, when the question was first asked. Even during the tumultuous early years of the Iraq War, the vast majority of U.S. adults, whether Republican or Democrat, said they were “extremely” or “very” proud to be American. At that point, about 9 in 10 were “extremely” or “very” proud to be American. Now, 58% of U.S. adults say that, in a downward shift that's been driven almost entirely by Democrats and independents. Independents' pride in their national identity hit a new low in the most recent survey, at 53%, largely following that pattern of gradual decline. When Trump first entered the White House, in 2017, about two-thirds of Democrats said they were proud to be American. But while Democrats' sense of national pride rebounded when Biden took office, it didn't go back to its pre-Trump levels. “It's not just a Trump story,” Jones said. “Something else is going on, and I think it's just younger generations coming in and not being as patriotic as older people.” People hold signs reading, “NO KINGS,” during a protest taking place on the day of a military parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Donald Trump's 79th birthday, Saturday, June 14, 2025, in Washington. Other recent polling shows that Democrats and independents are less likely than Republicans to say that expressing patriotism is important or to feel a sense of pride in their national leaders. Nearly 9 in 10 Republicans in a 2024 SSRS poll said they believed patriotism has a positive impact on the United States, with Democrats more divided: 45% said patriotism had a positive impact on the country, while 37% said it was negative. But a more general sense of discontent was clear on both sides of the aisle earlier this year, when a CNN/SSRS poll found that fewer than 1 in 10 Democrats and Republicans said “proud” described the way they felt about politics in America today. In that survey, most Americans across the political spectrum said they were “disappointed” or “frustrated” with the country's politics.</p>

The measure, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” with the president's trademark provocative hyperbole, is Trump's attempt to engineer lasting change through legislation in an administration that is also wielding huge and questionable executive power. Senators will begin a marathon series of votes on amendments Monday morning after working through the weekend. The bill is significant for its own sake, both ideologically and symbolically. It codifies some of Trump's key goals — from financing his deportation crackdown to slashing green energy projects. Days after he bombed Iran; stopped it and Israel firing missiles at each other; and celebrated a Supreme Court ruling that will facilitate his aggressive claims of executive authority, passing the bill would exemplify the growing power of a president dominating and disrupting this era in the US and abroad. Related article Republicans face a ferocious ad campaign surrounding Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill' Because senators made major modifications to the original House bill, the high-stakes legislative dance may see significant pushback from far-right House Freedom Caucus Republicans concerned about its effect on the national debt. But the stakes for Trump are so high, and his control over the party's base is so complete, that the bill is highly likely to become law in some form. And a compromise on state and local taxes in the Senate defused a brewing revolt by more moderate GOP House members who will be critical to the party's hopes of holding on to its majority next year. Republicans argue that the centerpiece bill of Trump's second term will honor the promises that he made to Americans in his election victory last year. He said we are going to change America for the better. “We're going to make sure that we have secure borders, not just now, but for generations to come,” Britt said. And we're going to make sure that people who have been unseen are seen.” But Democrats blasted the bill's permanent extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts as a massive giveaway to the president's rich friends and warned that cuts to Medicaid spending will shatter rural health care and hurt working Americans. “What this does, and the baseline is all these cuts, all this cutback on health care, to provide the wealthiest in our country a disproportionate share of tax cuts, that just doesn't seem fair,” Virginia Sen. Mark Warner told Tapper. “The more we can get that (message) out — I think this will be a political albatross.” This bill is the most tangible way for Trump to implement his 2024 campaign promises. Presidents always face intense pressure to enshrine their attempts at political transformation into law. Failed legislative leaps erode perceptions of presidential power in Washington. And while the bill has plenty of provisions Republican lawmakers may find hard to defend, they'd dread an exhibition of failing to act on the mandate they believe they were handed by GOP voters even more. Trump uses executive power more broadly and questionably than any modern president. But some of those unilateral acts could be quickly reversed by a Democratic successor. Changing laws locks in a more enduring legacy. The “big, beautiful bill” is also critical to some of Trump's most pressing priorities. It would, for instance, unlock massive funding for the border security and undocumented migrant expulsion plan at the center of his entire political project. “We got a lot of people to look for, a lot of people to arrest, a lot of national security threats we know are in this country,” White House border czar Tom Homan said last week. The bill ends many Biden administration tax breaks and subsidies for alternative energy sources under what this White House calls the “Green New Scam.” But Democrats warn the bill is a job-killer for an emergent US green energy industry and a gift to global competitors such as China and Europe. It makes good on Trump's promise to remove taxes on tips and overtime in a boost for working Americans touted by the president in his 2024 campaign. This is in keeping with a new era of American oligarchs cemented by a billionaire president and his Cabinet of billionaires and millionaires. This fiscal profligacy makes Elon Musk's attempt to defenestrate the federal government at the Department of Government Efficiency seem more of an ideological initiative than a fiscal one. For all the claims of saving money and curtailing the deficit, the “big, beautiful bill” makes a far clearer statement of Trump's attitude to debt and long-term national financial security. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley secured delays in the implementation of some of changes to Medicaid before agreeing to vote for the bill. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis warned that many people in his state would lose Medicaid coverage under the bill and voted against advancing it Saturday, earning a Trump blast on social media. Hours later, Tillis, one of the few remaining GOP senators ready to criticize the president, announced he wouldn't seek reelection next year, setting up an even more consequential race in his swing state. Related article Republican plans to overhaul Medicaid are already shaking up the 2026 midterms The feud over Medicaid, as well as other cuts to nutrition programs for low-income Americans, offers an opening for a Democratic Party that has struggled to slow Trump. “The Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, says it's going to kick between 10 and 15 million people off their health care,” the Connecticut Democrat continued. The White House denies it is cutting funding for Medicaid or nutrition assistance and argues it's merely cutting waste, fraud and abuse. But Murphy is right on at least one thing: Almost every poll on the bill shows that it's unpopular. CNN's Aaron Blake reported this month that four recent polls from the Washington Post, Fox News, KFF and Quinnipiac University had the legislation underwater by an average of 24 points. This is especially the case because the perceived benefits of any measure often become apparent more slowly than its political reverberations. The bill is critical to Trump's prestige and authority, and will be greeted as a massive triumph by the president if it passes. It could also turn into a quick liability for Republicans — in the same way as the Affordable Care Act and the American Rescue Plan Act did for Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. But in an era of one-term presidencies and narrow House majorities, the political onus is increasingly on parties and administrations to use power while they have it.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump faces a major obstacle in keeping the southern border secure through his second term and into the next decade. CBP anticipates a sharp uptick in retirements among employees who joined in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-TN) warned that the problem is not to be underestimated. “This could cripple our border security mission if not addressed swiftly.” The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CBP's customs officers who staff air, land, and sea ports of entry, has warned of a “catastrophic breakdown in port operations if thousands of officers retire without anyone to replace them.” The new agency brought government agencies and offices with national security missions under one roof. CBP's Office of Field Operations has 32,000 officers and staff members who are responsible for screening vehicles, cargo, and goods entering the United States, as well as inspecting all people entering the country at ports of entry. In the first few years following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. military and law enforcement departments saw an influx of people apply, including thousands who chose to apply to work for CBP. Those who joined CBP after 9/11 are aging out, facing mandatory retirement dates between now and 2030. Border Patrol lost nearly a quarter of its workforce, more than 4,000 employees, in the 3 1/2 years following former President Joe Biden's election to office in November 2020, the Washington Examiner first reported in May 2024. CBP employees are eligible to retire at any age with 25 years of service. They can retire at age 50 with 20 years of service. At 57 years old, employees are required to retire. “We need to focus on hiring,” Miller said. CBP's Office of Field Operations is already short 5,850 customs officers to staff the 328 land, air, and sea ports of entry nationwide, according to its union. “We expect many of the CBP Officers hired before July 6, 2008, will retire in 2028 because that is when they will become eligible to receive their full Law Enforcement Officer enhanced retirement,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald testified before Congress in May 2024. Paul Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council union, said the retirement cliff for Border Patrol agents is approaching in 2028, but added that CBP has one tool to retain agents that has been seeing a lot of success early on. Border Patrol agents are choosing to extend their careers for a one-year term as part of a newer initiative that allows them to apply for a short-term renewal multiple times until the age of 60. We do have a big retirement cliff coming, but many of the agents are opting to stay,” Perez said. The House-passed version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would give CBP $4.1 billion to hire personnel, as well as $2.05 billion for retention bonuses and signing incentives. It's time for the Senate to help us deliver,” Green said. One longtime Border Patrol agent in California, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because agents are not allowed to speak freely with media, said despite the ability to re-up for another year come retirement time, he plans to take his retirement before Trump leaves office, but he said he has peace of mind about where CBP is headed. “I have done and seen a lot during my career. As much as I love my country and think I can still do more to support and defend the Constitution, I have to take care of myself and let the new generation of agents … lead the patrol.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This satellite image provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shows Tropical Storm Barry, Sunday, June 29, 2025. MIAMI (AP) — A depression that was formerly Tropical Storm Barry dumped rain on eastern Mexico late Sunday as Tropical Storm Flossie brewed off its southwestern Pacific coast. The weakening and ill-defined depression came ashore south of Tampico with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph). All tropical storm warnings and watches were lifted, but rainfall and a risk of flooding were expected through Monday. In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Flossie maintained strength early Monday with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72.4 kph). Mexico's government issued a tropical storm warning along the southwestern coast from Punta San Telmo to Playa Perula. A tropical storm watch remained in effect for the southwest coast from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. A watch means tropical storm conditions are possible in the area within two days. Flossie is expected to rapidly intensify into a hurricane late Monday or Tuesday, then skirt the coast for a few days. While its center is forecast to remain offshore, moderate rain was likely in parts of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through early next week.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A Chinese national flag flutters against the residential building in Beijing, Monday, June 16, 2025. BANGKOK (AP) — Chinese factory activity improved somewhat in June after President Donald Trump agreed to delay imposing higher tariffs on imports from China for 90 days, but overall activity was still contracting, according to a survey released Monday. The purchasing managers index, which reflects new orders and other measures, rose to 49.7 from 49.5 in May, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. That's on a scale of 0 to 100 where 50 and above shows expansion. Other reports showed similar trends in Japan and Korea. The delay for imposing much higher tariffs on China, agreed to in early May, expires about a month later. The hiatus for tariffs brought a revival of manufacturing activity as companies and individuals rushed to take advantage of lower import duties. But that mainly helped large manufacturers, with small and mid-size companies' output still contracting. New export orders and exports also remained below the 50-level that marks expansion. “The subdued rise in industrial production in May means that firms were not benefitting from sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, and their production forecasts point to continued weakness,” Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a report. South Korea's government reported that its “all industry” measure of output fell 2.9% from a year earlier in May, with production of computer chips falling 2%. Production of vehicles fell 2.3% year-on-year, after falling 4.1% in April. In an interview with Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump said he's not planning to extend a 90-day pause on tariffs on most nations beyond July 9. The delay for imposing much higher tariffs on China, agreed to in early May, expires about a month later. Trump said his administration will notify countries that the trade penalties will take effect unless there are deals with the United States. He had played down the deadline at a White House news conference Friday by noting how difficult it would be to work out separate deals with each nation. The administration had set a goal of reaching 90 trade deals in 90 days. Details of the latest agreement to deescalate trade tensions are scarce and major issues between the world's two biggest economies remain unresolved. “I think getting along well with China is a very good thing,” Trump said.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Israeli court announced that hearings for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s corruption trial have been canceled for this week, a delay granted based on pressing national security matters following the country's military operation in Iran and the renewed campaign in Gaza. The ruling is a partial win for Netanyahu and his legal team in a case that has dragged on for four years. He added, “By the way, I hate champagne.” The ruling comes shortly after President Donald Trump blasted the trial as a “witch hunt” in two lengthy posts on Truth Social. “It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran. Importantly, he is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING (Cigars, Bugs Bunny Doll, etc.). This travesty of ‘Justice' will interfere with both Iran and Hamas negotiations. Trump concluded, “The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year, far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this. We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI GO, HE'S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump will travel to a remote, alligator-filled part of South Florida, roughly 50 miles west of coastal Miami, where he will see firsthand a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center that the state of Florida has allowed the federal government to erect in a matter of days, according to a senior administration official. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) announced late last week that he had taken executive action to remake a mostly abandoned airfield in Miami-Dade County into a federal detention site. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier had proposed the project and touted that the tent facility would not require much of a barrier surrounding the site because if immigrants were to escape, “there's not much waiting for them, other than alligators and pythons.” Trump's visit on Tuesday comes after weekend protests on U.S. Highway 41, known as the Tamiami Trail, which connects Miami and the Gulf Coast city of Naples. DeSantis first showed off the site in a media walk-through late last week and warned that “if a criminal alien were to escape from here somehow, and I don't think they will, you've got nowhere to go.” Not going to happen,” DeSantis told Fox News host Steve Doocy. Illegal immigrants who are deemed deportable may be flown out of the country. The tents are massive in size and include large rooms for families, adult men, and adult women to be housed. “This is being done by the Division of Emergency Management. So when we have a hurricane, we would actually have people stage here for hurricane response normally, anyways,” DeSantis said last Friday. “When we have all the linemen come in to do the power, we have to set up little little areas for them, and so you have all this type of stuff.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>AlphaBot 2 wants to beat humans at their own game. When the robot is asked if it wants to play dice, it can interpret the question and jump into action – pressing the button on an automatic dice roller, which spins a die. It can even react to its opponent's score with a thumbs up if they win. The robot's ability to understand instructions was made possible by embodied artificial intelligence (AI) – the integration of AI systems into physical entities – allowing it to interact with and learn from the world around it. “In the last era of robots, people needed to program them to tell them what to do,” Yandong Guo, CEO of AI² Robotics, told CNN correspondent Kristie Lu Stout on the sidelines of the conference. While AI chatbots like ChatGPT have become familiar, many experts say that embodied AI is the next big thing in the field. Companies across the world are developing humanoid robots with AI, including Tesla and California-based Figure AI, whose investors include major tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia. In China, embodied AI is receiving serious national support, including funding, innovation centers and even a robot school. Officials see the technology as a potential driver of economic growth, and in recent years homegrown robots have gained attention for skills ranging from delivering roundhouse kicks to running a half-marathon (though not very quickly). Today, robots are already being used around the globe in industrial settings, like car manufacturing plants. Many robots are programmed to complete routine tasks, but things are shifting towards the use of embodied AI, says Harry Yang, an assistant professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “As tasks become more complex, you need robots to see and understand and act based on different situations,” he says. AlphaBot 2 – which comes equipped with AI² Robotics' self-developed embodied AI model – already has customers across industrial services, biotechnology, and public services, the company says. At a factory operated by carmaker Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor Co. it loads and unloads materials, tows carts, and attaches labels to windshields. Today, most robots lack the technological prowess to be helpful in a household. But Morgan Stanley estimates that 80 million humanoids will be used in homes by 2050, as technology advances. Guo is already envisioning how his robots might be able to help consumers. “After we eat, I hope our robot can clean up all the dishes for us. The reality Guo imagines is still a way off. AI² declined to share a price for its humanoids, saying its robots are tailored to customer requirements, so there's no fixed price. Humanoids produced by some other companies in China cost just shy of $15,000 and within five years, the price of an AI² humanoid could drop to the range of an entry-level car affordable to a middle-class family, says a spokesperson. “The challenge here is that it's very expensive to make one,” says Yang. “Maybe you'd rather hire someone (to work in your home), it's cheaper and easier.” Experts have also raised concerns about the privacy risks of a home robot collecting people's data through cameras and microphones. Guo says that Chinese consumers have some anxiety about putting humanoid robots to use, and the company takes safety and privacy into consideration when it develops its products, but he adds: “You would be surprised to see there are so many customers in China willing to get robots.” Yang says that it will likely be about five to 10 years before humanoid robots can be truly useful in the home. AI² Robotics says in the third quarter of 2025 its robots will be launched at airports in major Chinese cities for tasks like organizing luggage carts for passengers. In three to five years, they might be ready for senior facilities, he says. That could help the company get closer to its goal. “Our dream is to get one robot for every family,” he says.
