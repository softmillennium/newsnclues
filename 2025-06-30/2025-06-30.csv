            The WNBA announced on Monday that Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia will be getting expansion franchises in the coming years.
    


            The new team in Cleveland will begin play in 2028, with Detroit following in 2029 and Philadelphia in 2030.
    


            The league said in a statement that the addition of the three teams “marks a significant milestone in the WNBA's commitment to growing the game, increasing opportunities for players, and bringing professional women's basketball to new and passionate fanbases in more cities.”
    


            “The demand for women's basketball has never been higher, and we are thrilled to welcome Cleveland, Detroit, and Philadelphia to the WNBA family,” WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert said in a statement.

            “This historic expansion is a powerful reflection of our league's extraordinary momentum, the depth of talent across the game, and the surging demand for investment in women's professional basketball. … We are excited for what these cities will bring to the league – and are confident that these new teams will reshape the landscape of women's basketball.”
    


            According to the league, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia were chosen based on “analysis of market viability, committed long-term ownership groups, potential for significant local fan, corporate, media, and city and state support, arena and practice facilities, and community commitment to advancing the sport, among other factors.”
    


            The three teams will bring the total number of WNBA franchises to 18 by the time the Philadelphia team joins, after teams in Portland and Toronto were revealed in 2024. Both Portland and Toronto will begin playing in 2026.
    


            The Golden State Valkyries, the WNBA's newest team, began their debut season this year and are competitive in year one, sporting a 9-7 record in the Western Conference and currently holding the league's No. 6 seed.
    


            Women's professional basketball will return to Cleveland for the first time since 2003 when the city's last WNBA team, the Rockers, folded after having been one of the league's original founding eight teams.

            For Detroit, the WNBA will also make a long-awaited return after the Shock – who played in the Motor City between 1998 and 2009, won three championships and set a single-game attendance record of 22,076 at Game 3 of the 2003 WNBA Finals – moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma, before ultimately moving to Dallas and rebranding to the Wings.
    


            The WNBA will be debuting in the City of Brotherly Love and will be owned by the same leadership group which runs the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers.
    


            The WNBA is in its 29th season and has seen remarkable growth of late.
    


            According to research by Sportico, the current 13 franchises that make up the league increased in value by an average of 180% over the last year which is more than “double the previous biggest year-over-year gain for a major sports league.”
    


            The teams are collectively worth $3.5 billion and on average, each franchise is worth $269 million, vastly more than the $96 million the average team was worth in 2024. The previous biggest year gain was seen in the NBA in 2014 after Steve Ballmer bought the Los Angeles Clippers.
    


            TV ratings, merchandise sales, attendance and revenue increases over the last 12 months have led to the explosion of valuation for WNBA teams, per Sportico.

Follow:


            The Supreme Court on Monday tossed aside a handful of lower court rulings that sided with transgender Americans, requiring that judges in those cases revisit their decisions in the wake of a blockbuster ruling this month that upheld a ban on gender-affirming care for trans youth.
    


            The justices upended rulings that blocked state policies excluding coverage for gender-affirming care in state-sponsored health insurance plans. The high court also tossed out an appeals court ruling that went against Oklahoma in a challenge to the state's effort to ban transgender residents from changing the sex designation on their birth certificates. In a loss for the transgender Americans who sued, those decisions will now be reviewed again.
    


            Lower courts must now review the cases again in light of the Supreme Court's major decision on June 18 that upheld Tennessee's ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for trans minors. The 6-3 ruling in US v. Skrmetti steered clear of discussion about other laws involving transgender Americans, but it also did little to protect them in other cases. The court ruled that Tennessee had not discriminated on the basis of sex, which gave the state far more room to regulate medical care.

            The court also held that the law did not discriminate on the basis of transgender status.
    


            But three conservative justices – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Amy Coney Barrett – said that they would not require courts to more closely scrutinize other laws that discriminate on the basis of transgender status. While a majority of the court declined to adopt that approach, if those three justices can convince two of their colleagues to agree with that reasoning, it would give conservative states much more leeway to enact laws aimed at trans people, both minors and adults. An estimated 1.6 million Americans over the age of 13 identify as transgender, the court said.
    


            Notably, the Supreme Court did not deal Monday with several cases involving state bans on athletes playing on sports teams that align with their gender identity.
    


            One of the cases the Supreme Court is asking lower courts to revisit is related to birth certificates.
    


            After years of allowing people to change their sex on a birth certificate, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt in 2021 signed an executive order barring the Oklahoma health department from allowing anyone to alter their sex or gender on the document. A group of transgender residents challenged the law, arguing that it violated their equal protection rights.
    


            A federal district court dismissed the suit, but the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the equal protection claim to proceed. Oklahoma officials appealed to the Supreme Court in January.
    


            Now that case will return to the appeals court for a fresh look in light of the Skrmetti decision.
    


            Another issue that had been pending for months at the Supreme Court dealt with health insurance plans that do not cover transgender care. Lower courts had sided with the transgender advocates, but now will have to look at their decisions again after Skrmetti.
    


            The two state coverage cases concerned access to gender-affirming care for adults, while many of the other cases related to transgender rights to arrive at the court have dealt with minors.
    


            Last year, a Richmond-based federal appeals court ruled that North Carolina and West Virginia had violated the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause by excluding gender-affirming care from their insurance plans.
    


            The North Carolina plan, used for more than 740,000 state employees, had excluded coverage for gender-affirming care since the 1990s, while West Virginia's Medicaid program for low-income residents excluded coverage for gender-affirming surgeries.
    


            The plans were challenged by transgender residents in both states who were denied coverage for care needed to treat their gender dysphoria, the medical term for an uncomfortable conflict between a person's assigned gender and the gender with which the person identifies.

            “Because the exclusions here condition access to certain surgeries on whether those surgeries will better align the patient's sex assigned at birth with their gender, they discriminate on the basis of sex,” US Circuit Judge Roger Gregory wrote in the majority opinion holding that the plans violate the Constitution.
    


            Both states asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, with attorneys for North Carolina arguing to the justices that the appeals court ruling is “seriously flawed” because its exclusion of coverage for gender-affirming care is a use-based distinction, not a sex-based one.
    


            “States do not discriminate against any protected class when they decline to cover certain treatments and surgeries across the board, even when those coverage decisions have a disproportionate effect on some plan participants,” they wrote in court papers. “And the Constitution certainly does not mandate that States not only permit, but fund, these highly controversial forms of medical intervention while the ongoing medical debate remains unsettled.”
    


            West Virginia's attorneys said that state's exclusion of gender-affirming surgeries was based on cost-related decisions and asked the high court to review the appeals court decision “to address the chaos that will result” from it.
    


            “The Constitution now dictates gold-standard insurance coverage for transgender Medicaid beneficiaries in West Virginia, which will come at the expense of other services,” they wrote.

Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin has ordered that an information sharing agreement with Sweden on nuclear accidents and nuclear installations be abandoned, after Stockholm joined NATO last year.

The relevant document was signed by Mishustin on June 24 and published on the state portal for legal information on Friday.

The deal, signed by the USSR and Sweden in 1988, taking force in April of that year, stemmed from the 1986 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Convention on Early Notification of a Nuclear Accident, in which the agency's members agreed to notify each other of any nuclear accidents on their territory that could affect other countries.

Scientists at the Swedish nuclear power station at Forsmark were among the first in the west to detect increasing radiation levels on April 28, 1986, two days after the explosion at the Chernobyl power plant in Ukraine.

Sweden joined NATO in March 2024, abandoning its long-standing policy of neutrality. Stockholm has provided almost $10 billion in military and other assistance to Kiev since February 2022, while also announcing a major rearmament program at home.

Russia constitutionally remains a successor state of the Soviet Union, having exclusively incurred the bloc's debt upon its dissolution, and Moscow recognizes international treaties signed by the USSR.

Russian ambassador to Stockholm Sergey Belyaev told RIA Novosti in May that Stockholm's stance “indicates that Sweden has completely lost its status of a neutral country and is turning into a springboard for the implementation of NATO's militaristic ambitions.”

Coins and banknotes have nearly disappeared from everyday life in China, according to Le Monde. From supermarkets and cafes to public transportation, most payments are now made exclusively through mobile apps such as WeChat Pay and Alipay.

The two platforms have become essential tools for daily living in the world's second-largest economy, the outlet said on Saturday. Their logos are displayed at virtually every checkout, and many businesses no longer use traditional cash registers. Instead, vendors scan a QR code on the customer's smartphone to complete the sale.

Only the oldest shoppers still use coins and notes, the outlet said, noting that across the rest of Chinese society, cash has virtually vanished.

The shift is especially visible in urban markets, where even fruit and vegetable sellers rely on mobile payments. Most taxi drivers no longer accept cash, and many small neighborhood shops lack the ability to provide change, discouraging cash transactions altogether.

The dominance of WeChat and Alipay has diminished the role of traditional banking services for many young Chinese, who often only engage with banks for tasks like obtaining mortgages. In response, China's central bank has accelerated the development of a digital currency, the digital yuan, aiming to maintain monetary control amid the rise of private payment platforms. Pilot programs began in several cities in 2019, with a smartphone app launching in 2022. Despite claims of 260 million accounts opened, the digital yuan remains largely absent from daily life, overshadowed by the convenience of existing apps.

Efforts to promote the digital yuan have faced challenges, including the 2024 arrest of Yao Qian, a former official responsible for digital currency research, on corruption charges involving tech companies. Nonetheless, China's central bank continues to advocate for the digital yuan's global expansion, aiming to reduce reliance on the US dollar and promote a multi-currency international system.

Two firefighters were shot and killed in an apparent ambush while responding to a wildfire in the US state of Idaho on Sunday.

Emergency crews were dispatched to Canfield Mountain, a popular hiking and biking destination in Coeur d'Alene, around 1:30pm local time. Roughly 30 minutes later, reports of gunfire began coming in, according to the Kootenai County Sheriff's Office.

Sheriff Robert Norris told reporters that a SWAT team had been deployed and was engaged in a firefight with the suspect. “We are actively taking sniper fire as we speak,” he said.

The Sheriff's Office later stated that the body of the suspected gunman was found on Canfield Mountain, with a firearm located nearby.

Lieutenant Jeff Howard told ABC News that authorities are investigating whether the blaze was intentionally ignited to draw firefighters into a trap.

Civilians, including hikers, were seen fleeing the area.

FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino confirmed that federal agents were deployed to provide “tactical and operational support.” A police helicopter was dispatched to assist but was unable to land due to continued gunfire.

Idaho Governor Brad Little condemned the attack, calling it a “heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters.”

BELGRADE, June 30. /TASS/. Protesters in Serbia announced on social media that they would begin a total blockade of roads, streets, and intersections in their areas ""until their demands are met,"" including the immediate release of previously detained protesters and the holding of early parliamentary elections.

""After the ultimatum was not met and mass arrests of citizens and students took place yesterday and today, citizens across Serbia decided to block intersections, roads, and streets in their municipalities. Until our demands are met!"" the organizers said on social media.

Serbian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Ivica Dacic said that the police would closely monitor the situation in Belgrade, where participants gathered Sunday evening for new protests against the arrests of students suspected of inciting violence. He also called on citizens not to create situations that could lead to clashes with the police.

Mass protests in Serbia are continuing for the second day and are becoming increasingly large-scale and decentralized. Protesters are blocking key transport hubs in Belgrade and other cities, setting up barricades and tents. They are demanding the release of detainees, the holding of elections, and the dismantling of the tent camp of President Aleksandar Vucic's supporters outside the parliament building.

On a platform dedicated to the protests and on social media, students reported 24 locations in Belgrade where roads were blocked, as well as rallies in 18 cities across the country. Despite the blockades and transport disruptions, the police are maintaining a restrained position and are not interfering with the protesters' actions.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

CHOLPON-ATA /Kyrgyzstan/, June 30. /TASS/. NATO's defense spending spree will only hurt the alliance, leading to its ultimate collapse, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters after the Collective Security Treaty Organization's Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, as he called for more pragmatism in its approach.

""He can probably see – since he is such a wise sage – that the disastrous increase in spending of NATO countries will also lead to the collapse of this organization,"" Lavrov said, commenting on Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski's statement that Russia's military buildup would cause its downfall.

""Meanwhile, Russia – as President [Vladimir Putin] said the other day in Minsk after the Supreme Eurasian Economic Council meeting – plans to reduce its military spending and be guided by common sense, rather than imaginary threats, as NATO member states do, including Sikorski,"" he pointed out.

NATO countries have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, according to the communique adopted following the NATO Summit held in The Hague on June 24-25. The alliance member states will allocate at least 3.5% of GDP by 2035, based on NATO's agreed definition of military spending, with 1.5% of GDP to be earmarked for protecting critical infrastructure and networks, ensuring civil preparedness and resilience, stimulating innovation, and strengthening the defense industry.

US President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on June 20, said that the United States should not be subject to his demand for NATO member countries to raise military spending to 5% of GDP.","{'href': 'https://tass.com', 'title': 'tass.com'}","world"

Shooting occurred near the historic Stonewall Inn while bear spray incident happened in Washington Square Park

Two teenagers were shot and six other people were bear-sprayed at the tail end of New York City's Pride march on Sunday, bringing a violent end to the month-long LGBTQ+ celebrations.

New York police said the shooting occurred near the historic Stonewall Inn in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, where the gay rights movement kicked off with an anti-police demonstration in June 1969.

Police said both victims – girls aged 16 and 17 – were shot shortly after 10pm and taken to New York's Bellevue hospital. One of them is listed in critical condition from a gunshot to the head, police said. The other was shot in the leg and was reported to be in stable condition. No suspect has been identified, according to CBS News.

The shootings happened in Sheridan Square, which was teeming with revelers. Reports suggest that the daytime festivities were peaceful but, as night-time approached, the crowd of revelers grew rowdy and out-of-control.

“Saddened to learn about the shooting by the Stonewall Inn tonight as Pride celebrations were winding down,” New York City's mayor, Eric Adams, posted on X late on Sunday night. “During a time when our city should be rejoicing and celebrating members of our diverse LGBTQ+ community, incidents like this are devastating.”

He added: “We're praying for the speedy recovery of the victims in tonight's shooting. [Police] will work quickly and tirelessly to bring the suspects to justice.”

Police have not offered a motive for the double shooting.

About two hours earlier, six people were injured in nearby Washington Square Park after being hit with bear spray, which is similar to pepper spray and is used to ward off angry bears.

The New York fire department said that the six who were injured were hit with the irritant at about 7.50pm and evaluated for minor injuries. Police later posted on social media saying: “An individual deployed bear deterrent. This individual is in custody.”

Details have not been released about the arrested person or what led up to bear spray attack, according to local reports. Police, meanwhile, asked the public “to remain calm”.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

Former labor minister, 61, won primary for leftwing parties with over 60% of vote ahead of November election

The Chilean communist Jeannette Jara, the country's former labor minister, has won the primary election for leftwing parties with surprising ease, beating out a more moderate rival to clinch over 60% of the vote.

The decisive upset makes Jara, 51, the candidate representing Chile's beleaguered incumbent government in November elections, set to face off against center-right and far-right contenders who have surged in the polls.

Because of term limits, the current leftist president, Gabriel Boric, 39, cannot run for a second consecutive term.

Jara, a lawyer and member of Chile's Communist party who was Boric's labor minister before resigning to run for president, secured 60.5% of the vote. The runner-up who had been considered a favorite – the former interior minister Carolina Toha from the traditional Democratic Socialist party – took 27.7%.

“Today begins a new path that we will walk together, with the conviction to build a fairer and more democratic Chile,” Jara wrote on social media. “In the face of the threat from the far right, we respond with unity, dialogue and hope.”

After Boric's 2022 election, voting was made compulsory, adding unpredictability to this year's race.

Preliminary turnout figures from electoral authorities showed that turnout was much lower than expected, with just 1.4 million people casting ballots. Chile has about 15.4 million eligible voters.

Although Jara's landslide win represents the rise of hardliners within Boric's coalition, analysts have described Jara as less dogmatic and more diplomatic than some of her communist peers. As labor minister, she earned praise for a program that increased minimum wage and reduced the working week to 40 hours.

She has earned comparisons to Michelle Bachelet, Chile's former center-left president and an icon of female empowerment who governed 2006 to 2010 and again from 2014 to 2018.

Paying tribute to Bachelet in her victory speech, she said: “She was the one who showed us the path that nothing is impossible.”

But Jara faces a tough climb to the top job. Recent opinion polls show the leftwing government declining in popularity at a moment of sluggish economic growth and rising fears over organized crime and migration in what has long been regarded as one of the region's most stable and prosperous democracies.

Those hot-button issues have helped mobilize support for Chile's rightwing candidates, particularly the ultraconservative lawyer and former lawmaker José Antonio Kast, and set the stage for a deeply polarized election.

Another favorite on the right is Evelyn Matthei, a former minister of labor whose business-friendly policy proposals have charmed investors.

More than one-third of the people in the tiny Pacific nation of Tuvalu, which scientists predict would be submerged by rising seas, have applied for a landmark climate visa to migrate to Australia, according to official figures.

Tuvaluan Permanent Representative to the UN Tapugao Falefou on Sunday said he was “startled by the huge number of people vying for this opportunity.”

Tuvalu, one of the countries at greatest risk from climate change, which experts say is boosting sea levels, has a population of 11,000 on its nine atolls scattered across the Pacific between Australia and Hawaii.

Since applications for Australia's visa lottery opened this month, 1,124 people have registered, with family members bringing the total seeking the visa to 4,052 under the Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union treaty, which established a “special human mobility pathway” between Australia and Tuvalu.

Applications close on July 18, with an annual cap of 280 visas designed to ensure migration to Australia does not cause brain drain from Tuvalu, officials said when the treaty was announced in 2023.

The visa would allow Tuvalu residents to live, work and study in Australia, accessing health benefits and education on the same basis as Australian citizens.

“Moving to Australia under the Falepili Union treaty will in some way provide additional remittance to families staying back,” he said.

By 2050, NASA scientists project daily tides would submerge half the main atoll of Funafuti, home to 60 percent of Tuvalu's residents, where villagers cling to a strip of land as narrow as 20m. That forecast assumes a 1m rise in sea levels, while the worst case, double that, would put 90 percent of Funafuti under water.

Tuvalu, whose mean elevation is just 2m, has experienced a sea-level rise of 15cm over the past three decades, one-and-a-half times the global average. 

It has built 7 hectares of artificial land, and is planning more, which it hopes would stay above the tides until 2100.

The former taxi driver turned crime boss became the prime target of law enforcement early last year after escaping from a prison in the southwestern port of Guayaquil.
Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa's government released “wanted” posters with images of his face and offered US$1 million for information leading to his capture.
In a country plagued by crime, members of Fito's gang, Los Choneros, have responded with violence, using car                                    



                                                                                Two former Chilean ministers are among four candidates competing this weekend for the presidential nomination of the left ahead of November elections dominated by rising levels of violent crime.
More than 15 million voters are eligible to choose today between former minister of labor Jeannette Jara, former minister of the interior Carolina Toha and two members of parliament, Gonzalo Winter and Jaime Mulet, to represent the left against a resurgent right.
The primary is open to members of the parties within Chilean President Gabriel Boric's ruling left-wing coalition and other voters who are not affiliated with specific parties.

BRAZIL

Bolsonaro protests trial

Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday attended a public demonstration in Sao Paulo to protest against his ongoing Supreme Court trial in the South American country. A couple of thousand people gathered on Paulista Avenue, one of the city's main locations, in a demonstration that Bolsonaro, before the event, called “an act for freedom, for justice.” Bolsonaro and 33 allies are facing trial over an alleged plot to overturn the 2022 Brazilian presidential election results and remain in power. They were charged with five counts related to the plan. The former president has denied the allegations and claims that he is the target of political persecution. He could face up to 12 years in prison if convicted. “Bolsonaro, come back!” protesters chanted, but the former president is barred from running for office until 2030.

SERBIA

Student clashes escalate

Thousands of people on Sunday set up street blockades in Serbia, angry over the arrest of anti-government protesters who clashed with police at a massive rally a day earlier, demanding early elections. Protesters put up metal fences and garbage containers at various locations in the capital, Belgrade, also blocking a key bridge over the Sava River. Protesters in the northern city of Novi Sad pelted the offices of the ruling populist Serbian Progressive Party with eggs. Serbian media said similar protest blockades were organized in smaller cities in the Balkan country. Protesters demanded that authorities release dozens of university students and other protesters who were jailed for attacking the police or for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government at the rally Saturday in Belgrade. Tens of thousands of people attended the rally held after nearly eight months of persistent dissent that has rattled Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic. 

CHILE

Communist wins primary

Chilean communist Jeannette Jara, the country's former minister of labor and social welfare, won the primary election for left-wing parties on Sunday with surprising ease, beating a moderate rival to clinch more than 60 percent of the vote. The upset makes Jara, 51, the candidate representing Chile's beleaguered incumbent government in November elections, set to face off against center-right and far-right contenders who have surged in the polls. Due to term limits, Chilean President Gabriel Boric, 39, cannot run for a second consecutive term. Jara, a lawyer and member of Chile's Communist Party who was Boric's labor minister before resigning to run for president, secured 60.5 percent of the vote. The runner-up, who had been considered a favorite — former minister of the interior Carolina Toha from the traditional Democratic Socialist party — took 27 percent.

INDIA

Snakes seized at airport

Indian customs officers in Mumbai said they have stopped a plane passenger arriving from Thailand with a wriggling cargo of live snakes, the third such seizure this month. “Customs officers ... foiled yet another wildlife smuggling attempt, 16 live snakes ... seized from a passenger returning from Thailand,” said customs officers at the airport in the Indian financial hub. The passenger, who arrived on Sunday, has been arrested, the customs agency said in a statement, with “further investigation underway.” The live snakes included reptiles often sold in the pet trade, and were largely non-venomous, or with venom too weak to affect people.

The former taxi driver turned crime boss became the prime target of law enforcement early last year after escaping from a prison in the southwestern port of Guayaquil.
Ecuadoran President Daniel Noboa's government released “wanted” posters with images of his face and offered US$1 million for information leading to his capture.
In a country plagued by crime, members of Fito's gang, Los Choneros, have responded with violence, using car

More than 15 million voters are eligible to choose today between former minister of labor Jeannette Jara, former minister of the interior Carolina Toha and two members of parliament, Gonzalo Winter and Jaime Mulet, to represent the left against a resurgent right.
The primary is open to members of the parties within Chilean President Gabriel Boric's ruling left-wing coalition and other voters who are not affiliated with specific parties.

The Taiwan Carbon Solution Exchange (TCX) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the European Energy Exchange (EEX), the main trading platform of the EU Emission Trading Scheme, in Germany on Friday.

The memorandum is aimed at helping the TCX build a transparent, robust and trustworthy emission trading market in Taiwan by leveraging the EU's experience, the TCX said in a statement yesterday.

During the signing ceremony, EEX CEO Peter Reitz said global carbon emission trading mechanisms are critical to achieving decarbonization and energy transition.

The EEX was happy to share its rich expertise in system design and operations to support the establishment of new mechanisms and jointly advance global carbon pricing and trading markets, he said.

The TCX said the signing was a new milestone in Taiwan's efforts to establish its own cap-and-trade emissions trading scheme.

Since its launch in 2005, the EU Emission Trading Scheme has become the world's leading carbon pricing mechanism, with the EEX playing a key role in carbon emission trading operations, TCX CEO Joshua Tien (田建中) said.

TCX is planning to pilot Taiwan's emission trading scheme mechanism next year, in line with the Ministry of Environment's policy road map, Tien said.

The MOU enables Taiwan to draw on the European exchange's extensive experience in market operations to support that, he said.

The EU emission trading scheme has already linked with Switzerland's scheme and is planning further connection with the UK's system, as it gradually expands toward a global carbon trading system through international cooperation, the TCX said.

Countries near Taiwan, including Japan and South Korea, have already established or are promoting their own emission trading mechanisms, and the MOU would pave the way for Taiwan's integration with carbon markets, it said.

                                        The rate of enterovirus infections in northern Taiwan increased last week, with a four-year-old girl developing acute flaccid paralysis, the CDC said                                        Two imported cases of chikungunya fever were reported last week, raising the total this year to 13 cases — the most for the same period in 18 years, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said yesterday.
The two cases were a Taiwanese and a foreign national who both arrived from Indonesia, CDC Epidemic Intelligence Center Deputy Director Lee Chia-lin (李佳琳) said.
The 13 cases reported this year are the most for the same period since chikungunya was added to the list of notifiable communicable diseases in October 2007, she said, adding that all the cases this year were imported, including 11 from

The indictments stem from investigations launched earlier  this year after DPP lawmakers Su Chiao-hui (蘇巧慧) and  Lee Kuen-cheng (李坤城) filed criminal complaints  accusing campaign organizers of submitting false signatures  in recall petitions against them.
According to the New Taipei District Prosecutors Office,  a total of 2,566 forged recall proposal forms in the initial  proposer petition were found during the probe.

Czech Military Intelligence director Petr Bartovsky yesterday said that Chinese operatives had attempted to create the conditions to carry out a demonstrative incident involving Hsiao, going as far as to plan a collision with her car.
Hsiao was vice president-elect at the time.

Editor's note: The story was updated with comments made by Russia's Defense Ministry. 

The Crimean Bridge was temporarily closed late on June 29 following reports of explosions and active air defense fire in the city of Kerch, according to local Telegram channels.

Witnesses reported hearing multiple blasts and observing Russian air defense systems in action. ""Explosions heard in Kerch, Russian air defense is firing, and the lighting on the Crimean Bridge has been turned off,"" the Crimean Wind Telegram channel reported.

Ukraine has frequently targeted the Crimean Bridge over the course of the Russian full-scale invasion. Constructed after Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea in 2014, it is a critical supply and transport route for Russian forces to the occupied Ukrainian territories.

Traffic on the bridge was briefly halted, though it remains unclear whether the closure was precautionary or due to damage. Traffic reportedly resumed just over an hour later.

Russia's Defense Ministry said on June 30 that its air defense systems shot down five Ukrainian drones overnight over the Sea of Azov. It did not report any damage in Kerch or to the Crimean Bridge. 

The incident follows a series of Ukrainian attacks on the Crimean Bridge. On June 3, Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) confirmed it had carried out a third strike targeting the bridge, detonating 1,100 kilograms of explosives beneath its underwater supports.

""God loves the Trinity, and the SBU always brings what is conceived to the end and never repeats itself,"" SBU Chief Vasyl Malyuk said in a statement at the time. The operation, he added, had been planned over several months and caused ""severe"" damage to the bridge's foundations without harming civilians.

Russian media later claimed a Ukrainian intelligence agent involved in preparing the explosive had been detained by the Federal Security Service (FSB).

The bridge, also known as the Kerch Bridge, previously suffered damage in Ukrainian attacks in October 2022 and July 2023. Despite these strikes, Russia has worked to maintain the bridge's operational status due to its strategic and symbolic importance.

Previously, she worked as a TV journalist at Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne, covering global politics and international developments. Anna holds a Bachelor's degree in International Communications from Taras Shevchenko National University and is currently an MA candidate in International Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS).

30 people have been killed and 172 others injured after a mass Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv overnight on June 17.

""Construction of the major pieces of equipment for the Paks nuclear plant is proceeding in Russia and France,"" Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, as cited by Bloomberg. 

Since June 29, the Ukrainian battlefield monitoring group DeepState has marked a ""gray"" zone in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, identifying potential fighting in this section of the front line. 

Witnesses reported hearing multiple blasts and observing Russian air defense systems in action. 

The move comes amid a major deterioration in Russian-Azerbaijani relations that followed the detention of over 50 people of Azerbaijani origin as part of a murder investigation in Yekaterinburg on June 27. 



The first edition sent on June 12 raised $16,500 in just four days for the Leleka Foundation, a U.S.-Ukrainian charity that procures medical supplies for those on the front lines.

Two high-ranking Moscow officials recently issued separate warnings about the state of Russia's economy.

Speaking at a press conference during his visit to Kyiv, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Germany is working with its defense industry, European allies, and the United States to urgently secure more systems for Ukraine's air shield.

According to Ukraine's Air Force, Ukrainian air defense hit 74 out of 107 drones launched overnight by Russia. 

""Russia's sense of impunity is the root cause of its crimes,"" Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote in a post on X. ""It's naive to expect a criminal to stop if their crime is forgiven instead of punished. Russia will hit your other cheek as well. And those who have lost no one in this war have no right to make such statements.""

The Kremlin said the pace of negotiations hinges on Ukraine's position, the effectiveness of U.S. mediation, and battlefield developments.

The number includes 1,070 casualties that Russian forces suffered just over the past day.

The visits come amid growing North Korea-Russia engagement across multiple sectors, including military cooperation.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe told U.S. lawmakers that most of Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium likely remains buried under rubble at the Isfahan and Fordo nuclear sites, two of the three key facilities targeted by U.S. strikes.

A screengrab from China's state TV broadcaster that showcased the details of a new ""graphite bomb"". (South China Morning Post) 

China's state TV broadcaster has revealed details of a new ""graphite bomb"" that can cause a ""complete loss of electricity"" across an area of 10,000 square meters, or knock out entire power stations, the South China Morning Post reported on June 29.

An animated video released by China's CCTV showed a missile being launched from a ground-based launcher and then flying to a target where it releases 90 small submunitions.

They then bounce on the ground before exploding amid a mock-up of an electrical substation. The video then shows electrical equipment malfunctioning.

The video of the new weapon comes amid heightened global tensions and the rising threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

China has also been a key ally to Russia during its full-scale war, helping Moscow evade Western sanctions and becoming the leading source of dual-use goods fueling the Russian defense industry.

Graphite bombs, also known as ""blackout bombs"" or ""soft bombs,"" release a dense cloud of tiny graphite particles over a target area.

As graphite — even particles dispersed in a cloud — is an extremely good conductor of electricity, any power lines or electrical equipment in the target area will be short-circuited.

Such an attack on a civilian or military area will mean that any electrical equipment in that area will cease to function.

But released over a power station, the entire region it supplies will be affected as well.

Though a graphite bomb is classed as non-lethal, the effects of widespread power outages among a civilian population can cause casualties.

Graphite bombs have been around for decades and are known to have been used by Western nations on two occasions.

In 1999, NATO used them to target five power plants in Serbia during the Kosovo war, leading to instant power cuts across 70% of the country.

The intention was to take out the Yugoslav Army's radar and communications while minimizing civilian casualties, but the power outages also affected hospitals, public transport, and water and sewage systems.


""The military strategy of attack on civilian infrastructures is a war on public health.""
    

A subsequent report by the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded that the ""targeting of electrical generating plants, water treatment facilities, Danube bridges, railways and roads has adverse effects on civilian life, endangers health and seriously affects health care.""

""The military strategy of attack on civilian infrastructures is a war on public health.""

When asked about the weapon after the attack, Pentagon spokesperson Ken Bacon told the BBC: ""We have certain weapons we do not believe it is appropriate to talk about — and this is one of them.

""It is highly classified, and it's not a weapon we choose to discuss publicly.""

The U.S. armed forces also used graphite bombs during the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq, using its BLU-114/B graphite bomb to target two power distribution facilities and causing blackouts that lasted 30 days.

Though there are few details on the exact workings of China's new graphite bomb, there do appear to be differences in how they can be deployed.

The BLU-114/B uses spools of carbon-fiber wire, which are dispersed over the target area. When these come into contact with a high voltage, they then vaporize into a fine cloud of particles.

According to what can be seen in the video released by CCTV, the Chinese bomb releases submunitions that self-detonate in order to create a cloud of graphite particles.

South Korea said in 2017 that it had developed its own graphite bomb and was ready to deploy it against North Korea in the event of a war.

On the day of the June 21 bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities, U.S. President Donald Trump gave phone interviews to six reporters from multiple news outlets.Julia Demaree Nikhinson/The Associated Press

For reporters, it's hardly unusual to call sources on the phone to learn details or get quotes that will enliven their stories. Sometimes people will talk, sometimes they won't.

But the president of the United States?

In an almost unfathomable level of access, reporters who call President Donald Trump on his personal cell phone often get an answer – and an interview – from the leader of the free world on the spot. There's evidence that this is happening more frequently.

Paradoxically, it's the same president who popularized the term “fake news” and has battled against the press for years on multiple fronts. Just this week, Trump's lawyers threatened to sue CNN and The New York Times over their reporting on an initial government assessment of damage caused by bombing Iran's nuclear facilities.

On the day of the June 21 bombing, Trump gave phone interviews to Jonathan Karl of ABC News, Kristen Welker at NBC News, Reuters' Steve Holland, Axios' Barak Ravid and both Bret Baier and Sean Hannity of Fox News Channel, according to an independent database of the president's media appearances.

The next day, Trump spoke with Josh Dawsey of the Wall Street Journal – for all of 38 seconds, Dawsey noted – enabling the reporter to include a fresh presidential quote in the newspaper's story about the bombing.

“I find it utterly remarkable,” said Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush. “It's classic Trump. It defies tradition.”

Opinion: Trump's attacks on the media are eroding independent journalism

This spring, when he was denied an interview with Trump for an Atlantic magazine cover story, Michael Scherer dialed Trump's number on a Saturday morning. “Who's calling?” Trump answered. When the reporter identified himself, Trump berated him for past stories he'd written. But he didn't hang up.

Scherer explained the story he was doing. Trump answered his questions, and was gracious about it, he said.

“The president likes speaking,” he said. “He wants to share his story. I think he feels that the more he shares his story, the better off he is. He just has a totally different approach to the press than any president I've covered.”

In a subsequent story, Scherer and colleague Ashley Parker explored how the telephone is like a lifeline to the president. Many other people besides reporters know the number. Trump has kept using it even after being told around Election Day of the likelihood that Chinese spies had the ability to listen in on his conversations, The Atlantic reported.

Dealing with the press – and by extension, the American public – is a significant part of a president's job. But the interactions are generally much more formal and structured. That was the case with Trump in his first term, too; Scherer said the times he talked with Trump then, it was mediated by the White House communications office.

That wasn't the case when they talked this spring, nor when Scherer called Trump's phone for an interview the day of the military parade in Washington.

“There have been multiple times that people who work for the president have made clear that they weren't happy he was talking to me,” Scherer said. “But they don't get to make the decisions. It's his decision.”

Opinion: Donald Trump is winning the war against the mainstream media

Asked about the calls, White House communications director Steven Cheung said Trump “is the most transparent president in history, and we celebrate his willingness to fight back against Fake News media outlets who have shown a disgusting proclivity to lie about him and his administration. The American people are better served because President Trump engages with the press on a daily basis, and we are all so thankful for his leadership, which makes our jobs much more rewarding and gratifying.”

The calls almost certainly make the jobs of Trump's staff harder if they're not on the line, or aren't given a briefing by the president about what he said, Fleischer said. Still, he said, “it's who he is and the staff needs to deal with it.”

Karl and Welker are among Trump's frequent callers. ABC's Karl spoke with Trump by phone at least three times in June, according to social media and ABC reports. “I called Trump about 10 minutes ago,” Karl posted on X the night of the Iran bombing. “He didn't talk details or next steps. But he wanted to say this: tremendous success tonight.”

About the calls, Welker told NBC's Seth Meyers recently that “sometimes you just have to take a chance and it works out.”

The calls tend to be brief, often worth little more than a quote or two, said Brian Stelter, author of CNN's “Reliable Sources” newsletter. They hark back to Trump's real estate or “Apprentice” days when he could be depended upon by reporters for a pithy quote, he said.

“At the same time, if you can get the president by phone, by all means you should,” he said.

Opinion: Why the returning president is likely to become one of history's most consequential figures

NBC's Yamiche Alcindor spoke to Trump on June 23, reporting that Trump had said the bombing represented “a great day for America. It's a great day for the Middle East and I'm very happy to have been able to get the job done.”

That Trump even took Alcindor's call is noteworthy in one respect: The two clashed repeatedly at public news conferences during his first term, when she worked for PBS “NewsHour,” with the president once accusing her of asking a racist question. NBC wouldn't make Alcindor available for an interview.

On the surface, Trump is doing these interviews at a time of broad attacks against the media. His administration is seeking to shut down government-run news outlets like Voice of America, and strip NPR and PBS of federal subsidies, both because he thinks their news products are biased against conservatives. He's involved in settlement talks after suing CBS' “60 Minutes” and settled a lawsuit against ABC News last winter. He's sought to restrict access by The Associated Press to some presidential events.

His style of dealing with the media is the definition of unique, Fleischer said.

“Part of Trump's success is his raw authenticity,” he said. “He's unscripted. He's not a typical politician, and it shows every day. So [the phone interviews] fits with who he is. A traditional, typical politician and a traditional, typical White House staff would never do this. He's not typical. He's not traditional.”

There are transcripts or video, sometimes both, available for 89 per cent of the interviews that Trump gave during his first term. So far during his second term, roughly half of the interviews have such public records, said Bill Frischling, head of Roll Call Factbase, an organization that keeps track of presidential media appearances.

That drop is entirely due to the increase in phone interviews, Frischling said. So while Trump has been talking on the phone to more reporters, it also means fewer public records available to check what he said.

Scherer said he tries to be judicious in how often he uses Trump's cellphone, and he holds tight to the digits. “It's not my number to share,” he said. He can see a scenario where the number becomes so widely known that Trump will have to change it.

Until then, expect reporters to keep calling.

In an executive order signed earlier this year, President Donald Trump directed federal agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of children born in the U.S. who do not have at least one parent who is an American citizen or lawful permanent resident.Alex Brandon/The Associated Press

An explosive constitutional battle broke out over the weekend in the U.S., as the country assessed the impact of a Supreme Court decision that jeopardized the notion of “birthright citizenship” and inflamed all the passions of the Donald Trump era. 

The high court ruled Friday that lower courts could not “stay,” or delay, the implementation of executive orders or laws. The decision has immediate implications beyond ending nationwide injunctions, which has been used against executive-branch policies of both Republican and Democratic administrations but came into full flower in the Joe Biden and Trump years.

The lower courts had questioned the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship policy, announced the day he returned to the White House on Jan. 20. So the Supreme Court's decision opened the way, if only temporarily, to permit the administration to deny American citizenship to some people born in the U.S.

It's an initiative by the Trump administration that has roiled American politics and has the potential of altering the composition of the country's population.

Until Friday's ruling, it was a common assumption that the 14th Amendment's provision granting citizenship to all born in the U.S. was beyond debate. But, as it has done in a full gamut of areas, the Trump administration has taken what was a settled matter and, in the process, unsettled American politics. 

Trump administration ends legal protections for half-million Haitians who now face deportations

The Supreme Court's decision spurred fresh determination from the Trump camp to expand its drive against migrants, prompted indignant howls of protest from migrant-rights activists. It triggered yet another national debate on the Constitution, the prerogatives of the executive branch, and the policies of the President. 

The Trump offensive against all the assumptions of American civic life took special aim at the very first sentence of the post-Civil War amendment, passed by Congress in 1866 and confirmed by the states two years later: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

For 157 years, the interpretation of that language was largely immune to challenge, even though the context was the granting of citizenship to the enslaved persons who had been freed in the aftermath of the Civil War. The meaning was clear: Those born in the U.S. were, by definition, Americans. Even an earlier Supreme Court, in 1898, affirmed that notion, and for more than a century and a quarter, it seemed unassailable. 

But the new focus on immigration, and what the Trump administration considered the promiscuous conferring of American citizenship on the children of those residing in the country illegally, transformed a given to a right that the President and anti-immigrant activists wanted to take away. 

Many legal scholars doubt the Trump tactic, and argue that what the words say is what the amendment means. But the Trump administration argues that the context of the 14th amendment – part of a flurry of changes in American life after the Civil War that tore the country apart geographically, culturally, economically, and morally – means that the language reflected a specific moment in time and a specific circumstance. They argue that the 19th-century amendment doesn't apply to far different 21st-century circumstances. 

The irony is that many of those who support that position also embrace a “strict constructionist” view of the Constitution, urging in other cases that the words of the founding American document (which includes the 25 amendments that followed) are to be taken literally, shorn of context or interpretation.

The Supreme Court's decision actually said nothing about birthright citizenship. It merely argued that, as Justice Amy Coney Barrett put it, excesses by the executive branch can't be stanched by excesses of the judicial branch. That means that lower-court judges skeptical of, or opposed to, Trump policies cannot invalidate those initiatives.

The fact that the court test involved the Trump birthright citizenship case opened the administration to pursue its original intention, the denial of citizenship to some children of migrants and to make them vulnerable to deportation. This was an especially important target to the administration because of its view that large numbers of migrants were having children in the U.S., or coming to the country, for the express purpose of rendering their children American citizens.

A May study by the Migration Policy Institute at Penn State University found that, if Mr. Trump prevailed, about 255,000 children born on U.S. soil each year would be denied American citizenship.

The Supreme Court likely will rule on birthright citizenship in its next term, which begins in October, though it is possible some of the suits already filed may prompt it to make a swifter ruling. 

Opinion: The missing pieces migrants leave behind

The Trump administration must wait about a month before taking action in the 28 states that haven't challenged the President's order. Opponents of the policy didn't wait to take legal action. The court challenges came first from New Hampshire and New Jersey, but other states likely will follow, taking advantage of the fact the Supreme Court's decision offered another opening for action. 

It's an analogue to the opening granted to the Trump administration. The Supreme Court ruled that class-action suits could be filed in federal district courts that might, in specific geographical areas, bar enforcement of the Trump order. 

This issue has been confined thus far to the executive and judicial branches. But shortly after the Trump executive order, legislation was filed on Capitol Hill that would grant citizenship only to children born to a parent who is a U.S. citizen or national, to a lawful permanent resident living in the country, or to a non-American legally admitted to the country performing active service in the armed services. No congressional action has been taken.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Glastonbury organizers said on Sunday they were appalled by on-stage chanting against the Israeli military during a performance at the festival by punk-rap duo Bob Vylan.

Britain's BBC said it regretted not stopping the livestream of punk-rap duo Bob Vylan's set at Glastonbury after the performance included chants against the Israeli military, drawing condemnation from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The BBC has come under fire for allowing the performance to be shown live on Saturday as a Bob Vylan member led the crowd in chanting “death, death to the IDF,” a reference to the Israel Defense Forces, following chants of “free, free Palestine.”

The BBC, which broadcasts the festival in southwest England, issued a warning on screen while the set was being streamed online, but said on Monday it should have gone further.

The comments were “utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves,” the national broadcaster said in a statement. 

“The team were dealing with a live situation but with hindsight we should have pulled the stream during the performance,” the BBC added. “We regret this did not happen.”

The BBC said it would look at its guidance around live events so that in future its teams were clear on what is acceptable content to be shown.

Two firefighters deployed to a fire near Coeur d'Alene, in the northwestern state of Idaho, have been shot dead in an ambush. The suspected gunman, who is thought to have acted alone, has also been found dead.

At least two people were killed Sunday after shots were fired at firefighters who were tackling a blaze near the city of Coeur d'Alene in the northwestern US state of Idaho, officials said.

US authorities said late on Sunday that one suspected shooter had been found dead and is believed to have acted alone.

""Based on preliminary information we believe that was the only shooter,"" Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris told a news conference, adding ""there is no threat to the community at this time.""

The Kootenai County Sheriff's Office said the firefighters had been deployed to the blaze at Canfield Mountain at around 1:30 p.m. local time (19:30 GMT).

Norris said police responding to the incident were ""still taking sniper fire"" on Sunday afternoon.

Initially, authorities were not sure how many snipers were involved in the ambush.

Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said firefighters first responded to a report of a brush fire at Canfield Mountain, an area that is popular with hikers and cyclists. 

He said someone started shooting at them when they arrived, with the fire seemingly being set to lure them into an ambush.

A spokesperson with Kootenai Health later confirmed that three injured people were transported to the hospital.

Two of them, both firefighters, were dead on arrival, while a third, also a firefighter, made it through surgery and was ""fighting for his life,"" according to Norris. 

Police who rushed to the scene began searching for the shooter in hilly terrain that offered plenty of cover amid undergrowth and trees, particularly with smoke from the nearby fire also obscuring any clear view, he said.

The dead suspect was reportedly found using cell phone data.

Dozens of people have been detained in Turkey's largest city, Istanbul, and police blocked key parts of the city as the LGBTQ+ community attempted to hold a Pride parade.

Police in Istanbul on Sunday blocked attempts to hold a banned LGBTQ+ Pride demonstration, detaining more than 50 people who tried to march, according to activists and an opposition politician.

Istanbul Pride has been banned annually by Turkish authorities since 2015, including this year.

The governor of Istanbul had earlier banned the LGBTQ+ community from holding a Pride Parade, saying it ""undermines social peace, family structure, and moral values.""

A strong police presence in key areas of the city prevented large gatherings. Officers were seen clashing with activists holding rainbow flags in the city center.

""The palace regime cannot maintain power by demonizing the LGBTQ community,"" Kezban Konukcu, a lawmaker from the opposition DEM Party who attended the march, said.

Homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey, but President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has adopted an increasingly harsh rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community over the past decade.

In January, Erdogan declared 2025 the ""Year of the Family,"" describing Turkey's declining birth rate as an existential threat and accusing the LGBTQ+ movement of threatening the traditional family.

""The primary goal of the gender neutralization policies, in which LGBT is used as a battering ram, is the family and the sanctity of the family institution,"" he said at the time.

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have warned that the government's rhetoric and actions are creating a hostile environment for LGBTQ+ people, leading to increased discrimination and violence.

Germany's Social Democratic Party says first legal steps should be taken to ban the far-right AfD party as unconstitutional. Conservative lawmakers are less keen on the idea.

A number of Germany's conservative lawmakers have called for a cautious approach after the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the junior coalition partner, on Sunday passed a motion calling for preparations to ban the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.

The debate on whether to ban the AfD, which forms the strongest opposition force in parliament, has gained momentum after it was reclassified by Germany's domestic intelligence agency in May as a ""confirmed right-wing extremist"" group — an assessment that is now under court review after a legal challenge by the party.

The SPD motion put forward at the close of its three-day congress in Berlin calls on the relevant constitutional bodies to lay the groundwork for filing a case to declare the anti-immigrant AfD unconstitutional.

""The moment at which domestic intelligence says this is a confirmed right-wing extremist party, there is no more room for tactics,"" party co-leader Lars Klingbeil, who also serves as finance minister and vice chancellor in the conservative-led government, said at the congress.

The text of the motion reads: ""Now is the time for the constitutional bodies entitled to do so to create the conditions for immediately filing a motion to determine the unconstitutionality of the AfD."" 

German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, a member of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which leads the coalition, on Sunday threw cold water on the motion. 

Speaking to the ""Table.Today"" podcast, Dobrindt said, ""Decisions made at the SPD party conference are not yet a mandate for the interior minister.""

Dobrindt instead called for a cautious approach and for allowing the legal process to play out.

He said a working group of interior ministers from the German states will address the AfD issue if the ""right-wing extremist"" designation is upheld in court.

The working group is awaiting a ruling from the Cologne Administrative Court on whether it agrees with the ""extremist"" designation.

Dobrindt, as well as Chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU), have previously said they are skeptical of banning the AfD, which is known for its nationalist, anti-immigration, anti-Muslim and eurosceptic policies.

Chancellery head Thorsten Frei, from Merz's CDU, also said that he felt that a ban could not be justified, conceding that ""there are many good reasons for one.""

He told broadcaster ARD that a ban should not be pursued unless there is absolute certainty on the matter.

""That is why I urge caution. The AfD must be fought with political means,"" he said.

Two firefighters were killed and another was wounded when they were ambushed by sniper fire while battling a blaze in Idaho on Sunday.

Emergency service crews faced barrages of gunfire over several hours in an attack that the state's governor called a “heinous” assault.

Firefighters responded to a wildfire at Canfield Mountain, near Coeur d'Alene, around 1.30pm local time (9.30pm BST) and gunshots were reported about half an hour later, the Kootenai county sheriff's office said.

Sheriff Bob Norris said the sniper had used high-powered sporting rifles to fire rapidly at first responders

The suspect had been hiding in the rugged terrain, Mr Norris said, and he instructed deputies to fire back.

He said: “I'm hoping that somebody has a clear shot and is able to neutralise, because they're not at this point in time showing any evidence of wanting to surrender.”

A few hours later, police said that a man had been found dead with a firearm nearby on the mountain, prompting authorities to lift a lockdown at the scene.

The suspect was identified as Wess Roley, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Monday.

However, the sheriff's office cautioned residents because the fire was still burning.

Police are investigating whether the blaze could have been intentionally set in order to lure first responders to the scene.

Coeur d'Alene is a city of 55,000 residents near the border with Washington. Canfield Mountain is a popular hiking and biking area on the city's outskirts, covered with trees and trails that lead into a national forest.

Three victims were brought to Kootenai Health, according to Kim Anderson, a hospital spokesman. Two were dead on arrival and the third was being treated for injuries.

Brad Little, the governor of Idaho, wrote on X: “This is a heinous direct assault on our brave firefighters.

“I ask all Idahoans to pray for them and their families.”

The Idaho House Republican Leadership said in a statement: “We are horrified by the murder of two firefighters in Coeur d'Alene, and shocked by such a vicious attack on our first responders. We are praying for them, the injured, their families and their colleagues.”

Earlier, the sheriff's office in neighbouring Soshone County said on Facebook that authorities were “dealing with an active shooter situation where the shooter is still at large”.

Dan Bognino, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) deputy director said in a post on X: “FBI assets are headed to the scene in Coeur d'Alene to provide tactical and operational support. It is an active scene.”

A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, is “actively monitoring the situation in Coeur d'Alene”.

Mamdani has proposed raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy in New York City.

Zohran Mamdani has said that billionaires shouldn't exist, repeating a longtime goal of the left as he affirmed his commitment to equality instead in an interview on Sunday.

“You are a self-described democratic socialist. Do you think billionaires have a right to exist?” asked the NBC host, Kristen Welker, weirdly echoing the language used by pundits when discussing Israel.

“I don't think that we should have billionaires, because, frankly, it is so much money in a moment of such inequality,” Mamdani responded. “And, ultimately, what we need more of is equality across our city and our state and across our country. And I look forward to work with everyone, including billionaires, to make a city that is fairer for all of them.”

Mamdani's viewpoint is one shared by many on the left, including politicians like Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont), who have proposed policies like a wealth tax in order to ensure that billionaires pay their fair share back into society. 

Polls have found that such proposals are extremely popular across the political spectrum. However, the right has been fear mongering about Mamdani's political stances, with figures like President Donald Trump painting him as a radical communist — clearly as an insult meant to invoke the Red Scare.

“I already have to get used to the fact that the president is going to talk about how I look, how I sound, where I'm from, who I am — ultimately because he wants to distract from what I'm fighting for. And I'm fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower that he has since then betrayed,” Mamdani said, after the host asked if he identifies as a communist.

“When we talk about my politics, I call myself a democratic socialist in many ways inspired by the words of Dr. King, from decades ago, he said: Call it democracy, call it democratic socialism, but there must be a better distribution of wealth for all God's children within this country,” he went on.

Mamdani has shaken up the political world in just a few months, elevating the New York City mayoral race to one of national intrigue as the openly left-wing, pro-Palestine candidate has captured a remarkable level of popularity. 

Mamdani's platform is centered around affordability in New York, with proposals like universal child care, establishing city-run grocery stores, and building affordable housing. To pay for these plans, he has proposed raising the state corporate tax rate and placing a 2 percent tax on those making above $1 million annually in New York City.

Both major parties have turned to billionaires in recent years for support for their campaigns, often in a barely-veiled quid pro quo for lawmakers to support tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. This potentially explains why numerous Democrats, including leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-New York), are holding back on backing Mamdani, despite his historic campaign.

At a time when enthusiasm for the Democratic Party establishment is waning, Mamdani's campaign has been credited with spurring massive turnout, effectively creating a voter base where one didn't exist before; according to The New York Times, in the two weeks before the election last week, 37,000 people registered to vote, compared to 3,000 people in the last mayoral primary for the city. This rise is largely credited to Mamdani's campaign, with voters aged 18 to 34 turning out in higher numbers than any other age group.

Still, many establishment Democrats are aligning themselves with Trump in opposing Mamdani's agenda in order to punch left.

A source within the government tells journalist Erin Reed they believe the noncompliance is intentional.

Two weeks after a federal ruling affirmed that transgender people can update the gender markers on their passports — a policy that had been in place for years before the Trump administration began reversing those updates — the federal government appears to be defying the court order. Now, a source within the government familiar with the process tells Erin In The Morning they believe the non-compliance is intentional. According to the source, the administration could resume processing gender marker updates immediately, but instead appears to be deliberately stalling implementation in a refusal to comply with the court order.

On June 17, a federal judge overseeing the challenge to former President Trump's passport restrictions for transgender people granted class certification, expanding a previous ruling that deemed the policy likely unconstitutional. The judge had earlier found that the ban “conveys a fundamental moral disapproval of transgender Americans” and constitutes a clear expression of animus, likely violating the Equal Protection Clause. With the new order in effect immediately, the ruling now applies to all transgender individuals seeking to apply for or renew a passport with an accurate gender marker.

However, two weeks after the ruling, transgender individuals are still unable to update their passports. Requests for gender marker changes are reportedly being held indefinitely, effectively barring travel unless applicants accept documents that reflect an incorrect gender — directly contradicting the court's order. A government official close to the process tells Erin in the Morning the delay appears to be intentional and in violation of the ruling.

In a June 25th filing with the federal court, the ACLU states, “Defendants have not complied and are refusing to provide meaningful information to Plaintiffs about when they will be in compliance or what steps they have purportedly taken to comply…. Defendants have not meaningfully responded to those questions despite class counsel's repeated attempts to obtain this basic information…. Defendants are plainly in violation of the Preliminary Injunction.”

The filing details multiple instances in which passport offices have refused to process gender marker updates for transgender applicants despite the court ruling. At one office in Vermont, officials told a transgender applicant there was “nothing they could do” until further guidance was issued. In Seattle, agents were reportedly instructed to “neither approve nor deny” such requests, effectively placing them on indefinite hold. A passport office in New Hampshire allegedly told an applicant, “We are not intending to comply with the injunction. We have been told to only follow the President's Executive Order, unless the Supreme Court directs otherwise.” In San Francisco, a supervisor reportedly responded to a question about following the court order by saying, “We don't answer to courts.” When the applicant asked, “You're telling me you don't have to follow the law?” the supervisor replied, “We don't.”

The intentional noncompliance with a court order on identity documents is not unprecedented when it comes to transgender rights in the United States. In 2022, Montana's governor openly defied a court order requiring the state to allow gender marker updates on birth certificates, sparking a legal battle that dragged on for years. But the scope of the federal passport ruling is far broader — noncompliance at the national level now affects tens of thousands of transgender people who need accurate passports to travel.

The ACLU's motion to compel compliance with the court order remains pending. In the meantime, transgender individuals seeking to update the gender marker on their passports are advised to consult the ACLU's guidance. The organization has released a detailed FAQ to help navigate the process, available here.

When India's 2024 general election results were announced a year ago, they surprised almost everyone. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party—which was expected to win its third straight parliamentary majority—took less than 240 of the country's 545 seats. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised his supporters a supermajority in parliament; instead, he was forced into a coalition with other parties. It is the first time Modi has ever had to depend on politicians from outside the BJP to prop up his government.

The election results were, naturally, celebrated by India's opposition. They were also celebrated by millions of ordinary Indians who have been repressed by Modi's Hindu nationalist policies. As prime minister, Modi revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the country's only Muslim-majority state. He enacted a series of citizenship laws that discriminate against Muslims. And his government constructed a temple to Ram on the site of a former mosque in Ayodhya, the mythical birthplace of the eponymous hero of a Hindu epic. Modi's most recent campaign celebrated these achievements, and the prime minister engaged in the trademark Muslim-baiting and Islamophobia that helped him decisively win previous elections. When he then failed to sweep the 2024 contest, liberals concluded there were limits to Hindu nationalism. The BJP, they thought, might finally be losing its grip over the country.

It is true that the election diminished Modi. The prime minister's personal charisma, traditionally considered an invaluable asset, appears to have lost some of its sway. But the BJP has won most of the regional elections that have taken place since the national one, including in places where it was expected to lose. It has done so without moderating its Hindu nationalist stance. Instead, its shift was tactical. Rather than relying on Modi, it began depending more on the 100-year-old Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh—its parent body and India's overarching Hindu nationalist organization.

In many ways, this is a return to the norm. The RSS exercised control over the BJP until Modi won an overwhelming victory in 2014. Although Modi is still ideologically beholden to the body, his political popularity ensured that he did not have to answer to it. Unlike previous BJP leaders, he did not travel to the RSS headquarters to meet the organization's leader. Instead, the RSS chief came to him. But no more: in March, Modi made a pilgrimage to the organization's headquarters for the first time since becoming prime minister. The most recent state election campaigns were not waged in Modi's name or image. Instead, they were waged by the organization's vast cadre of members, who went door to door to ensure the BJP's success.

The RSS's success should be a wake-up call to anyone who thinks that Hindu nationalism is waning. It suggests that any predictions of the BJP's demise were greatly exaggerated and that the party is hardly doomed without Modi. In fact, thanks to the RSS, the party may be stronger and more durable than ever. It has broad support. It is exceptionally mobilized. It is thus well prepared to dominate India for years to come, no matter who its leader is. Modi, it seems, is a mere mortal. But the RSS isn't.

At first blush, the 2024 Indian elections looked rather straightforward. The BJP lost 63 seats. Its primary rival, the Indian National Congress, gained 47. The country, then, appeared to be like any of the other states around the world where incumbents struggled.

But most of the Congress party's pickups came at the expense of smaller parties, not by flipping BJP seats. In fact, the BJP was not pushed back in any region where it was in a one-to-one contest with the Congress. Instead, the BJP lost almost half its seats in a single state, Uttar Pradesh, where it was bested by the regional Samajwadi Party. It lost those seats not because of mass anger at Hindu nationalism, but because the Samajwadi Party mastered the BJP's own template. Over the last 20 years, the BJP has consolidated India's smaller and less dominant castes into an electoral coalition by giving them a small measure of political power, something the Congress did not manage to do in its decades in power. The BJP accomplished this by sealing alliances with the smaller political parties that represent these castes and by providing lower-caste peoples with some electoral representation in its own ranks. The BJP then merged these so-called backward castes with its high-caste base, creating an electoral juggernaut that was hard for any opponent to beat. But the Samajwadi Party did it by providing space within its own ranks for backward-caste leaders and giving a substantial number of tickets to backward-caste candidates. It thus flipped dozens of seats.

The Congress, however, failed to appreciate this. Instead, it treated 2024 as a vindication and changed nothing as it geared up for state-level contests. In the October elections held in the northern state of Haryana, for instance, the Congress put all its money on earning the support of a single, dominant farming caste—the Jats. The BJP, meanwhile, consolidated its old coalition of backward castes, rallying them in opposition. The party won 48 out of 90 seats in Haryana's parliament, more than it had before, while the Congress won just 37. It was a major upset.



Notably, the BJP's campaign in Haryana made little mention of Modi. The prime minister's face was not in all the party's posters, as it usually is. The BJP's slogans and proposals were not built around Modi's speeches, as they typically are. Instead, the party relied on a substantial grassroots effort by the RSS to consolidate castes and turn out votes. RSS apparatchiks worked in small neighborhoods across the state mobilizing voters. Before the elections, the RSS replaced the incumbent BJP chief minister—who hailed from a dominant urban caste—with a politician from a marginalized one. These efforts ultimately pushed the BJP to victory, checking momentum against the party after its national setback.

The BJP followed a similar template to win the November elections in Maharashtra, India's second-largest state. Once again, the party consolidated the country's various castes into a single electoral bloc. Once again, it did so not by relying on Modi but on the RSS (which is headquartered there). Then, in February of this year, the party won in Delhi. The victory in the capital was particularly notable: Delhi is India's biggest metropolitan city, and as such, it usually follows different political patterns than does most of the country. But the RSS was able to import the caste politics of rural regions to dislodge the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party, which had won the prior two contests by focusing on education and health while adopting a flexible approach to Hindu fundamentalism. (The BJP was also aided by the Congress, which needlessly divided the anti-BJP vote by running candidates in almost all of the city's constituencies.)

The BJP, of course, does not solely depend on grassroots mobilization to win elections. The party has also advantaged itself by taking authoritarian measures—cowing media outlets, harassing opponents, and exercising ever greater sway over India's Election Commission. After seizing control of the commission appointments process and stacking it with loyalists, the body began picking voting dates and schedules that benefit Hindu nationalist candidates. The Election Commission has also become increasingly opaque, ducking questions about voter rolls and registration. But these factors were all present in the 2024 national election, where the BJP underperformed. The recent wins thus mark a bigger organizational triumph.

The Delhi, Haryana, and Maharashtra elections have shown that the decline of Modi is not the decline of Hindu nationalism. They have also reset the movement's internal power politics. Modi may still be the face of Hindu nationalism. But the RSS is now in command. It will not be subservient to the prime minister—or to any one person.

The RSS is likely happy with this reversion. The RSS helped create the BJP in the early 1980s, and it steered the party for most of its history. Modi began his career as an RSS apparatchik before being sent by the organization to work for the BJP. It was not until he, as prime minister, built a powerful electoral base that he was free to ignore the RSS chief and, eventually, direct the organization. This arrangement yielded dividends for the RSS, as Modi made many of its biggest dreams come true. But the organization never enjoyed being subordinate to an elected official. It thus saw the 2024 results as an opportunity to reassert its position. “A true sevak” (one who serves the people) does not have “ahankar” (arrogance), said the RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat after the setback—a not-so-subtle swipe at Modi.

Modi's secular opponents may enjoy watching the diminishment of Modi at the hands of the RSS. Yet they shouldn't ultimately be happy. The resurrection of the RSS actually leaves the BJP stronger than it was when Modi was the movement's leader. The power the BJP has enjoyed since 2014 could have been transitory, likely to diminish with the passage of the prime minister. But by building on the organizational strength of the RSS, Hindu fundamentalists have made their movement more durable. The RSS has spent its century of existence creating powerful networks that contest elections, host cultural events, and do everything in between. It has survived all kinds of obstacles, including four separate bans on its existence. The group is not going to disappear.



Tomorrow, if the BJP were without Modi, the Hindu right would maintain its control over Indian politics. The RSS has simply created an electoral machine unmatched by any party. It has stationed sympathizers deep inside the Indian bureaucracy and judiciary. It has gained control of almost every university in the regions it controls, remaking curricula to reflect its crude, Hindu-supremacist ideology. The chief ministers who now govern Delhi, Haryana, and Maharashtra may not be charismatic politicians in the mold of Modi, but from the RSS's perspective, they are something even better: faceless apparatchiks who have lived their lives within its anonymous confines and are committed to advancing its program. India's political and social apparatus, in other words, is increasingly just the RSS machine.

Anyone who seeks to deal with India must come to terms with the fact that, from now on, they will actually be dealing with the RSS. On a day-to-day basis, this might not seem significant. But overall, it will mean a more nationalistic New Delhi. During the recent Indian-Pakistani conflict, for example, the ideology and rhetoric espoused by Indian policymakers could have come from any RSS handbook published over the last 50 years. Going forward, India might grow even more belligerent, including when it comes to Kashmir. Among the most prominent RSS demands has been to capture the part of Kashmir under Pakistani control, or what India terms “Pakistan Occupied Kashmir.” Doing so is part of an RSS vision for a greater India in which New Delhi reaches out and occupies part of its neighborhood.

That idea might seem fanciful. But so were many RSS proposals that have now become real. With the organization still dominant, a Hindu nationalist foreign policy may be something India's neighbors—and everyone else—will have to contend with. The country, after all, does not appear poised to change course any time soon.

            Norway's national lottery has apologized after thousands of players were mistakenly told that they had won large sums in the Eurojackpot draw due to a coding error.
    


            Norsk Tipping receives the prize amounts from Germany in euros, then coverts them to Norwegian kroner. However, it was during the conversion that an error occurred and winnings were multiplied by 100, rather than divided by 100, the company said in a statement Friday.
    


            Norsk Tipping sent messages and push notifications to customers that showed the wrong, inflated winnings, before later issuing a correction.
    


            “Norsk Tipping sincerely apologizes to everyone who was notified of an incorrect prize amount,” it said.
    


            The company blamed the issue on a “manual coding error.”
    


            “No customers have been paid the wrong prize,” it added.
    


            In a separate statement on Saturday, Norsk Tipping CEO Tonje Sagstuen also apologized for the error.
    


            “I am terribly sorry that we have disappointed so many, and I understand that people are angry with us,” said Sagstuen in the statement.
    


            “I have received many messages from people who had managed to make plans for holidays, buying an apartment or renovating before they realized that the amount was wrong,” she said.
    


            “To them I can only say: Sorry! But I understand that it is a small consolation,” added Sagstuen, who later stepped down and was replaced by acting CEO Vegar Strand.
    


            The company then sent out another apology message signed by Strand.
    


            “On Friday evening, thousands of Norwegians were mistakenly told that they had won a large prize in Eurojackpot. This was an error that affected many and which we take very seriously,” it read.
    


            “We deeply regret what has happened, and on behalf of us at Norsk Tipping I would like to apologize to everyone who was affected by this,” said Strand, who added that the company was “working intensively” to make sure that something similar doesn't happen again.
    


            As no one correctly matched all of the numbers in Friday's draw, the Eurojackpot has now reached 377 million Norwegian kroner ($37.3 million), with the next draw scheduled to take place on Tuesday.

Brett McGurk is a CNN global affairs analyst who served in senior national security positions under Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden.



            Following American airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities last week, and then the imposition of a ceasefire, it's time to step back and assess what has changed in the Middle East, and the chances of translating military success into lasting strategic gains.
    


            In a national security crisis, what does not happen can be as important as what does. That is particularly true regarding the recent conflict with Iran. For years, analysts predicted that an American strike into Iran would result in an all-out war in the Middle East, hundreds if not thousands of American casualties, and a ladder of escalation that Tehran might ultimately control through asymmetrical means — such as militias across the region with weapons capable of striking American personnel and positions.
    


            I had thought those claims were exaggerated and a product of Iranian propaganda as much as sound analysis. That's been especially true in this crisis, which unfolded after a nearly 18-month degradation of Iranian power by Israel in response to Tehran's fateful decision to join in a war against its rival shortly after Hamas' attack into Israel on October 7, 2023.
    


            Today, we have not just theories and predictions of Iran's response to an American attack — but lived experience. And so far, it turns out the pessimists were wrong. Iran responded feebly with a telegraphed and defeated missile attack against a US base in Qatar, which served only to unite the Gulf states in condemnation of Iran. Iran's militias — from Hezbollah in Lebanon, already degraded after losing its own conflict with Israel last year, to the Iraqi militias under the control of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps — stood down entirely.

            Further afield, nobody came to Iran's assistance. There is a theory in foreign policy circles that an alliance called “CRINK” — China, Russia, Iran, North Korea — might band together in a crisis or conflict with the West. No doubt, this collection of states may form tactical and issue-specific partnerships such as North Korea and Iran supporting Russia in its war against Ukraine.
    


            But when push came to shove in the Middle East, with Iran suffering its greatest military setbacks since its 1979 revolution, these partners were nowhere to be found. China made clear that Iran should not think about shutting the Strait of Hormuz given its reliance on Gulf oil exports, and when Iran's foreign minister visited Russia amid the crisis, he left with only a benign statement from Moscow calling for de-escalation.
    


            Russia's assertive strategy in the Middle East, moreover, which began in 2015 with President Vladimir Putin's decision to decisively back the Assad regime in Syria, is in disarray. Putin made a decent bet that power matters above all in the Middle East, and that by coming to the assistance of Assad, he could translate such an assertion of military might into deeper ties throughout the region, including in Israel and the Gulf states. That plan did not work out.
    


            Today, Assad is gone (now living in Moscow having lost his regime in Damascus), and the Russians are barely hanging on to a presence in the Syrian port city of Tartus. Russia's fearsome air defense systems, known as S-300s, proved useless and easily destroyed by Israel's military systems, most of them provided by the United States.
    


            All of that — plus Russia's war in Ukraine, where it has suffered nearly 1 million military casualties and has never established air superiority over Ukrainian territory, something Israel achieved over Iranian territory in 24 hours — leaves Moscow both unwilling and unable to project power in the Middle East, let alone come to the tangible assistance of Iran.
    


            At bottom, what did not happen in this crisis demonstrates not only the weakness of Iran, but also the brittleness of an anti-Western alliance led by Russia and China.
    


            Shortly after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, I was in the Oval Office during a phone call between President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. The Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah had just opened a second front in the north, firing missiles and rockets into northern Israel. Netanyahu provided a blunt assessment of the emerging situation: In the Middle East, if you're perceived as weak, you're roadkill.
    


            Weakness breeds aggression, particularly for Israel, which for decades has had to deal with an Iran committed to its destruction. Iran has spent that time supporting terrorist militias like Hezbollah and Hamas to place what was known as a “ring of fire” around Israel, with an aim to steadily pressure and strangle the country. Israel for years had managed and contained these emerging threats, until October 7, 2023.
    


            As I've written previously, the October 7 Hamas attack, with its mass slaughter of civilians and taking of hostages, forever changed Israel's national security doctrine. It will never again accept the presence of Iranian-backed terrorist groups on its borders and — after Tehran's direct attacks against Israel from Iranian territory in April and October of last year — it will also strike directly into Iran when necessary. This is an entirely new equation in the Middle East, and one that in my view is likely here to stay.
    


            Against that backdrop, what happened over the last two weeks in Iran was a foreseeable consequence of its decision to join in a multifront war against Israel after October 7. Not inevitable, however, was the significant military success of Israel's campaign.
    


            In a matter of 12 days, Israel eliminated the top echelon of Iran's military, its leading nuclear scientists, its missile production facilities, and most of its nuclear facilities and sites other than those deeply buried, such as the Fordow enrichment facility or the storage areas of Isfahan. This display of intelligence and military dominance will resonate throughout the Middle East for years to come. Israel is now the dominant military power in the region, a remarkable turn of events from only 20 months ago.
    


            America's assertion of military power may also carry global implications. The B-2 bombers that struck into Iran were launched from the continental United States and dropped guided munitions that no other country possesses with pinpoint accuracy, down three ventilator shafts — all without requiring a regional platform or base.
    


            Deterrence in global affairs lies through the unique combination of military capabilities together with a perceived will to use them.  This assertion of force without then getting bogged down with expanding objectives and unclear aims will be noticed by other world leaders who might now think twice before testing the United States.
    


            Based on everything we know to date, Iran's nuclear program has been significantly set back. My former colleague Norman Roule, who served as the Iran mission manager for the US intelligence community, told CNN that he believed Tehran's nuclear program had suffered a “catastrophic blow.” Unfortunately, as intelligence professionals work to comprehensively assess what is left of Iran's nuclear program, this question has become politicized, with many Republicans seeking to back up Trump's premature claim that the program was “obliterated,” and many Democrats seeking to prove prematurely that Iran might still be able to quickly reconstitute its program.
    


            On a question like this, patience and caution matter, because even as assessments become more comprehensive, there may never be a “final” or definitive call.
    


            Let me explain.
    


            There are generally three levels of battle damage assessments, or BDAs. The first comes shortly after an operation and is based primarily on imagery that might be available immediately or within about 24 hours. The second adds additional information, such as whether munitions performed as designed, and whether specific aim points were hit. This assessment might also more fully assess overall damage to a target — from light, to moderate, to severe.
    


            The third level is different, and incorporates all sources of information, including signals intelligence, partner assessments and perhaps human sources. That process can take weeks and incorporates the views of multiple departments and agencies.
    


            The situation is even more complicated when assessing a nuclear program, and what Iran might do in response. Compare this situation with a strike targeting a terrorist leader. The assessment in that BDA is ultimately binary: The target is alive, or not. Even a Level 2 BDA might be inconclusive, as destruction of a building or a vehicle cannot guarantee elimination of the target. In a Level 3 BDA, there might be imagery of a body being removed, or limping away, or preparations for a funeral, or reactions from the target's counterparts.
    


            Still, it's a binary conclusion — dead or alive.
    


            Assessing a nuclear program, what's left of it and what might happen next is far different, nonbinary and laden with assumptions. For example, even if, as has been reported, Iran might possess a stockpile of highly enriched uranium, does it still possess the high-power centrifuges required to spin that uranium to weapons grade? And let's presume it does, are we confident that Iran would make the risky decision to install a cascade of centrifuges and move the uranium as Israel still controls its airspace?
    


            Do we assume this could be done without Israel or the US knowing about it — and then taking further action to destroy the cascade, as President Donal Trump has suggested he'd be prepared to do? Or do we assume that Iran is in such disarray that it's unlikely to make such a decision, or at least not anytime soon? Or that it's unlikely to make such a decision under threat of further US and Israeli strikes?
    


            Even in that worst-case BDA assessment of highly enriched uranium combined with a cascade of advanced centrifuges (unlikely, but for sake of argument), there would be more questions: Does Iran still possess industrial equipment to mold uranium metal, necessary for producing a bomb, and if not, how long would that take to reconstitute? And could Iran do so without Israel or the United States noticing and acting against such a step?
    


            Such assessments would be made through a combination of nuclear experts in the intelligence community — such as the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration — and political analysts primarily at CIA who study and aim to predict Iranian decision-making, as well as the National Security Agency with its unique expertise in deciphering signals intelligence, which can often be misleading.

            For these reasons, when you hear that Iran might reconstitute its program in “months” or “years,” keep in mind that any such assessment is based on assumptions that may or may not be right, including secondary and tertiary assumptions that may or may not be right, and that the United States and Israel can influence Tehran's calculations.
    


            Inside the US government over the coming weeks and months, there should be a two-way conversation between the intelligence professionals and national security policymakers to determine what might be left of Iran's nuclear program, what can and cannot be easily reconstituted, and then what policies might be required to help ensure the most dangerous elements of the program — enrichment and uranium metal — do not resume.
    


            Bottom line: This is not the time for a victory lap, which in the Middle East often comes back to haunt presidents. It's time for focused and determined follow-through.
    


            The military operation has likely set Iran's nuclear ambitious back significantly, but turning those tactical military gains into a strategic success will require a diplomatic agreement. It might be as simple as Iran truly living up to its commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, under which all of Iran's nuclear material and equipment must be declared and made subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Or it could mean a more comprehensive deal that forever prohibits Iran from enriching uranium, likely in exchange for some level of sanctions relief and international support for a peaceful nuclear energy program.

Exclusive: Details emerge of secret diplomatic efforts to restart Iran talks



            The aim should be the latter, and as I explained in my last analysis, the diplomacy here has a built-in deadline timed to the “snapback” of international sanctions, which both France and the UK say they are prepared to do in the event Iran rejects a deal. With the authority to snap back sanctions expiring in October, early September (around our Labor Day) is seen as a deadline for reinstalling the multilateral sanctions on Iran that the Obama-era nuclear deal removed, and that have remained removed until today.
    


            This is a card that Washington can effectively use in coordination with London and Paris to impose a deadline on diplomacy.  The longer Iran delays returning to the table, the less time it will have to negotiate a deal to avoid a renewal of sanctions and the possibility of additional military strikes should it choose to reconstitute its enrichment program.
    


            Now is also the moment to secure a ceasefire in Gaza.
    


            An extensive backchannel is ongoing to secure a ceasefire in exchange for the release of at least half the hostages still held by Hamas. Hamas has rejected these offers to date, but with all that's happened, there is a new sense of optimism that these talks can succeed. Trump himself on Friday predicted a ceasefire within a week. That would be great news, and should be the aim, though I'd predict an outcome may take a bit longer as the dust settles in Iran.
    


            There is also renewed optimism for an expansion of the Abraham Accords as Arab countries take stock of new power equations and may seek to enjoy the fruits of economic and technological cooperation with Israel, which is now viewed as the most advanced and high-tech power in the region.
    


            Over time, such a trend is likely, in my view, but not until Gaza returns to a ceasefire phase and is ultimately resolved. Israel is unlikely able to have its cake and eat it too, as the Gaza conflict remains an acute concern for populations across the region and few Arab leaders would be prepared to take the step toward Israel until they can have confidence that it is winding down altogether.
    


            So, how will this all play out?
    


            There is always a chance that the Iranian regime, now desperate for survival, does all it can to cobble together what's left of its nuclear program and dash for a bomb. It's important to protect against such a possibility, but it seems implausible — both with respect to what Iran might be willing and able to do given its setbacks, together with what Israel and the United States might see and stop.
    


            There is also the bullish case, that the American operation sets back Iran's nuclear ambitions for good and the region is now on the cusp of dramatic and positive events to include expansion of the Abraham Accords, and even a potential unraveling of the theocratic regime in Tehran, a historic change in world affairs.
    


            This version of coming events is equally implausible, as spoilers abound in the Middle East, there are no signs yet of an Iranian regime coming undone, and the system in Tehran will seek over time to regroup and reestablish its control internally.
    


            In my view, however, it is now more likely than not that the United States keeps Iran from seeking to reconstitute its nuclear program, helps secure a ceasefire in Gaza, and opens the pathway for an expansion of the Abraham Accords over time (years, not months).
    


            A senior Middle East official who I've gotten to know and trust over many years described this recent period and the degradation of Iran's power as creating the conditions for a new Middle East: more stable, prosperous, integrated and secure. His question was whether the Trump administration is committed to follow through on what's been made possible, pursuing diplomacy with the same discipline and skill as seen in the military phase.
    


            We should all hope and encourage the answer to be yes.

The measure, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” with the president's trademark provocative hyperbole, is Trump's attempt to engineer lasting change through legislation in an administration that is also wielding huge and questionable executive power.
    


            Senators will begin a marathon series of votes on amendments Monday morning after working through the weekend. Republicans unveiled several compromises to shore up the narrow party line majority, preserving a tight timeline that could see the measure sent back to the House — and then onto the president's desk by the holiday.
    


            The bill is significant for its own sake, both ideologically and symbolically. And its blend of vast tax cuts and reductions in social safety-net spending will have far-reaching political impacts for the country, Trump's legacy and the GOP.
    


            It codifies some of Trump's key goals — from financing his deportation crackdown to slashing green energy projects. The legislation, which offers new benefits to working Americans but more strikingly rewards the rich, is a snapshot of the transformation and contradictions of the modern Republican Party.
    


            But the bill — which is deeply unpopular with the public — is also part of the wider story of Trump's second term. Days after he bombed Iran; stopped it and Israel firing missiles at each other; and celebrated a Supreme Court ruling that will facilitate his aggressive claims of executive authority, passing the bill would exemplify the growing power of a president dominating and disrupting this era in the US and abroad.

Republicans face a ferocious ad campaign surrounding Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill'



            Because senators made major modifications to the original House bill, the high-stakes legislative dance may see significant pushback from far-right House Freedom Caucus Republicans concerned about its effect on the national debt. Any changes designed to appease this group could mean the July 4 deadline slips, and the bill may need to be reconciled with the Senate version.
    


            But the stakes for Trump are so high, and his control over the party's base is so complete, that the bill is highly likely to become law in some form. And a compromise on state and local taxes in the Senate defused a brewing revolt by more moderate GOP House members who will be critical to the party's hopes of holding on to its majority next year.
    


            Republicans argue that the centerpiece bill of Trump's second term will honor the promises that he made to Americans in his election victory last year.
    


            “President Trump ran on this. He said we are going to change America for the better. We're going to make sure that hardworking people can keep more of their money,” GOP Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama told CNN's Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” Sunday.
    


            “We're going to make sure that we have secure borders, not just now, but for generations to come,” Britt said. “We're going to make sure that we have a strong national defense. … We're going to unleash American energy. And we're going to make sure that people who have been unseen are seen.”
    


            But Democrats blasted the bill's permanent extension of Trump's first-term tax cuts as a massive giveaway to the president's rich friends and warned that cuts to Medicaid spending will shatter rural health care and hurt working Americans.
    


            “What this does, and the baseline is all these cuts, all this cutback on health care, to provide the wealthiest in our country a disproportionate share of tax cuts, that just doesn't seem fair,” Virginia Sen. Mark Warner told Tapper. “The more we can get that (message) out — I think this will be a political albatross.”



            Which of these dueling political narratives comes closest to solidifying in the mind of voters could dictate the outcome of next year's midterm elections.
    


            This bill is the most tangible way for Trump to implement his 2024 campaign promises.
    


            Presidents always face intense pressure to enshrine their attempts at political transformation into law. Doing so is critical to repaying their core supporters and replenishing their political capital. Failed legislative leaps erode perceptions of presidential power in Washington. And while the bill has plenty of provisions Republican lawmakers may find hard to defend, they'd dread an exhibition of failing to act on the mandate they believe they were handed by GOP voters even more.
    


Trump uses executive power more broadly and questionably than any modern president. But some of those unilateral acts could be quickly reversed by a Democratic successor. Changing laws locks in a more enduring legacy.
    


            The “big, beautiful bill” is also critical to some of Trump's most pressing priorities. It would, for instance, unlock massive funding for the border security and undocumented migrant expulsion plan at the center of his entire political project.
    


            “We got a lot of people to look for, a lot of people to arrest, a lot of national security threats we know are in this country,” White House border czar Tom Homan said last week. “We need to find them. We need more money to do that, we need more agents to do that. For God's sake, let's pass this bill.”
    


            Another Trump priority is boosting the exploitation of fossil fuels and unleashing the production of new American energy. The bill ends many Biden administration tax breaks and subsidies for alternative energy sources under what this White House calls the “Green New Scam.” But Democrats warn the bill is a job-killer for an emergent US green energy industry and a gift to global competitors such as China and Europe.

            The bill also highlights how Trump has changed the Republican Party by showcasing the importance of populism and its limits. It makes good on Trump's promise to remove taxes on tips and overtime in a boost for working Americans touted by the president in his 2024 campaign. But the broader tax policy contained in the bill is classic GOP orthodoxy, meaning that the more someone earns, the more dollars they are likely to gain from it. This is in keeping with a new era of American oligarchs cemented by a billionaire president and his Cabinet of billionaires and millionaires.
    


            Independent sources also warn that — despite the administration's highly questionable claims that the bill and so-far hypothetical trade deals would unleash growth — the measure would swell the national debt. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the Senate version of the bill would boost the deficit by $3.3 trillion over a decade. This fiscal profligacy makes Elon Musk's attempt to defenestrate the federal government at the Department of Government Efficiency seem more of an ideological initiative than a fiscal one. For all the claims of saving money and curtailing the deficit, the “big, beautiful bill” makes a far clearer statement of Trump's attitude to debt and long-term national financial security.
    


            The most politically consequential impact of the bill could lie in its attempt to push more of the burden of Medicaid spending onto the states and to introduce new work requirements for recipients of the federal health program. Republicans insist the bill will secure access and make the program more efficient.
    


            “We are spending at a rate that we cannot continue. And, ultimately, that means that these programs would one day be insolvent for the very people that need them,” Britt said on “State of the Union.” “We want them to be safety nets, not hammocks that people stay in.”
    


            But not all Republicans agreed. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley secured delays in the implementation of some of changes to Medicaid before agreeing to vote for the bill. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis warned that many people in his state would lose Medicaid coverage under the bill and voted against advancing it Saturday, earning a Trump blast on social media. Hours later, Tillis, one of the few remaining GOP senators ready to criticize the president, announced he wouldn't seek reelection next year, setting up an even more consequential race in his swing state.

Republican plans to overhaul Medicaid are already shaking up the 2026 midterms



            The feud over Medicaid, as well as other cuts to nutrition programs for low-income Americans, offers an opening for a Democratic Party that has struggled to slow Trump.
    


            “By almost a 2-to-1 margin, the American people hate this piece of legislation because it's going to represent the biggest transfer of wealth and money from the poor and the middle class to the rich in the history of the country,” Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said on NBC's “Meet the Press.”
    


            “The Congressional Budget Office, nonpartisan, says it's going to kick between 10 and 15 million people off their health care,” the Connecticut Democrat continued. “And for what? To be able to afford a new $270,000 tax cut for the richest families in the country. New tax cuts for corporations, new tax cuts for billionaires.”
    


            “This bill stinks. It's a moral abomination. Everybody that learns about it hates it.”
    


            The White House denies it is cutting funding for Medicaid or nutrition assistance and argues it's merely cutting waste, fraud and abuse.
    


            But Murphy is right on at least one thing: Almost every poll on the bill shows that it's unpopular. CNN's Aaron Blake reported this month that four recent polls from the Washington Post, Fox News, KFF and Quinnipiac University had the legislation underwater by an average of 24 points. On average, 55% of surveyed Americans opposed it, while 31% supported it.
    


            This is one reason why, even with Trump's deadline looming, the passage of the bill is not guaranteed. The reputation of every major piece of legislation is dependent on the political battle that is waged to define it in the views of voters once it passes. This is especially the case because the perceived benefits of any measure often become apparent more slowly than its political reverberations.
    


            The bill is critical to Trump's prestige and authority, and will be greeted as a massive triumph by the president if it passes. It could also turn into a quick liability for Republicans — in the same way as the Affordable Care Act and the American Rescue Plan Act did for Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.
    


            But in an era of one-term presidencies and narrow House majorities, the political onus is increasingly on parties and administrations to use power while they have it.

            AlphaBot 2 wants to beat humans at their own game. When the robot is asked if it wants to play dice, it can interpret the question and jump into action – pressing the button on an automatic dice roller, which spins a die. It can even react to its opponent's score with a thumbs up if they win.
    


            The humanoid, created by AI² Robotics, based in Shenzhen, China, displayed its skills at the recent Beyond Expo in the Chinese special administrative region of Macao, where it played the game with attendees of the tech conference, including CNN journalists.
    


            The robot's ability to understand instructions was made possible by embodied artificial intelligence (AI) – the integration of AI systems into physical entities – allowing it to interact with and learn from the world around it.
    


            “In the last era of robots, people needed to program them to tell them what to do,” Yandong Guo, CEO of AI² Robotics, told CNN correspondent Kristie Lu Stout on the sidelines of the conference. “Now you just tell them what to do, and the robot can understand the environment.”
    


            Guo adds that it took the robot just minutes to learn to play. “We just show the robot what to do, maybe five to 10 samples, and the robot can learn.”
    


            While AI chatbots like ChatGPT have become familiar, many experts say that embodied AI is the next big thing in the field.
    


            Companies across the world are developing humanoid robots with AI, including Tesla and California-based Figure AI, whose investors include major tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia. 



            In China, embodied AI is receiving serious national support, including funding, innovation centers and even a robot school. Shenzhen alone is home to more than 200 companies focusing on the tech, according to local media.
    


            Officials see the technology as a potential driver of economic growth, and in recent years homegrown robots have gained attention for skills ranging from delivering roundhouse kicks to running a half-marathon (though not very quickly).
    


            Today, robots are already being used around the globe in industrial settings, like car manufacturing plants. Many robots are programmed to complete routine tasks, but things are shifting towards the use of embodied AI, says Harry Yang, an assistant professor at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. “As tasks become more complex, you need robots to see and understand and act based on different situations,” he says.
    


            AlphaBot 2 – which comes equipped with AI² Robotics' self-developed embodied AI model – already has customers across industrial services, biotechnology, and public services, the company says.
    


            At a factory operated by carmaker Dongfeng Liuzhou Motor Co. it loads and unloads materials, tows carts, and attaches labels to windshields.
    


            But Guo hopes that one day, it can step out of the factory and into the home.
    


            Today, most robots lack the technological prowess to be helpful in a household. Hong Kong-listed UBTech Robotics plans to unveil a $20,000 home companion robot this year, according to Bloomberg, but the company said the technology was years away from being able to help with household chores and to look after humans.
    


            That's because it's difficult to get enough training data to simulate the varying home environments people live in, experts say. But Morgan Stanley estimates that 80 million humanoids will be used in homes by 2050, as technology advances.
    


            Guo is already envisioning how his robots might be able to help consumers. “If you want to drink some tea,” he says, “the robot can know where to fetch the teabag can know where to get hot water, and how to pour the hot water into the cup and make tea for you.”
    


            That's not all. “After we eat, I hope our robot can clean up all the dishes for us. We love to cook, but we don't like to clean things up.”
    


            The reality Guo imagines is still a way off. Prices will need to come down. AI² declined to share a price for its humanoids, saying its robots are tailored to customer requirements, so there's no fixed price. Humanoids produced by some other companies in China cost just shy of $15,000 and within five years, the price of an AI² humanoid could drop to the range of an entry-level car affordable to a middle-class family, says a spokesperson.
    


            “The challenge here is that it's very expensive to make one,” says Yang. “Maybe you'd rather hire someone (to work in your home), it's cheaper and easier.”
    


            Safety is another major concern; a robot tipping over onto a human could cause injury. Experts have also raised concerns about the privacy risks of a home robot collecting people's data through cameras and microphones.
    


            Guo says that Chinese consumers have some anxiety about putting humanoid robots to use, and the company takes safety and privacy into consideration when it develops its products, but he adds: “You would be surprised to see there are so many customers in China willing to get robots.”
    


            Yang says that it will likely be about five to 10 years before humanoid robots can be truly useful in the home.
    


            AI² Robotics says in the third quarter of 2025 its robots will be launched at airports in major Chinese cities for tasks like organizing luggage carts for passengers. In three to five years, they might be ready for senior facilities, he says.
    


            The robots will be learning along the way. “We need to get a lot of data for the robot to learn, to have this kind of common sense,” he says.
    


             That could help the company get closer to its goal. “Our dream is to get one robot for every family,” he says.

Live Updates


• Authorities identify suspect: Investigators have confirmed the identity of the suspect found dead on Canfield Mountain on Sunday as 20-year-old Wess Roley, according to a law enforcement official.
    


Suspect found dead on mountain: The suspect is believed to be the only shooter involved in the deadly ambush on firefighters in Idaho Sunday, investigators said. Roley is believed to have started a brush fire before shooting at responding firefighters, the Kootenai County sheriff said.
    


            • Two killed, one injured: Two firefighters were fatally shot and a third was out of surgery and stable as of Sunday night, the sheriff said.
    


            • Fire still burning: The blaze that prompted firefighters to respond has scorched about 26 acres with no structures damaged, officials said. Residents were advised to be prepared “should further action need to be taken.”
    


            Idaho Gov. Brad Little has ordered that flags in the state fly at half-staff to honor the firefighters killed in the ambush on Sunday.
    


            Two firefighters were killed and one was injured after responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain, which authorities believe was intentionally set by a suspect who then opened fire on responding firefighters.
    


            “The entire State of Idaho grieves the profound loss of the firefighters killed in the shocking ambush,” the governor said in a statement. “Please join Teresa and me as we continue to pray for the victims and their loved ones.”
    


            The injured firefighter was out of surgery and in stable condition as of Sunday night, according to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris.
    


            Authorities have confirmed the identity of the suspect in the firefighter ambush as 20-year-old Wess Roley, according to a law enforcement official.
    


            Investigators believe the suspect intentionally set a brush fire on Canfield Mountain on Sunday before opening fire on responding firefighters, killing two and injuring a third.
    


            The fire at Canfield Mountain has grown to 26 acres as of Monday morning and a haze of smoke can be seen lingering in the area.
    


            CNN's Julia Vargas Jones is in Coeur d'Alene and shares that the smoke is still hovering over the mountain and the taste of ash is lingering in the air.
    


Check out the scene at the foot of the mountain:



            The blaze continues to burn and grew overnight to 26 acres, from 15 to 20 acres on Sunday evening, according to the Idaho Department of Lands.
    


            The brush fire authorities believe was intentionally set by a suspect who then opened fire on responding firefighters, killing two and injuring a third, has grown overnight.
    


            The blaze, now dubbed the Nettleton Gulch Fire, continues to burn and has grown to 26 acres, from 15 to 20 acres on Sunday evening, according to the Idaho Department of Lands.
    


            Firefighters are contending with tricky terrain, the agency said Sunday, with numerous snags and steep areas to navigate as they work.
    


            Firefighters responded to the brush fire on northern Idaho's Canfield Mountain Sunday, before the situation turned deadly.
    


            There's no such thing as a typical arsonist. People commit arson for different reasons, Ed Nordskog, an arson investigator with the LA County Sheriff's Department, previously told CNN.
    


            Psychologists point to some common characteristics: problems communicating, impulsive behaviors, difficulty expressing emotions and an interest in fire paraphernalia.
    


Roughly 20% of human-caused wildland fires in the US are set deliberately, but motives can vary widely. For some, it's a means to an end. These are usually the one-and-done arsonists, Nordskog said. It's the person who burns their car because they want the insurance money, or the business owner who sets fire to their office to destroy paperwork.
    


            In urban areas, arson occurs every day for a variety of reasons, Nordskog said, citing dumpster fires, car fires and people burning garbage in alleys. Many unhoused people accidentally set fires while cooking or trying to keep warm, he said. Mental health and substance use issues can also contribute to the cause of these fires, he noted.
    


            Serial wildland arsonists are rare, but they're “the worst of the worst,” Nordskog said.
    


                    “A true wildland serial arsonist has the power of an atomic bomb at their fingertips. No criminal in the world has that kind of power.”
                





            They tend to plan the event and take steps not to get caught, such as turning off their cellphones and using time-delayed incendiary devices, giving them time to get away.
    


            Regardless of why an arsonist starts a fire, they have no control over how big it gets. As climate change creates increasingly dangerous fire conditions, arsonists hold the power to do a lot more damage, experts say.
    


            Investigators are likely working to understand the motivation of the Idaho suspect who they believe started a brush fire before shooting at responding firefighters in what authorities describe as a planned ambush, a former intelligence official told CNN.
    


                    “Right now, behind the scenes, there's a lot of work going on to really understand who this individual is and what motivated them to carry out this attack,” Shawn Turner, former US national intelligence communications director, said Monday.
                





            First, investigators will be looking at “whether or not there was some sort of tension; some sort of strife, conflict between local law enforcement and this individual,” Turner said.
    


            Then, they will likely look into the whether the suspect held broader world views – such as anti-law enforcement or anti-government leanings – that drove him to launch the attack.
    


            The ambush appears to have been “a fairly complex attack where he intended to harm more people than he did,” Turner said.
    


            Turner, who said he spent 21 years in the Marine Corps, said he could hear the stress in the firefighters' voices, recorded in audio of the incident.
    


            “I listened to that, and I could hear in their voices the kind of tension that I would hear under very stressful situations in the military,” he said.
    


            Residents of Coeur d'Alene lined the highway on Sunday to honor two firefighters killed in an ambush while responding to a fire. The procession transporting the firefighters from Kootenai Health to Spokane, Washington, drew a large turnout from the community.
    


            “It was very moving to see all the people that came out. They just kept coming out. Even after the procession was done, people kept coming out,” Bill Buley, assistant managing editor for of the Coeur d'Alene Press, told CNN's MJ Lee.
    


            Many stood in silence, waving flags or holding one another in comfort as a stream of vehicles passed by, Buley said.
    


            “I think a lot of people were hit hard to think that this could happen — to their firefighters, the front-line guys, who are there to protect them,” Buley said. “Coeur d'Alene is a pretty small community. People know who these front-line guys are and hold them with a great amount of respect. So when this happened, I think a lot of people were really shaken and just really wanted to come out and show their support for the firefighters and for their families.”
    


            The attack, which took place near Canfield Mountain, has left the stunned community searching for answers.
    


            The suspect's cell phone was instrumental in helping law enforcement track and stop the threat during Sunday's ambush shooting that killed two firefighters near Idaho's Canfield Mountain, one expert said.
    


            “At 2:00, the firefighters called and said they had been ambushed,” Steve Moore, a retired FBI supervisory special agent, told CNN.
    


            “For the next 90 minutes … according to the sheriff at Kootenai County, they were responding and engaging the shooter with firearms. And that's about the time this phone stopped moving around in the woods. And so, either the responding officers or agents – whoever it was – they neutralized it. Or they caused this person to realize there's no way out and, at that point, they took their lives.”
    


            Moore praised law enforcement's swift response. “Either way, they had actually resolved this within 90 minutes. I'm very impressed. And the rest of the time was determining a safe way to clear that mountain … to get to the location of this cell phone, which they thought, correctly, was important evidence,” he said.
    


            The killing of two firefighters while responding to a fire near Idaho's Canfield Mountain on Sunday has shaken the Coeur d'Alene community, an act Kootenai County Commissioner Bruce Mattare described as “unheard of” and hard for residents to comprehend.
    


            “Thank God it's over. It's so tragic,” Mattare told CNN's Rosemary Church. “The people we lost were absolutely top-notch professionals. It's unheard of for something like this to happen in this community. People are still trying to process exactly what happened.”
    


            The firefighters were responding to a brush fire, later named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, when they were ambushed, officials said. The attack triggered a massive response from local and federal agencies, including the Idaho National Guard, which offered to provide a Black Hawk helicopter, Mattare said.
    


            “Our sheriff's office is top-notch,” Mattare added. “The overwhelming support from other jurisdictions was unbelievable. People came together, and we were able to stop the situation fairly quickly.”
    


            The attack has sparked questions about emergency response protocols. “You want to avoid having a knee-jerk reaction,” he said. “But because of the gravity of the situation, we have to evaluate all options.”
    


            Mattare also noted the community's outpouring of support for the fallen firefighters. “It's absolutely devastating, but the procession and the number of people coming out to show their support have been overwhelming. This is a great place to live, and something like this just doesn't happen here,” he added.
    


            The investigation into the attack remains ongoing.
    


            A man believed to have fatally shot two firefighters after starting a brush fire on Idaho's Canfield Mountain was found dead Sunday evening –– ending what authorities describe as a sniper attack on fire personnel and responding police.
    


            Law enforcement located the gunman by tracing his cell phone signal, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said at a news conference Sunday night. Officers exchanged gunfire with the suspect while he was at large, but authorities have not detailed how he died. He is believed to be the only attacker, Norris said.
    


            Roughly 300 law enforcement officials were part of the response, including multiple agencies from neighboring counties and the FBI.
    


            Here's what else we know so far:
    


            Fire crews are staging a range of resources to fight the wildfire law enforcement believes was intentionally set by a gunman in order to ambush firefighters on Canfield Mountain on Sunday.
    


            Aircraft, heavy equipment, water tankers, engines, firefighting crews and a specialized incident management team have been ordered and are expected to begin work Monday on what's been named the Nettleton Gulch Fire, according to an update by the Idaho Department of Lands.
    


            The fire, reported early Sunday afternoon, has grown to an estimated 15 to 20 acres, “with numerous snags and steep terrain,” the department said.
    


            “Crews were unable to access the fire until it was deemed safe, at around 7:30 p.m.,” the department notes, aligning with the timeline law enforcement has given for when the body of gunman was found.
    


            A man who on Sunday allegedly started a brush fire before shooting firefighters on Canfield Mountain in Idaho, set off a confrontation that mobilized hundreds of law enforcement officers and a massive emergency response, authorities said.
    


            By evening, the suspect was found dead near a weapon, Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris said at a news conference, assuring the public there was no ongoing threat to the community.
    


            Here's a timeline of the events, according to Norris:
    


            Kootenai County Commissioner Bruce Mattare described the shooting as “senseless and tragic beyond words,” expressing his condolences to the families of the slain firefighters.
    


            “We lost two outstanding professionals of the highest quality,” he said.
    


            The commissioner praised the sheriff's office's swift response in containing the suspect, saying it was “phenomenal.”
    


            “This is not who we are as a community,” Mattare said, adding that Coeur d'Alene was “a place that's comprised of caring people.”
    


            Kootenai County officials will not publicly provide identification details of the two deceased firefighters, Sheriff Bob Norris said.
    


            “Their families will need support,” Norris said.
    


            A third firefighter from Coeur d'Alene Fire Department is “fighting for his life, but he is in stable condition,” Norris said.
    


            The fire “absolutely” impacted the scene where the suspect's body was found, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said.
    


            “We felt like since the fire was approaching, we needed to scoop up (the suspect's) body,” Norris said, describing the scene as “compromised” but adding, “We had to do what we had to do to preserve the body.”
    


            Right now authorities are not releasing any information on the weapon found with the gunman, Norris said, pointing to the need for additional searches “once the fire threat diminishes.”
    


            “We don't know if there are more weapons up there that he had. There is a belief that he ran and shot,” the sheriff said. “There's a likelihood that when we are able to enter the scene again tomorrow without the threat of fire that we'll find other weapons that were placed.”
    


            The scene where the dead suspect was found is “contained” and “crews will be there all night” before the investigation continues in the morning, Norris said.
    


            The wildfire on Canfield Mountain has scorched approximately 20 acres, Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris said Sunday, but firefighting efforts were delayed by an exchange of gunfire. No structures were lost in the fire, Norris confirmed.
    


            Authorities believe the suspect intentionally started the fire as part of “an ambush,” Kootenai County Sheriff Robert Norris told reporters on Sunday. “We do believe he started it and it was totally intentional what he did.”
    


            Kootenai County Sheriff Robert “Bob” Norris confirmed the deaths of a firefighter from Coeur d'Alene and another from Kootenai County in a news conference on Sunday. A third firefighter from Coeur d'Alene Fire Department is out of surgery.
    


            “He is fighting for his life, but he's in stable condition,” Norris said.
    


            The man found dead with a firearm on Canfield Mountain is believed to be the only shooter in Sunday's attacks on police and firefighters, Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris said in a news conference.
    


            “We have one dead shooter,” Norris said, while noting, “There is no threat to the community at this time.”
    


            “Based on the trajectory and based on the type of weapons that this individual had that we could recover, we believe only the one shooter,” the sheriff said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Only 36% of Democrats say they're “extremely” or “very” proud to be American, according to a new Gallup poll, reflecting a dramatic decline in national pride that's also clear among young people.

The findings are a stark illustration of how many — but not all — Americans have felt less of a sense of pride in their country over the past decade. The split between Democrats and Republicans, at 56 percentage points, is at its widest since 2001. That includes all four years of Republican President Donald Trump's first term.




Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults who are part of Generation Z, which is defined as those born from 1997 to 2012, expressed a high level of pride in being American in Gallup surveys conducted in the past five years, on average. That's compared with about 6 in 10 Millennials — those born between 1980 and 1996 — and at least 7 in 10 U.S. adults in older generations.

“Each generation is less patriotic than the prior generation, and Gen Z is definitely much lower than anybody else,” said Jeffrey Jones, a senior editor at Gallup. “But even among the older generations, we see that they're less patriotic than the ones before them, and they've become less patriotic over time. That's primarily driven by Democrats within those generations.”

America's decline in national pride has been a slow erosion, with a steady downtick in Gallup's data since January 2001, when the question was first asked. 

Even during the tumultuous early years of the Iraq War, the vast majority of U.S. adults, whether Republican or Democrat, said they were “extremely” or “very” proud to be American. At that point, about 9 in 10 were “extremely” or “very” proud to be American. That remained high in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, but the consensus around American pride slipped in the years that followed, dropping to about 8 in 10 in 2006 and continuing a gradual decline.

Now, 58% of U.S. adults say that, in a downward shift that's been driven almost entirely by Democrats and independents. The vast majority of Republicans continue to say they're proud to be American.

Independents' pride in their national identity hit a new low in the most recent survey, at 53%, largely following that pattern of gradual decline.

Democrats' diminished pride in being American is more clearly linked to Trump's time in office. When Trump first entered the White House, in 2017, about two-thirds of Democrats said they were proud to be American. That had fallen to 42% by 2020, just before Trump lost reelection to Democrat Joe Biden.

But while Democrats' sense of national pride rebounded when Biden took office, it didn't go back to its pre-Trump levels. 

“It's not just a Trump story,” Jones said. “Something else is going on, and I think it's just younger generations coming in and not being as patriotic as older people.”

Other recent polling shows that Democrats and independents are less likely than Republicans to say that expressing patriotism is important or to feel a sense of pride in their national leaders. 

Nearly 9 in 10 Republicans in a 2024 SSRS poll said they believed patriotism has a positive impact on the United States, with Democrats more divided: 45% said patriotism had a positive impact on the country, while 37% said it was negative.

But a more general sense of discontent was clear on both sides of the aisle earlier this year, when a CNN/SSRS poll found that fewer than 1 in 10 Democrats and Republicans said “proud” described the way they felt about politics in America today. 

In that survey, most Americans across the political spectrum said they were “disappointed” or “frustrated” with the country's politics.

MIAMI (AP) — A depression that was formerly Tropical Storm Barry dumped rain on eastern Mexico late Sunday as Tropical Storm Flossie brewed off its southwestern Pacific coast.

The weakening and ill-defined depression came ashore south of Tampico with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph). All tropical storm warnings and watches were lifted, but rainfall and a risk of flooding were expected through Monday.

In the Pacific, Tropical Storm Flossie maintained strength early Monday with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72.4 kph). It was centered about 185 miles (297 kilometers) south of Zihuatanejo and was moving northwest at 10 mph (16 kph).

Mexico's government issued a tropical storm warning along the southwestern coast from Punta San Telmo to Playa Perula.

A tropical storm watch remained in effect for the southwest coast from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. A watch means tropical storm conditions are possible in the area within two days.

Flossie is expected to rapidly intensify into a hurricane late Monday or Tuesday, then skirt the coast for a few days. While its center is forecast to remain offshore, moderate rain was likely in parts of Oaxaca, Guerrero, Michoacán, Colima, and Jalisco through early next week.

BANGKOK (AP) — Chinese factory activity improved somewhat in June after President Donald Trump agreed to delay imposing higher tariffs on imports from China for 90 days, but overall activity was still contracting, according to a survey released Monday. 

The purchasing managers index, which reflects new orders and other measures, rose to 49.7 from 49.5 in May, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. That's on a scale of 0 to 100 where 50 and above shows expansion. 

Other reports showed similar trends in Japan and Korea. 

Trump has said he's not planning to extend the 90-day pause on tariffs on most nations beyond July 9. The delay for imposing much higher tariffs on China, agreed to in early May, expires about a month later. 

The hiatus for tariffs brought a revival of manufacturing activity as companies and individuals rushed to take advantage of lower import duties. But that mainly helped large manufacturers, with small and mid-size companies' output still contracting. Hiring also fell.

New export orders and exports also remained below the 50-level that marks expansion.

In Japan, manufacturing output edged 0.5% higher in May, well below analysts' estimates for a 3.5% increase.

“The subdued rise in industrial production in May means that firms were not benefitting from sky-high U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, and their production forecasts point to continued weakness,” Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a report.

South Korea's government reported that its “all industry” measure of output fell 2.9% from a year earlier in May, with production of computer chips falling 2%. Production of vehicles fell 2.3% year-on-year, after falling 4.1% in April. 




In an interview with Fox News Channel's “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump said he's not planning to extend a 90-day pause on tariffs on most nations beyond July 9. The delay for imposing much higher tariffs on China, agreed to in early May, expires about a month later. 

Trump said his administration will notify countries that the trade penalties will take effect unless there are deals with the United States. He had played down the deadline at a White House news conference Friday by noting how difficult it would be to work out separate deals with each nation. The administration had set a goal of reaching 90 trade deals in 90 days.

Despite a recent trade deal with Beijing over rare earth exports from China, establishing a fairer relationship will require significant tariffs.

Details of the latest agreement to deescalate trade tensions are scarce and major issues between the world's two biggest economies remain unresolved.

“I think getting along well with China is a very good thing,” Trump said. “China's going to be paying a lot of tariffs, but we have a big (trade) deficit, they understand that.”

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the mission behind a new ICE detention facility in the Everglades as construction begins on 'Alligator Alcatraz.'

President Donald Trump will head to Florida on Tuesday for the official opening of an immigration detention camp in the Everglades that is surrounded by alligators, aptly dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday. 

""We have the president of the United States coming down tomorrow to tout what Florida has done,"" DeSantis said at a Monday news conference, according to the Miami Herald. 

""I think by tomorrow it will be open for business,"" he added. 

DeSantis authorized the construction of an illegal immigrant detention center on a 30-square-mile property in the Everglades' swamplands of Miami–Dade County under an emergency order. The property is a former airport that has been outfitted with sturdy tent structures to house 5,000 illegal immigrants amid the Trump administration's deportation blitz to remove the millions of illegal migrants who flooded the nation during the Biden administration.

The detention center earned its name due to its location in the heart of the Everglades, which is home to massive reptiles such as alligators and pythons. 

""This is an airport that's already there,"" DeSantis said Wednesday during an event with the media. ""Clearly, from a security perspective, if someone escapes, you know, there are a lot of alligators you're going to have to contend with. No one's going anywhere once you do that. It's a safe and secure as can be."" 

Environmentalists and Democrats have come out against the detention center, including lining up along Highway 41, which runs through the Everglades, to protest its construction Saturday. Protesters held signs declaring, ""Another stupid plan to abuse people & the Everglades,"" ""No Alligator Alcatraz"" or signs demanding ICE is pushed ""out of Florida,"" photos show.

Various federal and state agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security and Florida's Division of Emergency Management, were additionally hit with a lawsuit Friday spearheaded by a pair of environmentalist groups that claim the detention facility will disrupt and threaten the Everglades ecosystem, The Associated Press reported.

The Pittsburgh Steelers and Miami Dolphins reportedly made a trade involving All-Pro defensive backs on Monday with the beginning of training camp weeks away.

The Dolphins agreed to trade cornerback Jalen Ramsey, tight end Jonnu Smith and a 2027 seventh-round draft pick to the Steelers for safety Minkah Fitzpatrick and a 2027 fifth-round pick, according to multiple reports.

It had been known that Ramsey was looking to be traded. 

NFL.com reported in April that Ramsey and the team would mutually explore potential trade opportunities before the start of the 2025 season. A reunion with the Los Angeles Rams was at one time rumored to be a possible option for Ramsey. 

He won a Super Bowl there in 2021.

However, the Steelers appeared to have been in the market for ways to bolster the defense. Additionally, not only does the team receive the three-time All-Pro, but they also get a Pro Bowl tight end in Smith to add to the offensive depth and give Aaron Rodgers another target.

Ramsey had 60 tackles and two interceptions in 17 games last season. Smith had a career-high 88 catches for 884 yards and eight touchdowns.

The Dolphins received Fitzpatrick, who started his career in Miami. The New Jersey native was traded to the Steelers in the middle of the 2019 season as that year got away from the Dolphins.

‘The Five' co-hosts discuss the Supreme Court ruling on rogue federal judges, delivering the Trump administration a major victory.

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to take up a Republican-led challenge to U.S. campaign finance restrictions that limit the amount of money that political parties can spend on behalf of certain candidates. 

The case, National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, was originally appealed to the court by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and on behalf of two Senate Republican candidates running for election at the time — among them, now-Vice President JD Vance.

It centers on whether federal limits on campaign spending by political parties run afoul of free speech protections under the First Amendment of the Constitution.

In asking the Supreme Court to review the case, petitioners said the spending limits ""severely restrict political party committees from doing what the First Amendment entitles them to do: fully associate with and advocate for their own candidates for federal office.""

A decision from the Supreme Court's 6-3 conservative majority could have major implications on campaign spending in the U.S., further eroding the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, a law Congress passed more than 50 years ago with the aim of restricting the amount of money that can be spent on behalf of candidates.

The case comes as federal election spending has reached record highs: Presidential candidates in 2024 raised at least $2 billion and spent roughly $1.8 billion in 2024, according to FEC figures.

The challenge will almost certainly be among the most high-profile cases to be heard by the Supreme Court in the upcoming term.

The Trump-led Justice Department also said it will side with the NRSC in arguing the case, putting the administration in the somewhat unusual move of arguing against laws passed by Congress. The Democratic National Committee, Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, meanwhile, have asked to defend the decision of a lower appeals court that ruled in 2024 to keep the limits in place.

The Justice Department cited free speech protections as its basis for siding with the NRSC, saying their decision to do so represents ""the rare case that warrants an exception to that general approach"" of backing federal laws.""

Oral arguments will be held in the fall.

A Guatemalan national working under an alias was found dead inside an industrial oven at a cereal plant in Missouri last week, authorities say.

Nicolas Lopez Gomez, 38, who was working under the name Edward Avila, was located by officers, emergency medical services personnel and firefighters, the Perryville Police Department said. 

Officers were sent to the Gilster-Mary Lee Perryville Cereal Plant for a man ""stuck in an industrial oven that was shut down,"" police said. By the time they got to Gomez, he was already dead. 

The Perry County coroner was called in shortly after to assist.

Emmanuel Acho reacts to the growing concern around how the WNBA is handling Caitlin Clark. From intense physical play to mounting injuries, Acho questions whether the league is pushing her too far.

Caitlin Clark's popularity is the highest it's even been, and the second-year Indiana Fever player will only have more eyes on her as she continues to build out her legacy in the WNBA.

The rise in fame has come with some hard licks on the court. Clark was in plenty of skirmishes during her rookie season, taking bumps on shots and being on the receiving end on hard screens. So much so that she admitted to a busted eardrum and had a black eye at one point. This season, Clark was already knocked down in brouhahas with opponents.

Clark fans have suggested that the lack of protection for the Fever sharpshooter could lead her toward building her own professional basketball league. Christine Brennan, the author of ""On Her Game: Caitlin Clark and the Revolution in Women's Sports,"" talked about the potential of that happening in an interview on ESPN Los Angeles last week.

""Nike loves her. She's got Wilson, obviously. She's got Gatorade,"" she said, via the New York Post. ""Even though the salary's $76,000 for a rookie — it's more this year now — she's making $28 million from Nike alone, according to the Wall Street Journal. So she's at $40 million, whatever. OK, fine, she's doing great. And if Nike said, ‘We're going to make the Nike-Clark league,' it would obviously take a few years to get the arenas and whatever.

""But you know the TV contract. I mean, it's Caitlin. Again, the TV viewership, it's Caitlin Clark. It's not Angel (Reese) and Caitlin. It's Cailtin. It's Caitlin Clark only. And I think Angel's a great rebounder and excellent at what she does, but she doesn't move the needle on TV ratings. It's Caitlin. And they could do it. I think they could absolutely put it together in a couple of years. And I'll stay on that because I agree with you. It's fascinating, and it's doable because of the void in the vacuum of leadership the WNBA continues to exhibit.""

Clark didn't participate in the offseason Unrivaled league, but the league and WNBA players are set to enter bitter collective bargaining negotiations very soon.

MIAMI — President Donald Trump plans to visit “Alligator Alcatraz,” the newest illegal immigrant detention center in Florida's Everglades on Tuesday, the same day that the government had planned to move its first detainees into the site, the Washington Examiner learned Sunday evening.

Trump will travel to a remote, alligator-filled part of South Florida, roughly 50 miles west of coastal Miami, where he will see firsthand a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center that the state of Florida has allowed the federal government to erect in a matter of days, according to a senior administration official.

Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) announced late last week that he had taken executive action to remake a mostly abandoned airfield in Miami-Dade County into a federal detention site. 

Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier had proposed the project and touted that the tent facility would not require much of a barrier surrounding the site because if immigrants were to escape, “there's not much waiting for them, other than alligators and pythons.”

Trump's visit on Tuesday comes after weekend protests on U.S. Highway 41, known as the Tamiami Trail, which connects Miami and the Gulf Coast city of Naples.

Highway 41 is likely to see further protests Monday and Tuesday as Secret Service prepares the vicinity for the president's visit.

DeSantis first showed off the site in a media walk-through late last week and warned that “if a criminal alien were to escape from here somehow, and I don't think they will, you've got nowhere to go.”

“What are you going to do? Trudge through the swamp and dodge alligators on the way back to, 50-60 miles just to get to civilization? Not going to happen,” DeSantis told Fox News host Steve Doocy.

The site will be run by the federal agency ICE, not state authorities. DeSantis said the government plans to use the airport runway to fly in migrants brought from other parts of the state and country. Illegal immigrants who are deemed deportable may be flown out of the country.

The property is nearly identical to structures that the Border Patrol erected amid the record-high influx of illegal immigrants who came over the southern border during the Biden administration. The tents are massive in size and include large rooms for families, adult men, and adult women to be housed.

The facility also includes laundry machines, bathrooms and showers, and a dining area.

“This is being done by the Division of Emergency Management. So when we have a hurricane, we would actually have people stage here for hurricane response normally, anyways,” DeSantis said last Friday. “When we have all the linemen come in to do the power, we have to set up little little areas for them, and so you have all this type of stuff. So this is not our first rodeo.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

The Supreme Court on Monday wiped away a series of lower court decisions that favored transgender litigants, sending the cases back to the appellate level for reconsideration in light of the court's recent ruling upholding a Tennessee ban on puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors.

The 6-3 decision in United States v. Skrmetti, handed down June 18, marked a major victory for state-level efforts to restrict transgender procedures for minors. The ruling has now prompted the justices to vacate multiple decisions from lower courts in cases involving health benefits and birth certificate policies for people who identify as transgender.

In an order list issued Monday morning, the high court overturned appellate rulings that previously blocked state-level bans or coverage restrictions for transgender-related care in North Carolina, West Virginia, Idaho, and Oklahoma. The move means each case must now be reheard under the legal standard articulated in the Skrmetti ruling, which found no violation of the Constitution's equal protection clause in a ban on medical treatments for minors who identify as transgender.

The high court also declined to take up a separate appeal from Kentucky, where families challenged the state's similar law banning transgender procedures for minors.

In Skrmetti, the Supreme Court held that Tennessee's law did not discriminate based on sex or transgender status, giving states wide latitude to regulate medical procedures offered to minors. The ruling did not address transgender status more broadly, and it did not interfere with the precedent set in the 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision, which said employers cannot discriminate against people based on gender identity.

But as a result of the most recent transgender-related high court case, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals must now reconsider its prior ruling that North Carolina and West Virginia violated the Constitution by refusing to cover certain treatments for transgender people through state insurance programs. Meanwhile, the 9th Circuit will reexamine a similar challenge in Idaho, and the 10th Circuit will revisit its decision blocking Oklahoma from banning gender changes on birth certificates.

Monday's actions come as the justices continue to weigh whether to take up additional cases, including challenges to school sports participation rules in Arizona, Idaho, and West Virginia that restrict biological boys from competing on girls sports teams.

HOW THE SUPREME COURT SKRMETTI RULING RESHAPES US LEGAL CASES

A decision on whether to grant review in those cases could come as soon as Thursday, when the high court is set to release another orders list.

While Monday's order was expected in light of the latest precedent shift, it underscores how Skrmetti is reshaping the legal landscape on transgender issues and raising the stakes for appeals involving schools, healthcare, and identity documentation.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

President Donald Trump faces a major obstacle in keeping the southern border secure through his second term and into the next decade.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the federal agency responsible for guarding the country's borders, faces a possible staffing shortage in the lead-up to Trump's departure from office in 2029, one that could affect the security at the border and Trump's legacy on a keystone campaign promise.

CBP anticipates a sharp uptick in retirements among employees who joined in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. 

House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green (R-TN) warned that the problem is not to be underestimated.

“Many of the Border Patrol agents and Customs and Border Protection officers who joined the department in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks are reaching a mandated retirement age,” Green said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “This could cripple our border security mission if not addressed swiftly.”

A report published by the Government Accountability Office in Washington concluded that beginning in late 2026, “significant increases” in retirements in CBP law enforcement positions “could have significant effects” on the agency's ability to meet its national security mission.

The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents CBP's customs officers who staff air, land, and sea ports of entry, has warned of a “catastrophic breakdown in port operations if thousands of officers retire without anyone to replace them.”

CBP is working to address the tsunami of employee retirements across its components, but whether CBP can hire and retain employees to make up for the losses will depend to some extent on what Congress is willing to fund.

Congress created the CBP in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The new agency brought government agencies and offices with national security missions under one roof. CBP's Office of Field Operations has 32,000 officers and staff members who are responsible for screening vehicles, cargo, and goods entering the United States, as well as inspecting all people entering the country at ports of entry.

Border Patrol's nearly 20,000 agents and staff work between land ports of entry and at select coastal regions to keep people and goods from coming into the country without inspection. Air and Marine Operations' 1,800 federal police and staff serve as the eyes in the sky and on maritime patrols.

CBP was formed in 2003, when patriotism was high. In the first few years following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. military and law enforcement departments saw an influx of people apply, including thousands who chose to apply to work for CBP.

Those who joined CBP after 9/11 are aging out, facing mandatory retirement dates between now and 2030. The challenges vary depending on the component.

Border Patrol lost nearly a quarter of its workforce, more than 4,000 employees, in the 3 1/2 years following former President Joe Biden's election to office in November 2020, the Washington Examiner first reported in May 2024.

Matthew Hudak, the retired second-in-command of Border Patrol, told the Washington Examiner last year that many agents lost motivation and purpose during the Biden administration, arresting illegal immigrants only to release them into the country rather than remove them. 

CBP employees are eligible to retire at any age with 25 years of service. They can retire at age 50 with 20 years of service. At 57 years old, employees are required to retire.

Troy Miller, former senior official performing the duties of CBP commissioner under Biden, testified before Congress in April 2024 that the agency was in the process of coming up with a plan to address the various departures across its components.

“We need to focus on hiring,” Miller said. “We need to have a plan where we start hiring in advance of 2028, and in fact over hire in '26 and ‘27 so we don't have a 400% [increase in] attrition rate when 2028 hits us.”

CBP's Office of Field Operations is already short 5,850 customs officers to staff the 328 land, air, and sea ports of entry nationwide, according to its union. 

To make up for the wave of retirements in 2028, OFO will need an additional 2,200 officers to address the 400% increase in retirements and keep up with stopping the flow of fentanyl into the U.S.

“We expect many of the CBP Officers hired before July 6, 2008, will retire in 2028 because that is when they will become eligible to receive their full Law Enforcement Officer enhanced retirement,” NTEU National President Doreen Greenwald testified before Congress in May 2024.

Paul Perez, president of the National Border Patrol Council union, said the retirement cliff for Border Patrol agents is approaching in 2028, but added that CBP has one tool to retain agents that has been seeing a lot of success early on.

Border Patrol agents are choosing to extend their careers for a one-year term as part of a newer initiative that allows them to apply for a short-term renewal multiple times until the age of 60.

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans are also pushing a funding solution that would give CBP a hefty investment to hire a lot more staff and retain existing employees.

“It's a good recruiting tool. We do have a big retirement cliff coming, but many of the agents are opting to stay,” Perez said.

The House-passed version of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would give CBP $4.1 billion to hire personnel, as well as $2.05 billion for retention bonuses and signing incentives.

“With the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' congressional Republicans are funding at least 3,000 new Border Patrol agents, 5,000 new CBP officers, 200 new Air and Marine Operations agents, and 290 support staff. It's time for the Senate to help us deliver,” Green said.

ICE SAYS IT ARRESTED 11 IRANIAN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AS TRUMP WARNS OF SLEEPER CELLS IN THE U.S.

One longtime Border Patrol agent in California, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because agents are not allowed to speak freely with media, said despite the ability to re-up for another year come retirement time, he plans to take his retirement before Trump leaves office, but he said he has peace of mind about where CBP is headed.

“I joined in early 2003. I was in, serving part-time in the National Guard during 9/11. I plan to retire by the end of 2028,” the agent wrote in a text message. “I have done and seen a lot during my career. I have served during different administrations, with different policy changes. As much as I love my country and think I can still do more to support and defend the Constitution, I have to take care of myself and let the new generation of agents … lead the patrol.”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

An Israeli court announced that hearings for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu‘s corruption trial have been canceled for this week, a delay granted based on pressing national security matters following the country's military operation in Iran and the renewed campaign in Gaza.

“Following the explanations given … we partially accept the request and cancel at this stage Mr. Netanyahu's hearings scheduled” for this week, the Jerusalem District Court ruled.

The ruling is a partial win for Netanyahu and his legal team in a case that has dragged on for four years. 

The prime minister's lawyers sought the cancellation of all hearings Netanyahu was required to be present at over the next two weeks, citing his busy schedule “managing national, diplomatic and security issues of the utmost importance.”

Netanyahu stands accused of bribery, fraud, and breach of trust after allegedly accepting tens of thousands of dollars' worth of cigars and champagne, allegations that he has denied.

When testifying in December of last year to the Jerusalem District Court, Netanyahu continuously pointed to his schedule, quipping that he “never gets to consistently smoke cigars” and is “always interrupted.”

“I work 17, 18 hours a day,” Netanyahu said in the courtroom at the time. “Everyone who knows me knows this. That's how I work. I eat my meals at my work table. It's not cordon bleu. It's not waiters coming with white gloves.”

He added, “By the way, I hate champagne.”

The ruling comes shortly after President Donald Trump blasted the trial as a “witch hunt” in two lengthy posts on Truth Social.

After initially decrying the trial on Wednesday, Trump reiterated his criticism of the court over the weekend, calling it a “travesty of ‘Justice'” while lauding Netanyahu as a “War Hero” for his strikes on Iran and the regime's nuclear program.

TRUMP DEMANDS IMMEDIATE END TO ‘GREAT WAR TIME' PM NETANYAHU'S CORRUPTION TRIAL

“It is terrible what they are doing in Israel to Bibi Netanyahu. He is a War Hero, and a Prime Minister who did a fabulous job working with the United States to bring Great Success in getting rid of the dangerous Nuclear threat in Iran. Importantly, he is right now in the process of negotiating a Deal with Hamas, which will include getting the Hostages back. How is it possible that the Prime Minister of Israel can be forced to sit in a Courtroom all day long, over NOTHING (Cigars, Bugs Bunny Doll, etc.). It is a POLITICAL WITCH HUNT, very similar to the Witch Hunt that I was forced to endure. This travesty of ‘Justice' will interfere with both Iran and Hamas negotiations. In other words, it is INSANITY doing what the out-of-control prosecutors are doing to Bibi Netanyahu,” the president said.

Trump concluded, “The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar a year, far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this. We just had a Great Victory with Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu at the helm — And this greatly tarnishes our Victory. LET BIBI GO, HE'S GOT A BIG JOB TO DO!”","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

A man and a woman were shot in New York City shortly after 10 p.m. on Sunday in Greenwich Village after the annual Pride Month parade. The shooting occurred near the Stonewall Inn, a bar made famous by the 1969 Stonewall riots.

A woman was shot in the leg, and a man was shot in the head and is in critical condition, according to local reports. The woman victim was reportedly stable. 

New York City Mayor Eric Adams released a statement about the shooting on X. 

“Saddened to learn about the shooting by the Stonewall Inn tonight as Pride celebrations were winding down,” Adams said. “During a time when our city should be rejoicing and celebrating members of our diverse LGBTQ+ community, incidents like this are devastating.”

“We're praying for the speedy recovery of the victims in tonight's shooting,” he said. “The NYPD will work quickly and tirelessly to bring the suspects to justice.”

Adams marched in the parade earlier in the day and expressed his excitement about participating.

America has more great-grandparents than ever. It also has a new caretaking challenge.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Through her teens, Hannah Domoslay-Paul had a great-grandmother on each side of her family. One of them was always crocheting, and as a girl, Domoslay-Paul would sit and watch her nimble hands construct the most delicate lace doilies. The other was a retired schoolteacher; at family events, she would tell stories or just list off all the counties in Michigan—the kind of thing students learned back when she was leading the classroom. Even their most mundane activities, to Domoslay-Paul, were enchanting.

Now Domoslay-Paul is a graphic designer in Pensacola, Florida, and she herself has six children: four with her late first husband, and two with her current husband. On the morning that I spoke with Domoslay-Paul, those kids were in Michigan with their great-grandmother, a 92-year-old in excellent health, picking strawberries to take home and make jam. They visit her every summer; they play cards, water the flowers, and even haul hay like Domoslay-Paul did when she was around their age.

Domoslay-Paul is grateful that her kids are growing up in a four-generation family as she did—but that experience is actually less rare now than when she was a child. For centuries, living long enough to become a great-grandparent was uncommon. The role was niche enough that kin researchers rarely studied it. But now many more people are reaching old age; even with people having children later on average than those in previous generations did, great-grandparenthood is becoming remarkably unremarkable. Ashton Verdery, a Pennsylvania State University sociologist who's part of a four-generation family himself, estimates that from 1996 to 2012, the number of great-grandparents in the United States increased by 33 percent, up to 20 million from 15 million. And according to Diego Alburez-Gutierrez, who studies kinship at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, American 15-year-olds today have an average of 2.85 great-grandparents—a figure that has been inching up since at least 1950 while the mean numbers of siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins have fallen. He expects that the overall number of great-grandparents will continue rising, not just in the U.S. but in countries across the globe.

In some ways, this is a beautiful development: Imagine your own children's children's children someday learning about history not from textbooks but from you, the person who lived it. But aging inevitably entails frailty, and caregiving often falls to one's children; when it comes to great-grandparents, their children are seniors themselves. Sociologists have long worried about the “sandwich generation,” meaning the people who are simultaneously caring for their young kids and their own aging parents—a situation that can significantly strain one's mental health (and savings). Now they're seeing a growing number of people in a sort of triple squeeze, helping care for their grown children, their grandchildren, and their own parents. This cohort is called the “club-sandwich generation”—and they're stretched exceedingly thin.

Zuzana Talašová, a doctoral student at Masaryk University, in the Czech Republic, likes to do a little experiment. When she asks people what it means to be a parent, everyone seems to have an answer. When she asks what it means to be a grandparent, she finds the same. But she doesn't get any cohesive response when she asks what great-grandparents do. A lot of people tell her plainly: “I don't know.”



In the absence of a strict cultural script, great-grandparents are in a strange position. Many of them didn't grow up with any such living elders and thus have no models to look to. They might never have expected to get to this point at all. But many of them end up serving an important function—one that is not practical, Talašová told me, so much as “emotional, symbolic, or narrative.”

Great-grandparents are, as Merril Silverstein, a Syracuse University sociologist, told me, “the peak of the family pyramid”: a kind of mascot for the whole lineage, and commonly a source of great pride. (Women live longer on average than men, so often that figure is a great-grandmother—a matriarch.) Many of them show up to special occasions and tell stories of national and family history. Verdery's kids have blond hair and blue eyes—but when they spend time with their great-grandmother, they get to hear about her childhood in Japan and her immigration to the United States. They love feeling connected with not only their great-grandma, Verdery told me, but also the whole line of ancestors she brings to life for them. Domoslay-Paul's grandfather died last winter, but when he was alive, he would drive her kids around his hometown, telling tales as they went. “‘That's the house that my grandfather lived in. And that's the house where I was born,'” she told me he'd recount. “‘When we were kids, we got drunk over there and then had to get sat by that outhouse because we were in big trouble,” and “That's where my brother's buried. He died when he was a year old.'”

Stories like these can give some perspective. Great-grandparents are a reminder that things change—that our lifetimes are enormously brief, but also that we are one link in a long line of generations, a part of something bigger than ourselves.

In some sense, great-grandparents are acting in a capacity quite like grandparents might have in the past. In the U.S., grandparents tended to be seen as familial authority figures and storytellers. Now, as I've reported, their role has evolved. Many of them are deeply engaged in the everyday bustle of raising their grandkids—because child-care costs keep climbing and the demands of parenthood keep growing, but perhaps also because more of them are staying active long enough to be able to help. As Silverstein told me, “Maybe an 85-year-old great-grandparent is as healthy as what used to be a 70-year-old grandparent.” That is: maybe not quite fit enough for anyone to ask them to pick up the great-grandkids from soccer practice, but hopefully strong enough to enjoy the birthdays, the holidays, the visits with no purpose other than to be together. Domoslay-Paul has observed that such a position can mellow out people who might've been harsh as parents. Instead of worrying about “who needs to go to the doctor, who needs new pants,” she told me, “you're able to just give the love.”

Grandparents, then, may actually be in the most difficult position within the four-generation family. In one 2020 qualitative study, researchers interviewed working grandmothers in four-generation families; the participants described being so busy caregiving that they had no time for medical appointments or tests, even though they could feel themselves aging and their body changing. Sometimes, their different roles—mother, grandmother, child, not to mention employee—would come into direct conflict; they were needed everywhere at once. “Who do I need to help first; for whom should I be more available?” one woman in the study wondered. “I respond not to my own agenda but to other people's agenda.”

I heard something similar from Jerri McElroy, a fellow with the nonprofit Caring Across Generations who lives in Georgia. McElroy is a full-time caregiver for her father, who has dementia and epilepsy and who lost his ability to speak after a seizure in 2018. She lives with him, her daughter, and her grandson—and has five other children and five other grandchildren as well. She has learned that when she's watching her grandkids and her dad, it can help to include the children in his care, as if it's a game—to get them excited to check up on him together, or let them carry a towel. She has mastered the juggling act, but it's never gotten easy. “When I think about certain seasons of life,” she told me, “it's all a blur. I don't even know how I got through.”

Great-grandparents are a kind of microcosm of the larger picture of extending lifespans: On the one hand, around the world, “aging is a big success story,” Silverstein told me. The grandmothers from the 2020 study were exhausted—but still grateful that their parents were alive. They viewed their circumstances not only as a duty, the author wrote, but also as a “privilege.” On the other hand, many societies—including the U.S.—have left family members to care for one another largely on their own, without guaranteed parental leave, child-care subsidies, or any cohesive, accessible system for tending to the proliferating elderly. Populations are transforming radically, and policies aren't keeping up.

If lifespans continue extending in the way we'd expect, four-generation families will become only more common. The future may be old. But it also might be more interconnected. As much as people talk about the U.S. and other countries becoming ever more individualistic, generations of American kin are arguably growing closer on average, researchers told me, and becoming more generous with one another. Silverstein said that because today's grandparents are so involved with family life on the whole, both logistically and emotionally, we might expect that great-grandparents will keep becoming more tied in as well.

That shift is bittersweet. With an aged loved one, impending loss is always close to the surface. But great-grandkids stand to benefit from being immersed in the normality of aging and death. They get to observe firsthand how time works: what it takes, but also what it gives. Domoslay-Paul's grandfather, born in 1930, rarely spoke about emotions. But she remembers that after her first husband died, her grandfather talked to her two oldest sons, who were 6 and 7 at the time. He told them that his own parents had died when he was not much older than them—eight decades earlier. “I know this is hard right now,” he said, “but I got through it.” They could see for themselves that he had.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Housing prices are rising fast in red and purple states known for being easy places to build. How can that be?

Something is happening in the housing market that really shouldn't be. Everyone familiar with America's affordability crisis knows that it is most acute in ultra-progressive coastal cities in heavily Democratic states. And yet, home prices have been rising most sharply in the exact places that have long served as a refuge for Americans fed up with the spiraling cost of living. Over the past decade, the median home price has increased by 134 percent in Phoenix, 133 percent in Miami, 129 percent in Atlanta, and 99 percent in Dallas. (Over that same stretch, prices in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles have increased by about 75 percent, 76 percent, and 97 percent, respectively).

This trend could prove disastrous. For much of the past half century, suburban sprawl across the Sun Belt was a kind of pressure-release valve for the housing market. People who couldn't afford to live in expensive cities had other, cheaper places to go. Now even the affordable alternatives are on track to become out of reach for a critical mass of Americans.

The trend also presents a mystery. According to expert consensus, anti-growth liberals have imposed excessive regulations that made building enough homes impossible. The housing crisis has thus become synonymous with feckless blue-state governance. So how can prices now be rising so fast in red and purple states known for their loose regulations?

From the March 2025 issue: How progressives froze the American dream

A tempting explanation is that the expert consensus is wrong. Perhaps regulations and NIMBYism were never really the problem, and the current push to reform zoning laws and building codes is misguided. But the real answer is that San Francisco and New York weren't unique—they were just early. Eventually, no matter where you are, the forces of NIMBYism catch up to you.

The perception of the Sun Belt as the anti-California used to be accurate. In a recent paper, two urban economists, Ed Glaeser and Joe Gyourko, analyze the rate of housing production across 82 metro areas since the 1950s. They find that as recently as the early 2000s, booming cities such as Dallas, Atlanta, and Phoenix were building new homes at more than four times the rate of major coastal cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York, on average. The fact that millions of people were being priced out of the locations with the best jobs and highest wages—so-called superstar cities—wasn't ideal. But the Sun Belt building boom kept the coastal housing shortage from becoming a full-blown national crisis.

No longer. Although the Sun Belt continues to build far more housing than the coasts in absolute terms, Glaeser and Gyourko find that the rate of building in most Sun Belt cities has fallen by more than half over the past 25 years, in some cases by much more, even as demand to live in those places has surged. “When it comes to new housing production, the Sun Belt cities today are basically at the point that the big coastal cities were 20 years ago,” Gyourko told me. This explains why home prices in the Sun Belt, though still low compared with those in San Francisco and New York, have risen so sharply since the mid-2010s—a trend that accelerated during the pandemic, as the rise of remote work led to a large migration out of high-cost cities.

In a properly functioning housing market, the post-COVID surge in demand should have generated a massive building boom that would have cooled price growth. Instead, more than five years after the pandemic began, these places still aren't building enough homes, and prices are still rising wildly.

As the issue of housing has become more salient in Democratic Party politics, some commentators have pointed to rising costs in the supposedly laissez-faire Sun Belt as proof that zoning laws and other regulations are not the culprit. “Blaming zoning for housing costs seems especially blinkered because different jurisdictions in the United States have very different approaches to land use regulations, and yet the housing crisis is a nationwide phenomenon,” the Vanderbilt University law professors Ganesh Sitaraman and Christopher Serkin write in a recent paper. Some argue that the wave of consolidation within the home-building industry following the 2008 financial crisis gave large developers the power to slow-walk development and keep prices high. Others say that the cost of construction has climbed so high over the past two decades that building no longer makes financial sense for developers.

Both of those claims probably account for part of the growth in housing costs, but they fall short as the main explanation. The home-building industry has indeed become more concentrated since 2008, but the slowdown in housing production in the Sun Belt began well before that. If the problem were a monopolistic market, you would expect to see higher profit margins for builders, yet Glaeser and Gyourko find that developer profits have remained roughly constant. (Other sources agree.) Likewise, construction and financing costs have risen sharply since the early 2000s—but not to the point where builders can't turn a profit. In fact, Glaeser and Gyourko find that the share of homes selling far above the cost of production in major Sun Belt markets has dramatically increased. Put another way, there are even more opportunities for home builders to make a profit in these places; something is preventing them from taking advantage.

The Sun Belt, in short, is subject to the same antidevelopment forces as the coasts; it just took longer to trigger them. Cities in the South and Southwest have portrayed themselves as business-friendly, pro-growth metros. In reality, their land-use laws aren't so different from those in blue-state cities. According to a 2018 research paper, co-authored by Gyourko, that surveyed 44 major U.S. metro areas, land-use regulations in Miami and Phoenix both ranked in the top 10 most restrictive (just behind Washington, D.C., and L.A. and ahead of Boston), and Dallas and Nashville were in the top 25. Because the survey is based on responses from local governments, it might understate just how bad zoning in the Sun Belt is. “When I first opened up the zoning code for Atlanta, I almost spit out my coffee,” Alex Armlovich, a senior housing-policy analyst at the Niskanen Center, a centrist think tank, told me. “It's almost identical to L.A. in the 1990s.”

These restrictive rules weren't a problem back when Sun Belt cities could expand by building new single-family homes at their exurban fringes indefinitely. That kind of development is less likely to be subject to zoning laws; even when it is, obtaining exceptions to those laws is relatively easy because neighbors who might oppose new development don't exist yet. Recently, however, many Sun Belt cities have begun hitting limits to their outward sprawl, either because they've run into natural obstacles (such as the Everglades in Miami and tribal lands near Phoenix) or because they've already expanded to the edge of reasonable commute distances (as appears to be the case in Atlanta and Dallas). To keep growing, these cities will have to find ways to increase the density of their existing urban cores and suburbs. That is a much more difficult proposition. “This is exactly what happened in many coastal cities in the 1980s and '90s,” Armlovich told me. “Once you run out of room to sprawl, suddenly your zoning code starts becoming a real limitation.”

Jerusalem Demsas: The labyrinthine rules that created a housing crisis

Glaeser and Gyourko go one step further. They hypothesize that as Sun Belt cities have become more affluent and highly educated, their residents have become more willing and able to use existing laws and regulations to block new development. They point to two main pieces of evidence. First, for a given city, the slowdown in new housing development strongly correlates with a rising share of college-educated residents. Second, within cities, the neighborhoods where housing production has slowed the most are lower-density, affluent suburbs populated with relatively well-off, highly educated professionals. In other words, anti-growth NIMBYism might be a perverse but natural consequence of growth: As demand to live in a place increases, it attracts the kind of people who are more likely to oppose new development, and who have the time and resources to do so. “We used to think that people in Miami, Dallas, Phoenix behaved differently than people in Boston and San Francisco,” Gyourko told me. “That clearly isn't the case.”

Real-world examples aren't hard to find. In early 2024, an affordable-housing developer proposed a project for an 85-unit apartment building in an affluent suburb of San Antonio. The apartments would have consisted entirely of subsidized units reserved for low-income residents, and the building would have included an on-site preschool. The project had buy-in from the city government, but a handful of local residents opposed it, citing concerns such as traffic, crime, and the height of the building. “It's too much—we're turning into Houston,” one nearby resident told the planning commission in April. “I would appreciate if you all would keep San Antonio residential and feeling like home.”

Those residents took advantage of a 1927 Texas law known as the “valid petition,” a procedure originally introduced as a way to preserve segregation after the Supreme Court struck down explicitly racial zoning. Under the law, any effort by a developer to get an exemption from a zoning ordinance (say, to build apartments on land zoned for retail) can be blocked if the owners of just 20 percent of the land within 200 feet of the proposed project site file a petition opposing the effort. At that point, the only way to rescue the project is to summon a three-fourths supermajority vote by the city council. In San Antonio, that meant nine of the city's 11 council members would need to vote to overturn the valid petition. In the end, only seven did. The project was killed.

Experts told me that from the mid-20th century through the 2000s, valid petitions were hardly used in Texas. But in recent years they have become such a common way to kill new projects that they have earned the nickname “the tyrant's veto.” They have been wielded against, among other things, a hospital expansion in Dallas, student housing in Bryan, and Habitat for Humanity houses in Austin. According to Nicole Nosek, the chair and founder of Texans for Reasonable Solutions, a pro-housing advocacy organization, the law chills development before it even gets proposed in the first place. “Developers call it ‘the silent killer,'” Nosek told me. “Many of them don't even try to propose projects in places like East Austin, because they know that one person could stir up enough trouble to kill it altogether.”

Justin Webb, the owner of a small family-owned home-building business in Dallas, told me that when he started out in 1990, the local environment was “every builder's dream.” Not anymore. “Now everything is a negotiation; everything is a process,” Webb said. He cited a project first proposed in May 2022 to turn a run-down strip mall in North Dallas into a mixed-use development with 2,300 new housing units alongside offices, retail, walking paths, and green space. After three years of local opposition and several contentious community meetings, the proposal has been scaled back to just 868 units. And it faces a lawsuit filed by a local neighborhood association that might kill it altogether. “A lot of times, the last person to move in wants to close the door and throw away the key,” Webb said. “I think that's what's happening all over Texas right now.”

Texas isn't an outlier. Similar anecdotes abound in cities such as Orlando, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Albuquerque, and Atlanta. This trend has turned some of the most developer-friendly cities into absolute nightmares for home builders.

Olga Khazan: Why people won't stop moving to the Sun Belt

When Mike Vasquez began working for his family's Arizona-based construction business in the 1980s, he told me, he could walk into the local planning office with a proposal “written on a napkin” and get approval for a new project within hours. Today, that process requires navigating an agonizing thicket of paperwork, regulations, town-hall meetings, neighborhood resistance, and potential lawsuits. Simply breaking ground on a new project can take years, if it gets approved at all. “It used to be the case that if you owned a piece of land, you could just build on it,” Vasquez told me. “Now it takes a year or two just to get the land rezoned so I can start a project. You can't run a business like that.” So after 43 years of building homes out West, Vasquez has decided to pull up stakes and move across the country to North Carolina, where he has heard it's still possible to build like in the good old days.

Right now, the same story is playing out again and again across the Sun Belt: Eventually, suburban sprawl runs its course, and cities must face both the restrictiveness of their own land-use laws and the seemingly universal human tendency to put down roots and then oppose new development. If current trends continue, then in 20 years, the housing crisis in cities such as Miami, Phoenix, and Atlanta will be as severe as it is in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York today.

The good news is that these cities have been warned. They can look at the crisis plaguing their coastal counterparts, see into their not-so-far-off future, and choose to do something about it. Some already have. In 2021, Raleigh, North Carolina, responded to an influx of new residents by reforming its laws to make building multifamily housing much easier. Over the next three years, the city built 60 percent more units annually and experienced half the rental-cost growth than it had during the previous five years, according to data gathered by Alex Horowitz, the project director for housing policy at the Pew Charitable Trusts.

The forces opposed to new development are just as vehemently opposed to the kind of reforms needed to avert a future crisis. Many local and state governments across the Sun Belt have tried and failed to implement lasting pro-housing reforms. But the recent spike in home prices across the region has put even more pressure on lawmakers to act. The Texas legislature recently passed several pieces of legislation that will, among other things, reduce the minimum lot size of new homes, limit the power of the “tyrant's veto,” and allow multifamily housing to be built on land currently zoned for offices and retail. Red states like to portray themselves as free from the pathologies that have made housing such a problem in other parts of the country. Now they have an opportunity to prove it.

Humanity is set to start shrinking several decades ahead of schedule.

First, the bad news: Global fertility is falling fast. The aging populations of rich countries are relying on ever fewer workers to support their economy, dooming those younger generations to a future of higher taxes, higher debt, or later retirement—or all three. Birth rates in middle-income countries are also plummeting, putting their economic development at risk. Practically the only countries set to continue growing are desperately poor.

By about 2084, according to the gold-standard United Nations “World Population Prospects,” the global population will officially begin its decline. Rich countries will all have become like Japan, stagnant and aging. And the rest of the world will have become old before it ever got the chance to become rich.

Sorry, did I say “bad news”? That was actually the good news, based on estimates that turned out to be far too rosy. Every two years, the UN's demographers revise their population projections, and for the past 10 years, they've always had to revise in the same direction: down. Next year, they'll do so again. In reality, the worldwide population decline is set to begin decades ahead of their expectations. Because global fertility trends are much worse than they, and probably you, think.

Jesús Fernández-Villaverde, a University of Pennsylvania macroeconomist, studies how poor countries develop. This development usually happens alongside a fertility transition. As people move from rural areas to cities, their economic opportunities expand, and kids become less crucial as a source of agricultural labor. Women gain access to contraception and education. They go from having about six kids, on average, to two. Fernández-Villaverde calls this “the standard modernization story,” and he's been teaching it for decades.

Much of Fernández-Villaverde's research focuses on Latin America, an economically middling region where one would expect middling fertility rates. In recent years, however, births in some Central and South American countries have plummeted to rates far lower than most rich countries', in defiance of the standard modernization story. Each year, Fernández-Villaverde updates his data on Latin American birth rates, which he gathers from the countries' official birth statistics, in preparation for a class he teaches about the region's economic history. He first began noticing in 2019 that the UN was too optimistic, but only in the past few years did the discrepancies become downright alarming.

For 2024, the UN had projected 701,000 births in Colombia; it had put the chance of the number of births being lower than 553,000 at only 2.5 percent. In the end, Colombia saw only 445,000 births in 2024. That translates to a fertility rate of 1.06 births per woman, down more than half from 2008. Chile's is even lower: At current rates, 100 reproductive-age Chileans can expect to have 52 children and only 27 grandchildren. (Demographers generally consider a birth rate of about 2.1 to be “replacement level,” or the point at which a society doesn't shrink from one generation to the next.)

Olga Khazan: An unexpected argument from the right

The discrepancies were not limited to South America. In 2024, Poland's births were also below the 2.5-percent probability cutoff, as were Estonia's and Cuba's and Azerbaijan's and Sri Lanka's and Egypt's. These supposed outlier results aren't outliers at all—the world is just not having as many babies as the UN had thought it would.

Digging into the UN's model, Fernández-Villaverde found something even stranger. For nearly every low-fertility country, the UN projects either one of two outcomes: The fertility rate will flatten, or it will rise to a number somewhere between one and two births per woman—still below replacement level, but not quite as catastrophic. The United States is in the first category. Our fertility rate has fallen steadily since the Great Recession, from 2.1 to 1.6. One might therefore expect the decline to continue. But the UN projects that the U.S. birth rate will stay flat, not just this year but also in 2026 and 2030 and 2060 and 2090, never rising above 1.7 or dipping below 1.6.

In the other category are countries such as Thailand, whose fertility rate has been falling for 72 years and has never stopped for longer than a single year. Nonetheless, there the UN projects a demographic miracle: Starting in two years, the country's birth rate will begin to climb, first slowly and then a little more quickly, finishing out the century with a birth rate of 1.45, up from its projected 2024 low of 1.20.

Every part of that appears to be wrong. In reality, Thailand's reported birth rate last year was 0.98, and preliminary 2025 data show the decline continuing. In a country the size of Thailand, the difference between the UN's projection and the real fertility rate throughout the 21st century will amount to millions of people who will never be born.

All in all, as Fernández-Villaverde recently explained at a research symposium in London, humanity won't start to shrink in 2084. It will start to shrink in 2055, if not sooner.

“There are two types of people,” Alice Evans, a British professor who studies falling fertility around the world, posted on X after reading Fernández-Villaverde's presentation: those “not bothered about demographics” and “those who've read Jesus's slides.”

The UN has a simple explanation for its optimistic projections: Fertility has rebounded in the past, so it will rebound again.

In Belarus, for example, the fertility rate in 1988 was at replacement level; it fell to an abysmal 1.22 only nine years later. But then it rebounded, all the way up to 1.73 by 2015. Australia's birth rate fell to 1.7 in 2001, only to bounce back to 2.0 in 2008. France's rate followed a similar trajectory during the same period, as did Italy's and Sweden's. “To the extent you think the ‘World Population Prospects' are wrong, that is the extent to which you are saying, ‘This time is different,'” Lyman Stone, a Ph.D. student and birth-rate consultant, told me.

The thing is, this time really does look different. Birth rates in Australia and France and Italy and Sweden have now fallen to all-time lows (excluding during World War I, in France's case). Belarus, a onetime redemption story, recorded a fertility rate of just 1.1 last year, lower than the lowest lows the country experienced in the 1990s. Deaths outnumbered births by nearly two to one. If a rebound is coming, there are no signs of it yet. Fernández-Villaverde estimates that the world is already below replacement fertility: The population is not just projected but guaranteed to shrink if things don't change. That was not the case in the 1990s.

Elizabeth Bruenig: Why the left should embrace pronatalism

The UN's model hasn't adjusted to the new normal. If a country has ever experienced a fertility increase (as Australia and France and Belarus have), then its birth rate is assumed to be stable. If a country has never experienced an increase, then the model assumes that it will at some point, once fertility gets low enough. In other words, the model assumes as its end state a stable and modest number of births. This is perhaps a reflection of humanistic optimism. “There is, at some point, a minimum social capacity to adapt and eventually at least address some of the concerns or challenges that exist in that country,” Patrick Gerland, the chief author of “World Population Prospects,” told me. “The people living in those countries don't necessarily want their country to totally disappear.”

To his point, the model comes with a hard-coded minimum: No country can ever be projected to have a fertility rate less than 0.5 children per woman. Like the rest of the model, this, too, might need to be revised. Macau (which the UN analyzes separately from mainland China) had a fertility rate of 1.2 a decade ago. Last year, it fell to 0.58, and it looks set to fall even further: In the first four months of 2025, births were down another 13 percent.

If you're not sure why this is all so alarming, consider Japan, the canonical example of the threat that low fertility poses to a country's economic prospects. At its peak in 1994, the Japanese economy made up 18 percent of world GDP, but eventually, the country's demographics caught up with it. Now Japan's median age is 50 years old, and the country's GDP makes up just 4 percent of the global economy. Measured per hours worked, Japan's economic growth has always been strong, but at some point, you just don't have enough workers.

The fertility rates that doomed the Japanese economy ranged from 1.3 to 1.5. So imagine what's in store for modern-day Colombia (1.06) and Chile (1.03). How will they grow with so few workers? How will they ever become rich if each worker is expected to provide for so many elderly people? The overly optimistic UN estimates have obscured just how urgent these questions really are. Because if the birth rate continues to drop around the world at its current pace, economic growth and workers' retirement prospects will go the way of those projections: adjusting every few years to a smaller, sadder, poorer future.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

A recent book suggests that Latin American democracy may hold lessons for the current U.S. political moment

Imagine a couple of bros recording a video podcast in which they get together to swap compliments while casually chatting about vaporizing due process. This is roughly what it felt like to tune in to President Donald Trump's joint press conference with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office in April. First came the mutual praise. “I want to just say hello to the people of El Salvador and say they have one hell of a president,” Trump started. Bukele expressed delight at meeting “the leader of the free world.” Later in the conversation, Trump told Bukele, “You sort of look like a teenager,” playfully slapping his arm.

The pair then turned their attention to the extrajudicial transfer of dozens of Venezuelan migrants held in the United States to the notorious Salvadoran mega-prison known as CECOT (Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo), as well as the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who had been mistakenly deported to El Salvador by U.S. authorities. Asked by a reporter if he would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, as mandated by the U.S. Supreme Court, Bukele asked coyly, “How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States?” Trump bobbed his head approvingly. (Abrego Garcia was ultimately returned to the U.S. earlier this month.)

This confab was the latest brutish two-step in a decades-long political dance between the U.S. and El Salvador. In the 1980s, the U.S. gave billions of dollars to murderous right-wing factions during the Central American nation's civil war, fueling the conflict and destabilizing the country. In the '90s, the Clinton administration began deporting Salvadoran immigrants convicted of crimes in the U.S. back to their homeland, a move that helped propel the rise of powerful gangs in a country that was institutionally weak after years of war. Rising gang violence then led thousands of ordinary Salvadorans to flee to the United States. The chaos laid the groundwork for the rise of Bukele, a man who once described himself as “the world's coolest dictator.” And now the U.S. is paying the country to house Venezuelan migrants, including many whose greatest crime seems to have been seeking asylum here.

This feels like more of the same, but with an awful new twist. American intervention in Latin America has often been premised on the condescending notion that the U.S. is a forbearing parent, the stable democracy tasked with maintaining order in its hemisphere. But now that our country has deployed the military against its own citizens in Los Angeles, taken a Constitution-shredding approach to deportation, and defied court orders, it might be Latin America's turn to offer guidance. Latin American nations, for all their political convulsions and repressive periods, have a rich history of social movements grounded in collective ideals. As some historians talk about Trump as a strongman in the Latin American mold, perhaps the region has something to teach us about democracy.

Trump's regime makes the arrival of the historian Greg Grandin's ambitious new book, America, América: A New History of the New World, incredibly timely. His previous, Pulitzer-winning book, The End of the Myth, incisively explained how U.S. expansionism gave way to the border-wall isolationism of the Trump era. In America, América, he expands the frame. Over 768 pages, Grandin gives us the sweep of history: the bloodshed of colonization, the movements for independence, manifest destiny in the U.S. and caudillo rule in Latin America, a pair of world wars, the Cold War, and the growing polarization of the 21st century.

Read: El Salvador's exceptional prison state

The author is not the first scholar to tackle the history of America—as in the American continent, not just the United States (which keeps trying to hoard the name for itself). The British historian Felipe Fernández-Armesto's 2003 book The Americas: A Hemispheric History covered the shifting fortunes of the continent's Anglo and Latin American nations over five centuries. But that work was more limited in scope, and in the two decades since it was published, a new generation of caudillos has arisen, including Bukele, Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro, Argentina's Javier Milei, and Trump.

America, América brings us to the present. It also offers a fresh look at the past, primarily focusing on the British and Spanish empires and providing a deep analysis of the ideas upon which both were built and governed (for better and worse). Grandin considers, for example, how both empires contended—or didn't—with the ethics of conquest. And he goes deep on the ways that the Monroe Doctrine shaped U.S.–Latin America relations over two centuries. When President James Monroe declared in 1823 that the Western Hemisphere was off-limits to future European colonial projects, his proclamation was received as a statement of solidarity by newly independent Latin American nations. But it quickly became “a self-issued warrant for the U.S. to intervene against its southern neighbors,” Grandin writes. Within two years, the U.S. was actively undermining Mexican President Guadalupe Victoria; military incursions in Mexico, Haiti, Cuba, and Puerto Rico followed. By the middle of the 20th century, Cold War paranoias about left-wing movements, spurred by the revolution in Cuba, led to, in Grandin's estimation, 16 U.S.-aided regime changes from 1961 to 1969—including one in El Salvador, which put that country on the slippery slope to civil war.

This is a big and unwieldy book—and it could have made for arid reading. But Grandin has a knack for enlivening theory with anecdotes that are both enlightening and appalling. A section detailing the independence movement in Venezuela, for instance, features a novelistic tangent about a royalist caudillo named José Tomás Boves, who attempted to beat the reformers back: He gathered an army to seize the capital of the newly independent nation, brutalizing anyone who stood in his path. In Cumaná, he held Caracas's republican orchestra captive and ordered the musicians to play waltzes as his soldiers danced with the town's widows. “Blood from the day's killing still moist on their boots turned the dance floor red,” writes Grandin. “As the orchestra played, Boves took one musician out at a time to be executed.”

Although such gory tales push the story along, what makes América, America instructive is Grandin's focus on the way that Latin American thinkers have advocated for important social rights from the very foundation of their republics. For starters, many early independence movements in Latin America were linked to the abolition of slavery—most notably in Haiti. The South American liberation leader Simón Bolívar emancipated the slave laborers who worked on his family's estate—unlike George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Moreover, the constitutions of many Spanish-speaking republics went beyond enshrining individual rights, also offering protection to el bien común de la Sociedad (“the common good of society”). Mexico's constitution was the first in the world to guarantee birthright citizenship. Venezuela's first constitution included nine instances of the word social and 15 of the word society, Grandin writes: “Neither word appears in the United States Constitution.” Venezuela's remarkable document declared, “Because governments are constituted for the common good and happiness of men, society must provide aid to the destitute and unfortunate, and education to all citizens.”

Read: The revolutionary idea that remade the world

Certainly, there was a gap between high-minded intentions and the actual application of the law. The abolition of slavery in Latin America didn't immediately eliminate it in practice, and that first Venezuelan constitution was shortly replaced by another. But Latin America's ideals of el bien común have nevertheless helped shape legal codes into the present—including international law. Many of the ideas put forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, emerged from Latin America, including the equal treatment of men and women, the right to marry across racial lines, the right to health care, and the right to leisure time.

Grandin's narrative upends the idea of Latin America as perpetual victim, instead chronicling a tradition of leaders who have consistently fought for the social good. One particularly illuminating chapter traces the way that liberation theology, Marxist economic theory, and Latin American literature came together in the 1960s to articulate “the intangible ways patriarchs, dictators, landlords, and foreign capital maintained their rule.” Grandin argues that this was “a period of such intense intellectual vitality, it should be considered equal to European Enlightenment.”

Particularly poignant in the context of El Salvador is the story of Father Ignacio Ellacuría, a prominent Jesuit clergyman in that country who was part of a wave of Latin American theologians interested in liberating their communities from economic and political peonage. One of Ellacuría's central ideas was that the poor shouldn't be expected to roll over and accept their condition. He wrote that he aimed “to bring the crucified down from their crosses.” These ideas, along with Ellacuría's attempt to broker a peace treaty between leftist insurgents and the government, were not well received by the military. In 1989, amid the chaos of the civil war, Ellacuría was assassinated as he slept, along with five other Jesuit clergymen and their housekeeper and her daughter. The perpetrators: members of the infamous Atlácatl Battalion, which had been created under the direction of U.S. advisers. The murder of these priests did not stamp out their ideas. Today, the priests are on the road to canonization, and an associate of theirs, Cardinal Gregorio Rosa Chávez, is one of Bukele's most outspoken critics.

As Grandin notes in his final chapter, the world is now experiencing the rise of a new generation of autocrats—among them Bukele, whom he criticizes for using CECOT as a site of a “Dantesque display of fascist dehumanization.” But in Latin America's socially minded ideals, the author finds a way forward. “Latin Americans know that the way to beat fascism now is the same as it was back then,” he writes, comparing our era to the rise of autocracy in the 1930s, “by welding liberalism to a forceful agenda of social rights, by promising to better the material conditions of people's lives.” To take one example, the electoral rise of the socialist Salvador Allende in Chile didn't come about because the masses were being mindlessly seduced by leftist doctrine; it was a result of the tangible (and very reasonable) reforms that Allende delivered: literacy programs, an expanded education system, increased pensions for widows, free lunches for schoolchildren, and workplace-safety regulations.

How might these ideas of el bien commún inform American social movements today? For now, Grandin has no more answers than anyone else. America, América focuses more on big-picture ideology than on the nitty-gritty mechanics of resistance. Unexamined, for example, are the ways in which the Catholic Church in Chile built institutions to resist the depredations of the military regime in the 1970s and '80s, helping set the stage for the liberalization that followed. There is a lot of material left to explore when it comes to overcoming the latest setbacks in the American continents' slow progress toward freedom. Perhaps it would be a fitting topic for Grandin's next book.

Sometimes emotions are the voice of one's conscience, and shouldn't be ignored.

Five years ago, Elon Musk told Joe Rogan during a podcast taping that “the fundamental weakness of Western civilization is empathy, the empathy exploit.” By that time, the idea that people in the West are too concerned with the pain of others to adequately advocate for their own best interests was already a well-established conservative idea. Instead of thinking and acting rationally, the theory goes, they're moved to make emotional decisions that compromise their well-being and that of their home country. In this line of thought, empathetic approaches to politics favor liberal beliefs. An apparent opposition between thought and feeling has long vexed conservatives, leading the right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro to famously declare that “facts don't care about your feelings.”

But the current ascendancy of this anti-empathy worldview, now a regular topic in right-wing social-media posts, articles, and books, might be less a reasonable point of argumentation and more a sort of coping mechanism for conservatives confronted with the outcomes of certain Trump-administration policies—such as the nightmarish tale of a 4-year-old American child battling cancer being deported to Honduras without any medication, or a woman in ICE custody losing her mid-term pregnancy after being denied medical treatment for days. That a conservative presented with these cases might feel betrayed by their own treacherous empathy makes sense; this degree of human suffering certainly ought to prompt an empathetic response, welcome or not. Even so, it also stands to reason that rather than shifting their opinions when confronted with the realities of their party's positions, some conservatives might instead decide that distressing emotions provoked by such cases must be a kind of mirage or trick. This is both absurd—things that make us feel bad typically do so because they are bad—and spiritually hazardous.

Xochitl Gonzalez: What happened to empathy?

This is certainly true for Christians, whose faith generally counsels taking others' suffering seriously. That's why the New York Times best seller published late last year by the conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey, Toxic Empathy: How Progressives Exploit Christian Compassion, is so troubling. In her treatise packaging right-wing anti-empathy ideas for Christians, Stuckey, a Fox News veteran who recently spoke at a conference hosted by the right-wing nonprofit Turning Point USA, contends that left wingers often manipulate well-meaning believers into adopting sinful argumentative and political positions by exploiting their natural religious tendency to care for others. Charlie Kirk, the Republican activist who runs Turning Point USA, said that Stuckey has demolished “the No. 1 psychological trick of the left” with her observation that liberals wield empathy against conservatives “by employing our language, our Bible verses, our concepts” and then perverting them “to morally extort us into adopting their position.” Taken at face value, the idea that Christians are sometimes persuaded into un-Christian behavior by strong emotions is fair, and nothing new: Suspicion of human passions is ancient, and a great deal of Christian preaching deals with the subject of subduing them. But Toxic Empathy is not a sermon. It is a political pamphlet advising Christians on how to argue better in political debates—a primer on being better conservatives, not better Christians.

Empathy is an ambiguous concept. When it was imported into English from German a little more than a century ago, empathy referred to one's capacity to merge experiences with objects in the world, a definition that current usage bears little resemblance to: The Atlantic reported in 2015 that “the social psychologist C. Daniel Batson, who has researched empathy for decades, argues that the term can now refer to eight different concepts,” such as “knowing another's thoughts and feelings,” “actually feeling as another does,” and “feeling distress at another's suffering,” a kind of catchall term for having a moral imagination. Stuckey's definition doesn't distinguish among these different elements; she instead frames empathy itself as a specific emotion rather than a psychological capacity for understanding the emotions of others, which makes her usage especially confusing. Whatever it is, empathy isn't something Stuckey wants to reject altogether: Jesus embodied a kind of empathy, and it can be, she says, “a powerful motivation to love those around you.”

Arthur C. Brooks: What's missing from empathy

The toxic kind of empathy, she contends, is the kind that makes you double-check your specifically conservative political priors. Some examples: “If you're really compassionate, you'll welcome the immigrant” and “If you're really a Christian, you'll fight for social justice.” This argumentative technique, in which Christians are asked to consider their political positions in light of the logic of their own faith, can hardly be described as empathy in any common sense of the term. This linguistic confusion between rational arguments about whether a person's political positions are adequately Christian, on one hand, and arguments that people should reason from emotion, on the other, runs through the entire debate about empathy. What Stuckey seems to be saying is merely that progressive assertions summon certain emotions inside their conservative debate partners—such as pity and compassion—that make them unwilling to defend their premises, regardless of whether said conservatives are actually inhabiting the emotional states of other people. Labeling those emotions as fruits of toxic empathy is a strategy for dealing with them: It resolves the tension between what one feels and what one thinks by dismissing one's feelings as misguided. This approach glibly ignores the possibility that such emotions are in fact the voice of one's conscience, and takes for granted that ignoring one's sympathies for other people is a good Christian habit of mind.

In that sense, the toxic-empathy rhetorical framework, built for producing peace of mind for conservative debaters, threatens to render Christians insensitive to moral demands of Christianity that run contrary to conservative preferences. “Toxic empathy claims the only way to love racial minorities is to advance social justice,” Stuckey writes at one point, “but ‘justice' that shows partiality to the poor or to those perceived as oppressed only leads to societal chaos.” It's true that every person should be judged equally in the administration of the law, but it's also the case that Christianity actually does dictate that the needs of the poor and powerless should be prioritized in society. Far from being a misleading interpretation adduced by bad-faith actors in political debates, it is rather the plain meaning of the Gospels, attested to by thousands of years' worth of Christian saints and thinkers who have declared that God especially loves the poor and the oppressed. That fact remains as radical today as it was when Jesus was preaching, and now, just as then, there are people who can't stand to recognize it.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Insomnia has become a public-health emergency.

I like to tell people that the night before I stopped sleeping, I slept. Not only that: I slept well. Years ago, a boyfriend of mine, even-keeled during the day but restless at night, told me how hard it was to toss and turn while I instantly sank into the crude, Neanderthal slumber of the dead. When I found a magazine job that allowed me to keep night-owl hours, my rhythms had the precision of an atomic clock. I fell asleep at 1 a.m. I woke up at 9 a.m. One to nine, one to nine, one to nine, night after night, day after day. As most researchers can tell you, this click track is essential to health outcomes: One needs consistent bedtimes and wake-up times. And I had them, naturally; when I lost my alarm clock, I didn't bother getting another until I had an early-morning flight to catch.

Then, one night maybe two months before I turned 29, that vaguening sense that normal sleepers have when they're lying in bed—their thoughts pixelating into surreal images, their mind listing toward unconsciousness—completely deserted me. How bizarre, I thought. I fell asleep at 5 a.m.

This started to happen pretty frequently. I had no clue why. The circumstances of my life, both personally and professionally, were no different from the week, month, or two months before—and my life was good. Yet I'd somehow transformed into an appliance without an off switch.

I saw an acupuncturist. I took Tylenol PM. I sampled a variety of supplements, including melatonin (not really appropriate, I'd later learn, especially in the megawatt doses Americans take—its real value is in resetting your circadian clock, not as a sedative). I ran four miles every day, did breathing exercises, listened to a meditation tape a friend gave me. Useless.

I finally caved and saw my general practitioner, who prescribed Ambien, telling me to feel no shame if I needed it every now and then. But I did feel shame, lots of shame, and I'd always been phobic about drugs, including recreational ones. And now … a sedative? (Two words for you: Judy Garland.) It was only when I started enduring semiregular involuntary all-nighters—which I knew were all-nighters, because I got out of bed and sat upright through them, trying to read or watch TV—that I capitulated. I couldn't continue to stumble brokenly through the world after nights of virtually no sleep.

I hated Ambien. One of the dangers with this strange drug is that you may do freaky things at 4 a.m. without remembering, like making a stack of peanut-butter sandwiches and eating them. That didn't happen to me (I don't think?), but the drug made me squirrelly and tearful. I stopped taking it. My sleep went back to its usual syncopated disaster.

In Sleepless: A Memoir of Insomnia, Marie Darrieussecq lists the thinkers and artists who have pondered the brutality of sleeplessness, and they're distinguished company: Duras, Gide, Pavese, Sontag, Plath, Dostoyevsky, Murakami, Borges, Kafka. (Especially Kafka, whom she calls literature's “patron saint” of insomniacs. “Dread of night,” he wrote. “Dread of not-night.”) Not to mention F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose sleeplessness was triggered by a single night of warfare with a mosquito.

But there was sadly no way to interpret my sleeplessness as a nocturnal manifestation of tortured genius or artistic brilliance. It felt as though I'd been poisoned. It was that arbitrary, that abrupt. When my insomnia started, the experience wasn't just context-free; it was content-free. People would ask what I was thinking while lying wide awake at 4 a.m., and my answer was: nothing. My mind whistled like a conch shell.

But over time I did start thinking—or worrying, I should say, and then perseverating, and then outright panicking. At first, songs would whip through my head, and I couldn't get the orchestra to pack up and go home. Then I started to fear the evening, going to bed too early in order to give myself extra runway to zonk out. (This, I now know, is a typical amateur's move and a horrible idea, because the bed transforms from a zone of security into a zone of torment, and anyway, that's not how the circadian clock works.) Now I would have conscious thoughts when I couldn't fall asleep, which can basically be summarized as insomnia math: Why am I not falling asleep Dear God let me fall asleep Oh my God I only have four hours left to fall asleep oh my God now I only have three oh my God now two oh my God now just one.

“The insomniac is not so much in dialogue with sleep,” Darrieussecq writes, “as with the apocalypse.”

I would shortly discover that this cycle was textbook insomnia perdition: a fear of sleep loss that itself causes sleep loss that in turn generates an even greater fear of sleep loss that in turn generates even more sleep loss … until the next thing you know, you're in an insomnia galaxy spiral, with a dark behavioral and psychological (and sometimes neurobiological) life of its own.

I couldn't recapture my nights. Something that once came so naturally now seemed as impossible as flying. How on earth could this have happened? To this day, whenever I think about it, I still can't believe it did.

In light of my tortured history with the subject, you can perhaps see why I generally loathe stories about sleep. What they're usually about is the dangers of sleep loss, not sleep itself, and as a now-inveterate insomniac, I've already got a multivolume fright compendium in my head of all the terrible things that can happen when sleep eludes you or you elude it. You will die of a heart attack or a stroke. You will become cognitively compromised and possibly dement. Your weight will climb, your mood will collapse, the ramparts of your immune system will crumble. If you rely on medication for relief, you're doing your disorder all wrong—you're getting the wrong kind of sleep, an unnatural sleep, and addiction surely awaits; heaven help you and that horse of Xanax you rode in on.

It should go without saying that for some of us, knowledge is not power. It's just more kindling.

The cultural discussions around sleep would be a lot easier if the tone weren't quite so hectoring—or so smug. A case in point: In 2019, the neuroscientist Matthew Walker, the author of Why We Sleep, gave a TED Talk that began with a cheerful disquisition about testicles. They are, apparently, “significantly smaller” in men who sleep five hours a night rather than seven or more, and that two-hour difference means lower testosterone levels too, equivalent to those of someone 10 years their senior. The consequences of short sleep for women's reproductive systems are similarly dire.

“This,” Walker says just 54 seconds in, “is the best news that I have for you today.”

He makes good on his promise. What follows is the old medley of familiars, with added verses about inflammation, suicide, cancer. Walker's sole recommendation at the end of his sermon is the catechism that so many insomniacs—or casual media consumers, for that matter—can recite: Sleep in a cool room, keep your bedtimes and wake-up times regular, avoid alcohol and caffeine. Also, don't nap.

I will now say about Walker:

1. His book is in many ways quite wonderful—erudite and wide-ranging and written with a flaring energy when it isn't excessively pleased with itself.

2. Both Why We Sleep and Walker's TED Talk focus on sleep deprivation, not insomnia, with the implicit and sometimes explicit assumption that too many people choose to blow off sleep in favor of work or life's various seductions.

If public awareness is Walker's goal (certainly a virtuous one), he and his fellow researchers have done a very good job in recent years, with the enthusiastic assistance of my media colleagues, who clearly find stories about the hazards of sleep deprivation irresistible. (In the wine-dark sea of internet content, they're click sirens.) Walker's TED Talk has been viewed nearly 24 million times. “For years, we were fighting against ‘I'll sleep when I'm dead,' ” Aric Prather, the director of the behavioral-sleep-medicine research program at UC San Francisco, told me. “Now the messaging that sleep is a fundamental pillar of human health has really sunk in.”

Yet greater awareness of sleep deprivation's consequences hasn't translated into a better-rested populace. Data from the CDC show that the proportion of Americans reporting insufficient sleep held constant from 2013 through 2022, at roughly 35 percent. (From 2020 to 2022, as anxiety about the pandemic eased, the percentage actually climbed.)

So here's the first question I have: In 2025, exactly how much of our “sleep opportunity,” as the experts call it, is under our control?

According to the most recent government data, 16.4 percent of American employees work nonstandard hours. (Their health suffers in every category—the World Health Organization now describes night-shift work as “probably carcinogenic.”) Adolescents live in a perpetual smog of sleep deprivation because they're forced to rise far too early for school (researchers call their plight “social jet lag”); young mothers and fathers live in a smog of sleep deprivation because they're forced to rise far too early (or erratically) for their kids; adults caring for aging parents lose sleep too. The chronically ill frequently can't sleep. Same with some who suffer from mental illness, and many veterans, and many active-duty military members, and menopausal women, and perimenopausal women, and the elderly, the precariat, the poor.

“Sleep opportunity is not evenly distributed across the population,” Prather noted, and he suspects that this contributes to health disparities by class. In 2020, the National Center for Health Statistics found that the poorer Americans were, the greater their likelihood of reporting difficulty falling asleep. If you look at the CDC map of the United States' most sleep-deprived communities, you'll see that they loop straight through the Southeast and Appalachia. Black and Hispanic Americans also consistently report sleeping less, especially Black women.

Even for people who aren't contending with certain immutables, the cadences of modern life have proved inimical to sleep. Widespread electrification laid waste to our circadian rhythms 100 years ago, when they lost any basic correspondence with the sun; now, compounding matters, we're contending with the currents of a wired world. For white-collar professionals, it's hard to imagine a job without the woodpecker incursions of email or weekend and late-night work. It's hard to imagine news consumption, or even ordinary communication, without the overstimulating use of phones and computers. It's hard to imagine children eschewing social media when it's how so many of them socialize, often into the night, which means blue-light exposure, which means the suppression of melatonin. (Melatonin suppression obviously applies to adults too—it's hardly like we're avatars of discipline when it comes to screen time in bed.)

Most of us can certainly do more to improve or reclaim our sleep. But behavioral change is difficult, as anyone who's vowed to lose weight can attest. And when the conversation around sleep shifts the onus to the individual—which, let's face it, is the American way (we shift the burden of child care to the individual, we shift the burden of health care to the individual)—we sidestep the fact that the public and private sectors alike are barely doing a thing to address what is essentially a national health emergency.

Given that we've decided that an adequate night's rest is a matter of individual will, I now have a second question: How are we to discuss those who are suffering not just from inadequate sleep, but from something far more severe? Are we to lecture them in the same menacing, moralizing way? If the burden of getting enough sleep is on us, should we consider chronic insomniacs—for whom sleep is a nightly gladiatorial struggle—the biggest failures in the armies of the underslept?

Those who can't sleep suffer a great deal more than those gifted with sleep will ever know. Yet insomniacs frequently feel shame about the solutions they've sought for relief—namely, medication—likely because they can detect a subtle, judgmental undertone about this decision, even from their loved ones. Resorting to drugs means they are lazy, refusing to do simple things that might ease their passage into unconsciousness. It means they are neurotic, requiring pills to transport them into a natural state that every other animal on Earth finds without aid.

Might I suggest that these views are unenlightened? “In some respects, chronic insomnia is similar to where depression was in the past. We'd say, ‘Major depression' and people would say, ‘Everybody gets down now and then,' ” John Winkelman, a psychiatrist in the sleep-medicine division at Harvard Medical School, said at a panel I attended last summer. Darrieussecq, the author of Sleepless, puts it more bluntly: “ ‘I didn't sleep all night,' sleepers say to insomniacs, who feel like replying that they haven't slept all their life.”

The fact is, at least 12 percent of the U.S. population suffers from insomnia as an obdurate condition. Among Millennials, the number pops up to 15 percent. And 30 to 35 percent of Americans suffer from some of insomnia's various symptoms—trouble falling asleep, trouble staying asleep, or waking too early—at least temporarily. In 2024, there were more than 2,500 sleep-disorder centers in the U.S. accredited by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Prather told me the wait time to get into his sleep clinic at UCSF is currently a year. “That's better than it used to be,” he added. “Until a few months ago, our waitlist was closed. We couldn't fathom giving someone a date.”

So what I'm hoping to do here is not write yet another reproachful story about sleep, plump with misunderstandings and myths. Fixing sleep—obtaining sleep—is a tricky business. The work it involves and painful choices it entails deserve nuanced examination. Contrary to what you might have read, our dreams are seldom in black and white.

Whenever I interviewed a clinician, psychiatrist, neuroscientist, or any other kind of expert for this story, I almost always opened with the same question: What dogma about sleep do you think most deserves to be questioned?

The most frequent answer, by a long chalk, is that we need eight hours of it. A fair number of studies, it turns out, show that mortality rates are lowest if a person gets roughly seven hours. Daniel F. Kripke, a psychiatrist at UC San Diego, published the most famous of these analyses in 2002, parsing a sample of 1.1 million individuals and concluding that those who reported more than eight hours of sleep a night experienced significantly increased mortality rates. According to Kripke's work, the optimal sleep range was a mere 6.5 to 7.4 hours.

These numbers shouldn't be taken as gospel. The relationship between sleep duration and health outcomes is a devil's knot, though Kripke did his best to control for the usual confounds—age, sex, body-mass index. But he could not control for the factors he did not know. Perhaps many of the individuals who slept eight hours or more were doing so because they had an undetected illness, or an illness of greater severity than they'd realized, or other conditions Kripke hadn't accounted for. The study was also observational, not randomized.

But even if they don't buy Kripke's data, sleep experts don't necessarily believe that eight hours of sleep has some kind of mystical significance. Methodologically speaking, it's hard to determine how much sleep, on average, best suits us, and let's not forget the obvious: Sleep needs—and abilities—vary over the course of a lifetime, and from individual to individual. (There's even an extremely rare species of people, known as “natural short sleepers,” associated with a handful of genes, who require only four to six hours a night. They tear through the world as if fired from a cannon.) Yet eight hours of sleep or else remains one of our culture's most stubborn shibboleths, and an utter tyranny for many adults, particularly older ones.

“We have people coming into our insomnia clinic saying ‘I'm not sleeping eight hours' when they're 70 years of age,” Michael R. Irwin, a psychoneurologist at UCLA, told me. “And the average sleep in that population is less than seven hours. They attribute all kinds of things to an absence of sleep—decrements in cognitive performance and vitality, higher levels of fatigue—when often that's not the case. I mean, people get older, and the drive to sleep decreases as people age.”

Another declaration I was delighted to hear: The tips one commonly reads to get better sleep are as insipid as they sound. “Making sure that your bedroom is cool and comfortable, your bed is soft, you have a new mattress and a nice pillow—it's unusual that those things are really the culprit,” Eric Nofzinger, the former director of the sleep neuroimaging program at the University of Pittsburgh's medical school, told me. “Most people self-regulate anyway. If they're cold, they put on an extra blanket. If they're too warm, they throw off the blanket.”

“Truthfully, there's not a lot of data supporting those tips,” Suzanne Bertisch, a behavioral-sleep-medicine expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston, told me. That includes the proscription on naps, she added, quite commonly issued in her world. (In general, the research on naps suggests that short ones have beneficial outcomes and long ones have negative outcomes, but as always, cause and effect are difficult to disentangle: An underlying health condition could be driving those long naps.)

Even when they weren't deliberately debunking the conventional wisdom about sleep, many of the scholars I spoke with mentioned—sometimes practically as an aside—facts that surprised or calmed. For instance: Many of us night owls have heard that the weather forecast for our old age is … well, cloudy, to be honest, with a late-afternoon chance of keeling over. According to one large analysis, we have a 10 percent increase in all-cause mortality over morning larks. But Jeanne Duffy, a neuroscientist distinguished for her expertise in human circadian rhythms at Brigham and Women's, told me she suspected that this was mainly because most night owls, like most people, are obliged to rise early for their job.

So wait, I said. Was she implying that if night owls could contrive work-arounds to suit their biological inclination to go to bed late, the news probably wouldn't be as grim?

“Yes,” she replied.

A subsequent study showed that the owl-lark mortality differential dwindled to nil when the authors controlled for lifestyle. Apparently owls are more apt to smoke, and to drink more. So if you're an owl who's repelled by Marlboros and Jameson, you're fine.

Kelly Glazer Baron, the director of the behavioral-sleep-medicine program at the University of Utah, told me that she'd love it if patients stopped agonizing over the length of their individual sleep phases. I didn't get enough deep sleep, they fret, thrusting their Apple Watch at her. I didn't get enough REM. And yes, she said, insufficiencies in REM or slow-wave sleep can be a problem, especially if they reflect an underlying health issue. But clinics don't look solely at sleep architecture when evaluating their patients.

“I often will show them my own data,” Baron said. “It always shows I don't have that much deep sleep, which I find so weird, because I'm a healthy middle-aged woman.” In 2017, after observing these anxieties for years, Baron coined a term for sleep neuroticism brought about by wearables: orthosomnia.

But most surprising—to me, anyway—was what I heard about insomnia and the black dog. “There are far more studies indicating that insomnia causes depression than depression causes insomnia,” said Wilfred Pigeon, the director of the Sleep & Neurophysiology Research Laboratory at the University of Rochester. Which is not to say, he added, that depression can't or doesn't cause insomnia. These forces, in the parlance of health professionals, tend to be “bidirectional.”

But I can't tell you how vindicating I found the idea that perhaps my own insomnia came first. A couple of years into my struggles with sleeplessness, a brilliant psychopharmacologist told me that my new condition had to be an episode of depression in disguise. And part of me thought, Sure, why not? A soundtrack of melancholy had been playing at a low hum inside my head from the time I was 10.

The thing was: I became outrageously depressed only after my insomnia began. That's when that low hum started to blare at a higher volume. Until I stopped sleeping, I never suffered from any sadness so crippling that it prevented me from experiencing joy. It never impeded my ability to socialize or travel. It never once made me contemplate antidepressants. And it most certainly never got in the way of my sleeping. The precipitating factor in my own brutal insomnia was, and remains, an infuriating mystery.

Sleep professionals, I have learned, drink a lot of coffee. That was the first thing I noticed when I attended SLEEP 2024, the annual conference of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, in Houston: coffee, oceans of it, spilling from silver urns, especially at the industry trade show. Wandering through it was a dizzying experience, a sprawling testament to the scale and skyscraping profit margins of Big Sleep. More than 150 exhibitors showed up. Sheep swag abounded. Drug reps were everywhere, their aggression tautly disguised behind android smiles, the meds they hawked called the usual names that look like high-value Scrabble words.

I've never understood this branding strategy, honestly. If you want your customers to believe they're falling into a gentle, natural sleep, you should probably think twice before calling your drug Quviviq.

I walked through the cavernous hall in a daze. It was overwhelming, really—the spidery gizmos affixed to armies of mannequins, the Times Square–style digital billboards screaming about the latest in sleep technology.

At some point it occurred to me that the noisy, overbusy, fluorescent quality of this product spectacular reminded me of the last place on Earth a person with a sleep disorder should be: a casino. The room was practically sunless. I saw very few clocks. After I spent an afternoon there, my circadian rhythms were shot to hell.

But the conference itself …! Extraordinary, covering miles of ground. I went to one symposium about “sleep deserts,” another about the genetics of sleep disturbance, and yet another about sleep and menopause. I walked into a colloquy about sleep and screens and had to take a seat on the floor because the room was bursting like a suitcase. Of most interest to me, though, were two panels, which I'll shortly discuss: one about how to treat patients with anxiety from new-onset insomnia, and one on whether hypnotics are addictive.

My final stop at the trade fair was the alley of beauty products—relevant, I presume, because they address the aesthetic toll of sleep deprivation. Within five minutes, an energetic young salesman made a beeline for me, clearly having noticed that I was a woman of a certain age. He gushed about a $2,500 infrared laser to goose collagen production and a $199 medical-grade peptide serum that ordinarily retails for $1,100. I told him I'd try the serum. “Cheaper than Botox, and it does the same thing,” he said approvingly, applying it to the crow's-feet around my eyes.

I stared in the mirror. Holy shit. The stuff was amazing.

“I'll take it,” I told him.

He was delighted. He handed me a box. The serum came in a gold syringe.

“You're a doctor, right?”

A beat.

“No,” I finally said. “A journalist. Can only a dermatologist—”

He told me it was fine; it's just that doctors were his main customers. This was the sort of product women like me usually had to get from them. I walked away elated but queasy, feeling like a creep who'd evaded a background check by purchasing a Glock at a gun show.

The first line of treatment for chronic, intractable sleeplessness, per the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, or CBT-I. I've tried it, in earnest, at two different points in my life. It generally involves six to eight sessions and includes, at minimum: identifying the patient's sleep-wake patterns (through charts, diaries, wearables); “stimulus control” (setting consistent bedtimes and wake-up times, resisting the urge to stare at the clock, delinking the bed from anything other than sleep and sex); establishing good sleep habits (the stuff of every listicle); “sleep restriction” (compressing your sleep schedule, then slowly expanding it over time); and “cognitive restructuring,” or changing unhealthy thoughts about sleep.

The cognitive-restructuring component is the most psychologically paradoxical. It means taking every terrifying thing you've ever learned about the consequences of sleeplessness and pretending you've never heard them.

I pointed this out to Wilfred Pigeon. “For the medically anxious, it's tough,” he agreed. “We're trying to tell patients two things at the same time: ‘You really need to get your sleep on track, or you will have a heart attack five years earlier than you otherwise would.' But also: ‘Stop worrying about your sleep so much, because it's contributing to your not being able to sleep.' And they're both true!”

Okay, I said. But if an insomniac crawls into your clinic after many years of not sleeping (he says people tend to wait about a decade), wouldn't they immediately see that these two messages live in tension with each other? And dwell only on the heart attack?

“I tell the patient their past insomnia is water under the bridge,” Pigeon said. “We're trying to erase the added risks that ongoing chronic insomnia will have. Just because a person has smoked for 20 years doesn't mean they should keep smoking.”

He's absolutely right. But I'm not entirely convinced that these incentives make the cognitive dissonance of CBT-I go away. When Sara Nowakowski, a CBT-I specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, gave her presentation at SLEEP 2024's panel on anxiety and new-onset insomnia, she said that many of her patients start reciting the grim data from their Fitbits and talking about dementia.

That's likely because they've read the studies. Rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, that vivid-dream stage when our eyes race beneath our eyelids like mice under a blanket, is essential to emotional regulation and problem-solving. Slow-wave sleep, our deepest sleep, is essential for repairing our cells, shoring up our immune systems, and rinsing toxins from our brains, thanks to a watery complex of micro-canals called the glymphatic system. We repair our muscles when we sleep. We restore our hearts. We consolidate memories and process knowledge, embedding important facts and disposing of trivial ones. We actually learn when we're asleep.

Many insomniacs know all too well how nonnegotiably vital sleep is, and what the disastrous consequences are if you don't get it. I think of the daredevil experiment that Nathaniel Kleitman, the father of sleep research, informally conducted as a graduate student in 1922, enlisting five classmates to join him in seeing how long they could stay awake. He lasted the longest—a staggering 115 hours—but at a terrible price, temporarily going mad with exhaustion, arguing on the fifth day with an imaginary foe about the need for organized labor. And I think of Allan Rechtschaffen, another pioneer in the field, who in 1989 had the fiendish idea to place rats on a spinning mechanism that forced them to stay awake if they didn't want to drown. They eventually dropped dead.

So these are the kinds of facts a person doing CBT-I has to ignore.

Still. Whether a patient's terrors concern the present or the future, it is the job of any good CBT-I practitioner to help fact-check or right-size them through Socratic questioning. During her panel at SLEEP 2024, Nowakowski gave very relatable examples:

When you're struggling to fall asleep, what are you most worried will happen?

I'll lose my job/scream at my kids/detonate my relationship/never be able to sleep again. 

And what's the probability of your not falling asleep?

I don't sleep most nights. 

And the probability of not functioning at work or yelling at the kids if you don't?

Ninety percent.

She then tells her patients to go read their own sleep diary, which she's instructed them to keep from the start. The numbers seldom confirm they're right, because humans are monsters of misprediction. Her job is to get her patients to start decatastrophizing, which includes what she calls the “So what?” method: So what if you have a bad day at work or at home? You've had others. Will it be the end of the world? (When my second CBT-I therapist asked me this, I silently thought, Yes, because when I'm dangling at the end of my rope, I just spin more.) CBT-I addresses anxiety about not sleeping, which tends to be the real force that keeps insomnia airborne, regardless of what lofted it. The pre-sleep freaking out, the compulsive clock-watching, the bargaining, the middle-of-the-night doom-prophesizing, the despairing—CBT-I attempts to snip that loop. The patient actively learns new behaviors and attitudes to put an end to their misery.

But the main anchor of CBT-I is sleep-restriction therapy. I tried it back when I was 29, when I dragged my wasted self into a sleep clinic in New York; I've tried it once since. I couldn't stick with it either time.

The concept is simple: You severely limit your time in bed, paring away every fretful, superfluous minute you'd otherwise be awake. If you discover from a week's worth of sleep-diary entries (or your wearable) that you spend eight hours buried in your duvet but sleep for only five of them, you consolidate those splintered hours into one bloc of five, setting the same wake-up time every day and going to bed a mere five hours before. Once you've averaged sleeping those five hours for a few days straight, you reward your body by going to bed 15 minutes earlier. If you achieve success for a few days more, you add another 15 minutes. And then another … until you're up to whatever the magic number is for you.

No napping. The idea is to build up enough “sleep pressure” to force your body to collapse in surrender.

Sleep restriction can be a wonderful method. But if you have severe insomnia, the idea of reducing your sleep time is petrifying. Technically, I suppose, you're not really reducing your sleep time; you're just consolidating it. But practically speaking, you are reducing your sleep, at least in the beginning, because dysregulated sleep isn't an accordion, obligingly contracting itself into a case. Contracting it takes time, or at least it did for me. The process was murder.

“If you get people to really work their way through it—and sometimes that takes holding people's hands—it ends up being more effective than a pill,” Ronald Kessler, a renowned psychiatric epidemiologist at Harvard, told me when I asked him about CBT-I. The problem is the formidable size of that if. “CBT-I takes a lot more work than taking a pill. So a lot of people drop out.”

They do. One study I perused had an attrition rate of 40 percent.

Twenty-six years ago, I, too, joined the legions of the quitters. In hindsight, my error was my insistence on trying this grueling regimen without a benzodiazepine (Valium, Ativan, Xanax), though my doctor had recommended that I start one. But I was still afraid of drugs in those days, and I was still in denial that I'd become hostage to my own brain's terrorism. I was sure that I still had the power to negotiate. Competence had until that moment defined my whole life. I persuaded the doctor to let me try without drugs.

As she'd predicted, I failed. The graphs in my sleep diary looked like volatile weeks on the stock exchange.

For the first time ever, I did need an antidepressant. The doctor wrote me a prescription for Paxil and a bottle of Xanax to use until I got up to cruising altitude—all SSRIs take a while to kick in.

I didn't try sleep restriction again until many years later. Paxil sufficed during that time; it made me almost stupid with drowsiness. I was sleepy at night and vague during the day. I needed Xanax for only a couple of weeks, which was just as well, because I didn't much care for it. The doctor had prescribed too powerful a dose, though it was the smallest one. I was such a rookie with drugs in those days that it never occurred to me I could just snap the pill in half.

Have I oversimplified the story of my insomnia? Probably. At the top of the SLEEP 2024 panel about anxiety and new-onset insomnia, Leisha Cuddihy, a director at large for the Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine, said something that made me wince—namely, that her patients “have a very vivid perception of pre-insomnia sleep being literally perfect: ‘I've never had a bad night of sleep before now.' ”

Okay, guilty as charged. While it's true that I'd slept brilliantly (and I stand by this, brilliantly) in the 16 years before I first sought help, I was the last kid to fall asleep at slumber parties when I was little. Cuddihy also said that many of her patients declare they're certain, implacably certain, that they are unfixable. “They feel like something broke,” she said.

Which is what I wrote just a few pages back. Poisoned, broke, same thing.

By the time Cuddihy finished speaking, I had to face an uncomfortable truth: I was a standard-issue sleep-clinic zombie.

But when patients say they feel like something broke inside their head, they aren't necessarily wrong. An insomniac's brain does change in neurobiological ways.

“There is something in the neurons that's changing during sleep in patients with significant sleep disruptions,” said Eric Nofzinger, who, while at the University of Pittsburgh, had one of the world's largest databases of brain-imaging studies of sleeping human beings. “If you're laying down a memory, then that circuitry is hardwired for that memory. So one can imagine that if your brain is doing this night after night …”

We know that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, our body's first responder to stress, is overactivated in the chronically underslept. If the insomniac suffers from depression, their REM phase tends to be longer and more “dense,” with the limbic system (the amygdala, the hippocampus—where our primal drives are housed) going wild, roaring its terrible roars and gnashing its terrible teeth. (You can imagine how this would also make depressives subconsciously less motivated to sleep—who wants to face their Gorgon dreams?) Insomniacs suffering from anxiety experience this problem too, though to a lesser degree; it's their deep sleep that's mainly affected, slimming down and shallowing out.

And in all insomniacs, throughout the night, the arousal centers of the brain keep clattering away, as does the prefrontal cortex (in charge of planning, decision making), whereas in regular sleepers, these buzzing regions go offline. “So when someone with insomnia wakes up the next morning and says, ‘I don't think I slept at all last night,' in some respects, that's true,” Nofzinger told me. “Because the parts of the brain that should have been resting did not.”

And why didn't they rest? The insomniac can't say. The insomniac feels at once responsible and helpless when it comes to their misery: I must be to blame. But I can't be to blame. The feeling that sleeplessness is happening to you, not something you're doing to yourself, sends you on a quest for nonpsychological explanations: Lots of physiological conditions can cause sleep disturbances, can't they? Obstructive sleep apnea, for instance, which afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Many autoimmune diseases, too. At one point, I'll confess that I started asking the researchers I spoke with whether insomnia itself could be an autoimmune disorder, because that's what it feels like to me—as if my brain is going after itself with brickbats.

“Narcolepsy appears to be an example of a sleep disorder involving the immune system,” Andrew Krystal, a psychiatrist specializing in sleep disorders at UCSF, told me.

What? I said. Really?

Really, he replied. “There are few things I know of,” he said, “that are as complicated as the mammalian immune system.”

But insomnia-as-autoimmune-disorder is only a wisp of a theory, a wish of a theory, nothing more. In her memoir, The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping, the novelist Samantha Harvey casts around for a physiological explanation, too. But after she completes a battery of tests, the results come back normal, pointing to “what I already know,” she writes, “which is that my sleeplessness is psychological. I must carry on being the archaeologist of myself, digging around, seeing if I can excavate the problem and with it the solution—when in truth I am afraid of myself, not of what I might uncover, but of managing to uncover nothing.”

I didn't tolerate my Paxil brain for long. I weaned myself off, returned to normal for a few months, and assumed that my sleeplessness had been a freak event, like one of those earthquakes in a city that never has them. But then my sleep started to slip away again, and by age 31, I couldn't recapture it without chemical assistance. Prozac worked for years on its own, but it blew out whatever circuit in my brain generates metaphors. When I turned to the antidepressants that kept the electricity flowing, I needed sleep medication too—proving, to my mind, that melancholy couldn't have been the mother of my sleep troubles, but the lasting result of them. I've used the lowest dose of Klonopin to complement my SSRIs for years. In times of acute stress, I need a gabapentin or a Unisom too.

Unisom is fine. Gabapentin also turns my mind into an empty prairie.

Edibles, which I've also tried, turn my brain to porridge the next day. Some evidence suggests that cannabis works as a sleep aid, but more research, evidently, is required. (Sorry.)

Which brings me to the subject of drugs. I come neither to praise nor to bury them. But I do come to reframe the discussion around them, inspired by what a number of researcher-clinicians said about hypnotics and addiction during the SLEEP 2024 panel on the subject. They started with a simple question: How do you define addiction?

It's true that many of the people who have taken sleep medications for months or years rely on them. Without them, the majority wouldn't sleep, at least in the beginning, and a good many would experience rebound insomnia if they didn't wean properly, which can be even worse. One could argue that this dependence is tantamount to addiction.

But: We don't say people are addicted to their hypertension medication or statins, though we know that in certain instances lifestyle changes could obviate the need for either one. We don't say people are addicted to their miracle GLP-1 agonists just because they could theoretically diet and exercise to lose weight. We agree that they need them. They're on Lasix. On Lipitor. On Ozempic. Not addicted to.

Yet we still think of sleep medications as “drugs,” a word that in this case carries a whiff of stigma—partly because mental illness still carries a stigma, but also because sleep medications legitimately do have the potential for recreational use and abuse.

But is that what most people who suffer from sleep troubles are doing? Using their Sonata or Ativan for fun?

“If you see a patient who's been taking medication for a long time,” Tom Roth, the founder of the Sleep Disorders and Research Center at Henry Ford Hospital, said during the panel, “you have to think, ‘Are they drug-seeking or therapy-seeking ?' ” The overwhelming majority, he and other panelists noted, are taking their prescription drugs for relief, not kicks. They may depend on them, but they're not abusing them—by taking them during the day, say, or for purposes other than sleep.

Still, let's posit that many long-term users of sleep medication do become dependent. Now let's consider another phenomenon commonly associated with reliance on sleep meds: You enter Garland and Hendrix territory in a hurry. First you need one pill, then you need two; eventually you need a fistful with a fifth of gin.

Yet a 2024 cohort study, which involved nearly 1 million Danes who used benzodiazepines long-term, found that of those who used them for three years or more—67,398 people, to be exact—only 7 percent exceeded their recommended dose.

Not a trivial number, certainly, if you're staring across an entire population. But if you're evaluating the risk of taking a hypnotic as an individual, you'd be correct to assume that your odds of dose escalation are pretty low.

That there's a difference between abuse and dependence, that dependence doesn't mean a mad chase for more milligrams, that people depend on drugs for a variety of other naturally reversible conditions and don't suffer any stigma—these nuances matter.

“Using something where the benefits outweigh the side effects certainly is not addiction,” Winkelman, the Harvard psychiatrist and chair of the panel, told me when we spoke a few months later. “I call that treatment.”

The problem, he told me, is when the benefits stop outweighing the downsides. “Let's say the medication loses efficacy over time.” Right. That 7 percent. And over-the-counter sleep meds, whose active component is usually diphenhydramine (more commonly known as Benadryl), are potentially even more likely to lose their efficacy—the American Academy of Sleep Medicine advises against them. “And let's say you did stop your medication,” Winkelman continued. “Your sleep could be worse than it was before you started it,” at least for a while. “People should know about that risk.”

A small but even more hazardous risk: a seizure, for those who abruptly stop taking high doses of benzodiazepines after they've been on them for a long period of time. The likelihood is low—the exact percentage is almost impossible to ascertain—but any risk of a seizure is worth knowing about. “And are you comfortable with the idea that the drug could irrevocably be changing your brain?” Winkelman asked. “The brain is a machine, and you're exposing it to the repetitive stimulus of the drug.” Then again, he pointed out, you know what else is a repetitive stimulus? Insomnia.

“So should these things even be considered a part of an addiction?” he asked. “At what point does a treatment become an addiction? I don't know.”

Calvinist about sleep meds, blasé about sleep meds—whatever you are, the fact remains: We're a nation that likes them. According to a 2020 report from the National Center for Health Statistics, 8.4 percent of Americans take sleep medications most nights or every night, and an additional 10 percent take them on some. Part of the reason medication remains so popular is that it's easy for doctors to prescribe a pill and give a patient immediate relief, which is often what patients are looking for, especially if they're in extremis or need some assistance through a rough stretch. CBT‑I, as Ronald Kessler noted, takes time to work. Pills don't.

But another reason, as Suzanne Bertisch pointed out during the addiction-and-insomnia-meds panel, is that “primary-care physicians don't even know what CBT-I is. This is a failure of our field.”

Even if general practitioners did know about CBT-I, too few therapists are trained in it, and those who are tend to have fully saturated schedules. The military, unsurprisingly, has tried to work around this problem (sleep being crucial to soldiers, sedatives being contraindicated in warfare) with CBT-I via video as well as an online program, both shown to be efficacious. But most of us are not in the Army. And while some hospitals, private companies, and the military have developed apps for CBT-I too, most people don't know about them.

For years, medication has worked for me. I've stopped beating myself up about it. If the only side effect I'm experiencing from taking 0.5 milligrams of Klonopin is being dependent on 0.5 milligrams of Klonopin, is that really such a problem?

There's been a lot of confusing noise about sleep medication over the years. “Weak science, alarming FDA black-box warnings, and media reporting have fueled an anti-benzodiazepine movement,” says an editorial in the March 2024 issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry. “This has created an atmosphere of fear and stigma among patients, many of whom can benefit from such medications.”

A case in point: For a long time, the public believed that benzodiazepines dramatically increased the risk of Alzheimer's disease, thanks to a 2014 study in the British Medical Journal that got the usual five-alarm-fire treatment by the media. Then, two years later, another study came along, also in the British Medical Journal, saying, Never mind, nothing to see here, folks; there appears to be no causal relationship we can discern.

That study may one day prove problematic, too. But the point is: More work needs to be done.

A different paper, however—again by Daniel Kripke, the fellow who argued that seven hours of sleep a night predicted the best health outcomes—may provide more reason for concern. In a study published in 2012, he looked at more than 10,000 people on a variety of sleep medications and found that they were several times more likely to die within 2.5 years than a matched cohort, even when controlling for a range of culprits: age, sex, alcohol use, smoking status, body-mass index, prior cancer. Those who took as few as 18 pills a year had a 3.6-fold increase. (Those who took more than 132 had a 5.3-fold one.)

John Winkelman doesn't buy it. “Really,” he told me, “what makes a lot more sense is to ask, ‘Why did people take these medications in the first place?' ” And for what it's worth, a 2023 study funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that people on stable, long-term doses of a benzodiazepine who go off their medication have worse mortality rates in the following 12 months than those who stay on it. So maybe you're damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Still, I take Kripke's study seriously. Because … well, Christ, I don't know. Emotional reasons? Because other esteemed thinkers still think there's something to it?

In my own case, the most compelling reasons to get off medication are the more mundane ones: the scratchy little cognitive impairments it can cause during the day, the risk of falls as you get older. (I should correct myself here: Falling when you're older has the potential to be not mundane, but very bad.) Medications can also cause problems with memory as one ages, even if they don't cause Alzheimer's, and the garden-variety brain termites of middle and old age are bummer enough.

And maybe most generally: Why have a drug in your system if you can learn to live without it?

My suspicion is that most people who rely on sleep drugs would prefer natural sleep.

So yes: I'd love to one day make a third run at CBT-I, with the hope of weaning off my medication, even if it means going through a hell spell of double exhaustion. CBT-I is a skill, something I could hopefully deploy for the rest of my life. Something I can't accidentally leave on my bedside table.

Some part of me, the one that's made of pessimism, is convinced that it won't work no matter how long I stick with it. But Michael Irwin, at UCLA, told me something reassuring: His research suggests that if you have trouble with insomnia or difficulty maintaining your sleep, mindfulness meditation while lying in bed can be just as effective as climbing out of bed, sitting in a chair, and waiting until you're tired enough to crawl back in—a pillar of CBT‑I, and one that I absolutely despise. I do it sometimes, because I know I should, but it's lonely and freezing, a form of banishment.

And if CBT-I doesn't work, Michael Grandner, the director of the sleep-and-health-research program at the University of Arizona, laid out an alternative at SLEEP 2024: acceptance and commitment therapy, or ACT. The basic idea is exactly what the name suggests. You accept your lot. You change exactly nothing. If you can't sleep, or you can't sleep enough, or you can sleep only in a broken line, you say, This is one of those things I can't control. (One could see how such a mantra might help a person sleep, paradoxically.) You then isolate what matters to you. Being functional the next day? Being a good parent? A good friend? If sleep is the metaphorical wall you keep ramming your head against, “is your problem the wall?” Grandner asked. “Or is your problem that you can't get beyond the wall, and is there another way?”

Because there often is another way. To be a good friend, to be a good parent, to be who and whatever it is you most value—you can live out a lot of those values without adequate sleep. “When you look at some of these things,” Grandner said, “what you find is that the pain”—of not sleeping—“is actually only a small part of what is getting in the way of your life. It's really less about the pain itself and more about the suffering around the pain, and that's what we can fix.”

Even as I type, I'm skeptical of this method too. My insomnia was so extreme at 29, and still can be to this day, that I'm not sure I am tough enough—or can summon enough of my inner Buddha (barely locatable on the best of days)—to transcend its pain, at once towering and a bore. But if ACT doesn't work, and if CBT-I doesn't work, and if mindfully meditating and acupuncture and neurofeedback and the zillions of other things I've tried in the past don't work on their own … well … I'll go back on medication.

Some people will judge me, I'm sure. What can I say? It's my life, not theirs.

I'll wrap up by talking about an extraordinary man named Thomas Wehr, once the chief of clinical psychobiology at the National Institute of Mental Health, now 83, still doing research. He was by far the most philosophical expert I spoke with, quick to find (and mull) the underlayer of whatever he was exploring. I really liked what he had to say about sleep.

You've probably read the theory somewhere—it's a media chestnut—that human beings aren't necessarily meant to sleep in one long stretch but rather in two shorter ones, with a dreamy, middle-of-the-night entr'acte. In a famous 2001 paper, the historian A. Roger Ekirch showed that people in the pre-electrified British Isles used that interregnum to read, chat, poke the fire, pray, have sex. But it was Wehr who, nearly 10 years earlier, found a biological basis for these rhythms of social life, discovering segmented sleep patterns in an experiment that exposed its participants to 14 hours of darkness each night. Their sleep split in two.

Wehr now knows firsthand what it is to sleep a divided sleep. “I think what happens as you get older,” he told me last summer, “is that this natural pattern of human sleep starts intruding back into the world in which it's not welcome—the world we've created with artificial light.”

There's a melancholy quality to this observation, I know. But also a beauty: Consciously or not, Wehr is reframing old age as a time of reintegration, not disintegration, a time when our natural bias for segmented sleep reasserts itself as our lives are winding down.

His findings should actually be reassuring to everyone. People of all ages pop awake in the middle of the night and have trouble going back to sleep. One associates this phenomenon with anxiety if it happens in younger people, and no doubt that's frequently the cause. But it also rhymes with what may be a natural pattern. Perhaps we're meant to wake up. Perhaps broken sleep doesn't mean our sleep is broken, because another sleep awaits.

And if we think of those middle-of-the-night awakenings as meant to be, Wehr told me, perhaps we should use them differently, as some of our forebears did when they'd wake up in the night bathed in prolactin, a hormone that kept them relaxed and serene. “They were kind of in an altered state, maybe a third state of consciousness you usually don't experience in modern life, unless you're a meditator. And they would contemplate their dreams.”

Night awakenings, he went on to explain, tend to happen as we're exiting a REM cycle, when our dreams are most intense. “We're not having an experience that a lot of our ancestors had of waking up and maybe processing, or musing, or let's even say ‘being informed' by dreams.”

We should reclaim those moments at 3 or 4 a.m., was his view. Why not luxuriate in our dreams? “If you know you're going to fall back asleep,” he said, “and if you just relax and maybe think about your dreams, that helps a lot.”

This assumes one has pleasant or emotionally neutral dreams, of course. But I take his point. He was possibly explaining, unwittingly, something about his own associative habits of mind—that maybe his daytime thinking is informed by the meandering stories he tells himself while he sleeps.

The problem, unfortunately, is that the world isn't structured to accommodate a second sleep or a day informed by dreams. We live unnatural, anxious lives. Every morning, we turn on our lights, switch on our computers, grab our phones; the whir begins. For now, this strange way of being is exclusively on us to adapt to. Sleep doesn't much curve to it, nor it to sleep. For those who struggle each night (or day), praying for what should be their biologically given reprieve from the chaos, the world has proved an even harsher place.

But there are ways to improve it. Through policy, by refraining from judgment—of others, but also of ourselves. Meanwhile, I take comfort in the two hunter-gatherer tribes Wehr told me about, ones he modestly noted did not confirm his hypothesis of biphasic sleep.

How 20,000 steps became a new sign of wellness.

According to my phone, I've been averaging about 6,600 steps a day so far this year. My meager effort pales in comparison to the 15,000, 20,000, or even 30,000 steps I see influencers on my feed bragging about regularly.

The algorithm likes to remind me of my shortcomings. Although the long-held standard benchmark of 10,000 steps has been debunked, it seems many are aiming even higher these days. TikTok and Instagram feed me clip after clip of productive people racking upward of seven miles over the course of three-plus hours and multiple walks. They wake up at 4 am to walk. They walk and check emails. They walk and read. They walk to the grocery store or during meetings. They stride on walking pads, treadmills, and outdoors. They flash their Apple Watches to the camera to show their progress.

To be clear: There is nothing wrong with walking — it's a free and low-impact exercise that, compared to running, has greater mass appeal. Americans are overwhelmingly sedentary, spending an average of 9.5 hours a day seated, and anything that inspires people to move more is good news. But quantifying your every step, tracking every ounce of protein ingested, or hours slept can border on obsessive. The current cultural fixation on nutrition and fitness also speaks to a shift toward beauty standards that once again idealize thinness. Mix that with American hustle culture, and you have a recipe for turning a low-key activity into a compulsion. 

“This all comes down to how much our culture values productivity above everything else,” says Keith Diaz, an associate professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. “It's just another metric that we measure ourselves by.”

Walking is perhaps one of the most functional and accessible forms of movement: It gets you where you want to go, and you don't need any special equipment to do it. The vast majority of people walk at some point during their day without having to think too much about it. It makes sense, then, that walking has come in and out of fashion as a form of exercise throughout history. In the late 1800s, leisure walking became a popular sport. A century later, at the height of the fitness boom in the 1980s, walking got a rebrand and a refresh, thanks to a book called Heavyhands touting the benefits of walking with weights. “That became,” says Danielle Friedman, the author of Let's Get Physical: How Women Discovered Exercise and Reshaped The World, “a way to make walking not seem weak.”

To achieve a textbook hot girl walk, you must walk four miles while expressing gratitude and envisioning your goals.

The pandemic was a major boon for walking. With gyms and fitness studios closed and cabin fever setting in, many took to strolling as a way to get moving out of the house. Walking was gentler and less punishing than the high-intensity fitness trends of the early 2000s, Friedman says. “The pendulum swung a little bit more toward just appreciating movement for movement's sake,” she says. But as social media caught on — the original “hot girl walk” clip was posted on TikTok in January 2021 — walks became more performative. Walking now had a purpose. To achieve a textbook hot girl walk, for instance, you must walk four miles while expressing gratitude and envisioning your goals. Over time, the step counts ballooned.

Keeping careful track of your mileage also has a long history. The first modern pedometer was designed in 1965 in Japan. Called the manpo-kei, or 10,000 steps meter, this simple act of marketing helped cement the 10,000-step threshold as a benchmark that one should strive to hit for good health and well-being.

The science doesn't quite back up the marketing. Recent research has found that among women in their 70s, as few as 4,400 steps a day is related to lower mortality, compared to 2,700 steps or less. Those who walked more had even less risk for early mortality, but those benefits tapered off at more than about 7,500 steps. Another study of middle-aged adults found that those who took 8,000 steps were less likely to die early from heart disease and cancer compared to those who only took 4,000 steps. Again, the benefits plateaued after 8,000 steps. Similar findings suggest that 7,000 steps was the magic number (the studies, it should be noted, were observational and could not prove causation.) If you're walking for health, 7,000 to 8,000 steps, however, seems like a pretty good bet.

These days, everyone's got a step counter in their pocket or on their wrist. Health tracking apps on phones and wearables like the Apple Watch, Oura, Fitbit, and Whoop have made it much easier to account for every single step. Health-related tracking can be extremely motivating when it comes to behavior change. When you have specific health or fitness goals, tracking is a good way to measure success. “You have a target and you have a means to measure it,” Diaz says, “which is great.” 

At the same time, you should want to engage in that activity because you like it and not because your watch or an influencer is telling you to move. Unless you're intrinsically motivated to achieve that goal — I walk because I like the way it feels — tracking can veer into compulsion. Once you've hit a benchmark of 10,000 or 15,000 or 20,000 steps, you may feel compelled to meet, or exceed, it every day or else fall into a shame and anxiety spiral. “When the Fitbit first came out,” Diaz says, “I used it for a couple weeks, and I just had to put it away because I couldn't do it anymore. If I didn't hit 10,000 steps in a day, it'd be nine o'clock at night and…I'd be circling my little, tiny living room for 20 minutes just to get my steps to where I need them to be. I'm sitting there, like how is this healthy in any way, shape, or form that I'm obsessing over a number?”

Although quantifying an activity increases how often you do it, you start to enjoy it less.

Soon, something that previously brought you enjoyment can start to feel like work. Although quantifying an activity (like counting steps or the number of pages read) increases how often you do it, you start to enjoy it less, a 2016 study found. This change can happen within a few days of tracking, the study's author Jordan Etkin, a professor of marketing at Duke University, says. 

When participants were able to see their results, they would continue the activity. But when they weren't shown their data, they lost the motivation to continue. “The reasons for doing the activity shift from being because you like it or find some other value in it,” Etkin says, “to being because it gives you this sense of accomplishment and productivity. When you don't get that anymore, because you're not tracking how many of these things you're doing, it's less valuable to you.”

Instead of just moving for movement's sake, perpetual tracking assigns status and morality to basic bodily functions. Hitting a certain step count is “good” and having a low readiness score is “bad.” The number acts as a marker of wellness. These days, the ideal embodiment of that wellness has pivoted back toward thinness. No longer is a step just a step or a gram of protein a bit of nourishment — it's all in service of optimization of a skinnier, healthier self. People who track their health want every step to count, to matter, Etkin says. If it isn't being documented, it may as well not have happened. “That introduces new dynamics into how people decide what and whether and when to do things,” she says, “based on whether it's going to be recorded.”

By no means should you stop walking if it improves your mental and physical health. But if the pressure of hitting a specific target every day causes anxiety or you're unable to forgo walking for a day, you may need to reconsider your relationship with your goals. This is “because you're obsessing over this outward signal, and it becomes this unhealthy striving for perfectionism,” Diaz says. People can start to ignore their body's cues for rest and push themselves to injury.

In order to maintain a more flexible outlook on your goals, Diaz suggests setting a range target — maybe 8,000 to 12,000 steps a day — or weekly benchmarks. If you know you're going to be moving a lot on the weekend, you won't be so fixated on a weekday where your step count is lower.

Any wellness lifestyle should be sustainable. If your body and schedule allow for 20,000 steps a day, go for it. If it feels like a chore, you run the risk of burning out. It's worth asking yourself if any of your fitness-related hobbies are still enjoyable or if they inspire stress or obligation, Diaz says. Fitness isn't always fun, but it should, hopefully, relieve anxiety, not cause it.

The animal researcher who tried to experience the world through the nose of a dog.

Dog people tend to be pretty confident they know what's going on with their animals. 

When we put out a call on the Explain It to Me podcast for dog owners to tell us about their connection to their furry friends, the responses ranged from “soul dog” to “love of my life” to “I believe I can read my dog's mind.” 

But how well can we see inside a dog's mind, really? That's a question Alexandra Horowitz has been investigating for decades. She runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College in New York and has written four books on how dogs experience the world. 

When we called her up for our episode, she told Explain It to Me guest host Noam Hassenfeld that understanding that experience starts with the nose. 

The Explain It to Me newsletter answers an interesting question from an audience member in a digestible explainer from one of our journalists.

“They are smelling animals. Smell is their primary sense,” Horowitz said. “My interest is in saying, ‘Okay, let's try to understand the dog's way of seeing the world through their nose, instead of just assuming that they're just like us, but furrier and sitting on the floor where I'm sitting on a couch.'”

Horowitz talked to Noam about her experience with nose-first living, how dogs' smell shapes their perception of time, and whether, after all these years of research, she feels any more confident she knows what's going on with her fuzzy friends. Below is a transcript edited for length and clarity. But make sure to listen to the whole thing—it's a great interview.

How do you start to take a dog's point of view? You did a little experiment about this at one point, right? Where you pretended to be a dog? Or how should I put that?

Yeah, I tried to step into some of the dog's behaviors in order to understand them a little bit. Humans are visual creatures, right? We see the world first, and we assume the world is out there looking like it is to everybody, the way it looks to us. Of course, it doesn't. 

But if you're a smelling creature, how do you see the world? Smells don't just appear when you open your nose. If you look at dog behavior, they go and search out smells, right? They spend a lot of time with their nose on the ground or smelling objects that are nose height. And they sniff a lot more than we do. Our sniffs are pretty feeble, and they'll do seven sniffs a second if they wanna get a really good sense of something. And so I tried to do those things. 

That was just the first step, going around and saying, like, “All right, what are smells down at dog height? And what does something smell like if I put my nose right up to it?”

I feel like I need to get a bit more detail here. Where are you walking around trying to smell things at dog height?

Well, I did this in New York City. Right where I live.

If a friend met us and my dog sniffed the friend, I also sniffed the friend.

So no one gave you a second thought, right? Because it's New York City.

Oh no, people moved away from me, that's for sure. But I walked out of my house and followed what my dog did. Where he sniffed, I would lean down and sniff with him. Is it a tree post protecting a tree from people on the sidewalk? Is it a bush? Is it the grass? I didn't sniff other dog butts cause there are other issues involved there, but, you know, if a friend met us and my dog sniffed the friend, I also sniffed the friend.

What do you think this experience of trying to smell everything the dog smells told you about what it might be like to be a dog?

The big lesson for me was that, unlike the way I had characterized smells in my life, which I think is very human, as good or bad, right? Smells are something appealing, maybe a food smell, or something unappealing, like in New York, garbage in the summer is a very distinctive smell. But for dogs, smells are just information about the way the world is. So their world is wrought of smells the way ours is wrought of visual images.

You know, when I think of looking at the world, I create a spatial map of the world, right? Like, I'll walk through my apartment and I'll look around. Here's the door, here's the window, here's the hall. What does that mean for the world you live in if you're mapping it by smelling it?

Smells move, and that's one of the interesting things about them. We know this — you have a cup of coffee, you put it on the table, and you can smell it on the other side of the table. So where that coffee is, is a slightly different space to a, let's say, purely olfactory creature than to a visual creature. It's right in the cup to me, but to somebody who's seeing the world through smell, it's in this whole kind of universe around the cup as the smells go into the air. 

Oh, that's fascinating.

So things are casting off smells all the time. That doesn't mean that there's nothing concrete and real. It just means that it's a little more transient than we see.

Does the way a dog relies on smell also change their perception of time? 

Yeah, I think time is in smell. My presence in this room really smells to my dog. And when I've been gone for an hour, I'm still sort of in the room to them, but a little less. After a day, I'm a lot less in the room. And so they're sort of...noting time, time passing by the changeability of smells.

There's something reassuring in the fact that I'm still here when I'm not here for them.

Wow. That is kind of beautiful and also kind of sad. I don't know, imagining you fading slowly out of a room, it feels like a very different type of thing to experience.

Maybe I haven't ever thought of it as sad. I mean in a way, there's something reassuring in the fact that I'm still here when I'm not here for them. When I come home and I've been with another dog or I've had some experience which might potentially leave an odor on my clothes, they can experience that by just smelling me, and seeing where I've been. To me, that's extra neat, you know, not melancholy.

A lot of the people we've heard from in this episode — they talk about this ability to understand their dog and this connection they have. And then talking to you, it seems we're actually just really different. What does that difference mean to you? Do you find that difference exciting? Do you find that difference daunting?

As an experimenter, I do find it daunting that they're quite different than we are perceptually, and therefore probably cognitively, but also exciting, right? There's a lot of possibilities, a lot of things we can investigate and learn. As a person who lives with dogs, there's the mystery of it — the mystery of what it's like to be a smelling creature. Even though there's this fundamental difference between us, we co-exist and seem to share a lot of things. We share space and share a life. I find that mystery delightful, and I don't try to solve it in my ordinary life.

Lululemon is going after Costco, saying it copied the designs of some of its most popular product lines.

The Vancouver-based athleisure brand filed a lawsuit against Costco on Friday in California court, accusing it of ripping off the designs of its yoga jackets and chinos.

In the 49-page filing, it spotlighted three product lines — its Scuba hoodies and sweatshirts, Define jackets, and ABC pants — saying Costco had created ""confusingly similar"" dupes of them. It said Costco had infringed its ""trade dress,"" a broad trademark law that protects the look and feel of a product.

In the lawsuit, Lululemon put pictures of Costco's and its products side by side in tables to emphasize design similarities. For example, it compared Costco's Kirkland men's pants, priced at $19.90, to the $128 ABC men's pants.

It also compared Costco's Spyder women's yoga jacket, which retails for $21.90, to the Lululemon Define jacket, which retails for $128.

""There is even a hashtag 'LululemonDupes' on social media platforms such as TikTok that social media influencers use when promoting these copycat products,"" Lululemon said in the filing. ""The Infringing Products create an improper association with Plaintiffs' authentic products.""

Lululemon said it wanted damages from Costco in the form of lost profits and compensation for patent infringement. It also wants Costco to stop manufacturing and selling more products that are ""identical or confusingly similar"" to Lululemon's clothing.

Costco has yet to respond to Lululemon's lawsuit. Representatives for Lululemon and Costco didn't respond to requests for comment.

Lululemon has accused other companies of copyright infringement.

In 2021, the brand sued exercise equipment company Peloton after it launched its clothing line. Lululemon used similar wording in that lawsuit, saying Peloton's products looked ""confusingly similar"" to its own Align leggings. The two companies settled the lawsuit in September 2022.

In 2012, Lululemon sued Calvin Klein, saying the latter infringed design patents on its now discontinued Astro yoga pants' signature waistband and design. But it withdrew the lawsuit in the same year after the parties agreed to a confidential settlement.

Elon Musk on Friday announced Tesla had accomplished a major self-driving milestone: The company's first fully autonomous Model Y drove itself to its new home.

""The first fully autonomous delivery of a Tesla Model Y from factory to a customer home across town, including highways, was just completed a day ahead of schedule!!"" Musk said in a post on X.

Tesla's much-anticipated launch of its Full Self-Driving technology has been repeatedly delayed over the years. Musk initially promised Tesla's cars would demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017. Despite the persistent delays, the Model Y delivery still marks a major success for the company.

Musk, in his posts on X announcing the feat, added: ""There were no people in the car at all and no remote operators in control at any point. FULLY autonomous! To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully autonomous drive with no people in the car or remotely operating the car on a public highway.""

On Saturday, Tesla posted a full, 30-minute video of the driverless delivery, with the footage showing the autonomous Model Y driving at speeds of over 70 miles an hour on the highway.

While the Model Y's highway voyage makes it among the first passenger vehicles to drive itself on an interstate without a human operator, Waymo autonomous cars were granted regulatory approval to start testing their driverless capabilities on freeways in 2024, according to their website — however, while testing is underway, Waymo's robotaxis can't take riders on the highway yet.

Self-driving freight trucks from Aurora have also been operating in Texas since early May, including traversing Interstate 45, where the typical speed limit is between 70 and 75 miles per hour.

Ashok Elluswamy, a Tesla engineer, said in a separate post on X that the Model Y achieved a maximum speed of 72 miles per hour on the highway.

Responding to Elluswamy, Musk said the pace was ""Zippy!""

The exact route that the Model Y took or the speed limits along the way were unclear.

Representatives for Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Pretty much every potential homebuyer looks for houses on the internet, scouring listings for the right facade and envisioning their couch in glossy photos of empty living rooms. A lot of the time, that digital touring pays off: The National Association of Realtors recently found that about half of purchasers end up finding the winning property online. For many house hunters, the never-ending cyberquest for that dream home includes a stop (or many) at Zillow.

If you count yourself among the 221 million monthly visitors who scan Zillow or one of its affiliated portals, like Trulia, you probably won't notice any change in your home-scrolling habit on June 30. But it's an important date for the biggest name in home search. Behind the scenes, Zillow is using its vast machinery to fight a battle that could determine where you find your next house — and whether it even appears on Zillow at all.

Starting Monday, Zillow will be banning home listings that have been marketed publicly by a real estate agent — which includes everything from planting a for-sale sign in the front yard to posting on Facebook — without being shared in the local databases that feed home listings to the rest of the real estate industry, including Zillow and other search websites, within one business day. The move is part of a broader fight over ""exclusive inventory"" or ""hidden homes"" — basically, properties advertised in some places but not others. In an attempt to seize more control over their listings, agents at some real estate brokerages have been advertising homes in internal databases or posting them only on their own websites, out of reach of the search portals.

While the fight has been going on for a few years, things have recently turned especially ugly. Compass, the largest real estate brokerage in the US by sales volume, sued Zillow in federal court last week over the new blacklist, and industry execs have spent months trading barbs via social media, speeches, and email blasts that reached thousands of agents across the country.

The back-and-forth leaves homebuyers and sellers in a weird spot. I've spent months talking to people around the industry about the hidden listings issue, and I'm left with one big conclusion: If you decide to hire an agent (which most people do), you should go into that relationship with open eyes. The rules of the game are changing. Consumers need to make sure they know exactly what they're getting from their agents and how much they'll be paying for those services. Buyers' agents should also be able to explain how they'll navigate a shifting landscape in which some listings may become harder to find.

Big companies are squabbling because they need your clicks, your home listings, and, ultimately, the commission checks that flow from your deal. Whether you're a buyer or seller, your business is especially valuable right now. It can be daunting, but the upheaval may be advantageous if you play your next home transaction correctly.

Every real estate company has a huge financial stake in this war over listings. Zillow's new policy is an attempt to stem the rising tide of ""exclusive inventory,"" or homes marketed outside the multiple listing services, the formal name for the more than 500 local databases that distribute listings among fellow agents, big brokerages, and the popular search portals. Instead of being entered into the MLS, these ""hidden"" houses are shared among agents who belong to the same brokerage, swapped in clubby groups known as private listing networks, or posted exclusively on one brokerage's website without being distributed more widely. The leader of the push toward this walled-garden approach is Compass, which maintains its own trove of thousands of homes that you can only see by working with one of their agents. But it's far from the only company doing this — other major players, such as Howard Hanna, are increasingly leaning on hidden listings. Still others have threatened that they could do the same if the market fractures further.

Zillow really doesn't like this shift. The company depends on selling leads tied to the mountain of listings in its portal: When you signal your interest in a property on its website, Zillow will typically pass along your contact info to an agent who pays a fee to the site — not the agent who actually listed the house for sale. If the spigot of home listings gets cut off, search portals like Zillow are in trouble. Beyond self-interest, the company says it's also fighting for something far more noble: a fair and transparent housing market, in which listings are readily available for everyone to see. Buyers just want to see all the houses out there, Zillow execs say, and sellers can draw out the best offers when their homes get maximum exposure. Plenty of agents around the industry resent Zillow for the power it wields, but even some who have beef with the search giant have told me they agree with its basic point: A wide-open market is best for consumers.

Kirk Simmon, a 20-year veteran agent in the suburbs of Philadelphia, touts what he calls a ""public inclusive"" approach — a play on Compass's ""Private Exclusive"" listings, which are distributed internally among Compass agents and their clients. For the vast majority of people — except, maybe, A-list celebrities or those who desire true privacy — Simmon advises sharing a home listing as widely as possible.

""Why would you ever sell your house without the public knowing and everybody being included?"" Simmon tells me.

Dick Selzer, the owner and general manager of a Re/Max-affiliated brokerage in northern California, agrees. ""Candidly, I hate to come to the aid of Zillow because I don't particularly like them,"" Selzer tells me. But, he says, ""My job is not to be happy with Zillow. My job is to do the best I can for my client.""

I've gotten a similar message from Compass agents on the opposite side of the aisle, who say they'll stick with their marketing strategy despite Zillow's new rule.

""I'm not going to let them bully me into doing things that are detrimental to my clients,"" Jennifer Knoll, a Compass agent in the Washington, DC, area, told me recently, emphasizing that she always has clear discussions with her clients about their marketing plans.

Compass says the search portal's new policy is just an attempt to protect its market dominance. Robert Reffkin, Compass's CEO, argues that sellers benefit from testing their home listings with a limited audience before blasting them out more widely. The Compass website, unlike Zillow, Realtor.com, or any of the other big search websites, doesn't track price cuts or show how long a house has been sitting on the market, information that Reffkin says harms sellers. Compass can also monetize leads through its own website rather than handing those opportunities to a portal like Zillow.

The main thing consumers need to know is that they can — and should — be part of this conversation. Sellers should know exactly how their agent plans to market their home, and why they're doing what they're doing. Some of this comes down to just reading the forms. One of Compass's disclosure forms, for instance, warns sellers that listing homes off the MLS may ""reduce"" the number of potential buyers who learn about the property, the number of offers, and ultimately, the sale price (94% of Compass's listings last year eventually sold via the MLS, the company says, even though many were initially marketed in Compass's internal database). The form also warns sellers of the chance that their house won't show up on Zillow if the listing's advertisements run afoul of the search giant's new policy. A Compass spokesperson said in an email that while the company's research shows that consumers benefit from pre-marketing, the disclosure form reflects the fact that the company cannot guarantee results. One thing is clear: Sellers should know the trade-offs baked into any marketing plan for their home.

For buyers, a whole other set of rules from a massive legal settlement against the real estate industry last year dictate that before you so much as step into a house with an agent as your guide, you have to sign an agreement that outlines the terms of the agent's services and how much they expect to be paid. Buyers can no longer coast on the assumption that their agents' services are free, and they should make sure they're getting their money's worth. And though many homes are available in the major search portals these days, buyers have always relied upon agents to dig up the houses that can't be found online. That's not changing anytime soon, especially in markets that are still starved for available inventory. One Zillow economist recently told Business Insider that, after a tumultuous home search this spring, he eventually purchased a home that had not been officially listed for sale — his agent had heard of a homeowner who could be prompted to sell for the right offer.

Again, you probably won't notice anything different on Zillow or any of the other popular search portals in the coming weeks. Zillow has spent the past month warning agents whose home advertisements violate its new rules, and while the company won't say exactly how many listings it's flagged so far, Errol Samuelson, Zillow's chief industry development officer, said in an email statement that the company expects ""only a small number of for-sale listings will be affected.""

Everyone involved in this fight is scrambling to protect their slice of the pie. Savvy consumers should have no illusions about where they stand in this ecosystem. This may be happening out of sight, but buyers and sellers alike lose if they keep it out of mind.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated it wouldn't make sense for the government to ramp up sales of longer-term securities given where yields are today, though he held out hope that interest rates across maturities will be falling as inflation slows.

“Why would we do that?” Bessent said in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday when asked about increasing the share of longer-term securities in Treasury debt issuance. “The time to have done that would have been in 2021, 2022.”","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

GOP Tax Bill:

The US Capitol in Washington, DC.

Senate Republicans are moving forward with a plan to mask the $3.8 trillion cost of extending expiring tax cuts in President Donald Trump's signature economic legislation by using an unprecedented accounting maneuver. 

GOP senators voted Monday in favor of the plan to count the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts as costing nothing, over objections from Democrats and despite concerns raised by economists about the US debt trajectory. ","{'href': 'https://www.bloomberg.com', 'title': 'Bloomberg.com'}","business"

The Japanese company stopped selling on Amazon after noticing that third-party merchants were offering games for sale in the US at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, according to a person familiar with the situation.

President Donald Trump is championing a revival of American fossil fuels with calls to “drill baby drill.” But in the US energy capital, a pullback in the industry has already left its mark.

A wave of consolidation — with more than $450 billion of oil and natural gas deals since the start of 2023 — has led companies to cut jobs and abandon corporate campuses.

The former Apple designer loves the age-old tool, perhaps enough to make it a landmark AI device.

Can Sam Altman and Jony Ive turn this into an AI-enabled device?

The hottest new collaboration in Silicon Valley is between OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman and Jony Ive, the former Apple Inc. designer credited with giving iPhones, Macs and AirPods their sleek, covetous look. Altman bought Ive's startup for $6.5 billion earlier this year, releasing a slickly produced video to tease a new “family” of devices that would let people “use AI to create all sorts of wonderful things.” 

OpenAI has kept its plans a secret, but here's what we know: The first so-called AI device won't have a screen and it won't be something you can wear, according to recent filings in an unrelated court case. It probably won't look anything like the Humane Pin, a pioneering AI gadget that failed spectacularly. So what will it be?

Enthusiasm for all things artificial intelligence has helped propel stocks to another all-time high, but the AI ecosystem is getting close to a potential pullback, warned legendary short-seller Jim Chanos.   

The founder of Chanos & Co. likened the dominance of AI companies to networking giants such as Cisco and Lucent which characterized the market of the 1990s and saw their stocks soar as companies upgraded their systems to handle the new internet age. At a live recording of the Odd Lots podcast in New York, he cautioned that a potential pullback in demand from corporate customers for AI-related goods and services could spark a contraction in both corporate earnings and economic growth.

Senators on Monday began offering amendments to President Donald Trump's megabill, following a weekend of tense negotiations to try to get the president's second-term domestic priorities through the upper chamber.

The process, called a ""vote-a-rama,"" began shortly after 9 a.m. ET, and it was not yet clear how long it could go on. Eight hours or more is not unusual.

The votes on the first slate of amendments fell largely along party lines, as expected.

Some Democratic-led amendments did garner Republican support, however.

Sen. Ed Markey, Mass., for instance, introduced an change to the bill that sought to remove any language that would ""force rural hospitals to limit their services or actually close their doors"" due to cuts to Medicaid or Medicare, Markey said on the Senate floor.

Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats in favor of the amendment. Even so, that only added up to 49 yay votes, versus 51 nays from the rest of the GOP conference, meaning the amendment failed.

Senators are allowed to introduce unlimited amendments to the budget bill, forcing the chamber to cast back-to-back votes.

Lots of Democrats and even some Senate Republicans, Collins included, had signaled ahead of the vote-a-rama that they intended to file several amendments.

The majority of the amendments won't win the necessary 50 votes to get into the bill. But that's not always the point. For many of the amendments, the purpose is to send a political message, or to highlight various senators' opposition to, or support for, different pieces of the massive package. For example, Democrats will try to force Republicans to cast votes in favor of some of the more controversial parts of the bill, like Medicaid work requirements and the end of tax credits for electric vehicles.

Not only do these votes make individual Republicans squirm, but later on they can be used to make attack ads when that senator is up for reelection. Republicans, meanwhile, are using the amendment process in part to log their personal opposition to specific parts of the bill, even though they ultimately plan to vote in favor of its passage.

The vote-a-rama was initially set to begin late Sunday or early Monday following hours of debate on the 940-page package, but senators pushed the votes to Monday morning.

Lawmakers worked through the weekend to try to get Trump's bill across the finish line as Republicans' self-imposed July 4 deadline looms.

Republicans eked out a key procedural win late Saturday, with just two GOP senators — Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky — voting against a motion to advance the bill.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota is presiding over an extremely narrow majority, so he can only afford to lose one more vote in the final ballot — in addition to Tillis and Paul — and still pass the package.

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., an outspoken critic of the bill, signaled Monday that he is not committed to backing the package, in a sign of possible trouble for Thune.

Johnson ultimately voted to advance the bill during the Saturday procedurally vote, but that was only after he switched his vote at the 11th hour.

Even if Thune is able to get the bill through his chamber, it faces an uncertain path in the House, where lawmakers must approve the revisions made by the upper chamber.

Some House Republicans have already signaled objections to changes in the Senate version of the ""big, beautiful bill.""

House Republican leadership, for its part, has told its members to prepare for votes on the package Tuesday or Wednesday, Politico reports.

Google on Monday announced a partnership with Commonwealth Fusion Systems, or CFS, a private company spun off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which marks the tech giant's first commercial commitment to fusion.

The company unveiled plans to buy 200 megawatts of clean fusion power from what CFS describes as the world's first grid-scale fusion power plant, known as ARC, based in Chesterfield County, Virginia.

ARC is expected to come online and generate 400 megawatts of clean, zero-carbon power in the early 2030s, which is enough energy to power large industrial sites or roughly 150,000 homes, according to CFS. The agreement also gives Google the option to purchase power from additional ARC plants.

Google, which has invested in CFS since 2021, said it also increased its stake in the Devens, Massachusetts-based company.

Google and CFS did not disclose the financial terms.

""We're excited to make this longer-term bet on a technology with transformative potential to meet the world's energy demand, and support CFS in their effort to reach their scientific and engineering milestones needed to get there,"" Michael Terrell, head of advanced energy at Google, said in a statement.

Fusion is a process that takes light atomic nuclei and heats them to over 100 million degrees Celsius. At these temperatures, the fuel becomes a plasma, which eventually causes the nuclei to fuse and release significant amounts of energy. The energy is then captured to create carbon-free electricity.

CFS is one of many firms racing to achieve commercial-scale fusion energy and Google has invested in others. Earlier this month, Google announced continued funding for TAE Technologies, a California-based fusion energy company.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

Fundstrat's Tom Lee is joining a little known bitcoin miner aiming to become the biggest publicly traded holder of ether.

Lee, a high-profile market strategist known for his prescient bitcoin price forecasts and stock predictions, has been appointed chairman of the board of directors of BitMine Immersion Technologies, effective Monday. The company also announced a $250 million private placement to implement a buying strategy around ether, which it aims to make its primary treasury reserve asset while continuing with its core bitcoin mining business.

Lee's appointment comes amid a groundswell of interest around stablecoins following the successful IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle at the beginning of the month and positive momentum pushing potential stablecoin legislation through Congress.

""The financial services industry and crypto are converging and it really started with stablecoins, which is the ChatGPT of crypto because it's viral adoption by consumers, business banks and now even Visa,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" Monday. ""Underneath the stablecoin industry is Ethereum – that is really the backbone and architecture of stablecoins so it's important to create a project that accumulates Ethereum to essentially protect and have some influence on the network.""

The company will monitor the value of ether held per company share as a key performance metric going forward, Lee added, similar to MicroStrategy's bitcoin-per-share metric ""BTC Yield."" BitMine can increase the value of ETH held per share ""by a combination of reinvestment of the company's cash flows, capital markets activities, and by the change in value of ETH,"" Lee said in a statement.

Companies are increasingly looking past bitcoin for crypto treasury management strategies. BitMine joins the publicly listed betting platform SharpLink Gaming, which initiated an ether treasury strategy in May and appointed Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors. DeFi Development is focused on a similar strategy for the Solana token.

Ahead of this transaction, BitMine had a very tiny market value of just $26 million with lightly traded shares that were down 45% on the year.

Clean energy stocks fell Monday as President Donald Trump's spending legislation now includes a tax on wind and solar projects using Chinese components and abruptly phases out key credits.

Shares of NextEra Energy, the largest renewable developer in the U.S., fell 4%. Solar stocks Array Technologies, Enphase and Nextracker were down between 1% and 9%.

The Senate is voting Monday on amendments to the legislation. The current draft ends the two most important tax credits for solar and wind projects placed in service after 2027.

""The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country,"" Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted on X over the weekend. ""Utterly insane and destructive. It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.""

Previous versions of the bill were more flexible, allowing projects that began construction before 2027 to qualify for the investment and electricity production tax credits, according to Monday note from Goldman Sachs.

The change ""compresses project timelines and adds significant execution risk,"" Bank of America analyst Dimple Gosal told clients in a note Monday. ""Developers with large '25 pipelines, may struggle to meet the new deadlines — potentially delaying or downsizing planned investments.""

The Senate legislation also slaps a tax on solar and wind projects that enter service after 2027 if they use components made in China.

""The latest draft in the Senate has become more restrictive for most renewable players, moving toward a worst case outcome for solar and wind, with a few improvements for subsectors on the margin,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Andrew Percoco told clients in a Sunday note.

To be sure, the rooftop solar industry is viewed by Wall Street as a relative winner from the bill, with Sunrun shares up more than 13% and SolarEdge trading more than 6% higher on Monday. The legislation seems to allow tax credits for leased rooftop systems to remain in place through the end of 2027, which was not the case in previous versions, according to Goldman Sachs.

And First Solar is up more than 9% as the legislation seems to allow the manufacturer to claim credits for both components and final products, according to Bank of America.

In this article

Moderna on Monday said its experimental mRNA-based flu vaccine produced a stronger immune response than a currently available shot in a late-stage trial, clearing a path forward for the product and the company's separate combination flu and Covid jab.

Moderna in May voluntarily withdrew an application seeking approval of its combination shot targeting Covid-19 and influenza, saying it had plans to resubmit it with efficacy data from the phase three trial on its stand-alone flu vaccine. That decision came after discussions with the Food and Drug Administration, which is grappling with a massive overhaul under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic.

With the new data, the company plans to resubmit the application for the combination vaccine and file for approval of its stand-alone flu shot later this year, Stephen Hoge, the company's head of research and development, said in an interview.

If regulators approve the flu vaccine, the company can then advance the combination shot, Hoge said. He added that Moderna expects approvals for both shots next year pending reviews.

Moderna shares climbed nearly 3% in premarket trading Monday.

Hoge said the combination jab simplifies vaccination, which will ""help the health-care system"" by reducing the workloads of doctors and nurses, slashing costs, and improving uptake among patients.

The company so far appears to be the front-runner in the race against Pfizer and Novavax to bring a combination shot to the market. While Moderna does not have specific revenue projections for its individual products, Hoge said Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus are each multibillion-dollar markets.

""We're obviously hoping that our products allow us to earn our fair share of them,"" he said.

The phase three trial followed more than 40,000 adults ages 50 and above, who were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Moderna's shot, called mRNA-1010, or a standard competitor vaccine. Moderna's shot was 26.6% more effective than the other vaccine in the overall study population. 

The mRNA-1010 jab also demonstrated strong efficacy for each of the major influenza strains in the shot, including A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and the B/Victoria lineages. Moderna said the vaccine's benefit was consistent across different age groups, people with various risk factors and previous vaccination status against the flu. 

In adults ages 65 and older, the shot was 27.4% more effective than the standard flu vaccine. 

The efficacy results are ""a significant milestone in our effort to reduce the burden of influenza in older adults,"" Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a release. ""The severity of this past flu season underscores the need for more effective vaccines.""

Moderna cited data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing that seasonal flu-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits reached a 15-year high during the 2024 to 2025 season of the virus. More than 600,000 Americans were hospitalized due to flu-related illness last year, according to the CDC. 

The mRNA-1010 vaccine's safety data was consistent with previous results from another phase three study on the shot. 

Shares of Moderna were down more than 30% for the year entering Monday, fueled in large part by a string of moves by the Trump administration to change vaccine policy and undermine immunizations. The administration in May canceled a contract awarded to Moderna for the late-stage development of its bird flu vaccine for humans. 

When asked about the uncertain regulatory environment in the U.S., Hoge said Moderna is engaging closely with the FDA to understand what its requirements are and how to satisfy them.

""I believe, as relates to flu, I think we've got a pretty clear path,"" he said.

U.S. stocks have strongly rebounded after a rough start to the year, even as the outlook for the world's largest economy and its interest rates remains as uncertain as ever.

Economic modeling is ""very difficult"" right now because ""things are changing constantly,"" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday, pointing to Canada's recent walk-back on its digital services tax.

Market participants are also closely-watching the latest progress of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" which cleared a key Senate hurdle over the weekend. 

From an inflation perspective, that means focusing on the expectations of businesses and consumers, along with the actions they are taking in response, Bostic continued.

""The story there is that we are really starting to hear clear signs that they're expecting to raise prices, but how high and when that will happen is still quite unknown,"" he said.

More businesses are reporting that they may not reach a final strategy on tariffs until 2026, so their impact on growth and price rises ""could be a much more extended period than I think many expect,"" Bostic added.

The latest Fed ""dot plot,"" a map of members' expectations for rates, shows the wide range of different outlooks among officials for the economy, which Bostic said ""really does speak to the uncertainty that's out there.""

Fed Chair Jerome Powell last week stressed the need to hold monetary policy until the impact of tariffs on prices clarifies, but markets subsequently pinned their expectations on a lower Fed Funds rate range. Data from CME Group's FedWatch tool shows around a 50% probability of three quarter-point rate cuts by the end of the year, along with a 10% probability of a greater trim to a range of 3.25%-3.5% from the current 4.25%-4.5%.

Gilles Moëc, group chief economist at AXA Investment Managers, on Monday said that the new interest rate expectations were a reaction to the latest round of Trump's attacks on Powell. This again raised the prospect of the U.S. president naming Powell's successor in the near future in a bid to undermine his authority. 

Trump has sharply criticized the Fed for holding interest rates, and his pick would be expected to be supportive of rate reductions, even if this were opposed by the majority of voting members.

""Naming the next [Fed] President well ahead of the end of Powell's term – materialising the much talked-about ""shadow Fed"" scenario – could be the harbinger of lasting volatility"" and turn foreign investors further away from U.S. assets, Moëc said.

The S&P 500 closed at an all-time high on Friday, coming back from early-April lows when it was down nearly 18% in the year to date. The index has logged big swings amid the White House's ongoing tariff story, the latest chapter of which introduced a framework trade agreement between the U.S. and China that helped boost market sentiment last week.

The U.S. trade deal with the U.K. meanwhile went into force on Monday, reducing tariffs on British cars and aerospace parts, but keeping a baseline duty of 10% in place on most goods.

The two countries have yet to finalize a deal on steel imports — while broader U.S. steel tariff policy is keeping prices elevated stateside and depressed elsewhere.

The White House remains locked in negotiations with numerous key trading partners, including Canada, the European Union, Taiwan, Japan and India.

""Markets at the moment are I think taking a very naive view of what's happening on the trade front,"" Bob Parker, senior advisor at the International Capital Markets Association, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

""We could easily be having this discussion at the end of the year or potentially going in to 2026, as we all know carrying out trade agreements is very complicated and lengthy,"" Parker said. ""And as we saw over the weekend with Canada, there is a serious risk of trade negotiations failing.""

He added that, with the European Union in particular, even if the July 9 deadline to reach an agreement is extended, several sticking points could see an elevated level of tariffs stay in place.

Something I rarely, if ever, say: What a wonderful Monday morning!

On Friday stateside, the S&P 500 broke its previous record. Celebrations were shared with the Nasdaq Composite, which also hit a new high. The tech-heavy index enjoyed a liftoff from Nvidia and Microsoft, both of which reached all-time highs (and probably made some insiders at Nvidia multi-millionaires over the past month).

Tariff relief buoyed sentiment in markets. China announced it had finalized details of its deal with the United States. And even though U.S. President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs are due to kick in (again) one week later, he suggested that his administration ""can do whatever we want"" regarding the 90-day pause.

Postponing the return of those tariffs would give investors further cheer and put another feather, perhaps of the chicken variety, in their caps.

That said, as Trump giveth, so does he taketh away.

The S&P 500 was up as much as 0.76% at one point during Friday's trading session, but stumbled after the U.S. president slammed the door shut on trade talks with Canada over its digital services tax. The index dipped only slightly, but that nonetheless shaved off some gains from what could have been a higher high.

Even though Canada has since rescinded the tax, this episode shows how Trump is still steering markets.

U.S. markets open just as Europe trading begins winding down. May it be in Trump's nature to be a giver, to borrow Chappell Roan's words — so Monday can end as well as it began.

New record for S&P 500. The broad-based index rose 0.52% to close at 6,173.07 Friday, surpassing its previous high of 6,147.43. U.S. futures climbed Sunday evening stateside. On Monday, Asia-Pacific markets mostly rose.

China manufacturing activity contracted in June. Even though the official purchasing managers' index improved from May's reading, it's still below the 50-point mark, making it the third consecutive month of contraction.

Canada walks back on its digital services tax. The country's decision, released Sunday night local time, follows Trump's announcement that the U.S. is ending trade discussions because of said tax.

'Very wealthy people' ready to buy TikTok. Speaking at a Fox News interview on Sunday, Trump said he can reveal the identities of those individuals in about two weeks, but the deal depends on Beijing's approval.

[PRO] Eyes on U.S. jobs numbers. June's nonfarm payrolls report comes out Thursday and could determine if the rally in U.S. markets continues. Investors will only have half a day to react: U.S. markets close early Thursday and are dark Friday.

How BP became a potential takeover target

For weeks, market tongues have been wagging about a potential merger between Britain's oil giants — until, ending weeks of speculation, Shell on Thursday denied reports that it's in talks to acquire BP.

But how did we get to the point that BP, a U.K. oil exploration company that was founded in 1909 under the name Anglo-Persian Oil Company, is now seen as a possible takeover target for its long-time rival?

U.S. President Donald Trump told Fox News in an interview aired on Sunday that he has a group of ""very wealthy people"" ready to buy TikTok, whose identities he can reveal in about two weeks.

Trump added that the deal will probably need Beijing's approval to move forward, but said ""I think President Xi will probably do it,"" in reference to China's leader Xi Jinping.

The president made the off-the-cuff remarks while discussing the possibility of another pause of his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo."" 

Tiktok's fate in the U.S. has been in doubt since the approval of a law in 2024 that sought to ban the platform unless its Chinese owner, ByteDance, divested from it. The legislation was driven by concerns that the Chinese government could manipulate content and access sensitive data from American users.

Earlier this month, Trump extended the deadline for ByteDance to divest from the platform's U.S. business. It was his third extension since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok law just a few days before Trump's second presidential inauguration in January. The new deadline is Sept. 17. 

The Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, of PAFACA, had originally been set to take effect on Jan. 19, after which app store operators and internet service providers would be penalized for supporting TikTok.

TikTok went dark in the U.S. ahead of the original deadline, but was restored after Trump provided it with assurances on the extension.

Trump, who credited the app with boosting his support among young voters in the last presidential election, has maintained that he would like to see the platform stay afloat under new ownership. 

Potential buyers that have voiced interest in the app include Trump insiders such as Oracle's Larry Ellison to firms like AppLovin and Perplexity AI. 

However, it's unclear if ByteDance would be willing to sell the company. Any potential divestiture is likely to require approval from the Chinese government.

A deal that would have spun off TikTok's U.S. operations and allowed ByteDance to retain a minority position had been in the works in April, but was derailed by the announcement of Donald Trump's tariffs on China, Reuters reported that month.

The president previously floated a proposal for American stakeholders to buy the company and then sell a 50% stake to the U.S. government as part of a joint venture. 

Experts have previously told CNBC that any potential deal could face legal challenges in the U.S., depending on whether it complies with PAFACA.

LONDON – The U.K.-U.S. trade deal comes into play on Monday, giving a preferential tariff rate to British cars imported to America, while questions linger over final levies on the U.K.'s metal exports.

Back in May, the U.K. became the first country to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S. since White House leader Donald Trump unveiled his so-called reciprocal tariffs a month prior. The terms of the agreement are effective as of June 30.

Under the deal, a blanket 10% tariff now applies to U.K. goods imported into the United States.

It will also see the first 100,000 vehicles sold from the U.K. to the U.S. every year subjected to a 10% tariff. Any further vehicles sent to the U.S. will receive a 25% import duty.

According to figures from influential autos trade body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), around 102,000 cars manufactured in Britain were exported to the U.S. last year.

Mike Hawes, CEO of the SMMT said on Monday that the deal was ""a huge relief for the U.K. automotive companies that export to this critically important market.""

""It immediately slashes the punitive tariffs that brought the US export market to a standstill and threatened the viability of some of the most famous names in British manufacturing,"" he said in a statement.

The U.S. has a trade surplus on goods with Britain, meaning it exports more to the U.K. than it imports. Cars are the U.K.'s largest export to the United States, with the U.S. emerging as the top buyer of British cars globally. Last year, 27.4% of all U.K. car exports were shipped to America.

The 10-25% tariff range is sharply lower from the 50% levy slapped on vehicles imported to the U.S. from other trade partners.

Britain's deal with the U.S. will also remove duties from Britain's aerospace sector.

But London is still working on bringing down tariffs on key industrial metals.

While Britain is the only nation that currently has a preferential 25% tariff rate on its steel and aluminum exports to the U.S., compared to a larger 50% for other American trade partners, the two nations have spoken of reducing tariffs on British steel to 0%. The U.S. is the fourth-biggest export market for British iron and steel.

The U.K. government said on Monday that ""we will continue go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed.""

But negotiations over steel tariffs have been stymied by the U.S.'s ""melt and pour"" rule on steel imports, according to Jon Carruthers-Green, steel market analyst at MEPS international. The guidance was introduced under the previous administration and only categorizes a product as U.K.-produced if it is melted and poured in Britain.

That is not the case for many of the semi-finished products which arrive and are finalized at the major Tata Steel plant in Wales, which sources from its other plants in countries such as India and the Netherlands.

""Tata has the ultimate decision and they won't stop taking that material from elsewhere, so the only way out of this [for the U.K.] might be if deals are struck for other countries or for the rest of the industry,"" Carruthers-Green said.

Trump's initial tariff announcement caused an immediate jump in U.S. steel prices, which remain elevated even after paring gains. 

""Asia and Europe are still dealing with overcapacity which has depressed prices… in Europe that means the steel industry is really struggling,"" Carruthers-Green said.

Also on Monday, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer touted the ""historic"" trade deal as one that will be ""safeguarding key industries that are vital to our economy"" and protecting jobs.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets.

European stocks retreated on the first trading day of the week after a chunky gain last week.

The Stoxx Europe 600 was provisionally down 0.4%. Regionally, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX were also down 0.4%. France's CAC 40 fell by 0.3%.

The worst performer on the index was Danish turbine-maker Vestas Wind, with a loss of about 8%, over changes to wind energy regulation in the U.S.

Germany's Bayer was the third biggest loser due to the U.S. Supreme Court delaying a decision on a long-running litigation over its weedkiller.

— Ganesh Rao

Bayer shares fell nearly 5% after the company said the U.S. Supreme Court was seeking the view of the U.S. government on its subsidiary Monsanto's long-running weedkiller litigation.

The move by the top court would add further delays to the Durnell case, where Bayer is seeking relief on potentially billions of dollars in damages.

""We see this request as an encouraging step,"" said Bayer CEO Bill Anderson.

— Ganesh Rao

Stocks traded up on Monday morning.

The S&P 500 rose 0.4% just after the opening bell, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also advanced 207 points, or 0.5%.

— Sean Conlon

Germany's annual inflation rate unexpectedly eased to 2% in June, bringing Europe's largest economy in line with the European Central Bank's target, preliminary data from statistics office Destatis showed Monday.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 2.2% in the twelve months to June.

The German print is harmonized across the euro zone, allowing for a direct comparison with other single currency states.

The consumer price index had eased to 2.1% in the year to May.

Despite an upbeat start, the Stoxx 600 is trading just below the flatline in early afternoon deals. The worst performer on the index so far today has been Danish turbine-maker Vestas Wind, last down around 5.5%.

In a Monday note, analysts at Citi said the latest text of U.S. President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" looked ""incrementally negative for wind.""

That's in part due to proposed changes to the rules surrounding tax credits for wind projects, which will become more restrictive, and a potential new tax on wind developments that have ""material assistance"" from foreign entities of concern.

While this would not technically apply to Vestas, ""the complexity of supply chains could leave operators fearful"" and ""potentially prevent new orders being placed in the near term, even to western suppliers,"" according to Citi.

However, they added that while the bill would provoke an initial negative reaction in Vestas shares, its scaling in offshore and European market growth story supported the stock longer-term.

Analysts at Sydbank meanwhile took a positive view on the stock in a Monday note, maintaining their ""buy"" recommendation.

""The Senate has submitted a bill with significant reductions in subsidies for onshore wind. This increases the risk of a significant and drastic decline in activity levels in the years after 2027, but may open up a very high order intake from the US in 2025 and 2026 for Vestas,"" they wrote, according to a Google translation.

The U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. came into effect today, slashing tariffs on British-made autos and removing levies on Britain's aerospace sector.

But while U.K. steel has also been given a preferential tariff rate of 25%, compared with 50% for other trade partners, questions remain over when — and by how much — tariffs on U.K. metals can be reduced further, as promised.

The U.K. government said Monday that it is still working with The Trump administration to bring tariffs on Britain's core steel products down to 0%.

The regional Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index was last seen trading 1.3% lower, with French vehicle parts supplier Valeo leading losses on a 2.8% drop.

The Stoxx Aerospace and Defense index was 0.8% higher, meanwhile, with Britain's QinetiQ and Rolls-Royce both gaining around 1.5%.

Speaking to CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" this morning, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic emphasized how hard it has become for the Federal Reserve to make inflation forecasts amid fast-changing U.S. policy and foreign relations — citing Canada's recent walk-back on its digital services tax as an example.

Bostic said he is therefore focusing on the inflation expectations of businesses and consumers and the actions they are taking, and where he sees risks to the outlook for taming price rises.

""The textbook story for economics is, if you do tariffs, it's a one time shift. It happens quickly,"" Bostic said.

""What we are seeing today, though, is not just a one-time shift, it's actually something that's being stretched out over a much longer period of time. I think that runs the risk that people start to feel like inflation is always with them, this elevated level of inflation is always with them.""

""And that then runs the risk that there might be some some structural changes that businesses, and consumers for that matter, make in terms of how they respond and how they engage in the marketplace.""

Bostic, who is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, also told CNBC he doesn't think the data will support an interest rate move in July and that he see's the so-called ""terminal rate"" — neither stimulating nor restricting inflation and growth — ""somewhere in the mid threes."" The current federal funds rate is 4.25%-4.5%.

Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo has called for a revamped Eurogroup — the informal body comprised of finance ministers for euro zone member states — days after announcing his candidacy for presidency of the group.

Cuerpo told CNBC the group needs to be ""more agile, more efficient in decision making,"" adding that he has a track record of bringing people to the table and striking deals. Eurogroup will vote on its next president on July 7. 

Three European finance or economy ministers have put themselves forward for the role, with Irish incumbent Paschal Donohoe facing competition from Lithuania's Rimantas Šadžius and Cuerpo.

Euro zone bond yields are extending declines this morning after regional German inflation data.

The June consumer price index in the key industrial state of North-Rhine Westphalia came in at 1.8% on the year down from 2% in May, and and was down 0.1% on the month. Preliminary national inflation data will be released this afternoon.

The 10-year German bond yield, the euro area's benchmark, was more than 2 basis points lower at 2.57%. The German 2-year yield was last down 2 basis points at 1.85%.

The U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to have enough clarity on the trajectory of the U.S. economy to justify an interest rate cut in July, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Monday.

""We're only going to have one more measure of inflation. We're going to have a lot that's unknown about how other policies are impacting the labor market. And without that kind of clarity, I don't think it's going to be my view that it'll be appropriate to move in any direction at this point,"" Bostic said.

Tackling the issue of when the data might be sufficient to support a move, Bostic said the Fed would be closely monitoring how businesses and consumers respond to tariffs and other economic factors.

""I'm hearing more [businesses] say that they may not expect this whole thing to play out, to where they're at their final strategy, till even 2026, so this could be a much more extended period than I think many expect,"" he told CNBC.

European stocks opened in the green on Monday, with the Stoxx 600 index up 0.1% in early deals, building on last week's gains. Global sentiment appears broadly robust, with Asia-Pacific stocks turning mixed but U.S. futures remaining higher.

In Europe, sectors are mixed, with autos down 0.6% and banks slipping 0.25% as financial services gain 0.6%.

Beneficiaries of the U.K.-U.S. trade deal, which took effect this morning, are slightly higher, having already notched strong gains on the previous announcement. Those include engine-maker Rolls-Royce, up 0.6%, and German automaker BMW, up 0.26% — though Aston Martin shares are 0.1% lower. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 is up 0.1%.

The British pound, which last week hit an almost four-year high against the U.S. dollar, is up 0.1% against the greenback at 7:39 a.m. in London to around $1.373. Futures data meanwhile points to higher opens for both the FTSE 100 and the broader FTSE 250.

Monday marks the start of the trade deal between the U.K. and U.S. which was brokered last month. Key details include British car export tariffs being reduced from 27.5% to 10%, along with duties on aerospace goods such as engines and aircraft parts being slashed to zero. 

The U.K. has still been left with a baseline 10% tariff and an outlined agreement that will put zero tariffs on core steel products has not been finalized.

The U.K.'s statistics agency meanwhile on Monday confirmed that economic growth for the first quarter of 2025 was 0.7%, in line with its previous estimate.

Welcome to CNBC's live blog covering all the action in European financial markets on Monday, and the latest regional and global business news, data and earnings.

Futures data from IG suggests a positive start for European markets, with London's FTSE looking set to open unchanged at 8,794, Germany's DAX up 0.3% at 24,104, France's CAC 40 up 0.3% at 7,709 and Italy's FTSE MIB up 0.2% at 39,911.

The positive start for Europe comes after similar sentiment in Asia-Pacific markets overnight, as investors parsed details on trade negotiations and data points, including Japan's industrial output figures for May and China's manufacturing activity for June.

Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures rose early Monday as investors look to cap an exuberant month for stocks, despite uncertainty over global trade negotiations.

Market watchers in Europe will be looking at the latest inflation data out of Italy and Germany on Monday, as well as German retail sales, for signs of inflationary pressures and a hit to consumer confidence.

Traders will also be digesting data out of China earlier that showed manufacturing activity contracted for a third straight month in June, despite Beijing's stimulus efforts helping to stabilize certain aspects of the industrial sector.

Canada has walked back on its digital services tax ""in anticipation"" of a mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States, Ottawa announced Sunday night, just one day before the first tax payments were due.

The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump announced over the weekend that he will be ""terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada"" in response to Ottawa's decision to impose a digital services tax on American tech firms.

""Today's announcement will support a resumption of negotiations toward the July 21, 2025, timeline set out at this month's G7 Leaders' Summit in Kananaskis,"" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in the statement.

The first payments from Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year and applies retroactively to 2022, were initially set to be collected Monday. The tax would have applied to both domestic and foreign tech companies, including U.S. giants such as Amazon, Google and Meta with a 3% levy.

This decision from Ottawa was an about-turn from Canadian officials earlier this month, who said they would not pause the digital services tax, despite strong opposition from the U.S.

Canada's minister of finance and national revenue, Francois-Philippe Champagne, added, ""Rescinding the digital services tax will allow the negotiations of a new economic and security relationship with the United States to make vital progress and reinforce our work to create jobs and build prosperity for all Canadians.""

However, the statement from Canada's Finance Ministry also said that Carney ""has been clear that Canada will take as long as necessary, but no longer, to achieve that deal.""

The digital services tax was first introduced in 2020 to address a taxation gap where many large tech companies were earning significant revenues from Canadians, but were not taxed.

Ottawa also said that the tax was enacted while it worked with international partners — including the U.S.— on a multilateral agreement that would replace national digital services taxes.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Friday that U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would investigate the tax to ""determine the amount of harm to the U.S. companies and the U.S. economy in general.""

""We disagree [with the tax], and we think that they discriminate against U.S. companies,"" Bessent told CNBC's Morgan Brennan on ""Closing Bell: Overtime.""

""Several countries within the European Union have digital service taxes. None of them have done those retroactively,"" Bessent said, who added that the retroactive digital taxes, which amount to about $2 billion, ""seem patently unfair.""

U.S. goods trade with Canada totaled roughly $762 billion last year, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

The WNBA announced on Monday it has awarded three new expansion teams to Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia, growing the league to 18 teams over the next five years.

WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert called it a ""truly monumental day"" for the league.

""These are proud cities with powerful sports legacies, each one rich in basketball tradition,"" she said. ""This is a bold step forward as we grow our footprint.""

The league currently has 13 teams, with franchises in Toronto and Portland set to join in 2026.

The Cleveland team will begin play in 2028, followed by Detroit in 2029 and Philadelphia in 2030. Each team will pay $250 million in franchise fees to join the league, according to a person familiar with the terms who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details. Those fees would represent a historic high for the WNBA.

The league has been looking at the expansion process for more than two years. More than a dozen cities submitted bids, including Kansas City, St. Louis, Austin, Houston, Miami, Denver and Charlotte, North Carolina. 

The league said Monday each location was selected after analyzing market viability, infrastructure and local support. Engelbert said Houston, specifically, is one the league will continue to have its eye on for future expansions.

""Today marks a transformative day in Cleveland's sports history,"" said Nic Barlage, CEO of the Rock Entertainment Group, which owns the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers and other professional sports teams in the city.

This would not be Cleveland's first foray into professional women's basketball. The city hosted one of the WNBA'S original franchises, the Cleveland Rockers from 1997 to 2003. That team folded after seven seasons as the team's owner, Gordon Gund, cited low attendance and said he could not find a way to make the team profitable.

The Detroit WNBA ownership group is led by Tom and Holly Gores, owners of the Detroit Pistons.

""This is a huge win for our city,"" said Arn Tellem, the vice chairman of the Detroit Pistons basketball franchise. ""It's much bigger than basketball."" 

The Detroit team will return women's basketball to the city after a roughly two-decade hiatus. The Detroit Shock played from 1998 to 2009, winning three championships and setting records for attendance before moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The Philadelphia team will be owned by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, owner of the Philadelphia 76ers, which includes Josh Harris, David Blitzer and David Adelman. Comcast holds a minority stake in the team.

Harris, co-founder and managing partner of HBSE, said bringing the WNBA to the city ""wasn't just a nice-to-have, it was an obligation.""

Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC.

Something I rarely, if ever, say: What a wonderful Monday morning!

On Friday stateside, the S&P 500 broke its previous record. Celebrations were shared with the Nasdaq Composite, which also hit a new high. The tech-heavy index enjoyed a liftoff from Nvidia and Microsoft, both of which reached all-time highs (and probably made some insiders at Nvidia multi-millionaires over the past month).

Tariff relief buoyed sentiment in markets. China announced it had finalized details of its deal with the United States. And even though U.S. President Donald Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariffs are due to kick in (again) one week later, he suggested that his administration ""can do whatever we want"" regarding the 90-day pause.

Postponing the return of those tariffs would give investors further cheer and put another feather, perhaps of the chicken variety, in their caps.

That said, as Trump giveth, so does he taketh away.

The S&P 500 was up as much as 0.76% at one point during Friday's trading session, but stumbled after the U.S. president slammed the door shut on trade talks with Canada over its digital services tax.

Investors took the news in their stride. The index only dipped slightly, but that nonetheless shaved off some gains.

U.S. markets open just before Asia heads to bed. May it be in Trump's nature to be a giver, to borrow Chappell Roan's words — so Monday can end as well as it began.

New record for S&P 500. The broad-based index rose 0.52% to close at 6,173.07 Friday, surpassing its previous high of 6,147.43. U.S. futures ticked up Sunday evening stateside. The Stoxx Europe 600 popped 1.14% Friday as shares of Barclays and Deutsche Bank rallied to decade highs.

China confirms trade deal details with America. The framework covers the export of rare earth metals from China, and the easing of tech restrictions imposed by the U.S., according to a statement released by Beijing on Friday. Trump said the same day he can do ""whatever"" he wants with tariffs.

Talks with Canada 'terminated.' Trump on Friday abruptly announced that the U.S. is ending trade discussions over Ottawa's decision to impose a digital services tax on American tech firms, which will affect titans such as Amazon, Google and Meta.

U.S. consumers paid more for goods and services in May. The core personal consumption expenditures price index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month, putting annual inflation at 2.7%. Both figures were 10 basis points higher than expected.

[PRO] Eyes on U.S. jobs numbers. June's nonfarm payrolls report comes out Thursday and could determine if the rally in U.S. markets continues. Investors will only have half a day to react: U.S. markets close early Thursday and are dark Friday.

China's biggest public AI drop since DeepSeek is about to hit the market

On Monday, Chinese technology giant Baidu plans to make its Ernie generative AI large language model open source, a move by China's tech sector that could be its biggest in the AI race since the emergence of DeepSeek. 

""Baidu just threw a Molotov into the AI world,"" said Alec Strasmore, founder of AI advisory Epic Loot. ""OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, all these guys who thought they were selling top-notch champagne are about to realize that Baidu will be giving away something just as powerful,"" Strasmore said, comparing Baidu's move to Costco creating Kirkland.

On the face of it, 2025 looks like a banner year for crypto: Bitcoin hitting a record, an industry-boosting US president whose family is venturing headlong into the sector, and key legislation widely expected to be passed by Congress. 

But look beyond the bullish headlines and the rally in Bitcoin, and a vastly different landscape comes into view. Most of the so-called altcoins once touted as competitors to the original cryptoasset are nursing steep declines, with more than $300 billion of market value wiped out so far this year.

Bitcoin treasury company Strategy has acquired another 4,980 bitcoin, taking its total holdings to 597,325 bitcoin.

The recent purchases were funded through the usual at-the-market mechanisms Strategy has become infamous for using.

Strategy's executive chairman also recently made the case that the bitcoin price could rise to $21 million over the next 21 years.

Bitcoin treasury companies are on the rise more generally, as there are now 140 publicly traded companies with bitcoin on their books around the world, according to BitcoinTreasuries.net.



Strategy (MSTR), which was formerly known as MicroStrategy, has acquired an additional 4,980 BTC, for approximately $531.9 million, according to an SEC filing. The bitcoin purchases came in at an average price of $106,801 per bitcoin, and the bitcoin treasury company's total bitcoin holdings now stand at 597,325 bitcoin, currently valued at over $64 billion.Strategy's most recent bitcoin purchases were financed through a mix of capital raised via the sale of common stock (MSTR) and newly issued preferred stocks (STRK and STRF), which are part of the company's extensive at-the-market (ATM) equity programs. These efforts reflect the broader $84 billion capital raise initiative under the firm's “42/42” plan, which is intended to fund continued bitcoin accumulation through 2027.

Recently, Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor made the case during the BTC Prague conference that the bitcoin price could rise to $21 million over the next 21 years, which explains the company's reasoning behind acquiring as much bitcoin as they can as quickly as possible.

As of now, the company's average bitcoin purchase price sits at $70,982 per coin, resulting in over $21 billion in unrealized gains. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, Strategy is by far the world's largest publicly traded bitcoin treasury company, with the closest competitor—bitcoin miner MARA Holdings—having a bitcoin stash of roughly a tenth the size of Strategy's.

Bitcoin treasury companies have exploded in popularity over the past couple of years, as the cryptocurrency continues to gain adoption as a strategic reserve asset for corporations. There are now at least 140 publicly traded companies with bitcoin on their balance sheets around the world.

Strategy shares are up 2% in Monday morning trading and are up more than 35% for the year.

Bitcoin jumping above a key technical threshold would open a path to a much larger rally ahead, according to a market strategist. 

In a note to clients last week, Ed Campbell of Rosenberg Research said the next big resistance level for crypto is $114,000.

Bitcoin hovered around $107,800 on Monday afternoon. Should the token rise another 6% to clear the $114,000 mark, it could spark a fresh rally of as much as 25% to $143,000.

""While momentum may fade later this summer, a breakout now (or soon) would reinforce the bullish macro setup and could extend Bitcoin's leadership well into the second half of the year,"" Campbell wrote. 

The note pointed to a handful of bullish catalysts the firm believes will act as tailwinds to bitcoin's price going forward. 

Bitcoin's price has historically rallied after a halving event, when the rewards for bitcoin miners are slashed in half. The idea is to make it harder for new bitcoins to be mined and making the token more scarce. 

The last bitcoin halving was in April 2024 with the next one expected in 2028.

Investors are more concerned about storing their wealth in dollar assets like US government bonds than they were in the past, making bitcoin an attractive alternative to some investors.

The US Dollar Index, which weighs the greenback against a basket of foreign currencies and reflects the level of demand for the dollar, is down 10.5% for the year.

""Bitcoin is increasingly used to preserve wealth and ensure mobility,"" Campbell and Rosenberg said, pointing to spikes in on-chain activity during recent crises.

Bitcoin's adoption by institutions has boosted its credibility and attracted more funds to the crypto, another major catalyst for bitcoin's price.

Spot bitcoin ETFs, which were first launched in 2024, are now taking in more than $45 billion in cumulative monthly flows, Rosenberg Research's analysis found. 

Markets are also anticipating several rate cuts by the end of the year. Lower interest rates are generally bullish for risk assets, including crypto. Markets broadly have rallied on the prospects that the Fed could soon loosen monetary policy, with stocks making new highs in the last week amid more dovish talk from central bankers. 

Markets see the first rate cut coming in September, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. 

The regulatory environment is growing more friendly to crypto assets since President Donald Trump, who branded himself as the ""crypto president"" on the campaign trail, returned to the White House.

The note points to several pro-crypto officials Trump has appointed during his term, as well as actions that support bitcoin's price, like banning a US central bank digital currency and the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. The recent passage of the Genius Act in Congress aimed at creating a framework for stablecoins was the latest bullish policy development. 

""The removal of regulatory overhang could unlock significant capital and reinforce Bitcoin's positioning as a strategic reserve asset,"" Campbell said.

Bitcoin is up 15% this year, beating the S&P 500's 5% year-to-date gain.

As US President Donald Trump loosens cryptocurrency rules, one community reports that noise and pollution from a local bitcoin mining operation has become ""relentless.""

In the quiet village of Dresden on the western shore of Seneca Lake in the state of New York, the fire whistle blows like clockwork at noon every day. Residents don't mind; it's a familiar sound that blends into the rhythm of their small-town life.

But there's one noise some of the 300 villagers cannot stand: the constant mechanical droning of Greenidge Generation. This former coal-fired facility is now a natural gas ""peaking plant"" that supplies electricity to New York during high demand. Since 2019, it has also powered an energy-gulping bitcoin mine.

Locals say that on some days, the sound it emits is like a refrigerator humming in the background. But when the wind shifts just right, it becomes more of a roar.

Winton Buddington, who owns a home in Dresden, said ""it was a nice and peaceful community"" until 2017. ""Then, Atlas Holdings purchased the property.""

Retired nurse Beth Cain said research shows that constant noise ""does affect people. It creates stress for your system,"" she said, adding that it's like ""having tinnitus.""

But the unwanted soundscape is not the only concern locals share about the plant, which also discharges hot water into the lake and emits carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

Many in the community, including Yvonne Taylor, vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian, a grassroots environmental advocacy group in upstate New York, fear that Greenidge poses a threat to the broader region, whose wineries and Mennonite farms are big visitor attractions. 

""[The wine and tourism industry] is our driving economic engine, and all of those jobs rely heavily on clean air and clean water for survival,"" Taylor said.

Large-scale crypto-mining operations such as the one in Dresden consume massive amounts of energy. They use thousands of computer servers to compete in solving mathematical problems that validate blockchain transactions.

By 2021, the Greenidge facility was generating about 44 megawatts to mine bitcoin, which is enough to power up to 40,000 homes — depending on their consumption levels.

""Each one of those machines has to solve a puzzle. Each machine can solve that puzzle about 100 trillion times every second,"" said Colin Read, author of The Bitcoin Dilemma: Weighing the Economic and Environmental Costs and Benefits.And that requires a lot of energy, which generates a lot of emissions.

Citing Greenidge's own data, the environmental law group Earthjustice said the facility emitted almost 800,000 tons of carbon dioxide and CO2 equivalents in 2023 — on a par with the tailpipe emissions of over 170,000 cars.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, 137 crypto mining facilities were already operating in the country at the start of 2024. The current government has not yet released new figures, but Troy Cross, philosophy professor at Reed College in the US city of Portland and senior fellow at the nonpartisan Bitcoin Policy Institute, expects that under self-proclaimed ""crypto president"" Donald Trump, bitcoin companies will face fewer barriers when scouting for new mining locations. 

""Trump will make it easier for the large bitcoin mining companies in the US, and especially in West Texas,"" he said, in reference to the state being a leading producer of coal and natural gas. It's also among the top states in solar and wind energy generation.

Since coming to office, the president has already formed a working group to draft pro-crypto regulations and has announced a national reserve to stockpile digital assets. In a sharp reversal of his earlier stance that bitcoin was ""not money"" and a ""scam,"" he has even launched his own meme coin.

Taylor of the Seneca Lake Guardian said bitcoin mines are ""spreading across the country like a cancer,"" adding that ""slick crypto corporations"" are popping up in rural underserved communities with promises of job creation and earnings.

But pointing to the fact that the Greenidge bitcoin mine employed 48 people full-time in 2022 — about as many as in a typical McDonald's — she said experience shows that such claims ""fall short.""

Margot Paez, also of the Bitcoin Policy Institute, who studies cryptocurrency mining in New York state, said Greenidge's decision to co-locate its bitcoin mine with a natural gas plant is a ""terrible"" idea. But she added that the site is just ""one bad apple,"" suggesting that bitcoin miners should tap into renewables or support grid balancing.

In a draft environmental impact assessment of the 11 known crypto facilities within its borders, the state said the energy use from such operations ""may contribute to challenges meeting New York's renewable energy transition goals.""

Residents and environmentalists are also concerned about the Greenidge plant's water use. Keeping the crypto mining computers running without overheating requires massive amounts of water. The facility is permitted to draw up to 139 million gallons (525 million liters) from Seneca Lake every day and dump back as many as 134 million gallons.

Having been used for cooling, however, the water returned to the lake is much warmer than when it was taken out. Temperatures range between 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) in the winter and 108 F (42 C) in the summer — which some locals say makes the lake too warm for kayakers and swimmers to enjoy.

Residents also worry the warm water could affect aquatic life and trigger more harmful algae blooms in the lake. In 2024, the state environment authorities recorded 377 algal blooms — up from 50 in 2023. Exposure to blooms can cause rashes, coughing, sore throat, stomach pain, and vomiting.

Locals have been involved in legal action that has so far failed to halt the facility's operations. They are also part of a network of experts and activists from affected communities across 17 states that has reached out to Trump's crypto working group to explain the impacts of cryptocurrency policies on rural areas. They have not yet received a response.



In Dresden, where some residents rent out their properties to visitors who come for the lake, there are fears that proximity to Greenidge will hurt the local rental market. 

Even 10 miles (16 kilometers) away in the city of Geneva, residents are concerned about the potential impact of the bitcoin mining facility. Vinny Aliperti, owner of Billsboro Winery, said the plant hasn't affected his business yet, but he's confident it will. 

""Clean lakes are a big part of agrotourism. They're the reason people visit the area and the wineries,"" he said.

Greenidge, which describes itself on its website as an ""environmental leader in power generation and bitcoin mining,"" had not responded to a request for comment by the time of publication.

The Torrey Town Board, which governs Dresden, said the plant has complied with all its codes, including an independent noise study. 

""The Greenidge power plant has been an important part of the town of Torrey since the 1930s, remaining so today as a valuable employer and community partner,"" it said.

The crypto mine has contributed to the community by donating to Dresden's volunteer fire department and the village playground, and supporting businesses in the region during theCOVID-19 pandemic.

""They've done those things, but that's not something that we consider to be worth the trade-off of the pollution and the impact they're having on the environment,"" said homeowner Winton Buddington.

 BitMine Immersion Technologies raised $250 million through a private placement to establish an Ethereum treasury, signaling a shift away from its previous Bitcoin-centric approach. 

Bitcoin miner BitMine Immersion Technologies has secured a $250 million private placement to jumpstart its Ether treasury.

BitMine signed a private placement for the purchase and sale of 55,555,556 shares of common stock for $4.50 per share, yielding gross proceeds of approximately $250 million before expenses, the company said in a Monday announcement.

MOZAYYX led the raise, with participation from Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management and Thomas Lee. The transaction is expected to close on Thursday, provided that conditions, including the authorization of the Supplemental Listing Application by the NYSE American, are met.

Thomas Lee, chairman of BitMine, said that stablecoins are “the ‘ChatGPT' of crypto” and that he expects Ether (ETH) to appreciate thanks to their adoption. “Ethereum is the blockchain where the majority of stablecoin payments are transacted […] and thus, ETH should benefit from this growth,” he said.

BitMine's announcement follows a series of recent moves by publicly traded firms to establish ETH-focused treasuries. A couple of weeks ago, sports betting platform SharpLink Gaming acquired 176,271 Ether for $463 million. This made the firm the world's largest publicly traded holder of ETH.

The announcement followed SharpLink's launch of its Ether treasury in late May. The firm also nominated Ethereum co-founder Joseph Lubin as chairman of its board of directors.

With this announcement, BitMine, with its Bitcoin (BTC)-themed logo, is at least partially pivoting to Ethereum. Until this month, the firm's treasury strategy focused on accumulating Bitcoin.

“BitMine is a Bitcoin and Ethereum Network Company with a focus on the accumulation of Crypto for long-term investment,” the company's description in the announcement reads. BitcoinTreasuries.NET data indicates that BitMine currently holds 154 BTC worth roughly $17 million and is the 62nd largest corporate Bitcoin treasury.

BitMine is not alone in making the pivot. Last week, shares in Bit Digital fell by nearly 4% after the crypto mining firm announced it would wind down or sell its Bitcoin mining infrastructure and use the proceeds to buy more Ether. Shares then fell almost 19% over five days — with a 15% drop in 24 hours — soon thereafter.

Thomas (Tom) Lee, the Founder of Fundstrat and CIO of Fundstrat Capital, will become Chairman of the Board of Directors effective today.

The transaction was led by MOZAYYX with participation from Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management, and Thomas Lee.

Upon the closing of the Private Placement, BitMine will advance its treasury strategy on Ethereum.

BitMine Immersion continues to enhance its asset-light and mining business by increasing its existing treasury holdings by over 16x.

LAS VEGAS, June 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) (""BitMine"" or the ""Company"") today announced the pricing and signing of a private placement for the purchase and sale of 55,555,556 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) at a price of $4.50 per share for expected aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $250 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses (funded in a combination of cash and cryptocurrencies) to implement an Ethereum treasury strategy.

The transaction was led by MOZAYYX with participation from a high quality group of investors including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management, and Thomas Lee.

The closing of the offering is expected to occur on or about July 3, 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including without limitation, the authorization of the Supplemental Listing Application by the NYSE American. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to acquire the native cryptocurrency of Ethereum blockchain commonly referred to as ""ETH"" and contribute the ETH to the Company's treasury operations. ETH will serve as the Company's primary treasury reserve asset.

Thomas Lee, newly appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors, said, ""This transaction includes the highest quality investors across trad-fi and crypto venture capital, properly reflecting the rapid and continued convergence of traditional financial services and crypto.""

Proceeds from the private placement enable the Company to adopt Ethereum (ETH) as its primary treasury reserve asset, while continuing its focus on the core business operations. ETH is the native layer of the Ethereum blockchain. A differentiating feature of Ethereum is the enabling of smart contracts and the majority of stablecoin payments, tokenized assets, and decentralized financial applications are transacted on Ethereum. By having a direct ETH treasury position, the Company has access to native protocol-level activities, such as staking and decentralized finance mechanisms, on the Ethereum network.

Thomas Lee, Chairman of BitMine, states, ""Stablecoins have proven to be the 'chatGPT' of crypto, leading to rapid adoption by consumers, merchants and financial services providers.  Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, recently stated the stablecoin market could reasonably  reach $2 trillion (Bloomberg) compared to the current $250 billion (per defillama.com). Ethereum is the blockchain where the majority of stablecoin payments are transacted (according to Block.co) and thus, ETH should benefit from this growth. One of the key performance metrics (KPI) for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share. This can be achieved by a combination of reinvestment of the Company's cash flows, capital markets activities, and by the change in value of ETH

Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, said, ""The private placement will accelerate BitMine's treasury holdings shortly after its first treasury purchase on June 9, 2025. FalconX, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital plan to partner with the Company to grow a world class Ethereum treasury strategy alongside existing custody partners, BitGo and Fidelity Digital.""

Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as advisor to the lead investor, MOZAYYX.

Winston & Strawn LLP acted as counsel to the lead investor, MOZAYYX.

FitzGerald Kreditor Bolduc Risbrough LLP acted as counsel to the Company.

The offer and sale of the foregoing securities were made in a private placement in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirement of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ""Securities Act""), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and/or Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the securities offered in the private placement may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement of the Securities Act and such applicable state securities laws.

BitMine's $250M raise to build an ETH treasury represents a significant institutional move into Ethereum with potential valuation implications.

BitMine Immersion's $250 million private placement marks a pivotal strategic shift for the company, transforming from a traditional mining operation into a significant Ethereum stakeholder. This move goes beyond simply holding cryptocurrency—it positions BitMine to leverage Ethereum's entire ecosystem through staking and DeFi mechanisms, potentially generating additional yield on their treasury assets.

The caliber of investors participating in this placement is particularly noteworthy. The involvement of established cryptocurrency ventures like Pantera, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital alongside traditional finance players suggests strong institutional confidence in both BitMine's strategy and Ethereum's long-term prospects. This diverse investor consortium bridges the traditional finance and cryptocurrency worlds in a way few other public companies have managed.

The appointment of Thomas Lee as Chairman adds significant credibility. As Fundstrat's founder, Lee brings market analysis expertise that will be crucial for managing BitMine's treasury operations in the volatile cryptocurrency space. His mention of stablecoins as the ""chatGPT of crypto"" highlights a strategic vision focused on Ethereum's utility as the dominant settlement layer for the growing stablecoin market.

The introduction of ""ETH held per share"" as a key performance indicator creates a new valuation framework for BitMine. This metric effectively transforms the company into a leveraged play on Ethereum's price while maintaining operational cash flows from its core business. The 16x increase in treasury holdings represents a fundamental transformation of BitMine's balance sheet risk profile and potential return characteristics.

By focusing on Ethereum rather than Bitcoin, BitMine is making a calculated bet on the future of programmable blockchains over pure store-of-value assets. This differentiated approach in the public markets could potentially create a new category of cryptocurrency-exposed equities beyond the typical mining operations most investors are familiar with.

Thomas (Tom) Lee, the Founder of Fundstrat and CIO of Fundstrat Capital, will become Chairman of the Board of Directors effective today.

The transaction was led by MOZAYYX with participation from Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management, and Thomas Lee.

As Bloomberg News reported Monday (June 30), while bitcoin has enjoyed a rally thus far in 2025, many of the “altcoins” once championed as its competitors are fading, losing more than $300 billion in market value since the year began.

While crypto's early proponents touted the space as a place where a number of coins would vie for investor dollars, bitcoin's rise has led to predictions that huge portions of the sector will eventually turn fallow.

“I think they're just going to die, frankly,” Nick Philpott, co-founder of trading platform Zodia Markets, told Bloomberg in reference to altcoins. “They'll just wither away. Technically, a lot of this stuff will just sit there and gather dust in perpetuity.”

Bitcoin now commands a 64% share of crypto's market value, the report said, citing CoinMarketCap. That was the highest level since 2021, when cryptocurrency was mostly unregulated, crypto lending was seeing a boom, and nonfungible tokens were gaining popularity.

At the same time, altcoins — digital assets other than bitcoin and stablecoins — have begun to flag, down 50% this year.

Bitcoin, the report adds, has attracted the bulk of capital from investors in exchange-traded funds (ETFs), leaving other cryptos behind. That includes Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, which is around 50% below its all-time high, the report added.

“Historically, Bitcoin's moved and then that's passed down into altcoins,” said Jake Ostrovskis, a trader at Wintermute. “We've not really seen that yet this cycle.”

In other news from the digital assets sector, PYMNTS wrote last week about stablecoins' new position at “a rare confluence of opportunity and uncertainty.”

On one hand, the report noted, stablecoins provide “real-world utility at scale,” especially when it comes to cross-border payments and emerging markets. However, they also raise profound questions about monetary control, systemic risk and global financial governance.

“Yes, stablecoins have matured into a system-level conversation for payments players,” PYMNTS wrote. “But for every promise of financial efficiency and inclusion, there are equally urgent questions hovering in the wings about illicit finance, monetary sovereignty and market disruption.”

Last week saw the U.S. Federal Reserve rescind mentions of “reputational risk” from bank supervision programs, something that had effectively blocked banks from engaging with crypto or stablecoin providers.

But the tone is more cautious in Europe, with the European Central Bank and Bank for International Settlements arguing that widespread stablecoin use could hinder central bank control of monetary policy.

Oops, something went wrong

(Bloomberg) -- On the face of it, 2025 looks like a banner year for crypto: Bitcoin hitting a record, an industry-boosting US president whose family is venturing headlong into the sector, and key legislation widely expected to be passed by Congress.

But look beyond the bullish headlines and the rally in Bitcoin, and a vastly different landscape comes into view. Most of the so-called altcoins once touted as competitors to the original cryptoasset are nursing steep declines, with more than $300 billion of market value wiped out so far this year.

The sea of red points to a wider malaise that's forcing parts of the industry to confront existential questions. Crypto was imagined by early enthusiasts as a universe where a host of coins competed for investor money, offering a diverse set of use cases. But as Bitcoin reigns supreme, that's giving way to predictions that large swathes of the sector will become a digital wasteland.

“I think they're just going to die, frankly,” Nick Philpott, co-founder of trading platform Zodia Markets, said of altcoins. “They'll just wither away. Technically, a lot of this stuff will just sit there and gather dust in perpetuity.”

Bitcoin's share of the total market value of cryptoassets has climbed by nine percentage points this year to 64%, the highest since January 2021, according to CoinMarketCap. Back then, cryptocurrencies were a largely unregulated space, crypto lending was roaring with few safeguards and nonfungible tokens were just starting to take off.

In sharp contrast, altcoins — the catch-all term for all digital assets outside of Bitcoin and stablecoins — are faltering. A MarketVector index tracking the bottom half of the largest 100 digital assets, which more than doubled in the aftermath of Donald Trump's Nov. 5 election victory, has since given up all those gains and is down around 50% in 2025.

With Bitcoin soaking up the bulk of capital flows from investors in exchange-traded funds, other parts of the market are increasingly left behind. Even Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, remains about 50% below its all-time high after a modest rebound fueled by inflows to spot ETFs investing in the token.

“Historically, Bitcoin's moved and then that's passed down into altcoins,” said Jake Ostrovskis, an OTC trader at Wintermute. “We've not really seen that yet this cycle.”

Crypto is no stranger to mass extinction events. The 2022 market crash, punctuated by the implosions of algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD and Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX exchange, led to the demise of hundreds of projects. Thousands of coins still exist on their blockchains, with little or no activity — relegated to the status of “ghost chains” in crypto parlance.

What's different this time is that crypto is becoming a more regulated, institutionally-driven marketplace, and that stablecoins appear to be the only tokens with a real shot at achieving means-of-payment status, due to the fact that they eliminate volatility.

In the past year alone, the market value of stablecoins has swelled by $47 billion, and some of the world's largest banks are entering the field. The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Amazon.com Inc. is studying a potential stablecoin.

That's putting pressure on altcoin projects to find ways to shore up their status and appeal to a wider base of investors.

“I've talked to a couple of projects that have been thinking about merging foundations, putting it up for governance, saying, ‘Hey, we can now be governed under this other authority' — that authority being another altcoin community,” said Kanyi Maqubela, managing partner at venture capital firm Kindred Ventures.

The shifting tides are also reflected in corporate behavior. Modeled on Michael Saylor's Strategy, a new breed of Bitcoin accumulators has emerged. In April, a special-purpose acquisition company affiliated with Cantor Fitzgerald LP partnered with Tether Holdings SA and SoftBank to launch Twenty One Capital Inc., seeded with nearly $4 billion in Bitcoin. The Trump family, which is also getting involved in Bitcoin mining, has raised $2.3 billion via Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. to create a Bitcoin treasury.

While similar vehicles have been set up recently to accumulate smaller tokens like Ether, Solana and BNB, they are much smaller.

Glimmers of Hope

Not all altcoins are floundering. Tokens like Maker and Hyperliquid that are linked to thriving decentralized-finance protocols have notched big gains this year.

“There's certainly a subset of the market doing incredibly well — generally companies with real businesses, real revenues, and those revenues are being used to buy back tokens,” said Jeff Dorman, chief investment officer of digital asset investment firm Arca.

There's also the prospect of more favorable regulations. The potential for US Securities and Exchange Commission approval of ETFs backed by coins like Solana are stirring hopes of wider adoption. Another possible catalyst is the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act, informally referred to as crypto's market structure bill. The CLARITY Act aims to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework, including delineating responsibilities between the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC.

“The Clarity Act has the potential to do for altcoins what ETFs did for Bitcoin and Ethereum: provide the regulatory legitimacy that unlocks real institutional capital,” said Ira Auerbach, a senior executive at Offchain Labs.

Yet according to Maqubela, the issue ultimately boils down to utility. He compares Bitcoin to gold and Ether to copper — the former has a capped final supply and the latter's blockchain underpins much of crypto's functionality — and says most altcoins are stuck in a sort of twilight zone, underpinned by big promises and not much else.

“I think a lot of them are going to whittle down to zero because they were driven by speculation without that mimetic value like Bitcoin, and they tried to be utilitarian without achieving any real scale,” he said.

Digital brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) is extending its crypto footprint with a slate of new offerings, including developing its own blockchain network based on Arbitrum ARB$0.3467 and launching tokenized stocks trading, the company announced on Monday.

The firm today has debuted its stock token offering, issued on the Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum, for European users, giving access to over 200 U.S. equities and ETFs witt around-the-clock trading during weekdays. With the launch, Robinhood is expanding its crypto-focused EU app with tokenized stocks into an ""all-in-one investment app powered by crypto,"" the company said in a release shared with CoinDesk.

The firm also confirmed it's building its own layer-2 blockchain network optimized for tokenized assets. The upcoming chain, based on the Arbitrum tech stack, is aimed to support 24/7 trading, self-custody and cross-chain bridging of tokenized assets. A release date has not been disclosed, but persons familiar with the matter said it could go live around later this year, early next year.

The company announced it's opening access to private equity tokens, starting with tokenized shares in OpenAI and SpaceX.

""We will continue to work with regulators and bring the entire Robinhood ecosystem on-chain,"" chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev, said during the launch event in Cannes, France.

HOOD shares, traded on Nasdaq, rallied to a fresh record high of $91, advancing over 8% during the Monday session.

Robinhood's push into tokenized assets comes as competition with digital asset exchanges is heating up to offer a unified trading hub for all kinds of financial instruments. Asset tokenization is a read-hot sector that aims to bring real-world assets including equities, funds, real estate onto blockchain rails promising cheaper, faster and more efficient settlements and around-the-clock trading. It's potentially a huge opportunity: the tokenized asset market could grow to $18.9 trillion by 2033, a report by Ripple and BCG projected.

A slew of popular crypto exchanges, including Bybit, Kraken and Gemini have just recently started to offer tokenized stocks to users, while Coinbase reportedly also seeks regulatory approval to do so.

Robinhood's Tenev earlier this year touted asset tokenization as a way to expand investor access that assets that are limited to the wealthy, and advocated for clear U.S. regulations to tokenize securities.

While rivals have teamed up with regulated asset tokenization specialists to offer stock tokens, Robinhood is building its own tokenization engine to do so, Seong Lee, head of crypto products, told CoinDesk in an interview.

As part of the firm's crypt push, Robinhood is rolling out perpetual futures, a popular derivative instrument among crypto traders, for European users. Trades are routed through Bitstamp, one of the world's longest-running active crypto exchange which Robinhood acquired for $200 million.

The firm has also introduced crypto staking for U.S.-based investors starting with Ethereum's ether ETH$2,478.95 and Solana's SOL SOL$157.03 that lets token holders earn rewards without leaving the application.

Additionally, Robinhood will add crypto rewards to its credit card offering later this fall, allowing U.S. customers to invest cashback automatically in digital assets.

Robinhood Stock Tokens will allow EU customers to get exposure to the US stock market

Robinhood will also launch a new Layer 2 blockchain to power the tokenization of Real World Assets

Today, at Robinhood Presents: To Catch a Token in Cannes, France, we unveiled a suite of new products that mark a major step forward for crypto. From expanding Robinhood to over 400 million people across 30 EU and EEA countries, to launching stock and ETF tokens, we're building toward a future where investing is simpler, smarter, and more accessible worldwide.“Our latest offerings lay the groundwork for crypto to become the backbone of the global financial system,” said Robinhood Chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev.

Tokenization and Layer 2 Blockchain

We've launched US stock and ETF tokens in the EU, giving eligible customers exposure to US equities with Robinhood Stock Tokens—featuring zero commissions or added spreads from Robinhood (other fees may apply), dividend support, and 24/5 access. With tokenized stocks, our European app transitions from being a crypto-only app to an all-in-one investment app powered by crypto.

European customers will have access to 200+ US stock and ETF tokens. Stock token holders will also receive dividend payments directly in their app.  

“Crypto was built by engineers for engineers, and has not been accessible to most people,” said Johann Kerbrat, GM and SVP of Robinhood Crypto. “We're onboarding the world to crypto by making it as easy to use as possible—with the goal of bringing powerful tools into one intuitive platform.”

Stock tokens will initially be issued on Arbitrum. In the future, tokenized stocks will be facilitated by our very own Robinhood Layer 2 blockchain, based on Arbitrum. Currently in development, the Robinhood blockchain will be optimized for tokenized real-world assets and built to support 24/7 trading, seamless bridging, and self-custody.

Perpetual Futures

We are introducing crypto perpetual futures in the EU, where we will offer eligible customers access to a new class of derivatives with continuous exposure and up to 3x leverage. Perpetuals will be 100% rolled out to eligible customers by the end of the summer. Designed to help reduce the complexity typically associated with trading perpetuals, we built our interface with intuitive controls for setting position size and managing margin. Orders are routed through Bitstamp's perpetual futures exchange.

This launch will mark an important step in serving active traders across the globe with advanced trading tools in an intuitive platform. 

Crypto Staking in the US

Crypto staking is launching to eligible US customers, starting with Ethereum and Solana. With our user-friendly interface, you can now participate in blockchain ecosystems and access competitive reward rates by contributing to network operations. Crypto staking is also available to all Robinhood customers in the EU and EEA. 

Expanded Product Suite

There's more—we've rolled out a suite of new products to make trading crypto on Robinhood even more powerful and seamless.

 Robinhood is offering tokenized US stocks and ETFs on the Arbitrum blockchain to users in Europe. 

Robinhood's push into real-world assets (RWAs) is gaining momentum, with the digital brokerage launching a tokenization-focused layer-2 blockchain and introducing stock token trading for users in the European Union.

Built on Arbitrum, the new layer-2 network will enable the issuance of over 200 US stock and exchange-traded fund (ETF) tokens, giving European investors access to US assets, Robinhood announced on Monday.

Robinhood's stock tokens will have zero commissions and be available for trading 24 hours a day, five days a week.

The company also announced the launch of perpetual futures in the EU, giving eligible traders access to derivatives with up to three times leverage. These trades will be routed through Bitstamp, the crypto exchange Robinhood recently acquired for $200 million.

Robinhood isn't the first exchange to offer tokenized shares to European investors. As Cointelegraph reported, Gemini has already begun offering a tokenized version of Strategy (MSTR) stock, giving investors exposure to the Bitcoin-focused company.

Robinhood unveiled its new tokenization initiative days after launching micro futures contracts for Bitcoin (BTC), XRP (XRP), and Solana (SOL), allowing traders to access derivatives markets with significantly lower capital requirements.

In May, the exchange acquired Canadian crypto operator WonderFi in a $179 million deal. 

The company has also been advocating for sensible tokenization legislation in the United States, having submitted a proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish a national framework for RWAs. 

Robinhood's proposal includes plans to launch the Real World Asset Exchange, a platform designed for offchain trading with onchain settlement.

The RWA market has grown significantly over the past year, eclipsing $24 billion as of June, according to a recent RedStone report. However, much of its growth has been driven by private credit and US Treasury debt, with tokenized stocks accounting for less than $400 million.

Silver Scott Mines (OTC:SILS) has launched Weed.TrustNFT.io, a blockchain-based authentication platform for the cannabis industry. The platform aims to combat counterfeiting, streamline compliance, and create new revenue opportunities through NFT technology.

The system works by assigning unique NFTs to cannabis products, linking crucial information such as lab test results, strain genetics, and batch tracking. Consumers can verify product authenticity by scanning QR codes, while brands and regulators can access a blockchain ledger for compliance purposes.

According to pilot program projections, cannabis brands implementing TrustNFT.io can expect a 10-15% reduction in counterfeit losses, 30% faster compliance reporting, and potential new NFT-driven revenue of $50K-$500K annually. The company is offering 500 free NFTs to the first 10 brands who sign up for the platform.

Silver Scott Mines (OTC:SILS) ha lanciato Weed.TrustNFT.io, una piattaforma di autenticazione basata su blockchain dedicata all'industria della cannabis. La piattaforma mira a contrastare la contraffazione, semplificare la conformità normativa e creare nuove opportunità di guadagno attraverso la tecnologia NFT.

Il sistema funziona assegnando NFT unici ai prodotti di cannabis, collegando informazioni fondamentali come risultati di test di laboratorio, genetica delle varietà e tracciamento dei lotti. I consumatori possono verificare l'autenticità del prodotto scansionando codici QR, mentre marchi e regolatori possono accedere a un registro blockchain per scopi di conformità.

Secondo le proiezioni del programma pilota, i marchi di cannabis che adottano TrustNFT.io possono aspettarsi una riduzione del 10-15% delle perdite dovute a contraffazioni, una riduzione del 30% nei tempi di reportistica per la conformità e potenziali nuovi ricavi da NFT compresi tra 50.000 e 500.000 dollari all'anno. L'azienda offre 500 NFT gratuiti ai primi 10 marchi che si registrano sulla piattaforma.

Los consumidores pueden verificar la autenticidad del producto escaneando códigos QR, mientras que las marcas y reguladores pueden acceder a un registro blockchain para fines de cumplimiento.

Según las proyecciones del programa piloto, las marcas de cannabis que implementen TrustNFT.io pueden esperar una reducción del 10-15% en pérdidas por falsificación, un 30% más rápido en los reportes de cumplimiento y potenciales nuevos ingresos impulsados por NFTs de $50K a $500K anuales.

Silver Scott Mines (OTC:SILS)는 대마초 산업을 위한 블록체인 기반 인증 플랫폼인 Weed.TrustNFT.io를 출시했습니다. 이 플랫폼은 위조 방지, 규정 준수 간소화, NFT 기술을 통한 새로운 수익 창출 기회를 목표로 합니다.

이 시스템은 대마초 제품에 고유한 NFT를 할당하여 실험실 테스트 결과, 품종 유전 정보, 배치 추적과 같은 중요한 정보를 연결합니다. 소비자는 QR 코드를 스캔하여 제품의 진품 여부를 확인할 수 있으며, 브랜드와 규제 기관은 규정 준수를 위해 블록체인 원장을 조회할 수 있습니다.

파일럿 프로그램 예측에 따르면 TrustNFT.io를 도입한 대마초 브랜드는 위조 손실을 10-15% 감소시키고, 규정 준수 보고 속도를 30% 향상시키며, 연간 5만 달러에서 50만 달러의 NFT 기반 신규 수익을 기대할 수 있습니다. 회사는 플랫폼에 가입하는 최초 10개 브랜드에 500개의 무료 NFT를 제공합니다.

Silver Scott Mines (OTC:SILS) a lancé Weed.TrustNFT.io, une plateforme d'authentification basée sur la blockchain pour l'industrie du cannabis. Cette plateforme vise à lutter contre la contrefaçon, à simplifier la conformité et à créer de nouvelles opportunités de revenus grâce à la technologie NFT.

Le système fonctionne en attribuant des NFT uniques aux produits de cannabis, reliant des informations cruciales telles que les résultats des tests en laboratoire, la génétique des variétés et le suivi des lots. Les consommateurs peuvent vérifier l'authenticité du produit en scannant des codes QR, tandis que les marques et les régulateurs peuvent accéder à un registre blockchain à des fins de conformité.

Selon les projections du programme pilote, les marques de cannabis utilisant TrustNFT.io peuvent s'attendre à une réduction de 10 à 15 % des pertes dues à la contrefaçon, à un rapprochement des rapports de conformité 30 % plus rapide et à de potentielles nouvelles recettes NFT comprises entre 50 000 et 500 000 dollars par an. L'entreprise offre 500 NFT gratuits aux 10 premières marques qui s'inscrivent sur la plateforme.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=ico","PENGU Leads Solana Meme Coin Breakout with 80% Rise, Snorter ICO Hits $1.2M","https://coincentral.com/pengu-leads-solana-meme-coin-breakout-with-80-rise-snorter-ico-hits-1-2m/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:00:01 GMT","

It seems like meme coins are making a comeback, and one Solana-based token is leading the way.

You've probably seen everyone talk about Pengu (PENGU), and for good reason – it's up over 80% in just the past week.

At the same time, a new Solana meme coin called Snorter (SNORT) is gaining traction in its ICO, already raising over $1.2 million from early backers.

PENGU has had a great week, now trading around the $0.015 level.

That makes it the top-performing major meme coin at the moment.

In the last day alone, it jumped another 13%, leaving other Solana meme coins like Dogwifhat in the dust on both price and trading volume.

A few factors are driving up demand for this penguin-themed token.

First, a surprise ETF filing popped up from Cboe for a “Canary PENGU ETF.”



If approved, this fund would hold PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, which is a huge sign of potential institutional interest.

Plus, on-chain data shows that big money is moving in.

Nansen reported that whale wallets boosted their PENGU holdings by over 11% this past month, and that includes one enormous buy of $2.4 million.

For the technical traders, PENGU also broke out of a falling wedge pattern on Friday and is now trading above its 50-day EMA.

But it's not just a one-coin show.

All the bullishness around Pengu is lifting the entire meme sector, both on Solana and Ethereum.

The total market cap for meme coins has climbed back above $54 billion, and daily spot trading volumes have increased by 32% since yesterday.

Popular coins like PEPE and SPX jumped 3%, and Dogwifhat added 6% to its value.

This optimism seems tied to the broader market finding its footing again.



Bitcoin pushed past $107,000 yesterday, partly due to some unexpected news from the White House.

An order for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to look into crypto-based federal housing loans is seen as a huge deal.

It could potentially plug crypto into a $7 trillion system – and that kind of headline has a way of boosting sentiment.

That's helped the Crypto Fear & Greed Index finally get back into “Greed” territory.

With all this activity, smaller Solana-based meme coin projects, such as Snorter, are seeing an uptick in demand.

Snorter has now raised over $1.2 million in its ICO, with SNORT tokens currently available for just $0.0967 each.

Most of the hype is because it's pairing degen fun with an actual product.

Snorter's team is building a trading bot inside Telegram designed to give meme coin traders an edge.

Th bot uses Solana's speed for near-instant trades, automated sniping of new token launches, copy trading, and even scam detection.



 

With the crypto bot market already worth $41 billion, it's a clever move.

Holders of the SNORT token get perks like lower fees, staking rewards estimated at 244% per year, and a say in the project's future.

With big influencers like Crypto Gains already backing it, it's easy to see why ICO momentum is building.

Snorter has even been featured on popular ranking sites like CoinSniper.

And none of this early hype comes at the expense of security, since Coinsult and SolidProof have audited the SNORT token, finding no vulnerabilities.

So, while PENGU might be the hottest topic right now, many traders believe Snorter will be the next meme coin to take off.

June 30, 2025 12:28 pm


One of the so-called “North-West gang of eight”, who was prosecuted by the Information Commissioner's Office for obtaining customers' contact information without their consent, has hit back at the regulator, insisting there was no evidence of financial gain or criminal intent.
Craig Cornick, who runs multiple businesses in the legal and financial services sector, was accused of historical offences, alleged to have taken place between 2014 and 2017 within a previous business.
The private prosecution centred on the alleged hacking and obtaining of customers' contact information without their consent.
Jurors unanimously found Cornick not guilty of one count of conspiring to access computer systems without authority but guilty of unlawfully obtaining personal data.
In a statement following the proceedings, Cornick said: “I am relieved to have been cleared of some serious and damaging accusations. The claims of computer hacking were shown to be completely unfounded, with no evidence of criminal intent or harm.
“While I acknowledge the challenging and important role the ICO plays in protecting citizens' personal data, I reject any notion of wrongdoing.”
Cornick emphasised that he was willing to engage with ICO investigators early in the process and fully co-operate with their inquiries.
However, the ICO did not formally interview Cornick, nor obtain information through court orders and search warrants.
Cornick stated: “I was never subject to any searches of my personal or business properties, I was never interviewed, and my companies have never failed an audit. They are built on professionalism and trust and this result changes none of that.
In relation to the charge of unlawfully obtaining personal data, a majority guilty verdict was returned by the jury, although Cornick's legal representatives are keen to point out that by this stage the jury had reduced to 10 people, with the maximum sentence for this charge being a financial penalty.
Cornick stated: “I have managed all my business ventures both past and present with integrity, and this was made clear throughout the case. I plan to clear my name and protect the reputation of my companies and the hard-working staff.
“Our technology has assisted in the processing of millions of claims over the years across multiple businesses and have always complied with every rule and regulation. This outcome does not reflect how we operate nor who we are.
“We're proud of our record and will continue building ethical, compliant businesses that deliver measurable success.”
Laura Smith, head of corporate and financial crime at Cartwright King Solicitors, said: “We welcome the not guilty verdict of count one which clears Mr Cornick of serious wrongdoing.
“This was a private prosecution brought by the ICO, relating to offences said to have taken place a significant number of years ago. No evidence was produced throughout the prosecution case that showed Cornick, or the company received or processed stolen data.
“He maintains a strong standing within the business, legal and technology communities and will continue to carry on as normal as we work to fully clear his name.”
Cornick's legal team are now planning to appeal.

Cornick stated: “I have managed all my business ventures both past and present with integrity, and this was made clear throughout the case. I plan to clear my name and protect the reputation of my companies and the hard-working staff.
“Our technology has assisted in the processing of millions of claims over the years across multiple businesses and have always complied with every rule and regulation. This outcome does not reflect how we operate nor who we are.
“We're proud of our record and will continue building ethical, compliant businesses that deliver measurable success.”
Laura Smith, head of corporate and financial crime at Cartwright King Solicitors, said: “We welcome the not guilty verdict of count one which clears Mr Cornick of serious wrongdoing.
“This was a private prosecution brought by the ICO, relating to offences said to have taken place a significant number of years ago. No evidence was produced throughout the prosecution case that showed Cornick, or the company received or processed stolen data.
“He maintains a strong standing within the business, legal and technology communities and will continue to carry on as normal as we work to fully clear his name.”
Cornick's legal team are now planning to appeal.

The central bank (BOK) has paused preparations for the next phase of its digital won program, Bloomberg News reported Monday (June 30), citing comments from a bank official.

According to Bloomberg, the decision is happening as the stablecoin market has become a prominent item on the agenda of new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who wants to allow a wide range of companies to get involved with stablecoins.

Proposed legislation in South Korea would let businesses with equity as low as 500 million won ($370,000) to issue won-based stablecoins.

The report notes that the BOK's move is in line with rising skepticism among central banks about the need for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), while also pushing for rules to make sure stablecoins don't cause financial disruption.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a bill creating a regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, while Hong Kong and Taiwan are the jurisdictions in Asia exploring rules for stablecoins.

The Bloomberg report points out that at a recent an international conference hosted by the BOK, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller argued that stablecoins create an opportunity for nonbanks to enter the payments sector, creating competition for banks that could lower costs.

The report comes days after a BOK official called for won-pegged stablecoins to be rolled out gradually, starting with strictly regulated commercial banks.

“It is desirable to first allow banks, which are under a high level of regulations, to issue (won-based stablecoins) and gradually expand to the non-bank sector with the experience,” said Ryoo Sang-dai, the BOK's senior deputy governor, whose comments at a press conference were reported by Reuters.

At the same time, not every banking institution is totally on board with stablecoins, as covered here last week. For example, the newly published Bank for International Settlements Annual Economic Report 2025 includes a chapter which argues that stablecoins “perform poorly” as a form of sound money.

“The document argued that most stablecoins fail critical criteria for a currency, such as price stability, universal acceptability and trust. It also pointed to the fact that stablecoins are frequently exploited by criminals and lack the elasticity of credit that underpins modern financial systems,” PYMNTS wrote.

 The Bank of Korea reportedly suspended its central bank digital currency trials as participating banks are tempted by the government's promise to allow stablecoins. 

South Korea's central bank has reportedly postponed the testing of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) as the country's government has increasingly aired support for local currency stablecoins.

On Sunday, the Bank of Korea told banks taking part in CBDC tests that started in April that it was temporarily suspending and postponing the second round of tests slated for later this year, local outlets the Yonhap News Agency and The Chosun Daily reported on Monday.

A senior official at one of the seven banks taking part in the tests told Yonhap that the central bank is waiting to see the government's plans for stablecoins and how a CBDC would fit with such tokens.

Newly elected President Lee Jae-myung campaigned on a list of crypto promises, including allowing for the issuance of stablecoins, crypto tokens that track the price of currencies such as the Korean won.

His party put forward a bill earlier this month that would allow companies to issue such tokens with a minimum equity capital of 500 million Korean won ($370,000). 

One senior banking official said that the second part of the CBDC trials was already “on the verge of collapse” as the seven participating banks became unhappy with the cost of taking part.

The participating banks reportedly told the Bank of Korea that the trial was too expensive and were unhappy that the central bank hadn't specified a commercialization plan for the CBDC.

The Bank of Korea floated moving the second half of the tests from later this year to the first half of next year and could limit the number of financial institutions taking part, an unnamed senior banking official told Yonhap.

The first stage of the CBDC tests involved 100,000 participants testing payments using the central-bank-issued currency, which ran from April 1 to June 30 and the second stage would expand the number of merchants and bring in remittances.

The banks reportedly wanted to focus on issuing their own stablecoins, seemingly as there is a clearer path to financially benefiting from such tokens.

On Wednesday, it was reported that eight South Korean banks would team up to launch a won-backed stablecoin by next year.

Half of the banks that came together for the stablecoin — KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Woori and NongHyup — also took part in the first stage CBDC trials.

Shares in some South Korean fintech companies fell on Monday after news of the CBDC suspension and banks' desire to focus on stablecoins.

Shares in the mobile payment app KakaoPay Corp were down 7% as of 2 pm local time, while payments firm Hecto Financial was down around 5%. 

KB Financial Group, the parent company of KB Kookmin, saw a 0.8% bump, while Shinhan was up 1.6% so far on the day.

The Bank of Korea (BOK) suspended its central bank digital currency project, Singaporean financial newspaper Business Times reported on Monday. 

The project had reached the stage of developing a pilot program with participating banks.

The central bank told the banks it will pause discussions related to the initiative, according to the report, which cited an unidentified BOK official.

South Korea's President Lee Jae-myung, who took office June 4, courted the country's cryptocurrency community during his election campaign. Among his promises was a pledge to support a won-based stablecoin market.

Earlier this month, Lee's ruling Democratic party submitted a bill that would allow qualifying companies to issue stablecoins. 

CBDCs are a form of fiat currency that are meant to act as a digital counterpart to cash. They have been criticized as a concept, particularly among the crypto community, over concerns about privacy, surveillance and state control. 

The Bank of Korea did not respond to CoinDesk's request for comment.

Key Takeaways:

South Korea's efforts to introduce a central bank digital currency (CBDC) have hit a pause. The Bank of Korea (BOK) has suspended its second round of testing for the digital won, citing rising costs for banks and a lack of long-term commercial strategy. As legislative interest grows around stablecoins, banks appear to be pivoting their priorities.



On June 26, the Bank of Korea notified participating financial institutions that it would suspend discussions and preparations for the second phase of its CBDC pilot, known as Project Han River. The decision follows growing concerns from banks about the mounting expenses required for testing and unclear prospects for the digital won's commercialization.

Seven commercial banks participated in the initial phase of testing, which began in April and involved 100,000 users converting bank deposits into “deposit tokens” for real-world retail transactions. Despite progress, banks demanded a clearer roadmap for rollout and questioned the feasibility of further participation without stronger guarantees.

On average, each bank invested approximately 5 billion KRW ($3.75 million) into infrastructure and compliance systems for the first round of testing. Combined, the institutions are estimated to have spent nearly 35 billion KRW ($260 million).

One banking executive remarked, “The CBDC, stablecoins, and deposit tokens aren't well-differentiated. With stablecoin regulation underway, there's too much uncertainty to continue investing without knowing the end game.”

In response, BOK Governor Rhee Chang-yong met with bank CEOs in late June, proposing that the central bank cover at least half the cost of the next testing phase. Despite this, BOK failed to rally sufficient commitment from stakeholders.

The suspension also aligns with the Korean National Assembly's ongoing efforts to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Lawmakers are currently drafting a bill to permit issuance of won-pegged stablecoins, which could be issued by either banks or fintech firms.

According to multiple bank officials, the legislative uncertainty has forced the BOK to reassess the timing and scope of its CBDC initiatives. “They want to wait until there's clarity on the stablecoin law before continuing,” one participant confirmed.

Notably, the organizational structure of BOK's CBDC division is also changing. The digital currency experiment team will be absorbed into a different unit, signaling a broader internal shift in strategy.

As CBDC development stalls, banks are accelerating efforts to develop and issue their own stablecoins, sometimes in cooperation with blockchain firms. Several banks are exploring joint ventures and consortia that would issue digital tokens pegged to the Korean won.

BOK had previously asserted that its “deposit token” model was essentially equivalent to a stablecoin under government oversight. However, with the CBDC initiative delayed, banks are now pursuing parallel paths.

The central bank's decision had immediate ripple effects. Stocks tied to stablecoin and digital payment technology plunged as news of the suspension emerged.

Kakao Pay dropped 9.3% on the KOSPI on June 30, while LG CNS fell 10.8%. Stocks related to other stablecoins like ME2ON and Dozn also experienced sharp declines. The market drop is a clear sign of investor anxiety around the regulatory future and potential competition between stablecoin providers.



Crypto analysts point out that although both CBDCs and stablecoins have similar transactional use cases, they are fundamentally very different in structure. CBDCs are a centralised tool and are issued and controlled by central banks unlike the world of stablecoins which work in decentralised settings with a mix of degrees of transparency and the stability of its backing.

As the competition for stablecoin regulation intensifies, South Korea's move can serve as an illustration for other countries considering the development of CBDC vs. private sector alternatives.

BOK has not revoked its CBDC plans per se, but the roadmap has been rescheduled indefinitely. The central bank may conduct a review of the 2nd test phase in the middle of 2026, insiders claimed, depending on the outcome of the stablecoin legislative process.

Banks which still want to be involved in further possible tests may be invited individually. But with no binding commercial plan or guarantee of funding, enthusiasm has cooled.

Meanwhile, banks are exploring nimbler blockchain applications that can generate revenue and get to market faster, and with less regulatory headaches.

For the time being, South Korea's CBDC saga is stalled, and the fight for supremacy of the digital asset realm now moves to the stablecoin front.

As the U.S. government takes big steps to usher cryptocurrency into mainstream finance, one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges is urging the Canadian government to match and exceed those efforts, even as concerns mount.

Coinbase Global Inc. is pushing hard to educate Canadian politicians about the moment in the hope of seeing someone in government champion the cause, said Lucas Matheson, who leads the company's Canadian division.

“We need to drive a sense of urgency in our government to take crypto seriously, and to embrace this technology, to integrate it into our traditional financial system,"" he said in an interview.

A key focus in that push is to bring more legitimacy to stablecoins, a type of crypto designed to keep a steady value by pegging it to a currency, often the U.S. dollar, and holding reserves to back it up.

The idea is that by avoiding the volatility that crypto is often known for, stablecoins can work better as a form of internet-based currency. They offer the potential for faster and cheaper money transfers, especially across borders, though come with their own risks.

One of the biggest concerns so far is that without regulation, it's been hard to know if stablecoin issuers like Tether International and Circle Internet Financial actually hold the collateral they claim.

Following the U.S. lead

An industry-supported bill moving quickly through the U.S. government seeks to address those concerns by setting rules about the need to back stablecoins one-for-one to either U.S. dollars or short-term treasuries, and issuing regular financial reports.

“What the U.S. has done is establish some credibility at the most senior levels of government, and we hope that that inspires our elected officials to do the same” said Matheson.

Regulators in Canada, however, still treat stablecoins like other forms of crypto: as a security. That means it's considered an investment, rather than a form of payment.

“We're keen for Canada to also embrace some frameworks and definitions around stablecoins,” said Matheson.

“A lot of the advocacy work in Canada has been focused on our federal government, our new Minister of Finance (François-Philippe) Champagne, to help his office understand the opportunity to embrace crypto.”

Going mainstream

There's no doubt stablecoins are becoming big business.

Tether, the largest U.S.-dollar backed stablecoin, has seen the market capitalization of its token go from under US$10 billion in 2020 to almost US$160 billion. Meanwhile it made US$13 billion in profit last year thanks to the interest on the treasuries it holds as collateral.

The market as a whole is estimated to be around US$250 billion, but could grow to some US$2 trillion by 2028 as the U.S. law paves the way for growth, estimates Standard Chartered.

The growth coincides with efforts to bring the option more directly to consumers, including Shopify's announced partnership with Coinbase in mid-June to make stablecoins a standard option for payments.

For merchants, the option offers potential savings on fees linked to other forms of payments like credit cards, though for consumers the benefits aren't so clear.

Matheson said it's still early days, but he could see some companies using virtual rewards to entice people to use them.

“I would imagine there will be a world where you will go to a Shopify merchant, that merchant will offer a token-gated experience where maybe you need an NFT, to hold that NFT as part of a loyalty program, or as part of a previous purchase. And now that you have that token, you can enter into the token-gated experience that's sort of limited and exclusive, and then shop with a merchant, and receive digital twins of those products as a warranty, as a receipt, and as a collectible.”

While it's still not clear what consumer appetite is for stablecoins, they're already proving to be very popular with criminals.

Research firm Chainalysis figures that there was some US$51 billion of stablecoins received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses last year, and that they accounted for 63 per cent of all illicit crypto flows.

Proponents like Matheson tout the traceability and transparency of the blockchain, but as the current levels of illicit flows show, there are ways to get around that through the use of software that can combine transactions and obfuscate the flow of crypto.

Growing risks

And while criminal flows are a problem now, there is also growing concerns about the implications of stablecoins becoming a bigger segment of the financial industry.

The Bank for International Settlements, a central bank-backed global institution tasked with helping maintain financial stability, put out a warning just last week.

“If stablecoins continue to grow, they could pose financial stability risks,” said BIS in a report.

Along with concerns about crime, the report warned about the risks if a coin-issuer stumbled or collapsed. It said the boom in stablecoins resembles 19th century banking in the U.S., where each bank was printing its own bills and there were panic withdrawals when customers started to doubt the soundness of some banks.

“Society has a choice. The monetary system can transform into a next-generation system built on tried and tested foundations ... or society can relearn the historical lessons about the limitations of unsound money, with real societal costs, by taking a detour involving private digital currencies.”

There's also a concern of stablecoins trying to act more like banks by offering interest on holdings, and the potential stability risks that come with that.

The U.S. law actually prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest, in part because of such concerns, but Matheson wants to see Canada to drop its own ban.

“Currently that is not a permitted activity in Canada, providing yield on stablecoins, but it's something certainly our industry is advocating for with our regulators.”

As the industry pushes to be more integrated in the financial industry, it continues to be dogged by concerns of scams and questionable dealings, including by the many crypto initiatives being launched by the family of U.S. President Donald Trump.

But Matheson said modernizing rules around crypto is the answer.

""Regulatory clarity will trump all other temporary behaviour or experimentation that we're seeing in the market.”

Technology, Speed, Potential","https://newswatchtv.com/2025/06/30/what-makes-these-3-the-best-crypto-coins-to-invest-in-now-technology-speed-potential/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:07:30 GMT","

By: Alex Rivera

Today's top-performing coins integrate next-generation development tools, efficient consensus mechanisms, and vast scalability potential. These three attributes, technology, speed, and growth potential, are setting apart a few cryptocurrencies currently gaining serious traction. For instance, Qubetics introduces a developer-first approach driven by its AI-integrated IDE.



On the other hand, Ripple and Tron continue to dominate in enterprise utility and transaction efficiency, respectively.

This article unpacks why these three are great choices for anyone analyzing the best crypto coins to invest in now. With 2025's focus on high-tech features more than mere crypto noise, these tokens can be worthwhile candidates.

Qubetics is attracting widespread attention for one key reason: it simplifies blockchain development to the point where anyone, regardless of coding experience, can build on it. Central to this transformation is QubeQode, the project's powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

QubeQode reimagines smart contract creation through a drag-and-drop user interface designed for accessibility without compromising technical capabilities. Instead of manually scripting contract logic line by line, users can visually assemble code blocks, minimizing the margin for error and accelerating deployment. This model allows development teams to scale more efficiently while expanding accessibility for those without traditional coding backgrounds.



What amplifies Qubetics' technical edge further is the integration of artificial intelligence throughout the development pipeline. QubeQode includes AI-driven features that auto-generate optimized code snippets, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract logic, and suggest efficiency improvements. This use of AI in blockchain development not only boosts productivity but also enhances code quality and security.

This multi-layered approach makes Qubetics highly versatile among the best crypto coins to invest in now. It lowers entry barriers for emerging developers while simultaneously providing advanced tools for seasoned professionals looking to streamline operations.

Currently in Stage 37 of its public sale phase, Qubetics is rapidly approaching its hard cap. With a fixed token price of $0.3370, more than $18.1 million has already been raised. Over 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold, with the number of unique holders surpassing 28,300. What's noteworthy is that fewer than 9 million $TICS tokens remain at this stage.

Qubetics is on the cusp of a breakthrough as it prepares to go live on a top 10 centralized exchange on June 30 at 11:00 AM UTC. The presale wraps up just three hours earlier at 8:00 AM UTC.

Set to launch at a forecasted price of $0.40, Qubetics offers early backers a projected 20% return on investment from the final presale tier. This isn't just a listing; it's a pivotal leap from presale hype to real-world trading, hinting at broader liquidity, stronger exchange visibility, and enhanced enterprise traction.

$4,000 is allocated at the current price of $0.3370. This would yield approximately 11,869 $TICS tokens. If the price rises to the forecasted listing value of $0.40, that initial outlay would grow to $4,747, representing a 20% return.

Should $TICS reach $1 after the crypto presale concludes, the same token allocation would be worth $11,869. At $5, the figure would rise to $59,345. Market analysts have modeled additional growth scenarios based on network utility post-mainnet launch.

If $TICS hits $10, the return increases to $118,690. At $15, the total value would be $178,035, which is a 4,349% increase from the original capital.

While not guarantees, these forecasts present realistic possibilities given market trends.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Qubetics stands out because it transforms how people build in Web3. It eliminates complexity without sacrificing capability, and its AI integration redefines what blockchain development workflows can look like in the future.

Ripple is well known for transforming how money moves across borders. It enables near-instant global payments by connecting financial institutions through its proprietary blockchain protocol. Unlike traditional remittance systems, which rely on intermediaries and often take days to settle, Ripple transactions finalize in seconds with minimal fees.

The technology underpinning Ripple has proven resilient, scaling efficiently even under high-volume traffic. Its consensus protocol avoids energy-intensive mining while still maintaining decentralization through trusted validators. This structure allows the network to process over 1,500 transactions per second, outperforming legacy systems and many Layer 1 chains.

Its ongoing work with global banks and payment providers has positioned it as one of the few digital assets with practical enterprise integration. Ripple has made significant inroads into corridors in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, enabling liquidity management and fiat conversion in real time.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Ripple delivers institutional-grade infrastructure for Web3 finance. Its proven track record, technical scalability, and regulatory alignment make it one of the best crypto coins to invest in now.



Tron was designed with one major goal: to scale blockchain to support millions of users. Its high-throughput architecture and low transaction fees have helped it achieve this goal, particularly in regions where blockchain is used for everyday payments and digital commerce.

With a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, Tron confirms blocks every 3 seconds, one of the fastest settlement times in the market. The network's scalability and ultra-low fees have attracted a growing ecosystem of developers, particularly for decentralized applications (dApps) in entertainment, DeFi, and social media.

Through its partnership with USDD and a growing network of decentralized finance protocols, Tron is becoming a stable and liquid foundation for value transfer across jurisdictions. This dual utility, serving both high-frequency dApp activity and stablecoin settlement, gives Tron a unique place in the crypto stack.

Recent reports have also confirmed plans for regulatory alignment and public market exposure, including potential links to tokenized equities and other real-world assets.

Why this crypto makes it to this list: Tron's technical performance is unmatched in daily user engagement and transaction volume.

The market is saturated with tokens promising innovation, but few deliver across all metrics: developer accessibility, technical performance, and real-world use cases.

Qubetics simplifies blockchain creation with a revolutionary AI-based development tool. Ripple connects institutional finance to decentralized systems with speed and precision. Tron scales with ease, supporting millions of users daily and growing use in stablecoin settlements. They embody what the best crypto coins to invest in now truly represent: long-term utility built on technological excellence.

Qubetics is a blockchain platform featuring QubeQode, an AI-integrated drag-and-drop development environment that simplifies smart contract creation and dApp deployment.

Early-stage blockchain projects carry risks such as price volatility, smart contract bugs, and regulatory uncertainty. Users should always conduct their due diligence.

Ripple uses a unique consensus protocol that relies on trusted validators rather than mining, enabling fast, low-cost transactions while maintaining decentralization.

Tron's high throughput, minimal fees, and quick finality make it ideal for dApps and daily transactions, especially in cost-sensitive environments.

Yes, interoperability is increasingly prioritized across most blockchains.

This guide highlights three standout cryptocurrencies (Qubetics, Ripple, and Tron) as some of the best crypto coins to invest in now, thanks to their advanced technology, speed, and growth potential. Qubetics revolutionizes blockchain development with its AI-powered drag-and-drop IDE, QubeQode, making smart contract creation accessible and efficient. Ripple excels in institutional finance by enabling near-instant, low-cost cross-border payments with its scalable consensus protocol. Tron focuses on high-speed transactions and supports millions of daily users with its delegated proof-of-stake mechanism, fostering a growing ecosystem of decentralized apps and stablecoin use. Overall, these coins combine innovation, real-world utility, and strong market traction, positioning them as promising long-term candidates.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:coindesk.com","RWA News: Backed Debuts Tokenized Stocks on Bybit, Kraken and Solana DeFi Protocols","https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/06/30/backed-finance-debuts-tokenized-stocks-on-bybit-kraken-and-solana-defi-protocols","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 11:08:31 GMT","

Real-world asset tokenization firm Backed Finance is launching its tokenized stock offering on major crypto exchanges, and Solana SOL$156.98-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, bringing equities like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft and crypto-native platforms closer.

The offering includes some 60 equity and ETF tokens that are available for trading around-the-clock, the company said on Monday. 

Crypto exchanges Bybit and Kraken are first to allow trading with the tokens, followed by integrations with DeFi apps Kamino Swap, Raydium and Jupiter later in the day, the press release said. The tokens will soon be available as collateral for DeFi lending, too, Backed said.

The move comes as momentum grows for bringing traditional financial instruments including equities onto blockchain rails, also known as tokenization of real-world assets. Crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini, are seeking to expand into tokenized securities trading, while Robinhood was reportedly working on offering tokenized U.S. stocks for EU users.

Backed's rollout fits into that trend. The firm is orchestrated the xStocks Alliance, a group of exchanges and DeFi apps committed to building an open onchain market for real-world assets.

""xStocks represent a monumental leap forward in democratizing access to financial markets,"" Adam Levi, co-founder of Backed, said in a statement. 

""By bringing familiar assets onto the blockchain with unprecedented accessibility, we are not just bridging traditional finance and DeFi; we are building the foundational blocks for a truly open, efficient, and inclusive global financial system where everyone can participate in wealth creation,"" Levi said.

Bitcoin BTC$107,710.76 options flow on the leading decentralized onchain platform Derive.xyz shows that traders are preparing for downside price volatility over the next couple of weeks.

As of Monday, 20% of the platform's total BTC options open interest, valued at over $54 million, was concentrated in the July 11 expiry put options with strikes at $85,000, $100,000, and $106,000, according to data shared by Derive.

""This suggests that traders are positioning for potential downside, possibly bracing for macro uncertainty or profit-taking after recent strength,"" Nick Forster, founder of Derive told CoinDesk.

A put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset, such as BTC, at a predetermined price on or before a specified future date. A put buyer is implicitly bearish on the market, seeking to hedge against or profit from a potential decline in the underlying asset's price. Open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active options contracts at a given time.

Forster added that put options accounted for over 70% of the trading volume in the past 24 hours, a sign that ""BTC traders are on the defensive.""

The bearish flow contradicts activity on the centralized crypto options giant Deribit, where traders abandoned the July expiry put options while buying back upside bets or call options. The adjustment happened as BTC's price rose over 7% last week, marking a strong bounce from sub-$100,000 levels.

""We observe the dumping of no longer required $100,000 and below puts in July and buyback (blue) of $108,000-$115,000 plus calls. With a calmer environment and the upcoming July 4th U.S. long weekend, more inventory was sold onto dealers,"" Deribit noted on X.

Traders on Derive leaned bullish on ether, with about 30% of open interest concentrated in the $2,900 strike call options and another 10% in the $3,200 call.

""This positioning seems to be driven by anticipation of ETHCC in Cannes – a major event historically associated with product announcements and ecosystem growth. Traders are clearly expecting catalysts that could drive upward momentum,"" Forster noted.

Bitcoin BTC$107,710.76 has been consolidating above $100,000 since the start of May. The only time the price drop below $100,000 was on 22 June, which was a weekend when tensions escalated between Iran and the U.S.

However, due to typically low trading volume over weekends, price action is often less reliable during those periods since crypto is the only industry that trades continuously.

Despite ongoing discussions about public companies acquiring bitcoin globally, on top of the availability of exchange-traded funds in the United States, investors are still wondering why bitcoin has not yet broken to new all-time highs above $112,000.

On-chain data, specifically the revived supply breakdown by age, shows elevated levels of bitcoin being sold by investors who have held their coins for a minimum of 3 years and in some cases for over 10 years. 

Analyst Checkmate provided this data and commented, “Look at all this price suppression selling by market manipulators who acquired their coins more than 3 years ago and are definitely not selling for profit in a bull market... Much paper.” 

This implies that for every buyer there is a seller, and in a bull market, the higher the price climbs, the more likely the market will find sellers willing to offload their holdings.

Checkmate further added, “Always chopping sideways. Suppression == Boredom.” As bitcoin has been consolidating for some time, this is typically where the narrative of market suppression gains traction. However, the data indicates that persistent selling pressure continues rather than deliberate suppression.

 Kazakhstan's central bank is set to establish a state-run crypto reserve, likely funded by seized digital assets and government-linked mining. 

The National Bank of Kazakhstan plans to establish a state-managed cryptocurrency reserve, according to a Monday report by government news agency Kazinform.  

Local authorities are studying the development of a crypto reserve, which would follow international practices. Typically, such reserves are likely to be funded with expropriated digital assets and state-run crypto mining operations, the report said.

National Bank of Kazakhstan Chairman Timur Suleimenov acknowledged the volatility and risks associated with crypto assets. He said that placing the reserve under the control of a centralized institution would ensure proper oversight and risk management.

A response from the national bank to a parliamentary inquiry concerning digital assets, dated May 22, also said that the central bank supported the creation of a state-run crypto reserve. The document suggested that it could be managed by a national bank subsidiary specializing in alternative investments.

This is just the latest in a series of reports concerning Kazakhstan's adoption of cryptocurrencies. In May, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced plans to launch “CryptoCity,” a pilot zone where cryptocurrencies can be used to pay for goods and services.

Kanysh Tuleushin, Kazakhstan's first vice minister of digital development, said in May that with easier regulation, the country could become a leading crypto hub in Central Asia.

At the same time, authorities are pursuing stricter enforcement, as seen in the crackdown on 36 illegal cryptocurrency exchanges in 2024. Officials said the crackdown aimed to curb money laundering and bolster financial oversight.

State-run national cryptocurrency reserves are gaining popularity worldwide, although such initiatives typically only consider Bitcoin (BTC) as an option. Last week, Pradeep Bhandari, spokesperson for India's ruling BJP party, called for a Bitcoin reserve pilot and clarity on the country's approach to crypto.

Earlier this month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill officially authorizing the creation of the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Both initiatives follow the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

The US is also seeing increasing momentum behind the idea. US Senator Cynthia Lummis recently said that certain divisions within the American military support the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve to mitigate economic warfare threats.

 The new compliance solution may cut billions in compliance costs for institutions looking to invest in the crypto economy. 

Chainlink, a decentralized blockchain oracle network for crosschain communication, launched a compliance framework aimed at unlocking over $100 trillion worth of institutional investor capital for the cryptocurrency space.

The decentralized oracle network announced the release of its Automated Compliance Engine (ACE) on Monday. The system provides a modular and standardized framework for managing regulatory compliance across both traditional and decentralized finance (DeFi) systems.  

Chainlink said the new standard will allow the creation of compliance-focused digital assets and services across public and private blockchain networks, including reusable digital identities, automated policy enforcement, crosschain compliant digital asset settlement and regulated asset usage in DeFi.

ACE is currently in early access for select institutions and aims to unlock $100 trillion worth of new capital to enter the blockchain economy, the announcement said.

The standard was built on the Chainlink Runtime Environment and is launching in collaboration with market participants, including financial solutions provider Apex Group, the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) and the ERC-3643 Association.

Existing compliance processes in traditional finance are often fragmented and expensive, resulting in billions of dollars in costs for institutions.

Financial crime compliance for institutions in the US and Canada cost upward of $60 billion in 2023, according to a research report by LexisNexis and Forrester Consulting.

Chainlink said its privacy-preserving compliance framework integrates existing digital identity solutions and supports both onchain and offchain policy enforcements, enabling institutional digital asset deployment in a compliant manner.

ACE aims to make digital asset compliance faster, cheaper and more accurate, according to Sergey Nazarov, the co-founder of Chainlink.

“If you make a digital asset and use the Chainlink standard for compliance in that digital asset, it will be better, cheaper, and faster than its traditional alternative,” said Nazarov, adding:

Previous solutions often relied on manual processes for risk monitoring and identity verification, which often resulted in duplicated efforts across counterparties due to a lack of transparency.

In contrast, Chainlink's architecture allows compliance logic to be reusable, upgradeable and enforceable across any combination of token standards, which it claims will result in smaller onboarding costs and operational complexities.

Chainlink's compliance engine is a “powerful example of how verifiable organizational identity can enhance compliance across blockchain ecosystems,” according to Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF.

“As regulatory expectations evolve in both digital and traditional finance, we encourage all financial institutions to explore with their solution providers how adopting the vLEI can strengthen trust, interoperability and auditability in their compliance frameworks,” said Kech.

 Long-term Bitcoin holders have been selling to institutions since spot ETFs launched, keeping prices stagnant. 

Long-term holder selling pressure has stunted the growth of Bitcoin's price, despite recent moves from institutions and corporations to buy the asset, according to an analyst. 

“People are wondering why Bitcoin has been stuck at $100K so long, despite the institutional FOMO,” said Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards on Sunday. 

He added that this is largely due to Bitcoin (BTC) OGs — long-term holders — who have been “dumping on Wall Street” and “unloading their positions” since the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds launched in January 2024. 

Edwards shared a chart showing Bitcoin holder growth rates, with the six-month holder cohort surging, representing the new wave of BTC treasury companies. 

Edwards predicted that these Bitcoin treasury companies would create “a huge flywheel buying frenzy” and push the ETF narrative into the backseat. 

“We have clearly entered the heat of that today, as many copy-cats have entered the market,” he said.

Several new corporate investors emerged just last week, including real estate giant Cardone Capital; Anthony Pompliano's venture firm ProCap, which plans to go public; mineral exploration company Panther Metals; and Norwegian deep-sea mining firm Green Minerals.

Jeff Mei, chief operating officer at the BTSE crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph that in the short term, traders are taking profit ahead of the July 9 tariff deadline, as many expect core issues to remain unresolved. 

“They're hedging against a plunge in market prices in case trade talks go south,” he said, adding that more and more publicly listed companies are adding Bitcoin to their treasury operations. 

Meanwhile, Han Xu, director of liquid fund investments at HashKey Capital, told Cointelegraph that investors and traders were waiting for US macroeconomic data reports and policy updates coming this week.

“Updates on trade deals ahead of the reciprocal tariff deadline, along with the progress of Trump's budget bill, are both key risks that need to clear before a continuation of the bullish trend resumes,” he said, cautioning that any surprises “could trigger a sell-off.”

Bitcoin prices have been largely range-bound since they broke above six figures for the second time this year in early May. The asset has oscillated between $102,000 and $110,000 with a couple of brief spikes and dips outside of that range. 

Despite this market inactivity, spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States have seen more than $3.2 billion in inflows without an outflow day over the past fortnight. Meanwhile, the number of new Bitcoin treasury companies continues to increase weekly. 

BTC was trading up 1.2% on the day and had tapped resistance at $108,750 on Monday, its highest level for two weeks, but had failed to break above it at the time of writing.

“This discovery opens new doors to our understanding of daily life, spirituality, and urban planning in the Delta.”

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

The discovery of the ancient city Imet in Egypt's eastern Nile Delta offers intriguing insights, including the architectural urbanization of the area prior to the Roman era, and worship of the city's patron deity, the cobra goddess Wadjet. 

Excavations at Tell el-Fara'in reveal cultural norms during the early- to middle-fourth century B.C., which feature intricate urbanization with “substantial tower houses,” structures that were basically multi-story buildings supported by exceptionally thick foundation walls, according to a statement from the University of Manchester. 

“These tower houses are mainly found in the Nile Delta between the Late Period and the Roman era, and are rare elsewhere in Egypt,” Nicky Nielsen, researcher with the University of Manchester, said in a statement. “Their presence here shows that Imet was a thriving and densely built city with a complex urban infrastructure.” 

The thick foundation walls were designed to support the weight of the tall buildings. The houses, with their multiple floors, were crafted to accommodate many people, Mohamed Ismail Khaled, secretary general of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, said in a translated statement from the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.

The researchers located the city using remote sensing via high-resolution satellite imagery. The images identified clusters of ancient mudbricks that led the team to on-the-ground excavation. It was then they discovered the tower houses. 

But that wasn't all they found. The team discovered a grain processing center, which featured a paved area and animal enclosures. The find offers information about both the local economy and the religious significance of the area. Nielsen said Imet was prominent during the New Kingdom, sometime between 1550 and 1069 B.C. and its location along trade routes allowed it to maintain importance, especially as it attracted Wadjet pilgrims and merchants.

A newer find, from the mid-Ptolemaic Period of about 200 B.C., showed a large structure with a limestone plaster floor and impressive pillars wrapped with stucco. The building was constructed across a processional road that once connected to the temple of Wadjet. Researchers believe that this new building, placed over  the ceremonial road shows the worship of Wadjet had waned by that time, offering insight into a shifting religious landscape in ancient Egypt. 

The temple of Wadjet was rebuilt by Ramses II in the mid-1200s B.C., and then again by Ahmose II in the mid-500s B.C. but began a decline thereafter. 

The past religious culture of Imet has started to come into greater clarity in the present day, thanks to finds like a green faience ushabti (a ceramic funerary figurine) from the 26th Dynasty, a stela (an upright stone slab with a relief design) of the god Harpocrates (the Greek name for Horus the Child) standing on two crocodiles while holding a snake, and a bronze sistrum musical instrument adorned with the twin heads of Hathor, goddess of music and joy. 

“This discovery opens new doors to our understanding of daily life, spirituality, and urban planning in the Delta,” Nielsen said. “Imet is emerging as a key site for rethinking the archaeology of Late Period Egypt.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Elon Musk Promised Driverless Taxis—Instead, You Get a Guy in the Passenger Seat","https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/hybrid-electric/a65210102/tesla-robo-taxi-supervisor/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

Waymo followed a similar approach, but unlike Tesla, they didn't claim for years that they wouldn't need a safety monitor.

Here's what you'll learn reading this story.

Tesla has unleashed its fleet of Robotaxis on the streets of downtown Austin, Texas—with a “safety monitor” in the passenger seat. Seems like Elon Musk didn't deliver on his promise of delivering unsupervised rides this summer. Futurism and many other outlets reported that the information regarding the presence of the co-driver was disclosed in the invitation sent to those interested in being part of the pilot program. 

As we reported previously, the fleet will be confined to a geofenced area within the Austin city limits, and will comprise 10 Tesla Model Ys with the latest “unsupervised” version of Full-Self-Driving (FSD) software—a departure from the two-seat Cybercab we saw released last year.

After doing some digging, we discovered the invitation for those looking to participate in the early stages of Tesla's Robotaxi program. You can see it below.

Pretty much everyone is well aware of Musk's over-promise, under-deliver approach by now, and the Robotaxi rollout is another tally in that column. Musk promised as far back as 2019 that Tesla would have one million autonomous taxis on the road by the following year—a prediction that has clearly failed to come true.

That's not to say that the modern world is bereft of autonomous taxis. Volkswagen's ADMT service, Hyundai's Motional fleet, and Amazon's Zoox Fleet  have all launched test fleets, and Waymo even rolled out a fleet in the same city Tesla is trying to enter with a similar chaperone-in-the-passenger-seat precaution. But it is worth noting that Musk has spent years hyping up the fact that his service wouldn't need them. 

The news that Tesla would plonk a human “safety monitor” in the passenger seat was a bit surprising to us. Late last year, Electrek reported that Tesla was assembling a teleoperations team to monitor and remotely control each Robotaxi. Waymo employed a similar tactic when releasing its multiple fleets nationwide, allowing the vehicles to send alerts to the teleoperations team. That meant real humans would get a ping when a vehicle was stuck, and they could take steps to get the vehicle out of whatever bottleneck it found itself in.

However, that's where the similarities between the Waymo and Tesla fleets end. Tesla has defiantly stuck with their plan to exclusively use cameras to control its vehicles, while Waymo uses cameras that are backed up by radar sensors, LiDAR sensors, and ultrasonic sensors to understand the surroundings their cars drive through. Only time will tell if Tesla can remedy the apparent laundry list of problems it's having getting Full Self-Driving-equipped vehicles to operate without any training wheels.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:popularmechanics.com","Scientists Discovered a New Creature That Exists Between Life and Not-Life","https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a65193552/archaea-cell-virus/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Because they rely on hosts for a majority of functions, viruses aren't considered alive. But entities like ‘Sukunaarchaeum mirabile' complicated matters.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

At first glance, creating a definition for “life” seems somewhat straightforward. Sentient animals all the way down to single-celled organisms capable of reproduction are welcome on the tree of life, but there are other organisms that challenge this understanding, like viruses. Because virus don't grow, reproduce on their own, or make their own energy, they're typically excluded from definitions of life. But once a virus infects a host, it's immensely active, and can be responsible for world-altering events (see: Spanish flu, ebola, COVID-19, and so on). 

However, life is complicated, and this controversial categorization of “life” and “not life” can have gray areas in which organisms appear to defy the expectations of both camps. Recently, scientists found a new member of this head-scratching cadre. In a new paper published on the bioRxiv server, researchers in Canada and Japan outlined how they identified a new cellular entity that appeared to straddle the typical definitions of a virality and cellular life. 

Currently named ‘Sukunaarchaeum mirabile' (after a deity in Japanese mythology known for its small stature), this entity contains the necessary genes to create its own ribosomes and messenger RNA—something your typical virus lacks. But like a virus, it offloads certain biological functions onto its host and it appears singularly obsessed with replicating itself.

“Its genome is profoundly stripped-down, lacking virtually all recognizable metabolic pathways, and primarily encoding the machinery for its replicative core: DNA replication, transcription, and translation,” the authors wrote. “This suggests an unprecedented level of metabolic dependence on a host, a condition that challenges the functional distinctions between minimal cellular life and viruses.”

Led by Ryo Harada, a molecular biologist from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the team chanced upon this strange creature while studying the bacterial genome of the marine plankton Citharistes regius. Within the genomic data, Harada and his team found a loop of DNA that didn't match with any known species. They eventually determined that the organism belonged to the domain Archaea—a group associated with prokaryotic cells, but from which eukaryotic cells (i.e. you and me) ultimately descended a couple billion years ago. 

Perhaps the most remarkable feature of Sukunaarchaeum is its extreme genome reduction, with only 238,000 base pairs of DNA. Viruses, as Live Science points out, can contain many hundreds of thousands more base pairs, and can even reach up into the millions. As for fellow archaea, the smallest known complete genome within this group stretches to 490,000 base pairs, meaning that Sukunaarchaeum contains less than half the number of base pairs posessed by even the smallest archaeal genome. 

“The discovery of Sukunaarchaeum pushes the conventional boundaries of cellular life and highlights the vast unexplored biological novelty within microbial interactions,” the authors wrote. “Further exploration of symbiotic systems may reveal even more extraordinary life forms, reshaping our understanding of cellular evolution.”

To the point

Hansen's Disease, more commonly known as leprosy, is a chronic disease that can lead to physical impairment. Today it exists in over 100 countries, and while the infection is treatable, access to treatment varies widely with socioeconomic conditions. Its mention in historical texts give us a glimpse into its past impact on population health in Europe and Asia. Prolonged untreated infection can result in characteristic changes in bone, and these have been documented in archaeological skeletons as early as 5000 years ago in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. So far, absence of these characteristic changes in the pre-contact American contexts suggests that leprosy was one of the many diseases introduced to the continent in the colonial period. Thereafter it afflicted humans and curiously also armadillos.

From a genetic perspective, Hansen's Disease is caused by either the globally dominant Mycobacterium leprae or the newly identified and rare Mycobacterium lepromatosis. The recovery of M. leprae from archaeological bone in Europe suggests the disease originated in Eurasia sometime during the Neolithic transition about 7000 years ago. Similar emergence estimates have been proposed for other notorious diseases such as plague, tuberculosis, and typhoid fever. Ancient genomes for M. lepromatosis have remained elusive, and these may hold important clues on the history of Hansen's Disease.

Past disease in the American continent 

We know comparatively little about the infectious disease experience of the diverse communities of people living in the Americas before the colonial period. This accounts for almost 20,000 years of human history, and the diverse ecosystems into which humans integrated across the continent would have presented challenges to the immune system not otherwise encountered in other parts of the world. We know very little of these diseases, as they were smothered by the onslaught of pathogens that Europeans later brought with them. Archaeological study of human bones from the pre-contact Americas confirm that the time was far from disease-free, but often the traces seen on the bones aren't specific enough to assign to a known disease.

""Ancient DNA has become a great tool that allows us to dig deeper into diseases that have had a long history in the Americas,"" says Kirsten Bos, group leader for Molecular Paleopathology at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology. She and her team have been studying pathological bone from American context for over a decade. Some diseases that the group has found were expected - just last year they found evidence that the family of diseases closely related to syphilis had its roots in the Americas, which many had suspected. ""The advanced techniques now used to study ancient pathogen DNA allows us to look beyond the suspects and into other diseases that might not be expected from the context,"" she adds.

Re-writing the history of Hansen's Disease 

Bos's team worked closely with researchers from Argentina and Chile to both identify bones suitable for analysis and to carry out the meticulous work of isolating the DNA of ancient pathogens. Doctoral candidate Darío Ramirez of the University of Córdoba, Argentina, worked extensively with such material, and was the first to identify a genetic signature related to leprosy in some 4000-year-old skeletons from Chile. ""We were initially suspicious, since leprosy is regarded a colonial-era disease, but more careful evaluation of the DNA revealed the pathogen to be of the lepromatosis form."" This provided the first clue that M. lepromatosis and M. leprae, though nominally both pathogens that cause Hansen's Disease, might have very different histories. Reconstruction of the genome was key in looking into this. While putting the molecular puzzle of an ancient genome back together is never an easy task, these pathogens in particular had ""amazing preservation, which is uncommon in ancient DNA, especially from specimens of that age,"" comments Lesley Sitter, a postdoctoral researcher in Bos's team who carried out the analysis.

The pathogen is related to all known modern forms of M. lepromatosis, but as there are so few genomes available for comparison, there is still much to be learned about it. This work has shown that a pathogen considered rare in a modern context caused disease for thousands of years in the Americas. Rodrigo Nores, professor of Anthropology at the University of Córdoba, Argentina is convinced that more cases, both ancient and modern, will be identified in the coming years: ""this disease was present in Chile as early as 4000 years ago, and now that we know it was there, we can specifically look for it in other contexts."" Once more genomes surface, we'll be able to piece out further details of its history and better understand its global distribution today. The pathogen has recently been discovered in squirrel populations from the United Kingdom and Ireland, but in the Americas it has yet to be found in any species other than humans. With such little data, mystery still surrounds its origin. ""It remains to be determined if the disease originated in the Americas, or if it joined some of the first settlers from Eurasia,"" adds Bos. ""So far the evidence points in the direction of an American origin, but we'll need more genomes from other time periods and contexts to be sure.""

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Planets may start forming before stars even finish growing","http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250629033512.htm","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:21:23 GMT","

Signs of planet formation may appear earlier than expected around still-forming baby stars, according to new results of higher resolution images produced using new improved techniques to reanalyze radio astronomy archive data. These newly discovered signs of planet formation will provide a better understanding of when it begins around a young star, thereby elucidating the process that leads to planet formation, including habitable planets like Earth.

Planets form in disks composed of low-temperature molecular gas and dust, known as protoplanetary disks, found around protostars. Protostars are stars still in the process of forming. The nascent planets are too small to observe directly, but the gravity from a planet can create detectable patterns like rings or spirals in a protoplanetary disk. However, it is difficult to know when these patterns first appeared due to the limited number of protoplanetary disks that are close enough to Earth to be observed in high resolution.

A research team led by Ayumu Shoshi of Kyushu University and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) used improved data processing techniques to search for previously overlooked signs of planet formation in archive data from the ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array) radio telescope. The team reanalyzed data for 78 disks in the Ophiuchus star-forming region, located 460 light-years away in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus. More than half of the images produced in this study achieved a resolution over three times better than that of previous images.

The new high-resolution images show ring or spiral patterns in 27 of the disks. Of these, 15 were identified for the first time in this study. Combining this new sample with pervious work for a different star-forming region, the team found that the characteristic disk substructures emerge in disks larger than 30 au (astronomical units, 1 au = 149,597,870,700 m, the distance between the Earth and the Sun) around stars in the early stage of star formation, just a few hundred thousand years after a star was born. This suggests that planets begin to form at a much earlier stage than previously believed, when the disk still possesses abundant gas and dust. In other words, planets grow together with their very young host stars.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Quantum computers just beat classical ones — Exponentially and unconditionally","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250629033459.htm","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 06:32:47 GMT","

Quantum computers have the potential to speed up computation, help design new medicines, break codes, and discover exotic new materials -- but that's only when they are truly functional.

One key thing that gets in the way: noise or the errors that are produced during computations on a quantum machine -- which in fact makes them less powerful than classical computers - until recently.

Daniel Lidar, holder of the Viterbi Professorship in Engineering and Professor of Electrical & Computing Engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, has been iterating on quantum error correction, and in a new study along with collaborators at USC and Johns Hopkins, has been able to demonstrate a quantum exponential scaling advantage, using two 127-qubit IBM Quantum Eagle processor-powered quantum computers, over the cloud. The paper, ""Demonstration of Algorithmic Quantum Speedup for an Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem,"" was published in APS flagship journal Physical Review X.

""There have previously been demonstrations of more modest types of speedups like a polynomial speedup, says Lidar, who is also the cofounder of Quantum Elements, Inc. ""But an exponential speedup is the most dramatic type of speed up that we expect to see from quantum computers.""

The key milestone for quantum computing, Lidar says, has always been to demonstrate that we can execute entire algorithms with a scaling speedup relative to ordinary ""classical"" computers.

He clarifies that a scaling speedup doesn't mean that you can do things, say, 100 times faster. ""Rather, it's that as you increase a problem's size by including more variables, the gap between the quantum and the classical performance keeps growing. And an exponential speedup means that the performance gap roughly doubles for every additional variable. Moreover, the speedup we demonstrated is unconditional.""

What makes a speedup ""unconditional,"" Lidar explains, is that it doesn't rely on any unproven assumptions. Prior speedup claims required the assumption that there is no better classical algorithm against which to benchmark the quantum algorithm. Here, the team led by Lidar used an algorithm they modified for the quantum computer to solve a variation of ""Simon's problem,"" an early example of quantum algorithms that can, in theory, solve a task exponentially faster than any classical counterpart, unconditionally.

Simon's problem involves finding a hidden repeating pattern in a mathematical function and is considered the precursor to what's known as Shor's factoring algorithm, which can be used to break codes and launched the entire field of quantum computing. Simon's problem is like a guessing game, where the players try to guess a secret number known only to the game host (the ""oracle""). Once a player guesses two numbers for which the answers returned by the oracle are identical, the secret number is revealed, and that player wins. Quantum players can win this game exponentially faster than classical players.

So, how did the team achieve their exponential speedup? Phattharaporn Singkanipa, USC doctoral researcher and first author, says, ""The key was squeezing every ounce of performance from the hardware: shorter circuits, smarter pulse sequences, and statistical error mitigation.""

The researchers achieved this in four different ways:

First, they limited the data input by restricting how many secret numbers would be allowed (technically, by limiting the number of 1's in the binary representation of the set of secret numbers). This resulted in fewer quantum logic operations than would be needed otherwise, which reduced the opportunity for error buildup.

Second, they compressed the number of required quantum logic operations as much as possible using a method known as transpilation.

Third, and most crucially, the researchers applied a method called ""dynamical decoupling,"" which means applying sequences of carefully designed pulses to detach the behavior of qubits within the quantum computer from their noisy environment and keep the quantum processing on track. Dynamical decoupling had the most dramatic impact on their ability to demonstrate a quantum speedup.

Finally, they applied ""measurement error mitigation,"" a method that finds and corrects certain errors that are left over after dynamical decoupling due to imperfections in measuring the qubits' state at the end of the algorithm.

Says Lidar, who is also a professor of Chemistry and Physics at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science, ""The quantum computing community is showing how quantum processors are beginning to outperform their classical counterparts in targeted tasks, and are stepping into a territory classical computing simply can't reach., Our result shows that already today's quantum computers firmly lie on the side of a scaling quantum advantage.""

He adds that with this new research, The performance separation cannot be reversed because the exponential speedup we've demonstrated is, for the first time, unconditional."" In other words, the quantum performance advantage is becoming increasingly difficult to dispute.

Next steps:

Lidar cautions that ""this result doesn't have practical applications beyond winning guessing games, and much more work remains to be done before quantum computers can be claimed to have solved a practical real-world problem.""

This will require demonstrating speedups that don't rely on ""oracles"" that know the answer in advance and making significant advances in methods for further reducing noise and decoherence in ever larger quantum computers. Nevertheless, quantum computers' previously ""on-paper promise"" to provide exponential speedups has now been firmly demonstrated.

Many galaxies, including our own Milky Way, are characterized by a flat, extended, rotating stellar disk. These disk galaxies commonly contain two main parts: a thin disk and a thick disk. The thin disk contains younger, metal-rich stars, while the thick disk contains older, metal-poor stars. These distinct components hold fossil records that help astronomers understand how galaxies form stars, build up elements like oxygen and carbon, essential for life, and evolve into their present shapes.

Until now, thin and thick disks have only been identified in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies. It has been impossible with previous telescopes to distinguish the thin edge of a distant galaxy when viewed from the side.

That changed with the launching of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2021, which is currently the largest telescope in space.

An international team of researchers has examined 111 JWST images of distant edge-on galaxies, ones where the alignments enabled the researchers to observe the galaxies' vertical disk structures.

Takafumi Tsukui (formerly of the Australian National University and now based at Tohoku University), who led the research team, says that observing distant galaxies is like using a time machine, allowing us to see how galaxies have built their disks over cosmic history.

""Thanks to the JWST's sharp vision, we were able to identify thin and thick disks in galaxies beyond our local universe, some going as far back as 10 billion years ago.""

The study revealed a consistent trend: in the earlier universe, more galaxies appear to have had a single thick disk, while in later epochs, more galaxies showed a two-layered structure with an additional thin disk component. This suggests that galaxies first formed a thick disk, followed by the formation of a thin disk within it. In more massive galaxies, this thin disk appears to have formed earlier.

The study estimated the thin disk formation time for Milky Way-sized galaxies to be around 8 billion years ago. This figure aligns with formation timelines for the Milky Way itself, where stellar ages can be measured.

To understand the revealed sequential formation from thick to thin disks and the corresponding formation timelines, the team not only examined the stellar structure but also the motion of gas, direct ingredients of stars obtained from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and ground-based surveys in the literature. These observations supported a coherent formation scenario:

Tsukui emphasizes that the images provided by JWST help answer one of the biggest questions in astronomy: was our galaxy's formation typical or unique? ""The JWST images provided a window into galaxies that resemble the Milky Way's early state, bringing us valuable insights from galaxies far away.""

The team hopes that their study will help bridge studies of nearby galaxies with far away ones and refine our understanding of disk formation. The study was published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society on June 26, 2025.

Key points:

Exposure to fire smoke -- which can be composed of particulate matter, gases, materials from buildings such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), toxic metals, and carcinogenic compounds -- may alter the immune system on a cellular level, according to a new study led by researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The study is the first to examine the specific cellular changes associated with fire smoke exposure, documenting how smoke can damage the body through the immune system.

""We've known that smoke exposure causes poor respiratory, cardiac, neurological, and pregnancy outcomes, but we haven't understood how,"" said corresponding author Kari Nadeau, John Rock Professor of Climate and Population Studies and chair of the Department of Environmental Health. ""Our study fills in this knowledge gap, so that clinicians and public health leaders are better equipped to respond to the growing threat of difficult to contain, toxic wildfires.""

The study was published pn June 26 in Nature Medicine.

The researchers collected blood from two cohorts matched by age, sex, and socioeconomic status: 31 smoke-exposed adults, both firefighters and civilians, and 29 non-smoke-exposed adults. None of the participants had an acute or chronic condition, and none were taking immunomodulatory drugs at or before the time of the blood draw, which took place within one month after participants had been exposed to fire smoke.

Using cutting-edge single-cell -omic techniques -- epigenetic assays and mass cytometry -- and bioinformatic analytical tools, the researchers examined and analyzed individual cells within each blood sample.

The study found several cellular-level changes in the smoke-exposed individuals compared to the non-smoke-exposed individuals. Smoke-exposed individuals showed an increase in memory CD8+ T cells (a type of immune cell critical to long-term immunity against pathogens) and elevated activation and chemokine receptor biomarkers (indicators of inflammation and immune activity) within multiple cell types. Additionally, those who had been exposed to smoke showed changes in133 genes related to allergies and asthma, and more of their immune cells were bound with toxic metals, including mercury and cadmium.

""Our findings demonstrate that the immune system is extremely sensitive to environmental exposures like fire smoke, even in healthy individuals,"" said lead author Mary Johnson, principal research scientist in the Department of Environmental Health. ""Knowing exactly how may help us detect immune dysfunction from smoke exposure earlier and could pave the way for new therapeutics to mitigate, or prevent altogether, the health effects of smoke exposure and environmental contaminants.""

The researchers also noted that the study could help inform environmental and public health policies and investments. ""Knowing more about exactly how smoke exposure is harming the body, we may increase public health campaigns about the dangers of smoke exposure and the importance of following evacuation procedures during wildfires,"" Nadeau said. ""We may also reconsider what levels of smoke exposure we consider toxic.""

Other Harvard Chan co-authors included Abhinav Kaushik, Olivia Kline, Xiaoying Zhou, and Elisabeth Simonin.

The study was funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (R01 ES032253), the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (P01 HL152953, T32HL007118), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (U19AI167903), the San Francisco Cancer Prevention Foundation, the Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Center, and the Keck Foundation.

Scientists at The University of Texas at Arlington have identified a new enzyme that can be ""turned off"" to help the body maintain healthy cholesterol levels -- a significant development that could lead to new treatments for diseases that affect millions of Americans.

""We found that by blocking the enzyme IDO1, we are able to control the inflammation in immune cells called macrophages,"" said Subhrangsu S. Mandal, lead author of a new peer-reviewed study and professor of chemistry at UT Arlington. ""Inflammation is linked to so many conditions -- everything from heart disease to cancer to diabetes to dementia. By better understanding IDO1 and how to block it, we have the potential to better control inflammation and restore proper cholesterol processing, stopping many of these diseases in their tracks.""

Inflammation plays a crucial role in the immune system, helping the body fight infections and heal injuries. But when inflammation becomes abnormal -- due to stress, injury or infection -- it can damage cells, disrupt normal functions and increase the risk of serious diseases. During these periods, macrophages can't absorb cholesterol properly, which can lead to chronic disease.

The team -- Dr. Mandal, postdoctoral researcher Avisankar Chini; doctoral students Prarthana Guha, Ashcharya Rishi and Nagashree Bhat; master's student Angel Covarrubias; and undergraduate researchers Valeria Martinez, Lucine Devejian and Bao Nhi Nguyen -- found that the enzyme IDO1 becomes activated during inflammation, producing a substance called kynurenine that interferes with how macrophages process cholesterol.

When IDO1 is blocked, however, macrophages regain their ability to absorb cholesterol. This suggests that reducing IDO1 activity could offer a new way to help prevent heart disease by keeping cholesterol levels in check.

The researchers also found that nitric oxide synthase (NOS), another enzyme linked in inflammation, worsens the effects of IDO1. They believe that inhibiting NOS could provide another potential therapy for managing cholesterol problems driven by inflammation.

""These findings are important because we know too much cholesterol buildup in macrophages can lead to clogged arteries, heart disease and a host of other illnesses,"" Mandal said. ""Understanding how to prevent the inflammation affecting cholesterol regulation could lead to new treatments for conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer and others.""

Next, the research team plans to dig deeper into how IDO1 interacts with cholesterol regulation and whether other enzymes play a role. If they can find a safe way to block IDO1, it could open the door for more effective drugs to prevent inflammation-related diseases.

As wildfires increasingly threaten lives, landscapes, and air quality across the U.S., a Stanford-led study published in AGU Advances June 26 finds that prescribed burns can help reduce risks. The research reveals that prescribed burns can reduce the severity of subsequent wildfires by an average of 16% and net smoke pollution by an average of 14%.

""Prescribed fire is often promoted as a promising tool in theory to dampen wildfire impacts, but we show clear empirical evidence that prescribed burning works in practice,"" said lead author Makoto Kelp, a postdoctoral fellow in Earth system science at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. ""It's not a cure-all, but it's a strategy that can reduce harm from extreme wildfires when used effectively.""

Experts consider prescribed burns an effective strategy to reduce the threat of wildfires, and nearly $2 billion of federal funding had been set aside to conduct these and similar treatments to reduce hazardous fuel. Still, the use of prescribed burning in western states has expanded only slightly in recent years. Little research exists to quantify its effectiveness, and public opinion remains mixed amid concerns that prescribed burns can lead to smoky air and escaped fires.

Data-driven fire strategy

At Stanford, Kelp is working with climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh and environmental economist Marshall Burke through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship Program. Using high-resolution satellite imagery, land management records, and smoke emissions inventories, the research team compared areas treated with prescribed fire between late 2018 and spring 2020 to adjacent untreated areas that both later burned in the extreme 2020 fire season. The analysis found that areas treated with prescribed fire burned less severely and produced significantly less smoke.

That finding is particularly important given the growing recognition of wildfire smoke as a major public health threat. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfires has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular problems and is increasingly driving poor air quality across the U.S.

""People often think of wildfires just in terms of flames and evacuations,"" said Burke, an associate professor of environmental social sciences in the Doerr School of Sustainability. ""But the smoke is a silent and far-reaching hazard, and prescribed fire may be one of the few tools that actually reduces total smoke exposure.""

Not all treatments are equal

The study also highlights a key nuance: the authors found that prescribed fires were significantly more effective outside of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) -- the zones where homes meet wildland vegetation -- than within it. In WUI areas, where agencies often rely on mechanical thinning due to concerns about smoke and safety, fire severity was reduced by just 8.5%, compared to 20% in non-WUI zones.

""We already know that population is growing fastest in the areas of the wildland-urban interface where the vegetation is most sensitive to climate-induced intensification of wildfire risk,"" said Diffenbaugh, the Kara J Foundation Professor in the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and the Kimmelman Family Senior Fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. ""So, understanding why the prescribed fire treatments are less effective in those areas is a key priority for effectively managing that intensifying risk.""

Smoke tradeoffs and policy implications

The study addresses concerns about smoky air from prescribed burning, finding that the approach produces only about 17% of the PM2.5 smoke that would be emitted by a wildfire in the same area. The researchers estimate that if California met its goal of treating one million acres annually with prescribed fire, it could cut PM2.5 emissions by 655,000 tons over five years -- more than half of the total smoke pollution from the state's devastating 2020 wildfire season.

The authors note that their findings likely represent a conservative estimate of the benefits of prescribed fire, as such treatments can have protective spillover effects on surrounding untreated areas.

""This kind of empirical evidence is critical for effective policy,"" said Kelp. ""My hope is that it helps inform the ongoing conversation around prescribed fire as a potential wildfire mitigation strategy in California.""

Coauthors of the study also include Minghao Qiu of Stony Brook University, Iván Higuera-Mendieta, a PhD student in Earth system science at Stanford; and Tianjia Liu of the University of British Columbia.

Burke is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, and the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR); an associate professor (by courtesy) of Earth system science; and a member of Bio-X and the Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute.

The study was funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Stanford University.

Next generation weight-loss drugs are being developed and tested in China.Credit: Science Photo Library

A drug that outperforms placebo in helping people to lose weight is one of a growing number of next-generation obesity drugs being produced in China.

At first, Chinese pharmaceutical companies rushed to make similar versions of blockbuster weight-loss drugs, such as Wegovy and Ozempic, that have taken the world by storm. Nowadays, China is emerging as important innovator for new drug discovery in this field, says Daniel Drucker, an endocrinologist at the University of Toronto in Canada.

Results from a phase III trial of ecnoglutide show that people receiving a weekly injection of the drug lost up to 13.8 kilograms over 48 weeks of treatment. By contrast, people given placebo injections lost around 200 grams. The results were published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology on 21 June.

Ecnoglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist analogue, similar to the blockbuster obesity drug semaglutide. These drugs mimic the hormone GLP-1, which is involved in regulating appetite and managing blood-sugar levels. Unlike semaglutide, ecnoglutide preferentially targets the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, a messenger molecule associated with regulating glycogen, sugar and lipid metabolism, which helps to control blood-sugar levels, as well as weight loss.

The study, funded by drug manufacturer Sciwind Biosciences, based in Hangzhou, China, included 664 people given either a weekly injection of a placebo, or one of three doses of ecnoglutide. At the maximum dose of 2.4 milligrams, 92.8% of people lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared with 14% of people receiving placebo injections. People receiving ecnoglutide were also able to maintain their reduced weight after stopping treatment, regaining around 1% of their body weight over a 7-week period.

Linong Ji, a co-author and a diabetes researcher at Peking University People's Hospital in Beijing, says ecnoglutide also improved risk factors for heart disease and diabetes, and reduced the amount of fat in people's livers.

Dozens of GLP-1 drugs are being developed and tested in China, with “many more to come”, says Drucker.

Among them is mazdutide, which mimics GLP-1 and glucagon, a hormone involved in blood-sugar levels. In trial results published in May, a weekly injection helped more people to lose up to 15% of their body weight over 36 weeks and reduced the risk of cardiovascular diseases compared with a placebo treatment.

Developed by Eli Lilly in Indianapolis, Indiana, mazdutide is manufactured by Innovent Biologics in Suzhou, China, under an exclusive licence. Other trials are testing whether the drug can treat sleep apnoea or type 2 diabetes.

The growing number of new GLP-1 drugs target multiple pathways at the same time so will result in more-tailored treatments, says Sof Andrikopoulos, a diabetes researcher at the University of Melbourne. The next generation of drugs will target specific conditions associated with diabetes and obesity, such as sleep apnoea, fatty liver disease, chronic kidney disease and heart disease, he adds. “It'll give us options and it will make personalized medicine in obesity and diabetes more accessible.”

Tauopathies encompass a range of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-tau), for which there are currently no successful treatments. Here, we show impaired glycogen metabolism in the brain of a tauopathy Drosophila melanogaster model and people with AD, indicating a link between tauopathies and glycogen metabolism. We demonstrate that the breakdown of neuronal glycogen ameliorates the tauopathy phenotypes in flies and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons from people with FTLD-tau. Glycogen breakdown redirects glucose flux to the pentose phosphate pathway and alleviates oxidative stress. Our findings uncover a critical role for the neuroprotective effects of dietary restriction (DR) by increasing glycogen breakdown. Mechanistically, we show a potential interaction between tau protein and glycogen, suggesting a vicious cycle in which tau binding promotes glycogen accumulation in neurons, which in turn exacerbates tau accumulation which further disrupts cellular homeostasis. Our studies identify impaired glycogen metabolism as a key hallmark for tauopathies and offer a promising therapeutic target in tauopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Determining why only a fraction of encountered or applied strains engraft in a given person's microbiome is crucial for understanding and engineering these communities. Previous work has established that metabolic competition between bacteria can restrict colonization success in vivo, but other mechanisms may also prevent successful engraftment. Here we combine genomic analysis and high-throughput agar competition assays to demonstrate that intraspecies warfare presents a significant barrier to strain coexistence in the human skin microbiome by profiling 14,884 pairwise interactions between Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates cultured from 18 people from 6 families. We find that intraspecies antagonisms are abundant, mechanistically diverse, independent of strain relatedness and consistent with rapid evolution via horizontal gene transfer. Critically, these antagonisms are significantly depleted among strains residing on the same person relative to random assemblages, indicating a significant in vivo role. Wide variation in antimicrobial production and resistance suggests trade-offs between these factors and other fitness determinants. Together, our results emphasize that accounting for intraspecies warfare may be essential to the design of long-lasting probiotic therapeutics.

(a) We constructed a pangenome for S. epidermidis isolates in our collection and annotated genes and biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Antagonism-related BGCs were more frequent in accessory genomes, whereas metabolism-related BGCs were found in the core genome. (b) We identified regions of the genome with copy number variation within a lineage, indicating recently gained or lost regions. We compared the relative enrichment of Clusters of Orthologous Gene (COG) terms and hits from functional annotation databases among genes in the core genome and recent gain/loss regions. (c) As in B, but comparing genes in the core and accessory genomes. COG categories denoted in blue are metabolism associated, whereas antimicrobial production and resistance genes may be found in red categories. Significant enrichment in a two-sided Fisher's Exact test is indicated by an asterisk (one for naive P-value < 0.05, two for Bonferroni corrected P-value < 0.05), and the number of genes annotated in each category is indicated to the right of the figure.

Source data

In a previous study, up to 96 isolates of S. epidermidis were cultured from each of 23 participants at each timepoint sampled during a 1.5-year time period. Six families were selected for inclusion in this study. Relative lineage abundance, as determined from isolates, is plotted for each sample, organized by participant and family. PHLAME was applied to metagenomic samples from the same participant (denoted as MG), which confirmed that lineage abundances estimated by culturing did not have significant culture bias; note that uncalled portions of metagenomic samples (space above bars) can reflect uncertainty in PHLAME due low coverage rather than the true absence of lineages. We used isolate-based lineage abundances because deep metagenomic coverage of S. epidermidis was not available for every sample. Sample labels indicate the family, participant, and sampling timepoint (for example 1AA3 indicates Family 1, participant 1AA, timepoint 3). The number of S. epidermidis colonies isolated from each person is indicated above each bar. Lineages represented in the TSA antagonism screen in this study are indicated in color, while unrepresented lineages are indicated in greyscale. Some additional lineages were included in a follow-up screen M9 + S screen (see Methods); these are indicated by darker grey colors (denoted by *). Colors do not carry over across families, lineages are generally restricted to a family. Across all samples, the average proportion of lineage composition represented by isolates included in the TSA antagonism screen was 96%. Participant 8PB reported antibiotic use between timepoints, which may explain the difference between timepoints.

We measured 21,025 pairwise interactions between 145 isolates that passed inclusion criteria (15 replicate cultures were also included, totalling 25,600 interactions). The heatmap depicts the AUC of the ZOI calculated for pairwise interactions between S. epidermidis and other skin microbiome isolates in TSA. Each row and column indicate an isolate (in contrast to Fig. 2a where rows indicate lineages). Multiple isolates from a lineage are denoted by decimals (for example 20.1, 20.2, 20.3). Isolates are sorted by phylogenetic similarity, with dashed lines to indicate species boundaries. Each isolate of species other than S. epidermidis (labels > 200, see x-axis for details) was treated as a separate lineage. Interactions were shared among all isolates of the same lineage in ~97% of cases, so S. epidermidis isolates were dereplicated into lineages for other analyses unless otherwise noted. Nine isolates were added after the preliminary TSA screen, and thus are lacking some data points, indicated by brown squares. Unless otherwise noted, these isolates with partial data were excluded from statistical analysis.

Rather than depicting genomic relatedness using a tree (Fig. 2a), we calculated pairwise distances by different sequence similarities to understand whether antagonism and relatedness are correlated. (a) We binned interactions between pairs of lineages with similar average amino acid identities, then plotted the frequency of antagonism among pairs in each bin. (b) As in A, but binned according to average nucleotide identity. (c) As in B, but only for lineages of S. epidermidis, not other species. Antagonism frequency does not significantly vary with genomic distance in our collection, as both R2 and P are weak. (d) We plotted the strength of antagonism (AUC of ZOI) for each antagonistic interaction (excluding non-antagonistic interactions) against the average amino acid identity of the pair. (e) As in D, but against the average nucleotide identity. (f) As in E, but only for lineages of S. epidermidis, not other species. There is a significant but small increase in antagonism strength at high nucleotide identities among S. epidermidis. All P-values and R2 values report the fit of a linear model evaluated by a two-sided ANOVA. (g) The frequency of antagonism does not significantly differ between members of the same or different S. epidermidis phylogroup, according to a two-sided permutation test with shuffled group labels. The phylogeny at right depicts S. epidermidis phylogroup boundaries. Taken together, these results indicate that antagonism occurs at all levels of genomic relatedness, even between closely related lineages.

(a) In order to check for shared mechanisms, the binary antagonism matrix was clustered by constructing dendrograms for antagonism and sensitivity (Methods). White boxes indicate antagonism by the producer spot against the receiver lawn. Red arrows indicate the lineages in our collection chosen for our mechanism screen, which include 18 lineages with high antagonism frequencies plus 2 negative controls (which lacked antimicrobial production genes but contained suspected prophage, denoted by yellow arrows). We chose representative receiver bait lineages using the dendrogram of sensitivity to ensure that all interaction patterns were captured. Note that for this analysis, unlike other analyses in this study (Methods), antagonisms from idiosyncratic isolates that exhibit intra-lineage variation were not excluded. Lineages denoted by cyan arrows did not inhibit many S. epidermidis, with the exception of idiosyncratic lineages 20, 37, and 58, which cluster with some S. hominis and S. capitis isolates, denoted by a cyan line. It is possible that the antimicrobials behind these interactions are intended to target non-epidermidis species. (b) We screened cells and filtered supernatants against a representative array of bait lawns chosen based on interaction profiles from above. Filtrates treated with heat or proteinase to degrade proteins and peptides, desalting to remove small molecules, or 1:10 dilution were also tested. Filtrates exhibited varied patterns, including antagonisms likely mediated by small peptide effectors (isolate 30.1) and some cell-associated antagonisms induced by neighbours (isolate 34.2) or both. (c) Some cell-associated antagonisms are iron-mediated, as indicated by the elimination of the interaction in media supplemented with excess FeCl3 (see isolate 51.1). All tested isolates displaying iron-suppressible antagonisms cells contained a biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) for a product similar to pulcherriminic acid, an iron-sequestering pigment molecule which sabotages the iron supply. (d) We annotated putative bacteriocin BGCs and found BGCs for known compounds (including gallidermin-like, epicidin-like, and lactococcin-like BGCs) as well as unknown compounds. However, we did not find a clear correspondence between BGC presence and the phenotype classified in our mechanism screen, potentially due to multiple inducible effectors being encoded in the genome, incomplete expression of BGCs in different media or environments, or targets not represented in our screen (for example Cutibacterium acnes). One isolate, 32.1, had an active prophage that occasionally produced distinct plaques in this assay, and was later isolated using mitomycin-C induction.

(a) We overlaid interactions from TSA onto the S. epidermidis interaction matrix generated in M9 + S media, using color to indicate which media the antagonism appeared in. In total, 91% of interactions are the same in both media conditions, though antagonisms did vary between the two media, such that 23% of antagonisms observed in TSA were also observed in M9 + S, and 61% of antagonisms observed in M9 + S were observed in TSA. (b-e) Despite these differences, we observed a significant depletion of on-person antagonism (ΔAF, see Fig. 3c, Methods) in permutation tests that compare our observed data compared to simulated data with shuffled lineage compositions on each participant. Significance P-values are derived from two-sided permutation tests with shuffled lineage labels (Methods), without multiple hypothesis correction.

(a) Antagonism frequencies (AF) between co-resident lineages in samples appears depleted relative to the frequency across all S. epidermidis lineages (red). When lineages were present in a sample but were absent from our screen, we calculated the range of AF that would be expected based on the average rate of antagonism between any two isolates. Error bars depict the upper bound of the AF range in a given sample. This is likely an overestimate of the range, since on-person antagonism frequencies are lower than population-wide antagonism frequency. (b) We took the mean AF across samples of the same participant (subject), and still found that mean within sample AF appeared to be depleted relative to the expected AF. Reproduced from Fig. 3a. (c-f) Since t-tests are invalid for non-independent samples, we performed permutation testing by simulating scenarios that retained the structure in the interaction matrix and the composition of samples (for example uneven lineage distribution). For each simulation, we shuffled lineage labels in the relative abundance matrix and the p-value represents the fraction of simulations with less on-person antagonism than observed (black arrow indicates observed value of ΔAF). (c) The rows of the composition matrix were shuffled once across all lineages in our collection. This simulation tests for depletion of antagonism while maintaining the same degree of lineage sharing seen between individuals in the same family. Reproduced from Fig. 3c. (d) The rows of the composition matrix were shuffled, AF values were calculated for samples of the first participant, then rows were shuffled again before each new subject. These simulations broke the relatedness between individuals in the same family, while retaining similarity between samples from the same participant, thereby testing depletion of antagonism under the assumption that lineages are acquired from the environment independent of family. (e) To test for depletion of antagonism under the assumption that one can only acquire strains from a family member, shuffling was only performed on submatrices composed only of lineages on a family were shuffled, by row, as in C. (f) As in F, but without maintenance of lineage sharing between family members; submatrices shuffled but by once per participant. Note that less shuffled conditions (e,f) will definitionally have higher p-values because of fewer possible permutations. Under all tested assumptions, antagonism is depleted among strains present on the same person at the same time. Significance P-values are derived from two-sided permutation tests with shuffled lineage labels (Methods), without multiple hypothesis correction.

Relative abundance plots where each lineage is colored by the proportion of other lineages it antagonizes on TSA, with blues representing non-antagonistic lineages and reds representing highly antagonistic lineages. Lineages are labelled by number in white text and are plotted in the same order as in Extended Data Fig. 2. Grey lineages have missing data, and therefore an antagonism proportion cannot be calculated. Note that antagonism proportion is relative to other lineages across the study, not just within a family. Some families contain few antagonistic lineages (for example family 1), whereas most families contain at least one highly antagonistic lineage.

(a) Lineages were grouped into phylogroups according to phylogenetic structure as described previously, see Extended Data Fig. 4g. On many participants, multiple phylogroups coexist on the face at the same time. (b) The agrD sequence was annotated for each lineage on each participant and classified into quorum sensing types. Again, we found that on many participants, multiple agr types coexist on the face at the same time. Co-residence between different phylogroups and between incompatible quorum sensing types suggest that there is not competitive exclusion on the basis of phylogenic dissimilarity or quorum sensing. (c) We measured growth rate in liquid culture in TSB for all isolates in our collection (Methods). We calculated the median growth rate for each isolate in a lineage. Bars denote standard deviation (from technical duplicates of biological triplicates). (d) Lineages that grow faster than other lineages in vitro (green) reach higher abundance on individuals (blue), Spearman's rank correlation. Note that growth in vivo may vary significantly due to differences between nutrient composition of skin and TSB. (e) Lineages that antagonize a higher fraction of other lineages (red) do not grow faster or slower than other lineages (green), Spearman's rank correlation. (f) The growth rate for each isolate of idiosyncratic lineages 20, 37, and 58 (technical duplicates of biological quadruplicates) is shown. Growth rate varies between vraFG mutants (indicated with *) and wild-type isolates of each lineage, but without a directional trend. Reversion mutants of 37 have faster growth rates than 37.3, leaving the basis of the vraFG mutations unresolved.

Four “Idiosyncratic” isolates (20.3, 37.3, 49.5, and 70.3) exhibited large differences in antimicrobial sensitivity compared to other members of their respective lineages. Two idiosyncratic isolates shared a sensitivity pattern with lineage 58 (Fig. 4a, Extended Data Fig. 5), prompting a search for parallel mutations. We plotted the sensitivity phenotype against whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism trees constructed for each lineage. Each isolate on the tree was annotated with any vraFG and dlt operon mutations and/or genomic region gains or losses (colored by copy number relative to core genome). The sensitive phenotype (red/orange) correlated with vraF and vraG mutations in (a) lineage 20, (b) lineage 37, and (c) lineage 58. Presence or absence of genomic regions have no apparent trend in regards to the idiosyncratic sensitivity phenotype. While the vraFG mutants form a small fraction of their respective lineages, these isolates were found at multiple timepoints over six months apart, indicating that they are not a transient part of the population. (d) Since each represented a minority of their lineages, idiosyncratic isolates were excluded from other analyses presented in this study. However, on-person antagonisms remain depleted even if these isolates are retained (using simulations as in Fig. 3c in TSB). Significance P-value is derived from a two-sided permutation test with shuffled lineage labels (Methods), without multiple hypothesis correction. (e) Despite other sensitivities (Fig. 4d), the vraF-frameshift isolate (37.3) was less susceptible to phage infection than isolates with full-length vraF. However, we did not find this phage on participants carrying lineage 37 (Methods). Data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation, n = 6, P values were calculated by unpaired t-test (two-sided). (f) Nevertheless, together with prior results from literature, these results are consistent with a conceptual model in which the vraFG complex could reduce cell envelope modifications, weakening resistance to cationic antimicrobials but providing protection against some phage. (g) Heatmap depicting the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration for antibiotics, lysis enzymes, and antimicrobial fatty acids, based on a screen with one replicate per condition. Polymyxin B ( + 5) and kanamycin ( + 4) are more positively charged than clindamycin ( + 1), ciprofloxacin (0), or cephalothin (-1). Idiosyncratic isolates 20.3 and 37.3 are more sensitive to cationic antimicrobials and lysostaphin than other isolates in their lineages. Both vraFG and dlt operon genotypes in lineage 58 share a similar MIC pattern to these idiosyncratic isolates, especially in response to Polymyxin B.

People from Indigenous communities do not show the same link between chronic inflammation and age-related illness seen in industrialized societies, a study that looked at nearly 3,000 adults in four countries has found. 

Inflammation is an important part of the immune system's response to infection — but long-term inflammation can cause damage. The latest findings, published in Nature Aging on 30 June1, show that chronic inflammation — which has been long considered a hallmark of ageing — could be a feature of industrialized living.

How quickly are you ageing? What molecular ‘clocks' can tell you about your health

Researchers analysed eight inflammation-linked proteins in blood samples from people living in Italy and Singapore, along with those from Indigenous participants from Bolivia and Malaysia. They found that inflammation levels increased with age and were linked with illnesses such as chronic kidney disease in the Italian and Singaporean groups. But in the two Indigenous groups, inflammation did not increase with age or lead to health conditions.

This suggests that “our assumption that inflammation is an inexorable, inevitable part of ageing is not true”, says Thomas McDade, a biological anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. “We shouldn't assume that the links between inflammation and ageing are universal.”

“We're at a point where we're rethinking the whole nature of inflammation,” says study co-author Alan Cohen, who researches ageing at Columbia University in New York City. “The things that we think of as universal based on a lot of studies in Western industrialized populations are probably just particular to our environment.”

Much of what researchers know about the biological processes that underlie ageing is based on research in wealthy countries, which suggests that inflammation increases with age and can contribute to health conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and heart problems. But these conditions are rare in Indigenous populations.

To explore how inflammation might affect ageing in different environments, Cohen and his colleagues analysed blood samples from 1,041 participants in Italy, 941 from Singapore, 536 Tsimane people from the Bolivian Amazon and 358 Orang Asli individuals from Peninsular Malaysia. More than 50% of the people in each group were female.

The researchers measured how eight types of proteins called cytokines — molecules released by immune cells that are involved in inflammation — changed with age in each group, and whether their levels were associated with age-related health problems.

Research is under attack in the United States. The availability of grant funding from institutions such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Science Foundation (NSF) — especially for anything remotely related to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) — is now in question, at least for the next few years. This will result in many researchers having to find alternative income streams, or even leaving science altogether.

One of the programmes that I oversee on my campus was terminated last month. The Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) provided students from under-represented groups with extra funding and mentorship on a weekly basis. Now, fewer opportunities are available for these mostly first-generation students from low-income backgrounds and lower-performing schools. The funding was provided by the NSF, and supported professional development activities for emerging leaders in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. LSAMP is just one such programme; many more are on the chopping block.

How Trump is following Project 2025's radical roadmap to defund science

Some states, including my home state of California, are being specifically targeted for large-scale funding cancellations, so things are escalating quickly. For example, a few weeks ago, the news outlet Politico reported that the federal government was considering cutting education and research funds for California, thanks to a continuing feud over immigration.

In total, billions of dollars' worth of grants are being terminated. One colleague working for the US Agency for International Development has had their position ended. Another worked at the NIH as an adviser on health disparities and has also lost their job. Many of my colleagues at universities in California have had their grants wrapped up early, especially those who focus on health disparities and DEI. As a result, they have had to look elsewhere for financial support.

The grant funding I receive from various sources covers part of my salary, which is guaranteed by the state because of my tenured position. But many states, including Hawaii, Texas and Ohio, are now considering bans and limits on tenure. If this were to happen in California, I would be particularly at risk given that my work focuses on health-disparity topics that are being targeted for cancellation: HIV, global research ethics and supporting emerging faculty members who are conducting research into the challenges faced by ageing adults in minority groups.

It would be naive to think that this won't affect the job market: I expect many researchers to lose their salaries, jobs and health-care insurance as grants and funding dry up. This is already starting to happen. Frankly, it's time for many scientists to start thinking about a career change, or at least how they might diversify their income streams to protect themselves against a loss of funding or a period of unemployment.

Many think that the current challenges will be reversed after a few years, but that is a long time to be without an income. And even if most scientists were able or willing to move abroad, it's unlikely that there would be enough overseas funding to make up for cuts to science here in the United States.

One way to protect against these cuts might be to develop other streams of income while still pursuing a scientific career. Each of us has things we are good at apart outside scientific area of expertise. For example, my family and I have planted fruit trees and grown tomato plants, and we keep chickens that lay eggs, and my network allows me to sell those products. Other colleagues are generating cash from pet sitting and copyediting, working as a paid nanny or a personal chef, picking up paid teaching opportunities in schools and consulting for community-based organizations.

Originating from aquatic unicellular ancestors, over the course of ~1 billion years, the fungi have evolved to occupy nearly all aerobic environments on the planet, diversified into millions of different ‘species' and have developed complex multicellular structures. Their relatively small, simple genomes have facilitated massive-scale sequencing and allowed us to explore genome evolution across an ancient eukaryotic kingdom. With thousands of genomes from diverse lineages now available, this Review will discuss insights into fungal biology and evolution gleaned with genomics and other multi-omics approaches. Using published genomes available through GenBank and the Joint Genome Institute's MycoCosm platform, we generated kingdom-wide phylogenies and used them to highlight how fungal genomes have changed over time. With this phylogeny as a guide, we also discuss major evolutionary transitions that occurred across the fungal kingdom. Although progress has been made, these efforts are hampered by biases in genome representation and limited characterization of gene functions. Here, we discuss these challenges and possible future directions to address them, including initiatives to characterize conserved genes of unknown function and scale up sequencing towards 10,000 annotated fungal genomes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wired.com","Microsoft Says Its New AI System Diagnosed Patients 4 Times More Accurately Than Human Doctors","https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-medical-superintelligence-diagnosis/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 13:00:00 GMT","

Microsoft has taken “a genuine step toward medical superintelligence,” says Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the company's artificial intelligence arm. The tech giant says its powerful new AI tool can diagnose disease four times more accurately and at significantly less cost than a panel of human physicians.

The experiment tested whether the tool could correctly diagnose a patient with an ailment, mimicking work typically done by a human doctor.

The Microsoft team used 304 case studies sourced from the New England Journal of Medicine to devise a test called the Sequential Diagnosis Benchmark. A language model broke down each case into a step-by-step process that a doctor would perform in order to reach a diagnosis.

Microsoft's researchers then built a system called the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO) that queries several leading AI models—including OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, Meta's Llama, and xAI's Grok—in a way that loosely mimics several human experts working together.

In their experiment, MAI-DxO outperformed human doctors, achieving an accuracy of 80 percent compared to the doctors' 20 percent. It also reduced costs by 20 percent by selecting less expensive tests and procedures.

""This orchestration mechanism—multiple agents that work together in this chain-of-debate style—that's what's going to drive us closer to medical superintelligence,” Suleyman says.

The company poached several Google AI researchers to help with the effort—yet another sign of an intensifying war for top AI expertise in the tech industry. Suleyman was previously an executive at Google working on AI.

AI is already widely used in some parts of the US health care industry, including helping radiologists interpret scans. The latest multimodal AI models have the potential to act as more general diagnostic tools, though the use of AI in health care raises its own issues, particularly related to bias from training data that's skewed toward particular demographics.

Microsoft has not yet decided if it will try to commercialize the technology, but the same executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the company could integrate it into Bing to help users diagnose ailments. The company could also develop tools to help medical experts improve or even automate patient care. “What you'll see over the next couple of years is us doing more and more work proving these systems out in the real world,” Suleyman says.

The project is the latest in a growing body of research showing how AI models can diagnose disease. In the last few years, both Microsoft and Google have published papers showing that large language models can accurately diagnose an ailment when given access to medical records.

The new Microsoft research differs from previous work in that it more accurately replicates the way human physicians diagnose disease—by analyzing symptoms, ordering tests, and performing further analysis until a diagnosis is reached. Microsoft describes the way that it combined several frontier AI models as “a path to medical superintelligence” in a blog post about the project today.

The project also suggests that AI could help lower health care costs, a critical issue, particularly in the US. ""Our model performs incredibly well, both getting to the diagnosis and getting to that diagnosis very cost effectively,"" says Dominic King, a vice president at Microsoft who is involved with the project.

“It is quite exciting,” says David Sontag, a scientist at MIT and cofounder of Layer Health, a startup that builds medical AI tools. Sontag says the work is important not only because it more closely mirrors the way physicians operate but also because it is rigorous about addressing potential issues with the underlying methodology. “That's what makes this paper strong,” he says.

But Sontag says that Microsoft's findings should be treated with some caution because doctors in the study were asked not to use any additional tools to help with their diagnosis, which may not be a reflection of how they operate in real life. He adds that it remains to be seen whether the AI system would significantly reduce costs in practice. The doctors involved in the study may have taken into account factors that the AI could not, such as a patient's tolerance for a procedure or the availability of a particular medical instrument.

“This is an impressive report because it tackles highly complex cases for diagnosis,” says Eric Topol, a scientist at the Scripps Research Institute. Showing that AI could, in theory, reduce the cost of medical care is novel, he adds.

Both Topol and Sontag of MIT say that the next step in validating the potential of Microsoft's system ahead of general deployment would be demonstrating the tool's effectiveness in a clinical trial comparing its results with those of real doctors treating real patients. “Then you can get a very rigorous evaluation of cost,” Sontag says.

Chromebooks needed a wake-up call. The huge advances made by Windows laptops over the last year in battery life, efficiency, value, and AI features have made similarly priced Chromebooks look rudimentary.

Well, the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is the answer. It's easily the best Chromebook ever made. From the OLED screen to the premium build, there's never been a Chromebook this high-end, despite the affordable starting price of $650. It's time to start taking Chromebooks seriously again.

There's never been a Chromebook quite like the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14. The closest I can think of is the elegant HP Dragonfly Chromebook, which preceded the “Chromebook Plus” designation and led the way in high-end Chromebooks. The Lenovo takes this a step forward in all sorts of ways.

The silver chassis isn't remarkable, but the all-aluminum build is every bit as sturdy and premium-feeling as a Windows counterpart. There's no flex in every part of the laptop, including the keyboard and the lid. The bottom cover is plastic but has a grippy, ridged pattern, reminiscent of the old Google Pixelbook Go. It's not the thinnest Chromebook in the world (that'd be the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus), but at 0.62 inches thick, it's portable enough to carry around without bother. For reference, it's around the same thickness as a MacBook Pro.

As I mention in almost every review of a cheap laptop and Chromebook, there are two main points laptop manufacturers always compromise on: the touchpad and the display. These are two areas where it's difficult to tell the quality from a spec sheet. Well, I'm happy to report that the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 has a fantastic OLED panel and a responsive touchpad. Dragging my finger across the surface, it feels brilliantly smooth, as do two-finger swipes and gestures. The click isn't overly loud—just right. I wish I could say that about every other $650 laptop I've tested.

The keyboard is a joy to use, too. It's clicky and responsive, with a short but punchy feel. The layout is similar to most Chromebooks, and this one has a fingerprint reader off to the side, so you don't have to keep typing in passwords or pins.

This isn't the first OLED screen on a Chromebook, but it might be the best I've seen so far. The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus has a nice OLED panel on a larger 15.6-inch screen—this Lenovo has the same resolution screen (1920 x 1200), but it looks sharper on the smaller display. It also gets brighter than any Chromebook I've tested, which tends to be a downside of OLED. I measured it at 358 nits of brightness, plenty bright enough to fight off glare or reflections. Unlike cheaper Windows laptops like the Asus Vivobook 14, the Chromebook Plus 14 has accurate and vibrant colors. Laptops around $650 often use panels with poor color coverage, resulting in an overly green screen with distorted colors. Not here. It has a noticeably warmer tint, like many OLED laptops.

While not a 2-in-1 laptop, my review configuration came with a touchscreen, although that's not included in the $650 base model. Unfortunately, the hinge is wound up tight, so despite the lip for your finger, it requires two hands to open. Ports are pretty minimal. The left side has one USB-C and one USB-A, while the right has one USB-C and a headphone jack. That's it. I appreciate that Lenovo split up the USB-C ports so that you can charge the device from either side, but one more USB-C port or HDMI would have been helpful. At least there's a microSD card slot for storage expansion, considering everything on the Chromebook Plus 14 is soldered down.

There's only one CPU option for this laptop. That's because rather than use a typical Chromebook chip with only two performance cores (like the Intel Celeron N4500 or Core 3 100U), it uses a new ARM chip made by MediaTek, the Kompanio Ultra 910. Without getting into all the details, this is a highly efficient ARM chip in the vein of Qualcomm or Apple's latest entries, except made explicitly for Chromebooks.

Amazingly, the base configuration has 12 GB of RAM. That's not quite as much as the 16 GB you get in some Snapdragon X-powered Windows laptops like the forthcoming HP Omnibook 5 16—but for ChromeOS, it's more than enough. Meanwhile, the base configuration comes with 128 GB of storage, and the upgraded model has a 256-GB solid state drive.

Performance is solid. Speedometer is a benchmark that tests performance in the browser, which is important for ChromeOS since it's all built around the Chrome browser. The Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 was around three times faster than the Celeron N4500, as tested in the Asus Chromebook CX15, and around half the speed of the Apple M4 in a MacBook Air. I also tested a couple of heavier Android games like Diablo: Immortal and PUBG Mobile, which played well with settings maxed out. That's not surprising, but it shows that this chip can handle almost anything you throw at it. Like most ARM-powered laptops, the Chromebook Plus 14 is just as fast on battery as it is while plugged in.

Google and Lenovo are also touting the AI capabilities of this device, as the MediaTek chip is capable of 50 trillion operations per second (TOPS), a standard met by nearly all of its Windows and Mac competitors. Because of that, the Chromebook Plus 14 has a few exclusive on-device AI features you won't find in other Chromebooks. One of the most useful is Smart Grouping, which can identify the various apps and tabs you have open and group them intelligently into separate desktops. It's pretty handy. Less interesting to me is Quick Insert, which gives you unnecessarily easy access to AI-generated images. Beyond that, it also has the selection of AI features that come with all Chromebook Plus laptops, such as the helpful Continue Where I Left Off.

The efficiency of the Kompanio Ultra 910 shines bright in battery life tests, too. It has a 60-watt-hour battery, resulting in some impressive runtime. Lenovo and Google claim it's the longest-lasting Chromebook ever, and it's the best I've tested, lasting 16 hours in a video playback test. It might not last as long as the MacBook Air M4 or laptops like the Asus Zenbook S 16, powered by Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 2 chips, but it's in the ballpark. That's important because before the recent surge in ARM-powered laptops (like the modern MacBooks), Chromebooks were known for battery life. That was largely due to how lightweight ChromeOS was to run. It's nice to see Chromebooks are back in the running.

The Chromebook Plus 14 has one other trick up its sleeve. Unlike the janky speakers featured in nearly every Chromebook, this Lenovo has a quad-speaker setup and is the first to use Dolby Atmos. These are surprisingly good speakers—almost as good as the 13-inch MacBook Air's audio, providing a well-rounded sound that even features hints of bass. They're the best speakers on a laptop of this price.

Many of my points have been couched in the context of the price, and there's a reason for that. At $650 for the base configuration or $100 more to up the RAM and storage (and add the touchscreen), the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 is hitting a price that Windows laptops have struggled to address. There are contenders, but the Chromebook Plus 14 makes a case for Chromebooks at this price, offering several features and overall build quality that you won't find in competitors. If you're willing to embrace ChromeOS, this is simply the best the ecosystem has to offer.

We all have that one friend who's tech-savvy that everyone turns to for advice, especially ahead of big sale events like Amazon Prime Day. Well, that's me. I'm that guy.

When people find out what I do for a living, everything gets turned up to 11. I review laptops for my job, and almost everyone needs one. If people don't know where to begin, here's how I guide them through the process of picking the right Apple MacBook—where I recommend you start.

You might think narrowing your choice of laptop down to a MacBook would help, but these days, choosing an Apple laptop isn't as simple as it ought to be. You've got two sizes of MacBook Airs, two sizes of MacBook Pros, and all the chip configurations, ranging from the M4 to the M4 Max. That doesn't even include the plethora of older models that flood the search results of online retailers.

That's why I like to keep it simple. When someone comes to me, asking which MacBook to buy, I start them with the 13-inch MacBook Air M4. It's the laptop most people should buy, which is why it's at the top of our Best Laptops and Best MacBooks guides. The retail price is $999, but it's almost always on sale for at least $899, and at the time of writing, it's down to $849. While it doesn't come with much storage (only 256 GB), it does start with 16 GB of RAM (or unified memory, as Apple calls it).

From there, I make them give me reasons they should get something bigger or more powerful. I don't want my actual friends and family spending a dime more than they should, and I know some will think they need to upgrade to the MacBook Pro, even if it's just the M4 model.

Let's be real. You likely don't need the extra performance of the M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. Unless you edit video, produce music, or shoot photos for a living, it's not worth spending hundreds (or thousands) more to speed up video renders. The M4 MacBook Air is capable of far more than people realize. Upgrading to the M4 Pro and M4 Max is primarily about improving graphics and multicore CPU performance, but it's only something creative professionals will get much out of.

A part of the problem is that we're still operating as if it's 2015. A decade ago, it wasn't just that certain tasks were faster on a 16-inch MacBook Pro; it was that the old MacBook Airs couldn't perform these at all. If you were an amateur musician, artist, or programmer, you were forced into saving up for a MacBook Pro or forgoing those hobbies for the time being. Apple Silicon changed that equation entirely, and generation after generation, its M-series chips get more capable. Now, we're at the point where the M4 is quite capable, even in the fanless body of the MacBook Air.

That's not to say there aren't reasons to upgrade to other MacBooks. For example, if you're a heavy multitasker and never plan to use an external monitor, there's a case to be made for the extra screen real estate of the 15-inch MacBook Air. Also, there's a reason Apple sells a 14-inch MacBook Pro with the M4 for hundreds of dollars more than the Air, despite performance being nearly equivalent.

If you don't own a television and plan to have your MacBook be your primary entertainment device for watching shows, the brighter, more vibrant display and richer speakers of the Pro will offer a better experience. Or maybe you hate the idea of occasionally using a USB hub or dongle to get photos from your camera to your computer. I don't think that's worth $300, but if it's something you'll be doing daily, I can understand that.

I wouldn't worry too much about older MacBook models, such as the M3 or M2 MacBook Air. I haven't seen them be discounted enough to be worth the drop in performance and reduced external display support. The one older MacBook I recommend is the M1 MacBook Air, which came out back in 2020. You can still buy it new for $649, or find refurbished models for under $500. While I still recommend most people save up for the M4, the M1 MacBook Air remains one of the best laptops you can buy at that price, despite being almost 5 years old.

There's not much more to it than that. The M4 MacBook Air is a well-rounded little laptop, and it's the one most people should buy. At $849, it's never been cheaper.

Google on Monday announced a series of updates intended to bring its Gemini AI and other AI-powered tools deeper into the classroom. At the ISTE edtech conference, the tech giant introduced more than 30 AI tools for educators, a version of the Gemini app built for education, expanded access to its collaborative video creation app Google Vids, and other tools for managed Chromebooks.

The updates represent a major AI push in the edtech space, where educators are already struggling to adapt to how AI tools, like AI chatbots and startups that promise to help you “cheat on everything,” are making their way into the learning environment. 

School-aged kids and teens today are more likely to ask ChatGPT for help with their homework (or to even do it for them) than they are to ask a teacher to explain the concepts again. In higher ed, meanwhile, colleges are wrestling with whether or not plagiarism detectors can even identify AI-written content.

Amid this disruption, Google is charging ahead with AI tools, saying it thinks that “responsible AI” can help drive “more engaging and personalized learning experiences,” when used in conjunction with human-led teaching.

Since announcing its plans to bring Gemini to the classroom last year, Google on Monday said that its Gemini AI suite for educators is now available for free to all Google Workspace for Education accounts.

This includes over 30 new features, like the ability for teachers to brainstorm ideas, generate lesson plans, and personalize content for students using AI technology.

Over the next several months, Google will give teachers the ability to create interactive study guides using the AI research tool Notebook LM, along with their classroom materials. 

Teachers can also create custom versions of the Gemini AI called “Gems,” which will work as AI experts that help students who need extra support or want to better understand the subject.

This is essentially just taking an activity that students are already doing — asking an AI chatbot to explain a topic or answer questions — and redirecting that activity back to Google's own AI technology, where it's specifically been trained on the teacher's own classroom materials.

Soon, teachers will also be able to offer students real-time support for the AI-powered reading buddy when using the Read Along in Classroom tool.

Google is expanding basic access to its AI-powered video creator, Google Vids, as well, to make it available to all Google Workspace for Education users. Teachers can use the tool to make instructional videos, while students can use Vids for things like book reports or other assignments.

The company is also rolling out a series of new features designed to track student progress against learning standards and skills, view analytics on student performance and engagement, better secure Gemini user data and data in Gmail, manage who has access to AI tools like Gemini and Notebook LM, have better control over Google Meet waiting rooms, and more. 

Plus, along with a handful of updates for managed Chromebooks, Google introduced new teaching mode called Class Tools. This allows teachers to connect directly with their students via Google Classroom and share content to the kids' screens, like videos, articles, slides, and quizzes. These tools can be adapted to the student's own language, if need be, and are designed to keep kids focused on learning by restricting browsing to specific tabs.

AI-powered accounting startup Campfire announced Monday that it has raised a $35 million Series A led by Accel, with participation from Foundation Capital, Y Combinator, Capital49, and angel investors including Mercury's CFO Dan Kang.

“Within nine months of formation, we had customers [with] north of 100 employees ripping out NetSuite and putting in Campfire,” founder CEO John Glasgow said. Some of Campfire's customers that have migrated from NetSuite include wealth management platform Advisor360, construction software startup Rhumbix, and customer experience company Fooji, Campfire says.

This was, in part, because Glasgow attended YC in the summer of 2023, despite being decidedly more experienced than the typical 20-something YC founder. He described the age difference with a funny story: During a YC bingo event, “One of the bingos was ‘find someone that's a parent,' and I was the hot commodity at YC bingo.” 

Glasgow already had a decade and a half career in finance working for Fidelity, Union Square Advisors, and others. When his manager from Adobe left to run an Accel-backed startup called Invoice2go, he took Glasgow with him. Less than a year later, in the fall of 2021, Bill.com bought Invoice2go for about $625 million. 

Glasgow wound up with both the cash and an idea to build his own startup, one that would automate the drudgery in finance like reconciling payments on bills, revenue forecasts, and — the part he discovered during the Invoice2go deal — due diligence for M&A.

He launched Campfire in 2023 to upend 1990s-era enterprise resource planning accounting software (ERP) like Netsuite with an LLM-powered alternative. 

Campfire does things like automatically itemize and reconcile AWS cloud computing bills. It generates detailed cash flow analysis, charts, and answers to questions from natural-language prompts. 

“One of our customers went from a 15-day to a three-day close when they ripped out NetSuite and put in Campfire,” he says about the time to finalize the books each month. 

YC's famed access to other cohort alums helped him land tech startups as customers like Replit and Replo. 

While Campfire is just a gnat in terms of its impact on Oracle's billion-dollar (and growing) NetSuite business, the startup gained enough customers to prove its competitive plausibility. 

At its seed stage, Campfire grew to around 100 customers and is now up to 12 employees including, Glasgow said, one global customer on track to do a $250 million ARR.

“I was surprised that there were businesses of this size that were trusting their whole ERP to a 10-person, seed-stage project,” Accel's John Locke, who had backed Invoice2Go, told TechCrunch of what had enticed him with Campfire. 

Locke typically invests at the growth stage. But given that kind of “traction out of the gates” and a total ERP software market of $56 billion in 2024, according to some market research reports, Locke was in to lead the A. And he was in big.

“[The] AI ERP business is massive, and we think John is really the right person to do it. So why don't we do a $30 [million] to $35 million series A, and really go for it?” he told Glasgow and his partners. So they did.

Correction: This story originally identified Mercury as a customer when it is not.

Fusion power got another boost on Monday as Google announced it will buy half the output of Commonwealth Fusion System's first commercial power plant.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) will send Google 200 megawatts of electricity from its Arc power plant, which is expected to come online in the early 2030s. Meanwhile, Google is sending CFS a check as part of a new, unannounced funding round.

The new round will be “comparable” to the previous one, CFS co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard said. CFS's most recent funding round, a Series B that Google participated in and that brought in $1.8 billion, closed in 2021. The company has raised the most of any fusion startup.

“That's a very strong demand signal,” said Mumgaard. “This investment allows us to do some of the R&D that will enable us to go into Arc faster.”

CFS is building a demonstration reactor, known as Sparc, just outside of Boston. That facility will be completed in 2026, according to Mumgaard. Arc, the company's commercial power plant, will be built near Richmond, Virginia.

The new deal marks only the second time a major company has agreed to buy power from a fusion startup. The first was signed in 2023 when Microsoft agreed to buy the output of Helion's first commercial power plant, which is scheduled to come online in 2028.

Like other hyperscalers, Google has been scouring the globe for new sources of electricity. AI and cloud services have ignited a surge in data center construction, driving a new wave of electricity demand along with it. One forecast expects that data center power demand will double by the end of the decade.

“To power all this, we know that we're going to need to make big bets in this next frontier of energy innovation,” said Michael Terrell, Google's head of advanced energy.

Google thinks of its energy investments across three time horizons, Terrell said. In the short term, the company has prioritized solar, wind, and batteries. A bit further out, it's betting on geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors, as evidenced by its investments in geothermal startup Fervo Energy and nuclear startup Kairos Power.

Fusion energy is a bit further out, and that “would certainly put this [CFS investment] in the long-term category,” he said.

Google bought 8 gigawatts of renewable power in 2024, twice what it purchased in 2023. And while solar, wind, and batteries have been the main additions to Google's portfolio in recent years, Terrell told TechCrunch that the company will need other power sources to allow its data centers to operate 24/7.

“There's definitely a path with wind and solar and storage in regions where the resource is very strong,” he said, citing places like the Midwest, which has consistent winds, and the Southwest, which has mostly cloud-free skies. But other places, like the Southeastern U.S. and many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, might be too cloudy or their power grids too fragmented to make traditional renewables work.

To compensate for those shortfalls, one approach is to overbuild wind and solar, but that can get expensive quickly.

Technologies like fusion “actually bring the cost down of achieving high penetrations of carbon-free energy,” Terrell said. “If you have these clean, firm technologies — even if they're more expensive on a per megawatt-hour basis — if you're sort of folding those into the portfolio, it actually brings your overall portfolio costs down.”

Mumgaard is confident that CFS can deliver power to Google in less than a decade, and when that happens, he thinks that demand for fusion will skyrocket. 

 “It doesn't depend on geography or weather, doesn't depend on access to special materials. It's something that you could run 24/7,” he said. “We expect that fusion can have a really big payoff because once it's shown that you can do this and you have a first power plant up and running, you could scale it. You could build this around the world.”

The company behind Cursor, the viral AI coding editor, launched a web app on Monday that allows users to manage a network of coding agents directly from their browser.

The launch marks Cursor's next big step beyond its integrated development environment (IDE), the core product developers use to access its tools. While Anysphere, the company behind Cursor, initially offered only this AI-powered IDE, the company has made a concerted effort to put its products in more places, and develop more agent-powered experiences for users.

In May, Cursor launched background agents — AI systems that solve coding tasks autonomously without user supervision. In June, the company launched a Slack integration that allows users to assign tasks to these background agents by tagging @Cursor, similar to how Cognitions's AI coding agent, Devin, operates.

Now, with the web app, Cursor users can send natural language requests via browser — on desktop or mobile— to assign background agents tasks such as writing features or fixing bugs in their codebase. The web app also lets users monitor agents working on other tasks, view their progress, and merge completed changes into the codebase.

Andrew Milich, Cursor's head of product engineering, tells TechCrunch that the Slack integration and web app are part of an effort to “remove the friction” for users who rely on Cursor — and it seems many do.

Anysphere announced last month that Cursor has crossed $500 million in annualized recurring revenue, largely driven by monthly subscriptions. The company also said Cursor is now used by more than half of the Fortune 500, including companies such as NVIDIA, Uber, and Adobe. 

To capitalize on this growth, Anysphere recently launched a $200-per-month Pro tier for Cursor.

“You noted how customers want Cursor in more places. I think they also want Cursor to solve more of the problems they're having,” said Milich.

Cursor's background agents are designed to let users start tasks through Slack or the web app, allowing an agent to take a first pass. If the agent can't complete the task, users can seamlessly transition into the IDE to pick up where the agent left off. Each agent also has a unique shareable link — making it easy to view progress and code changes on agents that other teammates created.

Anysphere says all customers with access to background agents can use the Cursor web app — that includes subscribers to Cursor's $20-per-month Pro plan, as well as more expensive plans, but not users on Cursor's free tier.

Cursor is not the first to ship AI coding agents, but the company says it has been careful to take its time and not ship “demo-ware” — AI products that look good in theory but fail in practice. That has been the story for a lot of early AI coding agents, which made numerous mistakes in testing.

The team behind Cursor now believes AI reasoning models are advancing enough to make coding agents viable. In a recent interview with Stratechery's Ben Thompson, Anysphere CEO Michael Truell said he expects AI coding agents to handle at least 20% of a software engineer's work by 2026.

Worse than the floating-bus in this example is when it depends on uninitialized RAM which is often consistent based on DRAM so the code will always work on your machine/emulator but won't on someone else's machine with different DRAM chips (invariably you catch this at a demoparty when it won't run on the party machine and you only have 15 minutes to fix it before your demo is about to be presented)

reply

For higher memory capacities, e.g. 32 kB, 48 kB or 64 kB, static RAM would have been too expensive and too big, even if 6502 did not have an integrated DRAM controller, like Zilog Z80.

reply

But still DRAM is what you would use for a ""real"" system.  Wozniak's design for the Apple II used a clever hack where the system actually runs at 2 MHz with an effective CPU rate of 1 MHz.  Any read from a DRAM row will refresh the entire row.  Approximately every other cycle the video system steps incrementally through memory, refreshing as it goes.

The Apple II was one of the first 6502 systems to use DRAM (in 1977) and Woz was incredibly clever in getting the refresh for free as a side effect of the video generation

After reading, I realized that he just meant that the bus was ""open"" as in not connected to anything, because the address line decoders had no memory devices enabled at the specified address ($2000).It's pretty funny that the omission of the immediate mode (#) went unnoticed until the obsolete emulator didn't behave in the same way as the real hardware when reading <nothing> from memory.His solution of changing the instruction to use immediate addressing mode (instead of absolute) would have the consequence of faster execution time, because the code is no longer executing a read from memory.  It's probably now faster by about 2us through that blob of code, but maybe this only matters on bare metal and not the emulator, which is probably not time-perfect anyway.

Donkey Kong 64 has a memory leak that will kill the game after a (for that era) unlikely amount of contiguous time playing it (8-9 hours, if I understand correctly). That was not caught in development but is a trivial amount of time to rack up if someone is playing the game and saving progress via emulator save-state instead of the in-game save feature.(Note: there is some ambiguous history here. Some sources claim the game shipping with the Memory Pak was a last-ditch effort to hide the bug by pushing the crash window out to 13-20 hours instead of 8-9. I think recent research on the issue suggests that was coincidence and the game didn't ship with either Rare or Nintendo being aware of the bug).

Lots of reads and writes in the original NES just toggled voltages on a line somewhere, and then what happened, happened. You got the effect you wanted by toggling those voltages in a very controlled manner lock-stepped with the signal indicating the behavior of the CRT blanking intervals. Some animations in Super Mario Bros 3 involved toggling a RAM mux to select from multiple banks of sprite data so that when the graphics hardware went to pull sprites, it'd pull them from an entirely different chip with slight variations in their look. And since the TV timing mattered, they had to release different software for regions with NTSC and PAL TVs since those TVs operate with different refresh rates and refresh rate was the clock that drove the render logic.It was a wild time.

It was a wild time.

Not quite related, but i get a similar feeling if the game seems really tough: ""is this due to emulation latency"". I went down a rabbit hole on this one and built myself a mister FPGA!

And yet, I haven't seen a single example of administrative downsizing in our public universities—not one. Instead, I hear about professors losing grant funding and international students facing stress over visa uncertainty.So when I say universities aren't hearing the message, I'm referring specifically to the glaring lack of reform in their administrative structures. Until I see serious efforts to address this—starting with large-scale administrative layoffs—I'm not inclined to offer my sympathy.

What's actually happening is that most of the wealth and tax revenue is generated by the coastal metropolitan areas of the US, which basically subsidize the rural inland regions of the country. Things like Medicare which those same rural folks vote against. This is because the amount of wealth generated by science and technology vastly outweighs what is being generated by rural areas of the country.Now we cut off the pipeline and investment into those wealth generating areas so that long term, the nation will head into decline...

If you said that corporate America is no place for DEI and everyone should be hired based on merits alone, I would agree.I don't think the reason for the lack of US citizen minorities being underrepresented in tech is because of systemic racism and when I did do my stint at Amazon post 2020, I found the performative “allyship, DEI initiatives moan worthy at best and considering that Amazon is the shittyist employer in BigTech, I found it laughable”.  Yes I knew that going in and it was a remote position.  I went in with my eyes wide open.But on the other hand, if it is a pipeline problem, where should initiatives happen to give opportunities in tech if not in academia and who should do it if not the government?That being said, it would be a lot more palatable to voters if it was based on economic background than race.  I can't say with a straight face that had less opportunities as a minority when I went to private school from k-8th and came from an upper middle class background and had up to date computers where I taught myself  how to program ever since the mid 80s.And the sane party that decries putting people in positions they aren't qualified for nominated RFK to head the DHHS and other unqualified people to be heads of other agencies.Not to mention the shit show of DOGE.

> the whole federal government pissed off a good chunk of the country with DEI initiatives, codified by affirmative action, extra grant requirements, and ideological purity statementsCertainly there were affirmative action programs within the NSF, yes, but I think it's trivially obvious that they only affected a small minority of applications.

But on an objective level, I find the idea that this is some justified reaction to post-2008 wokism to be fundamentally incorrect.

On one research grant I led for NASA, the grant reviewer asked me to count the number of minority students on the team, from their picture displayed on one of my slides. That's just the kind of information I didn't gather because I was trying to run a research task and had employed the entire lab a professor led.That's fine, but we should also recognize how weird it is.

1. That really has nothing to do with what's going on. I feel comfortable saying that it is a plain fact that the Trump administration is not just pushing back against woke language or affirmative action, they are dismantling the entire scientific infrastructure. It's up to you to infer why (maybe for a good reason!), but denying that it's happening is doing yourself a disservice. That's of course not even mentioning how ""anti-DEI"" seems to be awfully close to old-school segregation in practice...2. I think you're mischaracterizing the basic mechanics of referrenda. Again, without getting too far into political particulars, I think it's objectively true that ""stop the woke"" was only a small part of Trump's campaign, even if we grant that that phrase logically implies what's happening now. He spent most of the final months denying P2025, hitting ""no taxes on tips"" and ""Trump == Safety, Kamala == Crime"" hard, associating Harris with Biden & The Deep State, and, above all, talking about inflation and the price of eggs and ""a new American golden age"". Of course all voters should read up on everything a candidate says, but we know that's far from the case.

This is mostly a software engineering forum, but no... most actually important industries and scientific work, unlike building webapps or video games, work the same way as software.John Doe straight of high school can go and make a photo sharing app with his laptop, but he is not going to be getting the same type of experience with non-trival research in his garage as at a research university.To actually get to the point where people had laptops required years of largely academic research and creating markets which were almost entirely academic. Just like with vaccination, people forget the time when a young person (who wasn't named Bill Gates) could get experience on an actual computer was at a university.

Research universities typically have essentially zero endowment, and what they do have are not applicable to funding the research.

Endowments are ""buffers"" the same way one's equity in the home they live in is a buffer. Liquidating either is a sign of distress and will lead to worse outcomes. So they are less of a buffer, and more of a last resort.

During the same period, it received about $1bn in ""Research: Federal and Non-Federal sponsored revenue"".I'm not sure paying that $1bn from its endowment would be an existential threat.

If the asteroid were to strike, let's say somewhere on one of the continents, the resulting destruction would be similar to the simultaneous detonation of at least a few thousand nuclear bombs minus the particle radiation..... but with so much more impact energy.This would generate a near-instant super-heated, molten crater at least 15km across and immediately followed by a hypersonic blast wave that would utterly annihilate everything within a radius of at least a couple hundred kilometers. The even faster-traveling thermal pulse in between those two would flash-fry any flammable thing out to maybe twice the distance of the blast wave, and even at the outer edge of said thermal pulse, this includes causing lethal, almost total third to fourth-degree burns over any living tissue.It would not be a good day for the people of whatever wider region that surrounds its impact point.Globally, we'd also see atmospheric effects. They'd be nothing like the ones that struck the dinosaurs down into near total extinction, but they'd be noticeable, and would cause social, economic and environmental havoc. It would maybe be comparable to something like the 1815 Tambora eruption, whose climatic effects basically killed summer for much of the world in that year. Only here it would happen in modern times and from a much scarier type of disaster, hammering delicate modern infrastructure and communications.If Apophis struck somewhere fairly densely populated, like, say, the Eastern U.S, almost anywhere in Europe or somewhere in central to Eastern China, in just seconds we'd have close to the biggest human death toll from a natural disaster in all our history, and the second-order effects of it would kill millions to tens of millions more. I can only think of the Black Death or maybe the 1918 flu pandemic as candidates for worse, albeit much slower killing.If Apophis were to hit the ocean, things get a bit harder to estimate and guesstimate.On the one hand, it's ""only"" 450 meters across, and much of the ocean is damn deep, enough so as to swallow the asteroid whole and mitigate much of its more fiery atmospheric effects. On the other hand all that kinetic energy still has to go somewhere, and so in this case, perhaps creates a massive ocean-spanning series of tsunamis that hit thousands of kilometers of coastline with waves big enough to drown tens of millions of people.Then again, maybe the word drown doesn't quite describe it. More accurately these waves would be pulverizing, smashing the victims in their way into surrounding objects with enough force to cause catastrophic tissue and bone trauma. Millions would be smashed to death much much faster than they could drown. In a way, it would be something of a mercy.Fun stuff.

When one party controls all three branches of government, and the executive branch does what they want regardless of laws (which aren't enforced because said party controls the enforcers as well), you get anything but a consensus.

reply

Besides, even if ""one party controls all three branches of government"" is true, they still don't control all the involved committees, do they?

reply

If you have 51% republican and 49% democrat and every republican says yes and every democrat says no, then it's not approved by both sides. That's how democracy works in a two-choice system, it's not a consensus.Unless by approval you mean ""this isn't worth a civil war""

the argument is that older people are more conservative (represented by Republicans who cancel this NASA initiative) and younger are more progressive (represented by Democrats)

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:technologyreview.com","Meet Jim O'Neill, the longevity enthusiast who is now RFK Jr.'s right-hand man","https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/06/30/1119449/hhs-robert-f-kennedy-jr-jim-oneill-longevity-maha/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 09:00:00 GMT","

The newest addition to Trump's health agency wants to create new cities in the sea, extend human lifespan, and Make America Healthy Again.

When Jim O'Neill was nominated to be the second in command at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dylan Livingston was excited. As founder and CEO of the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI), Livingston is a member of a community that seeks to extend human lifespan. O'Neill is “kind of one of us,” he told me shortly before O'Neill was sworn in as deputy secretary on June 9. “And now [he's] in a position of great influence.”

As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new right-hand man, O'Neill is expected to wield authority at health agencies that fund biomedical research and oversee the regulation of new drugs. And while O'Neill doesn't subscribe to Kennedy's most contentious beliefs—and supports existing vaccine schedules—he may still steer the agencies in controversial new directions. 

Montana just passed a new bill backed by longevity enthusiasts that will enable access to drugs and therapies that are not approved by the FDA.

Although much less of a public figure than his new boss, O'Neill is quite well-known in the increasingly well-funded and tight-knit longevity community. His acquaintances include the prominent longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who describes him as “a soft-spoken, thoughtful, methodical guy,” and the billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel. 

In speaking with more than 20 people who work in the longevity field and are familiar with O'Neill, it's clear that they share a genuine optimism about his leadership. And while no one can predict exactly what O'Neill will do, many in the community believe that he could help bring attention and resources to their cause and make it easier for them to experiment with potential anti-aging drugs. 

This idea is bolstered not just by his personal and professional relationships but also by his past statements and history working at aging-focused organizations—all of which suggest he indeed believes scientists should be working on ways to extend human lifespan beyond its current limits and thinks unproven therapies should be easier to access. He has also supported the libertarian idea of creating new geographic zones, possibly at sea, in which residents can live by their own rules (including, notably, permissive regulatory regimes for new drugs and therapies). 

“In [the last three administrations] there weren't really people like that from our field taking these positions of power,” says Livingston, adding that O'Neill's elevation is “definitely something to be excited about.”

Not everyone working in health is as enthusiastic. If O'Neill still holds the views he has espoused over the years, that's “worrisome,” says Diana Zuckerman, a health policy analyst and president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, DC. 

“There's nothing worse than getting a bunch of [early-stage unproven therapies] on the market,” she says. Those products might be dangerous and could make people sick while enriching those who develop or sell them. 

“Getting things on the market quickly means that everybody becomes a guinea pig,” Zuckerman says. “That's not the way those of us who care about health care think.” 

The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen puts it far more bluntly, describing O'Neill as “one of Trump's worst picks” and saying that he is “unfit to be the #2 US health-care leader.” His libertarian views are “antithetical to basic public health,” the organization's co-president said in a statement. Neither O'Neill nor HHS responded to requests for comment. 

As deputy secretary of HHS, O'Neill will oversee a number of agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, the world's biggest funder of biomedical research; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the country's public health agency; and the Food and Drug Administration, which was created to ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective. 

“It can be a quite powerful position,” says Patricia Zettler, a legal scholar at Ohio State University who specializes in drug regulation and the FDA.

Trump says he wants to make IVF more accessible, but his administration's other actions are putting reproductive freedom at risk.

It is the most senior role O'Neill has held at HHS, though it's not the first. He occupied various positions in the department over five years during the early 2000s, according to his LinkedIn profile. But it is what he did after that has helped him cultivate a reputation as an ally for longevity enthusiasts. 

O'Neill appears to have had a close relationship with Thiel since at least the late 2000s. Thiel has heavily invested in longevity research and has said he does not believe that death is inevitable. In 2011 O'Neill referred to Thiel as his “friend and patron.” (A representative for Thiel did not respond to a request for comment.) 

O'Neill also served as CEO of the Thiel Foundation between 2009 and 2012 and cofounded the Thiel Fellowship, which offers $200,000 to promising young people if they drop out of college and do other work. And he spent seven years as managing director of Mithril Capital Management, a “family of long-term venture capital funds” founded by Thiel, according to O'Neill's LinkedIn profile. 

O'Neill got further stitched into the longevity field when he spent more than a decade representing Thiel's interests as a board member of the SENS Research Foundation (SRF), an organization dedicated to finding treatments for aging, to which Thiel was a significant donor. 

O'Neill even spent a couple of years as CEO of SRF, from 2019 to 2021, when its founder Aubrey de Grey, a prominent figure in the longevity field, was removed following accusations of sexual harassment. As CEO, O'Neill oversaw a student education program and multiple scientific research projects that focused on various aspects of aging, according to the organization's annual reports. And in a 2020 SRF annual report, O'Neill wrote that Eric Hargan, then the deputy secretary of HHS, had attended an SRF conference to discuss “regulatory reform.” 

“More and more influential people consider aging an absurdity,” he wrote in the report. “Now we need to make it one.” 

While de Grey calls him “the devil incarnate”—probably because he believes O'Neill “incited” two women to make sexual harassment allegations against him—the many other scientists, biotech CEOs, and other figures in the longevity field contacted by MIT Technology Review had more positive opinions of O'Neill, with many claiming they were longtime friends or acquaintances of the new deputy secretary (though, at the same time, many were reluctant to share specific views about his past work). 

Longevity science is a field that's long courted controversy, owing largely to far-fetched promises of immortality and the ongoing marketing of creams, pills, intravenous infusions, and other so-called anti-aging treatments that are not supported by evidence. But the community includes people along a spectrum of beliefs (with the goals of adding a few years of healthy lifespan to the population at one end and immortality at the other), and serious doctors and scientists are working to bring legitimacy to the field. 

Pretty much everyone in the field that I spoke with appears to be hopeful about what O'Neill will do now that he's been confirmed. Namely, they hope he will use his new position to direct attention and funds to legitimate longevity research and the development of new drugs that might slow or reverse human aging. 

Longevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Now there's a push to establish their work as a credible medical field.

Johnson, whose extreme and expensive approaches to extending his own lifespan have made him something of a celebrity, calls O'Neill a friend and says they've “known each other for a little over 15 years.” He says he can imagine O'Neill setting a goal to extend the lifespans of Americans.

Eric Verdin, president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, says O'Neill has “been at the Buck several times” and calls him “a good guy”—someone who is “serious” and who understands the science of aging. He says, “He's certainly someone who is going to help us to really bring the longevity field to the front of the priorities of this administration.”

Celine Halioua, CEO of the biotech company Loyal, which is developing drugs to extend the lifespan of dogs, echoes these sentiments, saying she has “always liked and respected” O'Neill. “It'll definitely be nice to have somebody who's bought into the thesis [of longevity science] at the FDA,” she says. 

And Joe Betts-LaCroix, CEO of the longevity biotech company Retro Biosciences, says he's known O'Neill for something like 10 years and describes him as “smart and clear thinking.” “We've mutually been part of poetry readings,” he says. “He's been definitely interested in wanting us as a society to make progress on age-related disease.”

After his confirmation, the A4LI LinkedIn account posted a photo of Livingston, its CEO, with O'Neill, writing that “we look forward to working with him to elevate aging research as a national priority and to modernize regulatory pathways that support the development of longevity medicines.”

“His work at SENS Research Foundation [suggests] to me and to others that [longevity] is going to be something that he prioritizes,” Livingston says. “I think he's a supporter of this field, and that's really all that matters right now to us.”

While plenty of treatments have been shown to slow aging in lab animals, none of them have been found to successfully slow or reverse human aging. And many longevity enthusiasts believe drug regulations are to blame. 

O'Neill is one of them. He has long supported deregulation of new drugs and medical devices. During his first tour at HHS, for instance, he pushed back against regulations on the use of algorithms in medical devices. “FDA had to argue that an algorithm … is a medical device,” he said in a 2014 presentation at a meeting on “rejuvenation biotechnology.” “I managed to put a stop to that, at least while I was there.”

During the same presentation, O'Neill advocated lowering the bar for drug approvals in the US. “We should reform [the] FDA so that it is approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety and let people start using them at their own risk,” he said. “Let's prove efficacy after they've been legalized.”

Right to Try laws are being adopted and expanded throughout the country. In one state, they'll allow healthy people to access unproven treatments.

This sentiment appears to be shared by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a recent podcast interview with Gary Brecka, who describes himself as a “longevity expert,” Kennedy said that he wanted to expand access to experimental therapies. “If you want to take an experimental drug … you ought to be able to do that,” he said in the episode, which was published online in May.

But the idea is divisive. O'Neill was essentially suggesting that drugs be made available after the very first stage of clinical testing, which is designed to test whether a new treatment is safe. These tests are typically small and don't reveal whether the drug actually works.

That's an idea that concerns ethicists. “It's just absurd to think that the regulatory agency that's responsible for making sure that products are safe and effective before they're made available to patients couldn't protect patients from charlatans,” says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who is currently on sabbatical. “It's just like a complete dereliction of duty.”

Robert Steinbrook, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, largely agrees that this kind of change to the drug approval process is a bad idea, though notes that he and his colleagues are generally more concerned about O'Neill's views on the regulation of technologies like AI in health care, given his previous efforts on algorithms. 

“He has deregulatory views and would not be an advocate for an appropriate amount of regulation when regulation was needed,” Steinbrook says.

Ultimately, though, even if O'Neill does try to change things, Zettler points out that there is currently no lawful way for the FDA to approve drugs that aren't shown to be effective. That requirement won't change unless Congress acts on the matter, she says: “It remains to be seen how big of a role HHS leadership will have in FDA policy on that front.” 

A major goal for a subset of longevity enthusiasts relates to another controversial idea: creating new geographic zones in which people can live by their own rules. The goal has taken various forms, including “network states” (which could start out as online social networks and evolve into territories that make use of cryptocurrency), “special economic zones,” and more recently “freedom cities.” 

While specific details vary, the fundamental concept is creating a new society, beyond the limits of nations and governments, as a place to experiment with new approaches to rules and regulations. 

In 2023, for instance, a group of longevity enthusiasts met at a temporary “pop-up city” in Montenegro to discuss plans to establish a “longevity state”—a geographic zone with a focus on extending human lifespan. Such a zone might encourage healthy behaviors and longevity research, as well as a fast-tracked system to approve promising-looking longevity drugs. They considered Rhode Island as the site but later changed their minds.

Zuzalu, a pop-up city in Montenegro has provided a temporary home for people who plan to set up a new jurisdiction to encourage biohacking and fast-track drugs that slow or reverse aging.

Some of those same longevity enthusiasts have set up shop in Próspera, Honduras—a “special economic zone” on the island of Roatán with a libertarian approach to governance, where residents are able to make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Another pop-up city, Vitalia, was set up there for two months in 2024, complete with its own biohacking lab; it also happened to be in close proximity to an established clinic selling an unproven longevity “gene therapy” for around $20,000. The people behind Vitalia referred to it as “a Los Alamos for longevity.” Another new project, Infinita City, is now underway in the former Vitalia location.

O'Neill has voiced support for this broad concept, too. He's posted on X about his support for limiting the role of government, writing “Get government out of the way” and, in reference to bills to shrink what some politicians see as government overreach, “No reason to wait.” And more to the point, he wrote on X last November, “Build freedom cities,” reposting another message that said: “I love the idea and think we should put the first one on the former Alameda Naval Air Station on the San Francisco Bay.” 

And up until March of last year, according to his financial disclosures, he served on the board of directors of the Seasteading Institute, an organization with the goal of creating “startup countries” at sea. “We are also negotiating with countries to establish a SeaZone (a specially designed economic zone where seasteading companies could build their platforms),” the organization explains on its website.

“The healthiest societies in 2030 will most likely be on the sea,” O'Neill told an audience at a Seasteading Institute conference in 2009. In that presentation, he talked up the benefits of a free market for health care, saying that seasteads could offer improved health care and serve as medical tourism hubs: “The last best hope for freedom is on the sea.”

Some in the longevity community see the ultimate goal as establishing a network state within the US. “That's essentially what we're doing in Montana,” says A4LI's Livingston, referring to his successful lobbying efforts to create a hub for experimental medicine there. Over the last couple of years, the state has expanded Right to Try laws, which were originally designed to allow terminally ill individuals to access unproven treatments. Under new state laws, anyone can access such treatments, providing they have been through an initial phase I trial as a preliminary safety test.

“We're doing a freedom city in Montana without calling it a freedom city,” says Livingston.

Patri Friedman, the libertarian founder of the Seasteading Institute, who calls O'Neill “a close friend,” explains that part of the idea of freedom cities is to create “specific industry clusters” on federal land in the US and win “regulatory carve-outs” that benefit those industries. 

A freedom city for longevity biotech is “being discussed,” says Friedman, although he adds that those discussions are still in the very early stages. He says he'd possibly work with O'Neill on “changing regulations that are under HHS” but isn't yet certain what that might involve: “We're still trying to research and define the whole program and gather support for it.”

Some libertarians, including longevity enthusiasts, believe this is their moment to build a new experimental home. 

Not only do they expect backing from O'Neill, but they believe President Trump has advocated for new economic zones, perhaps dedicated to the support of specific industries, that can set their own rules for governance. 

While campaigning for the presidency in 2023, Trump floated what seemed like a similar idea: “We should hold a contest to charter up to 10 new cities and award them to the best proposals for development,” he said in a recorded campaign speech. (The purpose of these new cities was somewhat vague. “These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite the American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people—all hardworking families—a new shot at homeownership and in fact the American dream,” he said.)

But given how frequently Trump changes his mind, it's hard to tell what the president, and others in the administration, will now support on this front. 

His return to the White House puts the world's second-largest climate polluter on an emissions trajectory we can't afford.

And even if HHS does try to create new geographic zones in some form, legal and regulatory experts say this approach won't necessarily speed up drug development the way some longevity enthusiasts hope. 

“The notion around so-called freedom cities, with respect to biomedical innovation, just reflects deep misunderstandings of what drug development entails,” says Ohio State's Zettler. “It's not regulatory requirements that [slow down] drug development—it's the scientific difficulty of assessing safety and effectiveness and of finding true therapies.”

Making matters even murkier, a lot of the research geared toward finding those therapies has been subject to drastic cuts.The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world and has supported major scientific discoveries, including those that benefit longevity research. But in late March, HHS announced a “dramatic restructuring” that would involve laying off 10,000 full-time employees. Since Trump took office, over a thousand NIH research grants have been ended and the administration has announced plans to slash funding for “indirect” research costs—a move that would cost individual research institutions millions of dollars. Research universities (notably Harvard) have been the target of policies to limit or revoke visas for international students, demands to change curricula, and threats to their funding and tax-exempt status.

The NIH also directly supports aging research. Notably, the Interventions Testing Program is a program run by the National Institutes of Aging (a branch of the NIH) to find drugs that make mice live longer. The idea is to understand the biology of aging and find candidates for human longevity drugs.

The ITP has tested around five to seven drugs a year for over 20 years, says Richard Miller, a professor of pathology at the University of Michigan, one of three institutes involved in the program. “We've published eight winners so far,” he adds.

The future of the ITP is uncertain, given recent actions of the Trump administration, he says. The cap on indirect costs alone would cost the University of Michigan around $181 million, the university's interim vice president for research and innovation said in February. The proposals are subject to ongoing legal battles. But in the meantime, morale is low, says Miller. “In the worst-case scenario, all aging research [would be stopped],” he says.

The A4LI has also had to tailor its lobbying strategy given the current administration's position on government-funded research. Alongside its efforts to change Montana state law to allow clinics to sell unproven treatments, the organization had been planning to push for an all-new NIH institute dedicated to aging and longevity research—an idea that O'Neill voiced support for last year. But current funding cuts under the new administration suggest that it's “not the ideal political climate for this,” says Livingston.

Despite their enthusiasm for O'Neill's confirmation, this has all left many members of the longevity community, particularly those with research backgrounds, concerned about what the cuts mean for the future of longevity science.

“Someone like [O'Neill], who's an advocate for aging and longevity, would be fantastic to have at HHS,” says Matthew O'Connor, who spent over a decade at SRF and says he knows O'Neill “pretty well.” But he adds that “we shouldn't be cutting the NIH.” Instead, he argues, the agency's funding should be multiplied by 10.

“The solution to curing diseases isn't to get rid of the organizations that are there to help us cure diseases,” adds O'Connor, who is currently co-CEO at Cyclarity Therapeutics, a company developing drugs for atherosclerosis and other age-related diseases. 

But it's still just too soon to confidently predict how, if at all, O'Neill will shape the government health agencies he will oversee. 

“We don't know exactly what he's going to be doing as the deputy secretary of HHS,” says Public Citizen's Steinbrook. “Like everybody who's sworn into a government job, whether we disagree or agree with their views or actions … we still wish them well. And we hope that they do a good job.” 

GLP-1 agonists like Wegovy, Ozempic, and Mounjaro might benefit heart and brain health—but research suggests they might also cause pregnancy complications and harm some users.

Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing.

The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. 

The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on.

Even after decades of peering into cells, biologists are still finding surprises.

In a twist, researchers at the University of Virginia and the National Institutes of Health uncovered a new organelle, dubbed the hemifusome. This tiny membrane-bound structure serves as a cellular recycling center and may hold the key to treating several genetic diseases. The research has been published in Nature Communications.

“This is like discovering a new recycling center inside the cell,” co-author Seham Ebrahim, a biophysicist at the University of Virginia, said in a statement. “We think the hemifusome helps manage how cells package and process material, and when this process goes awry, it may contribute to diseases that affect many systems in the body.”

Scientists had not previously identified the structure because it only appears when needed. But thanks to cryo-electron tomography—an imaging technique that flash-freezes cells and captures them in 3D and in near-atomic resolution—researchers were able to observe the ephemeral structure.

The researchers say hemifusomes may aid in the formation of cellular vesicles, tiny sacs that shuttle and combine material throughout the cell. They might also help form other organelles composed of multiple vesicles, the study suggests. However, some evidence shows that hemifusomes do not participate in endocytosis, the traditional pathway by which cells engulf external material.

“You can think of vesicles like little delivery trucks inside the cell,” Ebrahim said in a statement. “The hemifusome is like a loading dock where they connect and transfer cargo. It's a step in the process we didn't know existed.”

Despite their fleeting nature, hemifusomes are not rare. They appear to be surprisingly common in certain parts of cells, particularly near the cell membrane.

Still, scientists aren't exactly sure how or why hemifusomes form and then disappear. They're hoping to find that out—as well as understand what happens when hemifusomes fail to function properly. Problems with how cells handle cargo are at the root of many genetic disorders.

“This is just the beginning,” Ebrahim said in a statement. “Now that we know hemifusomes exist, we can start asking how they behave in healthy cells and what happens when things go wrong. That could lead us to new strategies for treating complex genetic diseases.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","Is Crypto in a Bubble (Again)?","https://gizmodo.com/is-crypto-in-a-bubble-again-2000621921","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 03:32:48 GMT","

The crypto world is buzzing. If you ask a true believer, they'll say this is just the beginning. Ask a skeptic, and they'll swear we're watching a bubble inflate in real time. One that could pop any second.

I saw the excitement firsthand at a crypto event in Brooklyn last week. The bar was packed. People were animated. It felt like a flashback to 2020 and 2021, when crypto fever gripped everyone from twenty-something retail traders to grandparents. Back then, it was all about Bitcoin, flashy NFTs like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, and anything promising wild returns. It was a digital casino where everyone hoped to strike it rich. Fast.

But then came the crash. The “crypto winter” arrived, marked by the spectacular downfall of crypto exchange FTX and its poster boy Sam Bankman-Fried. Billions vanished. Trust collapsed. Regulators circled.

Now? The energy is back. And it's confusing.

At the Brooklyn event, hosted by Wire Network (a startup trying to connect different crypto systems, or “blockchains”), the optimism was palpable. “There's never been a better time to be a crypto developer,” co-founder Ken DiCross told me.

On paper, crypto's comeback looks unstoppable. The industry's total market value has ballooned by over $3 trillion since the start of 2023. Companies like Robinhood, Coinbase, and MicroStrategy are riding the wave. Circle Internet Group, the firm behind one of the biggest “stablecoins,” went public in June at a $6 billion valuation. It shot up to nearly $50 billion in just weeks.

Wait, what's a stablecoin?

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to hold a steady value, usually pegged to something like the U.S. dollar. The idea is to give people the speed and flexibility of crypto without the wild price swings of Bitcoin or Ethereum. In theory, you could use stablecoins instead of cash to buy your coffee or pay your rent. In reality, we're not there yet.

But the bet from crypto firms is clear: one day, we'll all use digital dollars instead of paper ones. That's what's driving today's gold rush. The question is: Are people getting ahead of themselves?

Much of the current hype centers on DeFi, short for decentralized finance. Think of it as an attempt to rebuild Wall Street without the banks. Instead of a bank approving your loan or handling your trades, code does it. No middlemen, no gatekeepers. Sounds revolutionary, but so far, it's mostly been a playground for speculators and tech geeks.

Then there are the Bitcoin treasury companies. These are regular businesses that are loading up their balance sheets with Bitcoin instead of dollars, euros, or gold. MicroStrategy is the poster child, spending billions to buy Bitcoin and turning itself from a sleepy software company into a kind of crypto hedge fund. The idea is that Bitcoin will outpace inflation and fiat currencies over the long run.

There's no clear answer. The numbers are dizzying. The hype is real. And yet, there's still so much uncertainty about whether crypto's grand promises will ever match reality. Even with a crypto-friendly president in the White House, the road to replacing cash or Wall Street is long.

So, is this a bubble? Maybe. Maybe not. It depends on who you ask.

Prime Day deal hunters normally set their sights on finding the best deals on items they've been thinking about buying for months, sometimes years. But when those deals are attached to brand-new products from an established trailblazing brand like Roborock, that's a game-changer.

Mark your calendar for July 7 and the much-anticipated Prime Day premieres of Roborock's Qrevo and Q Series robot cleaners, the newest vacuum/mop combo devices from the brand that brought you the Saros Z70, the world's first mass-produced robot vacuum with a foldable mechanical arm. And while the remarkable Zaros series sell for upwards of $1,500, the Qrevo and Q Series bots will be offered for a mere fraction of that price.

These four new robot cleaners — the Q7 M5+, Q10 S5+, Qrevo S5V, and QV35A — come with Roborock's combination of cleaning power, innovative convenience features, and great pricing. And as part of their Prime Day rollout, those great prices will be greater yet.

See Q10 S5+ at Amazon

The two new Q Series robot cleaners both boast the enormous 10,000Pa HyperForce suction power needed to lift hair and debris both large and small from carpets and tight areas most competing robot cleaners miss, and both feature Roborock's Dual Anti-Tangle System — a rubber and bristle anti-tangle main brush with JawScrapers comb teeth and an anti-tangle side brush. That's essential, as anyone who's ever watched pet hair choke a robot vacuum into submission knows.

All of that hair and dirt ends up in a self-emptying charging dock for both Q Series models, which can go up to 7 weeks before needing its dust bag changed.

The Q7 M5+ might be the entry-level model in this new Roborock lineup, but it can hang with the upper-tier models from many other manufacturers. PreciSense LiDAR navigation lets the Q7 M5+ scan your home's floor-plan to create and remember a detailed layout and most efficient route to follow, and it will even suggest No-Go Zones in areas where it anticipates it could get stuck. You can customize those zones, the Q7 M5+'s schedule, and many other settings with the Roborock app.

Vacuuming might end up being only half of the Q7 M5+'s job, because it's also a superior robotic mop for hard surfaces. It can mop and vacuum simultaneously, with three adjustable water flow levels you can change anytime. The combination of 10,000Pa HyperForce suction and the option of using the DEEP+ mopping mode removes the tiniest dust along with the most stubborn dirt, and when it's time for the Q7 M5+ to return to carpeted areas, it increases its suction power accordingly.

Bottom Line: The intuitive and easy to control Q7 M5+ is perfect for first-time robot vacuum buyers, and it'll be one of the hottest Prime Day deals among robot cleaners. The Q7 M5+ will be available for $279.99, down from $429.99. This robot makes smart cleaning affordable for everyone.

See Q7 M5+ at Amazon

If you're wanting or needing slightly more cleaning oomph than the Q7 M5+, check out its big brother, the Q10 S5+, which brings all of the great features of the Q7 M5+ to the table along with enhancements and upgrades that will show you its incredible cleaning power far outstrips its great price.

With the Q10 S5+ comes the same HyperForce vacuuming power, but an upgraded mopping experience thanks to Roborock's VibraRise 2.0 mopping system. The mop of the Q10 S5+ vibrates at up to 3000 times per minute, jostling loose and removing the toughest dirt while sparing you the intense elbow grease you would need to use with a manual mop. That vibrating mop module lifts up into the Q10 S5+ unit by 8mm when it's time for the robot to hit the carpeted areas so they don't get soaked.

No matter where you send the Q10 S5+, it's ready to run the inevitable obstacle course it will encounter in your home — especially if you have little kids, big kids, teenagers, or anyone else who's not great at picking up after themselves. The Q10 S5+ uses Reactive Tech Obstacle Avoidance — a structured-light system that spots objects in its path and navigates around them, even in cluttered areas and rooms.

Bottom Line:The 5200mAh battery in the Q10 S5+ is nearly double the size of the Q7 M5+'s, offering much more runtime. It also features Roborock's upgraded VibraRise 2.0 mopping system for a better cleaning experience, along with Reactive Tech Obstacle Avoidance to navigate around obstacles more efficiently. While this does mean a slightly higher price, the added comfort and convenience are well worth it. During Prime Day, you'll be able to get it for $349.99 down from $549.99.

See Q10 S5+ at Amazon

The Roborock QV 35A and Qrevo S5V are ready to take their place as the multifunctional cleaning champions of the robot cleaning world, with masterful and thorough vacuuming and mopping abilities along with added touches and innovations both big and small. Combined with incredible value pricing that will be even better during Roborock's Prime Day rollout event, the Qrevo series represents the latest evolution of robot cleaners.

For an all-in-one robot cleaner that just grazes the $400 price line, check out the QV 35A, the Robin to the Qrevo S5V's Batman. Before you knock the Boy Wonder, the QV 35A brings the same 200rpm rotating mop heads with 30 levels of water flow that you can easily adjust with the Roborock app, the 10mm mop lift that keeps your carpets dry after your hard floors get cleaned, and the Reactive Tech Obstacle Avoidance feature that keeps you from having to free the unit from the shoelace of the sneaker someone left on the floor.

The QV 35A also calls a robust multifunctional and fully automated dock its home for charging, mop self-washing and air drying, auto dust emptying, and auto mop tank refills. The mop's wash cycle runs in 3 cycles — a pre-wash, medium rinse, and high-speed spin dry that thoroughly cleans the mop heads so they're in pristine condition for the next cleaning run. The large-capacity dustbin can go up to 7 weeks before needing to be emptied, and the QV 35A's dock removes up to 99.9% of pollen particles as it empties the dust, preventing them from escaping into your home and aggravating allergy sufferers. Both the QV 35A and Qrevo S5V have detachable dock bases that are easily cleanable to remove dirt and mud buildup.

Bottom Line: The Roborock QV 35A delivers an all-in-one robot vacuum experience for under $400, featuring a multifunctional dock, powerful 8,000Pa HyperForce suction, and an anti-tangle side brush for hassle-free cleaning—which makes it hard to find a better deal at this price point. During Prime Day, it will be available for $399.99 down from $649.99.

See QV 35A at Amazon

We saved the best for last: The Qrevo S5V is a 12,000Pa powerhouse vacuum paired with dual spinning mops that can extend to reach floor edges and other obstacles the unit intelligently detects and works around for incredibly thorough cleaning. When it's not giving your floors the best cleaning ever, the Qrevo S5V's home is a multifunctional dock where it can self-clean its mop heads, dry them with warm air, automatically refill its water tank, and automatically empty the dirt and dust from the vacuum, all while charging the Qrevo S5V 30% faster than competing models.

The Qrevo S5V brings a similar Dual Anti-Tangle System to what the Q Series uses to eradicate pet hair without bringing the vacuum to a halt, and also the same Reactive Tech Obstacle Avoidance of the Q10 S5+. The Qrevo S5V's anti-tangle power comes from its DuoDivide main brush, which is actually two parallel brushes that work in tandem to steer hair toward the vacuum inlet rather than let it wind around the brush. The arc-shaped symmetric design of the Anti-Tangle side brush directs hair toward the ends of the bristles for easy removal instead of toward the center where they would get knotted. And the 12,000Pa HyperForce suction is the most powerful of the four new Roborock units.

The mopping power of the Qrevo S5V is where this new robot really stands out from the competition. Two spinning mop units move at 200rpm, with 30 levels of water flow that dirty floors just can't compete with. The FlexiArm feature lets those spinning mop heads extend out by 1.85mm for cleaning coverage of 98.8% along your floor's edges. And when it's time to hit the carpeted floors again, the mop units raise up by 10mm to keep the wetness away from the carpeting.

Bottom Line: The Roborock Qrevo S5V is the most affordable and advanced model in the Qrevo series, offering powerful 12,000Pa suction, effortless hair removal with its Dual Anti-Tangle System, and thorough cleaning along edges thanks to FlexiArm Edge Mopping—all designed to make smart cleaning simple and accessible. You can grab it for $549.99 down from $899.99 from July 8th, during the entire Prime Day.

Two more Grand Slams and the year's over, time flies! If you want to stream Wimbledon online for free, you're in the right place. This year's tournament promises plenty of excitement and world-class matches.

While watching on premium channels is easy, we understand that not everyone can afford them. Fortunately, there's a way to watch Wimbledon live on a free channel and not miss a single moment.

This guide explains where and how to access the live stream as soon as it starts, so you can watch every match online with English commentary.

Here's a question for you: Where is Wimbledon played?

The United Kingdom! Naturally, it means that local channels will broadcast the tournament. The one that comes to mind is the BBC. BBC constantly streams Wimbledon live for free for people in this country.

BBC can be accessed online through its BBC iPlayer platform (link: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer)

This is an on-demand streaming service to enjoy live programs like Wimbledon matches. It's a free English channel, so you can expect English commentary and Full HD footage.

Unfortunately, BBC iPlayer is region-locked to the UK, and it's pretty hard to access it abroad. People outside the UK often stare at the geo-restriction message, even with free accounts and UK roots.

So, how to watch Wimbledon 2025 on this free channel from anywhere?

Watch Wimbledon With NordVPN

It's pretty simple, according to people who found a solution.

BBC iPlayer works by registering a visitor's IP address. The IP must be from the UK for BBC iPlayer to work. Some people have found that, by altering their IP to the UK with a VPN, they can access BBC iPlayer abroad.

However, not every VPN works with it, as BBC iPlayer also knows about the trick. The provider that's constantly mentioned is NordVPN. You've likely heard of it because it's among the most popular options.

It offers over 400 UK servers, unlimited bandwidth, and sufficient speed for Full HD streaming. Moreover, NordVPN works on all devices, which makes watching Wimbledon live for free much easier.

So, how does it work?

You subscribe to the VPN, install it on your device, and connect to the UK server. Afterwards, you go to BBC iPlayer, sign in, and watch Wimbledon on a free channel. This VPN isn't free, but it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, effectively giving you a free trial of NordVPN.

Wimbledon is about fourteen days long, so you have ample time to get a refund. With the money back in your bank account and no money spent, you're at zero, much better than exorbitantly priced sports-streaming services.

For more details, refer to our lengthier Wimbledon free live stream tutorial.

Important note: You'll need to create a free account on BBC iPlayer to access its live programs. Don't worry though, the process is super quick.

There's no way to access the free live stream in the USA.

However, if you don't want to fiddle with the VPN and get a refund, some streaming services within the USA are viable options. They include:

All three have English commentary and provide Full HD footage. On the other hand, spending this much to watch Wimbledon sounds silly. Unless you have an account, it's rather pointless for most people.

It's worth noting that FuboTV provides a handy 7-day trial, which lets you enjoy a portion of the Grand Slam. You can use it for the last few matches, including the finals. Though keep in mind that all three work only in the USA.

People abroad use NordVPN to watch ESPN Plus, Sling TV, and FuboTV.

Yes! The free Wimbledon streaming channel works with a VPN in all countries. Sadly, no Canadian channel broadcasts the event free. TSN holds the rights to this broadcast in the maple-flagged country.

TSN is usually part of the TV package, so you can access it via your TV unless you're a cord-cutter. If you are, you can subscribe to TSN Plus, an online streaming service developed by TSN.

Similarly to BBC iPlayer, it provides access to live sports streams that you can otherwise watch on TSN. The price is a whopping CA$199 annually, but you can also spend CA$20 monthly if it's easier.

TSN doesn't have a free trial, and its plans are non-refundable. Moreover, TSN is exclusive to Canada, so you're doomed to fail without a Canadian IP. VPNs may work abroad, but you need a Canadian credit card to subscribe.

Visit NordVPN

Australians can celebrate because Wimbledon is broadcast for free on 9Now.

9Now or Channel Nine is popular in Australia because of its diverse content. 9Now is an on-demand service similar to BBC iPlayer, but it's exclusive to Australia. If you're in this country, all you must do is tune in and enjoy.

New Zealand users have TVNZ or TVNZ+. The latter is an on-demand service with access to a free Wimbledon broadcast in this country. 9Now and TVNZ+ require a free account, which can be made in minutes.

After that, you can watch anything, including this Grand Slam.

9Now works abroad with NordVPN, but the same applies to TVNZ+ for residents in another country. Most notably, they're not subscription services and cost nothing, making them more viable than ESPN+, TSN+, FuboTV, etc.

With all the solutions presented, accessing Wimbledon on a free channel isn't so hard. BBC iPlayer is the best option, as it offers the best-quality footage and English commentary for free. You can use NordVPN to access it abroad.

Other free channels, such as 9Now and TVNZ+, are great for Australians and New Zealanders, respectively. However, a VPN helps bypass their geo-blocks and use them even on a vacation or business trip overseas.

Avid tennis fans have paid options in the USA and Canada.

ESPN Plus, FuboTV, Sling TV, and TSN+ are some of them. If you're within their ‘allowed' regions, you can stream Wimbledon online without a VPN, as long as you don't mind the hefty price tag.

Try NordVPN Risk-Free Today

The 2025 Wimbledon Championships will mark the 138th edition of the tournament. This year's event is scheduled to take place from June 30 to July 13, 2025, at the iconic All England Club in London.

Yes, if you're in the UK, you can stream Wimbledon for free via BBC iPlayer. The platform broadcasts the entire event at no extra cost. However, if you're outside the UK, you'll need a VPN to access BBC iPlayer. NordVPN is a top choice for this, offering fast, reliable connections and UK servers that work seamlessly with iPlayer.

Yes, but only in Germany and Austria. Amazon Prime Video holds the exclusive broadcasting rights for Wimbledon in these countries until 2027. If you're a Prime member in either location, you can watch the tournament live at no extra cost.

Brother makes some solid, reliable printers. Indeed, for several years running, The Verge named it the best printer you should buy. Unfortunately, the company's devices appear to be riddled with new zero-day bugs that could allow a savvy cybercriminal to hijack them.

The vulnerabilities were discovered by cybersecurity firm Rapid7, which published a blog about the bugs last week. The blog explains that, after some research, Rapid7's cyber pros came across a total of eight new zero-day vulnerabilities in the machines. The vulnerabilities are all different, though there is one that is pretty bad. CVE-2024-51978 is an authentication bypass vulnerability that could allow a hacker to nab the printer's password. Researchers break it down like so:

A remote unauthenticated attacker can leak the target device's serial number through one of several means, and in turn generate the target device's default administrator password. This is due to the discovery of the default password generation procedure used by Brother devices. This procedure transforms a serial number into a default password. Affected devices have their default password set, based on each device's unique serial number, during the manufacturing process. Brother has indicated that this vulnerability cannot be fully remediated in firmware, and has required a change to the manufacturing process of all affected models.

Researchers originally contacted Brother Industries last year, and the printing company and security researchers have been in touch since then, working to mitigate the issues. The bugs are also impacting several other printer brands, including Fujifilm, Ricoh, Toshiba, and Konica Minolta, according to researchers.  

Dark Reading notes that millions of devices appear to be impacted. Luckily, researchers note that there is no evidence that the bugs are being exploited in the wild. Brother has also issued patches for the vulnerabilities.

In addition to installing patches, users are also encouraged to change their default administrator password. That should stop the bad bug, CVE-2024-51978, which would have allowed an intruder to hijack the machine. If you don't do that, researchers warn that an attacker could “use this default administrator password to either reconfigure the target device, or access functionality only intended for authenticated users.”

Gizmodo reached out to Brother Industries for more information. In a statement shared Wednesday, the company said: “Brother would like to thank Rapid7 for their efforts in discovering the issues. We have informed our customers about the mitigation on our website.”

Touchscreens have been available on laptop computers since 1983, believe it or not. But it took decades for them to become widely available and, more importantly, affordable. Now we appear to have moved from “affordable” to “absolutely dirt cheap,” if Best Buy's $169 sale (58% off) on the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is any indication.

See at Best Buy

This incredible price for a 14-inch full-HD Chromebook with a 2.05 GHz processor, integrated graphics, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage is only slightly more than half the price of Apple's entry-level 10th gen iPad, and the lowest price of the iPad Pro would cover the price of the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 five times over. The original $399 price for the IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is, honestly, reasonable. But Best Buy's current $169 deal is unbeatable.

We're not going to tell you the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is fancy, or jam-packed with incredible features or the very latest bells and whistles. What we can tell you is, it's abundantly solid, especially for high school or college students. It's sturdy, it's durable, it's easy on the eyes, and it just gets things done.

What kind of things? The stuff you do every single day, like browse, check and send email, post to your social media, and maybe catch up on a little streaming on the clear, full-HD screen. The IdeaPad Slim 3 does all of those things very well, and can do them all day long thanks to the 13.5-hour battery life. And it can do them wherever you need, because the IdeaPad Slim 3 is, indeed, slim and lightweight and abundantly portable.

Again, the IdeaPad Slim 3 isn't going to blow you away with a massive array of ports to become the hub of a huge desktop setup, but it has what you need — one USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, a microSD card reader, and a headphone/microphone aux jack. It will run an external monitor just fine, and an external SSD to augment the 64GB of built-in storage is also easy to connect.

WiFi 6 and Bluetooth connections are present and accounted for, and the HD screen's 60Hz refresh rate will make your streaming or online videos come through smoothly, although it's not a great choice for gaming. And then there is, of course, the touchscreen, which easily sets the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 apart from any sub-$200 laptop or Chromebook we can think of.

Think of the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 as basic simplicity and total competence and efficiency as a daily-use laptop, and take the touchscreen and especially the $169 sale price (58% off) at Best Buy as two very big bonus points.

Powerful Threadripper and twin RTX 4090 system fails to take off.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A 3D graphics professional has been having great difficulty with a pricey DIY PC build. Redditor joel_motion's purportedly $20,000 PC includes potent performance components such as a $4,000 AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro 7975WX, twin ~$2,500 Zotac RTX 4090 graphics cards, and luxuriant amounts of RAM (512GB). However, after a BIOS update went wrong, the Redditor hasn't been able to boot the system successfully, halting at Q-Code 92. Despite RMAing multiple suspected components, including the motherboard, this error persists.



Let's first look at the timeline of events for some clues, which may shine a spotlight on the root cause of the issue. The system seems to have been initially assembled at the end of 2024. Joel_motion built the system sans-case for initial testing, which proved successful, and then built it into his Corsair 9000D Super Full-Tower case. This still worked fine.

The Redditor noticed they needed to update the Asus Pro WS WRX90E-SAGE SE motherboard to fix an incompatibility issue with one of the NVMe SSD drives in the system. According to the social media post, they used ""the BIOS tool"" to install the update, rather than the motherboard's BIOS flashback feature. During the process, something bad happened. “After it hung on the BIOS update, I had to power it down,” notes the Redditor.

From here on in, we note that joel_motion faced an incurable case of Q-Code 92 errors. Naturally suspecting the motherboard – it was the only ‘change' between error free computing and the current sticky situation – the Redditor was lucky enough to be inside the product RMA window. However, after receiving a “used/refurbished replacement” from Asus, and a subsequent rebuild, the exact same error popped up…

Joel_motion went through swapping one suspected component after the next. They moved through “motherboard #2, CPU #2, and GPU #2, and it's still not working.” Then they cajoled Asus into sending motherboard #3 (new this time, apparently). Then tried building afresh with new RAM and a new PSU. Error Q-Code 92 persisted.

“Along the way, I have experimented with countless tries of RAM placement, clearing the CMOS, Flashbacking the BIOS to different versions, and have made sure to not have any peripherals or Drives plugged in,” adds the Redditor, exasperated. So, at this point, they turned to the PCBuild subreddit to ask the community for help with their “$20k paperweight.”

When troubleshooting cases like this, seasoned PC tinkerers and repairers often strip a system down to the bare minimum required components to POST and reach the board maker's splash screen, and then they can hit a key to enter the BIOS setup. In this case, that would be a success, as it would put Q-Code 92 in the rearview mirror.

Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.

As the Threadripper doesn't have an iGPU, a graphics card will need to be added to meet the minimum level of components. To begin, we would start at the test bench stage again, with everything unplugged from the motherboard. Then follow the procedure to clear the CMOS, install the CPU, add a stick of RAM, slot in the graphics card, rest a CPU cooler on the Threadripper with a little paste (for now), and connect up the motherboard and GPU power to the PSU. Plug in the monitor and a keyboard/mouse. You should now be able to power on by bridging the motherboard power pins header with a conductive item, such as a screwdriver tip.

If the system doesn't work in this minimal config, as in it gets the same error, you have a lot fewer variables to consider. PC repairers and enthusiasts with a wealth of spare parts at their disposal have it easier. They can often A/B test the various basic parts that may be causing trouble with ‘known good' ones to find the error culprit. The rest of us have to hope the stripped-back testing points to one or another component being the root of the error, so we can arrange a return and wait for the new component to arrive and solve the issue.

As Q-Code 92 points to a PCI Bus initialization issue, it doesn't really narrow down the culprit very precisely. So, we don't have definitive answers here. However, we hope that Joel_motion can find a way out of their $20K conundrum via the back-to-basics troubleshooting steps outlined above.

Somehow getting access to more components to A/B test would be a bonus for the Redditor. But if that isn't possible, and they feel like they are at a dead end, it might save a lot of time and stress to hire a well-reviewed local repairer to fix up the system. In effect, the 3D graphics professional would then trade their time to offset any PC troubleshooting and repair costs incurred by an individual or firm with the resources to efficiently pinpoint and fix their Q-Code 92 error.

Not a bad result

An elated eBay shopper has taken to Reddit to celebrate after buying two RTX 3080 GPUs for the paltry sum of $650, only to receive two 3090 cards probably worth double the price instead.

u/EmuAreExtiinct shared how they had paid $650 for two RTX 3080 cards earlier in June. The haul is actually two separate eBay lots, each listed as 'Dell GeForce RTX 3080 10GB GDDR6X Graphics Card.' Per the price and the image in the Reddit post, you can see that the cards were sold for $325 each sometime before June 26.

When they arrived, however, the user quickly realized they'd got a lot more than they'd bargained for, and had actually bought vastly more valuable RTX 3090 GPUs instead, as evidenced by the presence of Nvidia's fabled but now obsolete SLI tech. ""You can tell it's a 3090 and not a 3080 because only the 3090 had SLI, and you can clearly see the gold pins for SLI,"" the user notes.""

The cards weren't in fantastic condition, with the buyer reporting that both had a bent backplate and some cooling issues, but after bending the backplate back into place and applying some new thermal paste, both reportedly work fine.

As you can tell from the listings, these Dell cards have likely been taken from a pre-built system. While it's impossible to guess their value based on wear and use, both cards likely have an MSRP of roughly $1,500. A Dell Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, replete with its customary 24GB of VRAM, sold on eBay a few days ago for $820, considerably more than what this user paid for two of the same cards.

One commenter asked the question on everyone's lips, namely, will both cards be used in the SLI configuration they're built for? The user sadly admitted they only have an 850W PSU that probably wouldn't be able to handle the requisite power load. What the user ends up doing with the cards remains to be seen, but at the very least, they can relist one of the 3090s to recoup all of their investment, and still be left with a pretty excellent GPU to boot.

What's even wilder is that the poor eBay seller, a certain beebee1423, appears to have sold at least 20 more RTX 3080 cards under similar listings, giving rise to the possibility that there might be more 3090s out there in the world unbeknownst to their buyers, and indeed the misinformed seller.

Amazon and Nintendo have both denied the report.

Both Nintendo and Amazon have denied claims that the Japanese gaming giant pulled its product from Amazon U.S. and refused to launch its Switch 2 on the platform due to a disagreement over unauthorized sales. A Bloomberg report claims the two got into a spat over third-party merchants undercutting the price of Nintendo games, ultimately resulting in the Switch 2 not launching on Amazon during its release last month.

According to the report, Nintendo stopped selling products on Amazon after it noticed third-party merchants in the U.S. were selling games at prices lower than those advertised by Nintendo. It is reported that sellers were buying the products in bulk from Southeast Asia and exporting them to the U.S., before reselling them on the cheap through the marketplace.

In response, it is alleged that Nintendo product listings began to slowly disappear from Amazon US. Listings ""Sold by Amazon"" gave way to products sold by third-party resellers and independent merchants, but reportedly not from Amazon.

In response, Amazon tried to bring Nintendo back into the fold with an offer of labels guaranteeing the authenticity of products, a technique already employed for other products. However, Bloomberg reports this wasn't enough and that ""Nintendo ultimately opted to pull its products from Amazon in the US.""

This is allegedly the reason why the Nintendo Switch 2 didn't launch on Amazon when the device was released last month.

For their part, both Nintendo and Amazon deny the claims. Nintendo bluntly stated, ""There is no such fact. We do not disclose details of negotiations or contracts with retailers."" Amazon said Bloomberg's claims regarding its relationship with Nintendo were ""inaccurate"" and said it was ""pleased to offer Nintendo products directly to our customers as part of our commitment to providing an exceptional shopping experience with the widest selection possible.""

However, as the report notes, the Nintendo Switch 2 is indeed not to be found on Amazon.com, whereas it can be found on Amazon in multiple foreign markets, including Canada and the UK.

Bloomberg reports that some Nintendo Switch titles, notably Donkey Kong Banaza, are now appearing for pre-order on Amazon's U.S. website, but the Switch 2 remains absent, and Nintendo's website does not list Amazon as a vendor in the U.S..

The Amazon U.S. kerfuffle wasn't enough to stop Nintendo smashing the sales record for a new console, shifting 3.5 million units in just four days.

China aims to become the global supplier of chips in the next few years.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Market research and tech consulting firm Yole Group predicts that China will have 30% of the world's global foundry production capacity, making it the largest hub of semiconductor production. At the moment, Taiwan holds the highest output capacity at 23%, followed closely by China at 21%, South Korea at 19%, Japan at 13%, the U.S. at 10%, and Europe at 8%. According to Digitimes, China is expected to take the lead because of the massive investments in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, driven by Beijing's goal of reaching self-sufficiency for its chip production.

In 2024, the East Asian country's semiconductor production hit 8.85 million wafers per month, an increase of 15% from the previous year, and is projected to hit 10.1 million in 2025. China achieved this with the construction of 18 new fabs — for example, Huahong Semiconductor, and pure-play foundry based in Shanghai, just opened a 12-inch fab in Wuxi, with production beginning in the first quarter of this year.

The U.S. is the largest consumer of wafers, accounting for about 57% of global demand. However, it holds just around 10% of global production capacity, meaning it must source the rest of its supply from other major producers like Taiwan, South Korea, and China. On the other hand, Digitimes says that Japan's and Europe's production largely satisfies internal demand. There are other producers out there, too, like Singapore and Malaysia, which make up around 6% of global foundry capacity. These companies are largely foreign-owned, though, and exist to satisfy the demand in areas like the U.S. and China.

It seems that the report does not consider the fabs that are under construction in the United States, though. Several companies have started construction in the U.S., TSMC chief among them, with the company expecting to build 30% of its advanced chips in Arizona. Intel, Samsung, Micron, GlobalFoundries, and Texas Instruments also have projects underway, which will add to the U.S. wafer production capacity.

Additionally, the report did not specify how the technological capabilities of China's fabs compare to those of their Western counterparts. The U.S. has been putting export controls on the most advanced chip-making tech, making it harder for Chinese companies to acquire the necessary equipment to produce the latest chips. Because of this, Beijing is pouring billions of dollars into helping fill in the gaps in its semiconductor industry, like lithography tools and electronic design automation (EDA) software. So, even though China will likely have the upper hand when it comes to output capacity, the question of which country will have the greatest capability of producing cutting-edge chips in the near future is still up in the air.

Apple is reportedly working on a new, cheaper MacBook using a chip originally designed for the iPhone. Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted on X that the company is planning a new 13-inch laptop using an A18 Pro chip.The laptop, which Kuo says would launch at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, would be Apple's first Mac running on an A-series chip. The A18 Pro, which powers the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, averages in the 3,400s on the Geekbench 6 single-core benchmark and 8,500 to 8,600 in multi-core. Those single-core scores are only slightly lower than what you see in the M4, which range between 3,400 and 3,700 points on the same test, depending on which Mac they're in. The multi-core score is a lot closer to the original M1 generation, which also falls around 8,500.

This device will also reportedly come in various colors, including silver, blue, pink, and yellow. Some fans have called for Apple to bring the colors from the iMac line to the MacBook, but it hasn't done so yet. Apple's latest experiment with color on Mac laptops has been with the tastefully muted sky blue on the M4 MacBook Air.Kuo states that Apple is looking to sell 5–7 million units of this product in 2026. It's unclear how much they might cost, but presumably, these would be entry-level laptops that undercut the $999 MacBook Air. They would have to be pretty cheap to compete. The M3 MacBook Air has dropped to $799 new on sale before. Apple's current affordable play is at Walmart, which sells the M1 MacBook Air with the old design, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM for $649.A lower price might put Apple in a position to compete with cheaper Chromebooks and mid-level Windows laptops in a play for the education market and for those who might only use their laptops for email, web browsing, and other simple tasks.The reference design is reportedly being supplied by Everwin Precision in Shenzhen, China. Beyond the laptop, Kuo claims that Everwin is building frames for smart glasses due to ship in 2027. Those would feature audio playback, a camera, and video recording like Meta's AI glasses, as well as ""AI environmental sensing."" Kuo says the glasses will lack display functionality. We'll have to see if any or all of these predictions come to pass.

 June 30, 2025  

Hospitalist Arti Tewari, MD, no longer has to second-guess some of her decisions about the best treatment for managing patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). New ACS clinical practice guidelines she refers to as “groundbreaking” help her more confidently care for her cardiac patients at UChicago Medicine to improve their health and safety, she said.

“There have been times previously where I have weighed the risks and benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy, specifically not knowing if a patient would need open heart surgery or bypass surgery and not wanting to delay that surgery by giving them antiplatelet agents,” said Tewari, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago in Chicago.

Because hospitalists are among the first clinicians to care for patients with ACS when they are admitted into the hospital, Medscape Medical News sought to learn how the specialty physicians apply the new guidelines in their practice.

The directive to use more antiplatelet therapy was one of the biggest changes Tewari noted in the new guidelines released earlier this year by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. It was the first update in the guidelines in more than a decade.

ACS continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an estimated 1.2 million individuals in the US hospitalized with the group of acute cardiovascular conditions defined by sudden reduced blood flow to the heart muscles, according to the AHA's 2024 data.

Symptoms include chest pain, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Associated conditions include unstable angina and myocardial infarction, or a heart attack.

Tewari said patients with ACS typically come to the hospital complaining of chest pain. Hospitalists often are the first to manage their care, deciding if they are experiencing a cardiac, muscular, or another issue such as gastrointestinal reflex.

If hospitalists suspect a cardiac condition, they may consider whether the patient needs intervention such as a stent for a potential lesion in one of their coronary arteries. In that case, the hospitalist would administer antiplatelet agents as recommended in the guidelines while the patient is being stabilized for that procedure.

Another change Tewari noticed in the guidance was more careful optimization of lipid-lowering agents. “We used to use statins and to really kind of go based off of a cumulative risk score for our patients, but with these new guidelines there's really a push for non-statin lipid-lowering agents, and that is definitely a change in my practice that I think is going to benefit the patients greatly.”

The committee that drafted the new guidelines kept hospitalists in mind along with other clinicians who might provide care for patients with ACS during their treatment path, said Michelle O'Donoghue, MD, MPH, vice chair of the ACS guideline writing committee.

Hospitalists tend to see such patients after they are stabilized following coronary revascularization or readmitted after a recent ACS event, said O'Donoghue, a cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, Boston.

Like other clinicians following the new guidelines, hospitalists should become aware of the new recommendations for using lipid-lowering therapy and the selection and duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), O'Donoghue told Medscape Medical News, for which she frequently posts cardiology commentaries. She also serves on Medscape's cardiology advisory board.

O'Donoghue summed up some of the key points of the new guidelines for hospitalists and other clinicians, especially early after an ACS event.

“The new ACS guidelines want to target an LDL [low-density lipoprotein] cholesterol that is < 55 mg/dL, so, by and large, all patients should be on a high-potency statin, barring any contraindication, and if they're already on a high-potency statin, then the hospitalist should be initiating a non-statin lipid-lowering therapy.”

She cited several non-statin lipid-lowering therapies that can be considered, including proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors, ezetimibe, and bempedoic acid, that can help patients achieve their LDL cholesterol goal.

“But if they're not at goal and they're already on a high-potency statin, then really the hospitalist should be initiating non-statin therapies before hospital discharge and then also making sure that that patient is scheduled to have their lipid panel rechecked in another 4-8 weeks to make sure as an outpatient that they are, in fact, achieving that goal.”

Hospitalists should also focus on management of antiplatelet therapy, O'Donoghue said. “By and large all patients who undergo placement of a stent will be on dual antiplatelet therapy including aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor for some period of time after that stent is placed, but the duration is somewhat variable,” she explained.

“The important area for the hospitalist to know is that if the patient requires the addition of an anticoagulant, then the aspirin should be discontinued 1-4 weeks after PCI [percutaneous coronary intervention] for a patient who does not require an anticoagulant while the P2Y12 inhibitor is continued.”

The guidelines now offer more flexibility during follow-up for the possibility of discontinuing DAPT earlier, O'Donoghue said. “Traditionally, shorter duration of DAPT has meant stopping the P2Y12 inhibitor. However, the guidelines now have a class 1 recommendation to endorse the discontinuation of aspirin after 1-3 months for patients discharged on aspirin and ticagrelor to reduce risk of bleeding.”

She added that prasugrel and ticagrelor are both preferred over clopidogrel in the absence of a contraindication. “But we recognize for the hospitalist, who might be caring for a patient early in the course of their ACS, that there may be barriers such as cost that prevent them from getting those more potent antiplatelet therapies,” O'Donoghue said.

“If there is a need to switch between therapies, the hospitalist should make sure that they are consulting the pharmacist to best understand how to do that.”

Hospitalists should also refer the patient to cardiac rehab if they have been recently diagnosed with an ACS, she said. “There's been a clear benefit that has been shown for patients who participate in those types of programs.”

The guidelines even offer an alternative for a patient who can't attend in person — virtual cardiac rehab programs, she said.

Patients with ACS also should have an annual flu shot because the flu puts considerable stress on a recent patient with the heart condition, O'Donoghue said.

Community-based hospitalist Jeff S. Shapiro, MD, believes the new guidelines offer “a more nuanced approach to treatment of ACS with a continued emphasis on DAPT and aggressive lipid-lowering treatment, including clearer recommendations on adding non-statin therapy to patients who have either reached maximal doses of statins or in which statins are contraindicated.”

The guidelines on blood transfusion also “feel more aggressive than what we are currently using,” said Shapiro, regional medical director of the Southern California Hospitalist Network, Orange, and chief of staff, elect, of Emanate Health Foothill Presbyterian Hospital in Glendora, California.

“Recommendations such as microaxial flow pumps are less helpful for community-based physicians, as it will take time for that type of technology to reach our hospitals, although I used to say the same thing regarding stroke neuro-intervention, which we now do regularly at one of our hospitals.”

In general, Shapiro believes the new guidelines help community-based hospitalists discharge patients back to their primary care physicians on “optimal medical therapy similar to what we are doing with goal-directed medical therapy” for congestive heart failure.

For academic hospitalist Farzana Hoque, MD, the updates on DAPT, particularly the individualized step-down approach for high bleeding risk patients and lipid management, are especially valuable for patient care, she told Medscape Medical News.

The guidelines recommend at least 1 year of DAPT for patients with ACS who are not at high risk for bleeding to reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), said Hoque, associate professor of medicine at Saint Louis University in St. Louis.

She noted the guidelines' preference for ticagrelor or prasugrel over clopidogrel in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction — a more serious type of heart attack — managed with the nonsurgical PCI to reduce stent thrombosis and MACE.

“The updated recommendation favors clopidogrel over ticagrelor or prasugrel to minimize bleeding risk in patients requiring oral anticoagulation,” said Hoque, who also teaches the new recommendations to her medical students and residents.

She added that the old guidelines needed to be updated to reflect new evidence, evolving clinical practices, and advances in technology.

Hoque said she regularly consults such guidelines in her practice at the academic medical center, which cares for high-risk patients with diverse clinical and social needs from an underserved community.

Many of Hoque's patients are elderly with an increased tendency to bleed. So they will benefit from the update for patients with ACS who require anticoagulation.

When it comes to bleeding risk, Tewari said hospitalists also have to balance the risk for cardiac ischemia, reduced blood flow to the heart muscle because of blocked arteries.

“Every day we have patients who come in [the hospital] who make it successfully to a cardiac catheterization to unblock a heart vessel because of these guidelines,” she said.

She's gained confidence giving DAPT up front because the new guidelines suggest administering a large dose of it and then holding one of the platelet agents for 24 hours prior to a surgery, rather than 5 days.

While hospitalists are expected to stay informed of changing guidelines, Tewari admits there's a learning curve associated with them. “Certainly, it's a pretty significant change than what I learned in my training,” she said, adding that her practice is teaching its staff and residents to provide the updated standard of care.

“The guidelines are definitely helpful for us to refer back to because we can't possibly know all of this off the top of our head.”

A systematic review found that higher lifetime exposure to cooking oil fumes was associated with an increased risk for lung cancer in never-smoking women in high-income countries.

""Exposure to cooking fumes is linked to lung cancer due to the levels of carcinogens that can be produced during the heating of oils to high temperatures. VOCs [volatile organic compounds] which are generated by cooking oils have been shown to be mutagenic, containing PACs [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons], aldehydes, carbonyl compounds and other mutagens,"" the authors of the study wrote.

This study was led by Bría Joyce McAllister, University of Leicester College of Life Sciences, Leicester, England. It was published online on June 20, 2025, in BMJ Open.

All three studies relied on questionnaires and participant recollection rather than active monitoring of household air pollutant concentrations while cooking. The questionnaires used were not included in the publications, potentially limiting replication. Additionally, none of the studies accounted for the effects of outdoor air pollution, which is known to affect health and indoor air quality. The research was limited to Chinese women in Taiwan and Hong Kong using traditional cooking methods, raising questions about applicability to other ethnic groups and high-income countries.

This study was supported by a grant from the Wellcome Trust. The National Institute for Health and Care Research Leicester Biomedical Research Centre provided additional support. The authors declared having no relevant conflicts of interest.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

The UK is set to become the first country to use an artificial intelligence (AI) early warning system to flag healthcare safety issues in real time.

The government said the system will trigger earlier inspections by identifying patterns in hospital data and reports from community healthcare staff.

The new technology will alert the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to signs of abuse, serious injury, death, or other safety issues. When flagged, CQC teams will be able to conduct targeted inspections. 

Officials say the move aims to prevent NHS failures from escalating and to protect patients from the types of harm seen in recent high-profile scandals. The initiative forms part of the government's 10-Year Health Plan to modernise NHS services by shifting from analogue to digital systems.

The new system is expected to help save lives by “catching unsafe care before it becomes a tragedy,” Health and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said on Monday.

Concerns over NHS safety have intensified in recent years after a spate of scandals, particularly in mental health and maternity services.

Last week, Streeting announced a rapid national investigation into “systemic” failures in NHS maternity care spanning more than 15 years.

The first phase of the AI rollout — the Maternity Outcomes Signal System — is due to be launched across NHS trusts this year. It will monitor near real-time data to flag higher-than-expected rates of stillbirth, neonatal death, or brain injury. 

Professor Meghana Pandit, co-national medical director for secondary care at NHS England, predicted that the new system would “turbo-charge” how quickly the NHS responds to safety concerns.

Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive of the CQC, said a clearer and simpler inspection approach is already in development.

“In the future our experienced teams of inspectors, led by our newly appointed chief inspectors, will be able to conduct more inspections and share feedback on the findings more quickly,” he said.

Daniel Elkeles, chief executive of NHS Providers, said trusts must be able to identify failures and take action before inspections are triggered.

However, Professor Nicola Ranger, general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, warned that the system may not act fast enough. She called the current situation “drastically unsafe” and said that boosting NHS staffing levels remains essential to improving care.

DISCLOSURES |  June 30, 2025  

The benefits of bariatric surgery can extend beyond physical weight loss and improved metabolic parameters, according to a new study finding that self-esteem surges in the first year following the surgery.

“We certainly know that bariatric surgery can help with diabetes, hypertension, and sleep apnea, but we don't talk as much about how obesity affects basic self-esteem — how the patient feels about themselves,” study investigator Justin Dhyani, MD, Geisinger Medical Center, Danville, Pennsylvania, told Medscape Medical News.

“It seems logical that when a patient loses weight, self-esteem will increase, but the nearly 40-point rise in self-esteem scores we saw in just 12 months was really impressive,” said Dhyani.

But how long does it last?

Leslie Heinberg, PhD, Department of Psychiatry and Psychology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, told Medscape Medical News that the self-esteem boost in the first year after surgery noted in this study is “absolutely in line” with her own clinical observations.

It's after the first year when challenges may arise, said Heinberg, who wasn't involved in the research.

For their study, Dhyani and colleagues used the Geisinger database to identify 5056 adults (mean age, 48 years; 85% women) with obesity (BMI ≥ 35) who had bariatric surgery between 2006 and 2019. Most had Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy.

A total of 534 participants completed a survey on self-esteem within 12 months before and 6-24 months after weight-loss surgery.

Overall, the researchers found that self-esteem scores more than doubled just 12 months after bariatric surgery — from 33.6 at baseline to 75.5 (out of 100) at 12 months (P < .0001).

However, patients with a higher BMI at the time of surgery (BMI ≥ 50) experienced smaller gains in self-esteem compared with peers with lower baseline BMI (< 40), which could be due to lingering effects of weight stigma.

“When you start out at a higher BMI, you have a longer way to go to reach what society might think is a normal weight, said Dhyani, adding that the externalized weight stigma certainly would affect how patients feel about themselves.

“That's what I think is going on,” he told Medscape Medical News.

Dhyani presented the study at the 2025 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) Annual Scientific Meeting in Washington, DC.

He noted that longer-term follow-up will be important to see whether these gains in self-esteem persist over time, particularly in light of known trends in weight regain after surgery.

Heinberg told Medscape Medical News the first year after bariatric surgery is colloquially called the “heavenly period” because people are losing a lot of weight, they're finding big improvements in their health and quality of life, and they're often getting a lot of positive attention.

But “beyond the first year, quality of life may stabilize, and people find that they have to work hard so they don't experience weight recurrence,” said Heinberg. “They still have the same challenges as before surgery, like stressful jobs. They're just in a smaller body.”

That's why ongoing counseling is so important. “At Cleveland Clinic, the psychology team is embedded within the bariatric program. We see patients a bit more in the first year, but then annually is recommended,” Heinberg said, adding that they are available to patients more frequently if needed.

April Williams, from Gig Harbor, Washington, who had bariatric surgery in 2019, said the “temporary high” with surgery-induced weight loss can be followed by an “emotional crash” as the weight loss eventually slows down and people stop commenting and offering praise. 

People need to realize the “chronic and progressive nature of obesity. Just because you've treated it with bariatric surgery, the disease is still progressing in your life,” Williams told Medscape Medical News.

Driven in part by a lack of post-surgery support, much of it due to COVID, Williams founded BariNation, a patient-led organization that supports people at all stages of their bariatric weight loss journey.

Jamie Sarver, LPN, program coordinator with Cleveland Clinic's Bariatric and Metabolic Institute, said bariatric surgery is “an opportunity to make an investment in yourself, [but] it's not a quick fix.”

Sarver also had bariatric surgery in 2019. She shared that prior to surgery, she often felt “uncomfortable” in her own skin, but her perception of herself has “evolved several times” since the surgery.

“Initially I was glad for the rapid weight loss, smaller clothing sizes, and noticeable changes in my abilities to do physical activities. Over time, and as I've maintained my weight loss, my perception of myself has evolved further to feeling proud and confident of what I've achieved in these 5 years since surgery,” Sarver told Medscape Medical News.

Despite the physical and psychological benefits of bariatric surgery, only about 1% of Americans eligible for bariatric surgery choose to pursue it.

Dhyani said highlighting the emotional and social benefits of bariatric surgery could encourage more patients to consider the procedure. “I think letting patients know more about the self-esteem aspect of it might open up their minds to this type of care to improve their lives,” he said.

Richard M. Peterson, MD, MPH, president-elect of the ASMBS and professor of surgery at UT Health San Antonio, San Antonio, told Medscape Medical News that one of his initiatives is to “improve the image of bariatric surgery.”

“A lot of people still have the very old-school view that bariatric surgery is dangerous. But the truth is this surgery — that improves overall health and weight loss — is safer than having your gallbladder removed,” said Peterson.

A novel predictive model named STAYHOME effectively estimated the risk of losing the ability to live at home among older adults after cancer surgery, demonstrating good calibration with minimal deviation from observed risks. The model predicted a 2.4% and 3.4% risk for admission to a nursing home at 6 months and 12 months, respectively.

“The STAYHOME tool demonstrated good discrimination and was well calibrated. Thus, it may be a useful tool to identify a specific group of individuals at risk of not remaining home,” the authors wrote. “[The tool] used information readily available to patients, care partners, and healthcare professionals and may be implemented to provide them with individualized risk estimates and improve surgical oncology care delivery and experience for older adults,” they concluded.

This study, led by Julie Hallet, MD, Odette Cancer Centre, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was published online in JAMA Surgery.

The STAYHOME tool showed slightly reduced discrimination for predictor levels of preoperative frailty, preoperative home care use, receipt of neoadjuvant therapy, and having stage IV disease. The model was also less well calibrated at the extremes of the risk distribution, with a slight overestimation in higher-risk categories. 

This study was funded by operating grants from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Ontario Cancer Research Institute, and ICES. One author reported receiving speaker fees from Ipsen, outside the submitted work.

A man in his 30s with congenital indifference to pain with anosmia (CIP) presented to a tertiary centre for elective biopsy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Post-operatively, the patient developed intermittent tachycardia, hypertension, and pyrexia.

A case report by Thomas French, MD, research fellow in the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, England, documented a rare case of congenital pain insensitivity.

The patient presented for an elective endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy (EBUS) of a lesion in his right middle bronchus and video-assisted thoracoscopic lung resection for two nodules in his right lung.

He had undergone excision and adjuvant radical radiotherapy of a pT3 N0 M0 sarcoma on the right side of his neck 4 years earlier. Forty-six months later, a chest x-ray revealed a 9 mm nodule in the apical segment of his right lung.

His past medical history was notable for CIP with anosmia and a host of related hospital presentations, including poorly healing ulcers, scoliosis, Staphylococcus discitis, and infected soft tissue injuries.

On one occasion, he presented to the emergency department after feeling a painless “popping” sensation in his left arm and was diagnosed with a biceps tendon rupture. Imaging revealed widespread skeletal degeneration.

His condition had first come to his attention after scalding himself while working as a plumber. He had not noticed the injury until later. Subsequent genetic sequencing led to the diagnosis of CIP.

He had not required analgesia following his previous surgeries but had experienced autonomic responses to pain, characterised by tachycardia, hypertension, and pyrexia.

During EBUS, a lesion was observed at the bifurcation of the right middle and lower lobes. A VATS wedge resection of the right upper and lower lobes was performed, and three tissue samples — from the lesion, the upper lobe, and the lower lobe — were sent for histopathology. Intraoperatively, the patient's blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate remained stable, with no autonomic responses to surgical stimuli.

He underwent EBUS of the lesion located at the bifurcation of his right middle and right lower lobes and VATS wedge resections of the right upper lobe and right lower lobe. Three samples were sent for histopathologic analysis: biopsied lesion, upper lobe wedge, and lower lobe wedge.

The patient displayed no autonomic response to the primary incision while under general anaesthesia: his blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate remained constant throughout the entire operation, from the induction of anaesthesia onward.

Post-operatively, the patient was started on an oxycodone patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) regime. He exhibited intermittent tachycardia, hypertension, and low-grade pyrexia in the immediate post-operative period, which resolved following administration of an opioid bolus. The PCA was stopped at 8 hours post-operatively, as he was feeling nauseous after each bolus without any analgesic benefit.

As with the intravenous opioid, oral opioids and oral paracetamol in the immediate post-operative period successfully resolved the patient's tachycardia, blood pressure elevation, and pyrexia. His chest drain was removed one day after surgery, and he was discharged on the second post-operative day.

Four days after the surgery, the patient was readmitted because of fever, cough, and some small-volume purulent discharge from his drain site. A repeat chest x-ray was unremarkable, and a wound swab was negative. He was empirically treated with 24 hours of intravenous antibiotics and given a short, 4-day oral course to complete at home. The team felt that a lower threshold for treating infection would be appropriate, given his diagnosis of CIP. He was discharged one day after readmission and made a good recovery.

Histopathology of the lesion biopsy at the bifurcation of the right middle and lower lobe bronchus was consistent with metastatic synovial carcinoma. The same finding was reported for a nodule contained within the right upper lobe wedge. The histopathology of the lower lobe wedge was unremarkable.

He was referred back to the sarcoma multidisciplinary team and underwent radiotherapy for the lower lobe nodule.

“CIP encompasses a wide range of overlapping and poorly understood phenotypes. Patient analgesic requirements are likely to vary significantly from patient to patient, but opioids can be useful in controlling the autonomic response to painful stimuli,” the authors wrote.

Crafting the ideal patient progress note, at least judging from the literature, seems more easily achieved in theory than in execution. Since the late 2000s, when the electronic health record replaced pen and paper in chronicling a hospital patient's story, from entry to exit, senior physicians have struggled with house staff to make entries into the patient's record that actually mirror the patient's progress.

Various articles over the past 15 years have decried the condition of these notes, finding they contained unnecessary information and many inaccuracies — primarily because the note authors had copied and pasted prior input; this keyboard capability has been dubbed an “egregious danger.”

“These notes not only fail to reflect the orderly progression of thought and action…but also rarely provide clear documentation of the day's events,” authors of one study in The American Journal of Medicine wrote in 2009. About 5 years ago, the American College of Physicians chimed in: “At present, it is far too easy to open a patient chart, read volumes of data, and find that no single person has stated what they believe is happening.”

Other articles have attempted to create audit tools or best practice recommendations. (“Pulling in a full list of current medications is unlikely to improve the value of the note and may become outdated quickly depending on the timing of when a note is written.”) In 2019, JAMA Network Open published a California hospitals-based study that showed the significant disconnect between the number and type of exams that a group of nine emergency department trainees recorded as having completed and the actual number and type of exams that 12 observers witnessed either via direct audiovisual observation or by a review of the recorded observation. The agreement between what was actually recorded and observed was barely 50%. The observers, however, jibed with each other 90% of the time.

Contributing to the progress notes' bloat factor is how the hospitals use them, namely for coding, billing, and quality reporting. These entries make them legal documents and therefore the justified recipient of all non-care patient information. This extra information often obfuscates the point of the note's existence.

And it most likely negatively affects the person in the bed. “Poor notes negatively impact patient care,” wrote the authors of a new study conducted at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, and published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

Bottom line: It is finding the right balance — combining seasoned staff's clinical experience with the nearly innate tech know-how of incoming juniors — that has continued to elude all.

Refusing to accept that, Johns Hopkins' Samuel Durso, MD, MBA, executive vice chair, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, and director, Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, decided on a new tack for his study. He said in a recent interview that he had had enough of seeing poorly devised notes.

“Most of the time, you can't tell what is going on,” said Durso.

The Durso team took a different path for getting seasoned hospitalists to create readable, usable patient progress notes. They created a rubric with 15 gradable items, devised an educational intervention that was used when necessary, and included a control group. The total number of hospitalist participants was 26. The participants were all about 40 years old and had worked in hospital medicine for an average of about 9 years.

The study team rated 156 of the study participants' notes, taken 6 months prior to the educational instruction and after. The creation of the rubric was based on a literature review, 100 progress notes, the team's assessment of existing admissions notes, and peer feedback. The study results showed that progress-note quality improved if hospital physicians were guided via the rubric. P-value scores were significant in 8 of the 15 graded items.

Hospital physicians do not deliberately create poor progress notes, Durso said. “It's not because people are stupid or lazy; it's because hospital systems are set up a certain way,” he said.

As for what happens next, Durso said he is thinking about ways to maintain gains from the study results by “baking” them into the actual workday.

“We don't have that answer yet,” he said. “It takes people to do this and train them.” One option could be to use Johns Hopkins' existing artificial intelligence software to incorporate note quality.

He addressed the size of his study. “We didn't need this study to tell us we have a problem,” he said. His team wanted to see if it could design a plan that was workable in the Johns Hopkins environment “to give us an indication of whether the teaching method is effective.” 

The study also provided the methodology some credibility. “At least what we have shown is we can train people to improve their notes, with adjudication between observers.”

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has permeated nearly every sector of American healthcare in one way or another, from democratizing access to a variety of treatments by freeing up the inventory of provider time to developing cutting-edge new treatments that are sure to extend lives and deliver cures to intractable diseases. 

As such, one of the most tenuous passages along the medical journey for every hospital patient, the discharge process, has been among the first targets in the sights of healthcare technology teams in trying to better patient experience and outcomes while also reducing provider workloads. 

There's certainly no one-size-fits-all approach to implementing AI, but there is one statistic around which there's no argument: A 2023 study found that 50% of healthcare providers of all types are suffering from burnout, and similar statistics have been found in a panoply of other research. One of the factors contributing to this situation is a staffing crunch, which was highlighted in a 2024 infection-control study that found nearly 80% of the 390 hospitals in the study were understaffed. With metrics like these, freeing up the time of clinical personnel is a move toward better patient experience.

Here's a look at three approaches to using AI at this important point of care. 

The “capacity crisis” troubling the US health systems sparked the creation of Qventus' Inpatient Capacity Solution. First launched in 2012, and freshly updated last year, this system uses AI to predict optimal patient discharge timing as early as the first morning after admission; stage patient orders in a manner that flows toward achieving early discharge in all patients possible as evaluated on a whole-of-hospital basis; and automates discharge planning, relieving overtaxed clinical personnel of that administrative burden. 

“In use at dozens of hospitals in a wide variety of categories, this system touches more than half a million patients per year,” said Jason Cohen, Qventus' chief medical officer, inpatient. “Overall, we see that it drives up a 30% decrease in excess days, and a 10 times return on investment on average.” 

Cohen also pointed out a 2023 French study that identified a 40% higher risk for death for older adults who had to stay in the emergency department overnight prior to being admitted to the hospital, underscoring the need to ensure beds are available, especially for the most fragile populations.

“Transitions of care can be one of the most dangerous, difficult, and uncertain times in a patient's illness,” said Justin Schrager, MD, emergency physician and chief medical officer of Vital, an AI-powered patient experience company. “You would be hard-pressed to find an experienced clinician without a healthy fear of care transitions.”

Schrager noted that traditionally, most of these transitions have been extremely high touch, usually led by nurses, and focused as much on emotional support and spiritual benefits as empirical issues like medication reconciliation and parsing through discharge instructions. They tend to have a few other components in common, he said. 

“Generally, almost all of them require substantial personnel to manage and avoid a tech-first approach. Additionally, most focus on post-discharge optimization rather than pre-discharge interventions,” Schrager said. “As a technologist-physician, I see this situation as a truly great opportunity for automation that scales. But when I put on my physician-technologist hat, the key to success is personalization and utilization — something that healthcare technology has struggled with over the years.”

Vital's discharge planning works to integrate both worlds, taking all available medical data on the patient as well as their personal information and synthesizing it into a web app. The patient receives instructions via a text message, which links them directly over to the app. Arriving there, they fill out some personal information and are then presented with their care instructions in a visually-appealing user interface and written in plain language; next steps, including any referrals needed; name, address, and phone number of the location where medications have been sent; diagnosis information, including educational videos; access to hospital records, access to the hospital's existing patient portal system; and more.

“This technology can be used to ensure that patients and their family members understand what is being provided to them and make sure that the information provided is actually valuable and personalized,” Schrager said. “User-based design principles can be leveraged to cut (what's normally a) 10-page document down to a single page, accessible in all languages on a patient's or their family member's device, rewritten using AI to be reading-level appropriate and automatically detecting and surfacing care recommendations from the clinical team that should be present front-and-center.”

Sample outcomes in one study of use of the Vital product, at Dignity Health Arizona, a large healthcare provider within the CommonSpirit Health network, included 4.4-star average patient rating across emergency department and inpatient visits and a 50% improvement in patient experience.

The hospitals of Northwell Health, headquartered in New Hyde Park, New York, the state's largest health system, had a problem in common with those served by Qventus and Vital: overburdened, overstressed providers. 

In focusing on discharge planning, Jill Kalman, MD, Northwell's executive vice president, chief medical officer and deputy physician-in-chief, led the system to hone in on relieving those providers of some of their administrative work, and Northwell Health, in partnership with Aegis Systems, built a platform called Ascertain.

“Having started in a health system, Ascertain has a unique understanding of the complexities and needs of health systems and can seamlessly integrate with and reimagine the way their existing workflows operate,” Kalman said. In addition to health systems, Ascertain also has the ability to be deployed with payers and/or independent provider groups to handle administrative tasks such as documentation, prior authorizations, and compliance.

Kalman said that the platform has been generating strong results for Northwell, enabling nurses, case managers, social workers, and ancillary staff to focus more of their time on patient care rather than administrative tasks. At a time when burnout among healthcare professionals reaches almost half of all those working in the field, this is a crucial modification. 

“The fact is, healthcare workers are drowning in a sea of administrative burdens…Ascertain is helping enable more streamlined clinical workflows and therefore improving turnaround times, enabling clinicians to focus less on paperwork and more on patients,” Kalman said. “Ascertain empowers case managers by providing a single interface to manage communications with clinical teams and payers, surfacing the key medical information they need for conversations with patients and their loved ones, and automating time consuming, manual tasks such as form-filling and navigating portals, all to ensure that patients receive the right care at the right time.”

Citrate is essential for the metabolism and development of neurons. A membrane transport protein called SLC13A5 plays a central role in this process and has previously been linked to a particularly severe form of epileptic encephalopathy. Building on data from the recently completed RESOLUTE and REsolution flagship projects, scientists at CeMM have comprehensively studied the function and structure of the membrane transporter SLC13A5, experimentally investigating 38 mutant variants. Their findings, published in Science Advances (DOI 10.1126/sciadv.adx3011) shed new light on the mechanisms of this disease and lay the foundation for further research into epilepsy and other disorders.

Citrate, the negatively charged ion of citric acid, is a key component in the metabolism of every cell. In the citric acid cycle-often referred to as the ""hub"" of cellular metabolism-organic substances are broken down to generate chemical energy, while also producing various precursors for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and critical signaling molecules involved in inflammation and cell development.

In neurons, citrate plays an especially important role. As a so-called ""neuromodulator,"" it influences neuronal activity and is therefore present in relatively high concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid. Accordingly, neurons express high levels of the SLC13A5 transporter to facilitate citrate uptake. When this transporter is not fully functional, it can lead to SLC13A5 Citrate Transporter Disorder-a severe form of epilepsy associated with impaired brain development (scientifically referred to as developmental epileptic encephalopathy, DEE). This condition is caused by mutations in the SLC13A5 gene. However, until now, little was known about which mutations are involved, how they affect the molecular function of the transporter, and how they influence disease progression.

To address this knowledge gap, scientists at CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences performed a technique called ""deep mutational scanning"" (DMS), analyzing the effect of nearly ten thousand different genetic mutations on the function of the SLC13A5 transport protein. The dataset was further enriched by computational analyses of protein stability, and 38 mutated SLC13A5 variants were selected for experimental investigation. This approach revealed several molecular mechanisms linked to the manifestation of the disease. These included differences in transporter production levels in neurons, their precise localization in the cell membrane, and the actual rate of citrate transport.

""With these results, we were able to identify and characterize disease-causing variants of the SLC13A5 transporter,"" explains co-first author Wen-An Wang, summarizing the main findings of the study. ""In addition, by computationally analyzing the mutant variants, we assessed protein stability across different conformations and established an evolutionary conservation score for all variants,"" adds co-first author Evandro Ferrada, now at the University of Valparaíso in Chile.

Our work highlights the importance of systematically investigating the effects of genetic variants. Especially in rare diseases such as SLC13A5 citrate transporter deficiency, a specific form of epilepsy, this approach helps us uncover molecular disease mechanisms. At the same time, we gain valuable insights into the impact of variants that also occur in the general population – an important step toward a more comprehensive understanding of genetic diversity and its impact on human health.""

The scientists involved in the study were supported by the REsolution consortium, the successor to RESOLUTE-a large-scale project led by Giulio Superti-Furga at CeMM that functionally mapped the entire SLC transporter family and helped decode the ""logistics of the cell."" Patient data were provided by the TESS Research Foundation, which is dedicated to advancing research on SLC13A5 citrate transporter deficiency.

An international research team, including scientists from the Institut de Neurociències at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), has developed a new solution to reduce the immune response triggered by neural prosthetics used after limb amputations or severe nerve injuries. The approach consists of coating the electronic implants (which connect the prosthetic device to the patient's nervous system) with a potent anti-inflammatory drug. This coating helps the body better tolerate the implant, improving its long-term performance and stability.

Neural electrode implants are commonly used in prosthetics to restore communication between the device and the nervous system. However, their long-term effectiveness can be compromised by the body's natural immune reaction to foreign objects, which leads to the formation of scar tissue around the implant and can impair its function.

Now, a recent study published in Advanced Healthcare Materials by researchers from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, the Università di Ferrara, the University of Freiburg, and Chalmers University of Technology, conducted as part of the European collaborative project BioFINE, reports a novel method to improve the biocompatibility and chronic stability of these electrodes.

The technique involves activating and modifying the surface of polyimide (a material commonly used for implanted electrodes) using a chemical strategy that enables the covalent binding of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone. This innovation allows the drug to be released at the implant site slowly over at least two months, a critical period when the immune system typically mounts its strongest response.

Biological tests showed that this approach reduces inflammation-related signals in immune cells, while maintaining the material's biocompatibility and mechanical integrity. Animal testing further confirmed that the dexamethasone-releasing implants significantly reduce immune reactions and scar tissue formation around the device.

These findings suggest that the slow and localized release of dexamethasone from the implant surface could extend the functional lifespan of neural prostheses, offering a promising step forward in addressing the long-term challenges of implantable neurotechnology.

This is a main step that has to be complemented by the demonstration in vivo that this coating improves the functional performance of chronically implanted electrodes in the peripheral nerves, for stimulating and recording nerve signals.""

A new study finds that staying active for just over two hours a week can significantly tip the balance back to healthy blood sugar levels, highlighting how exercise, weight, and glycemic control collectively influence diabetes risk.

Study: Factors related to reversal of prediabetes in patients from a cardiovascular risk program during 2019 - 2023. Image Credit: Neirfy / Shutterstock

Engaging in physical activity for over 150 minutes per week can significantly reduce the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes, as reported in a recent study published in the journal Cardiovascular Diabetology – Endocrinology Reports.

Participants started with a median HbA1c of 5.9% – hovering just below the diabetes threshold and indicating their blood sugar control was already borderline at program entry.

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease that potentially increases the risk of various other health complications, including cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. A fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg/dL or higher, or a glycated hemoglobin level (a measure of glycemic control) of 6.5% or higher, is indicative of type 2 diabetes.

Prediabetes is an intermediate condition where blood glucose levels are higher than normal but lower than the diabetic range. A fasting blood glucose range of 100 to 125 mg/dL, or a glycated hemoglobin range of 5.7% to 6.4% is indicative of prediabetes. An oral glucose tolerance test result of 140–199 mg/dL after a 75g glucose load also qualifies as prediabetes according to ADA criteria.

Unhealthy lifestyle habits, including an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, are the major modifiable risk factors for both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Several studies have indicated that the timely implementation of lifestyle interventions, such as a low-carbohydrate diet and rigorous physical activity, can significantly reduce the risk of developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and delay or even reverse the progression from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes.

Several multidisciplinary cardiovascular risk programs have been initiated with the aim of reducing cardiovascular disease risk in prediabetic and diabetic patients through lifestyle interventions. Similarly, strategies to identify people predisposed to type 2 diabetes have been developed to reduce diabetes prevalence and improve management.

Monitoring prediabetes in structured cardiovascular risk programs is one such strategy, which may help identify factors associated with disease progression or reversal.

With the aim of promoting public health through these strategies, the current study was designed to identify factors associated with the reversion of prediabetes to normoglycemia (normal blood glucose level) in adult individuals living with prediabetes.

The study involved a total of 130 prediabetic adults who participated in a cardiovascular risk program at a referral center in Cali, Colombia, between 2019 and 2023. Medical records of participants were analyzed to obtain information on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. All participants received quarterly, multidisciplinary assessments including internal medicine, nutrition, psychology, and physiotherapy. Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Dietary guidance was individualized, and a weight loss goal of 7% was targeted for overweight or obese individuals.

The program used a specific insulin resistance marker called the glucose/triglyceride index (calculated as Ln((Triglycerides × Glucose)/2)), finding higher values linked to lower reversal chances.

The evaluation of prediabetic adults revealed that reversion of prediabetes to normoglycemia occurred in 21.5% of cases, prediabetes persisted in 64.6% of cases, and progression to type 2 diabetes occurred in 13.8% of cases over the 366-day study follow-up period.

The study identified age, body mass index (BMI), and glycated hemoglobin as potent predictors of the probability of prediabetes to normoglycemia reversion in the initial (bivariate) analysis. Participants aged 60 years or above, those with a BMI of over 25, and individuals with a glycated hemoglobin level of over 6% had a 59%, 67%, and 74% lower probability of restoring their normal blood glucose levels, respectively. However, in the final (multivariate) model, only BMI and glycated hemoglobin remained statistically significant predictors of reversion, while age was not significant after adjustment for other factors.

Among modifiable risk factors, physical activity exhibited a significant positive impact, and glycated hemoglobin and BMI exhibited a negative effect on the likelihood of reversing prediabetes to normoglycemia. Performing physical activity for at least 150 minutes per week (as validated by the IPAQ) was found to increase the probability by 4.15 times. In contrast, a glycated hemoglobin level of over 6% and a BMI of over 25 were found to reduce the likelihood by 86% and 75%, respectively.

Additionally, the study assessed the glucose/triglyceride index as a marker of insulin resistance, finding that a higher index was associated with a lower likelihood of prediabetes reversal. This marker may be a cost-effective tool for risk assessment in resource-limited settings.

The study highlights the importance of engaging in regular physical activity in reducing the risk of prediabetes progressing to type 2 diabetes. According to the study findings, excessive body weight gain and poor glycemic control are the two major factors that can significantly prevent the reversion of prediabetes to normoglycemia in prediabetic adults.

The participants in this study underwent specialist-conducted periodic assessment sessions in internal medicine, nutrition, psychology, and physiotherapy, and received group education from healthcare professionals. These non-pharmacological strategies are known to have a significant positive impact on disease management and health promotion. The program included quarterly clinical and laboratory evaluations, as well as ongoing education on healthy eating, physical activity, and cardiovascular risk management.

High hypertension prevalence (80.8%) characterized the cohort, reinforcing that prediabetes rarely exists in isolation from other cardiovascular risks.

Prediabetes is a preventable health condition that can be cost-effectively managed through non-pharmacological initiatives, including educational interventions, multidisciplinary follow-up, weight loss plans, nutritional recommendations, and physical activity training. The current study findings support this notion and contribute to public health management programs.

Glycated hemoglobin is a reliable marker of glycemic control over the preceding three months, considered a better predictor of cardiometabolic risk compared to other markers of glycemic control, such as fasting blood glucose levels. The study defined reversal to normoglycemia based on an HbA1c level of less than 5.7% and a fasting plasma glucose level of less than 100 mg/dL, using these as primary outcome criteria. Using this reliable marker, the current study reports that maintaining glycated hemoglobin levels at 6% or less can be beneficial for prediabetic adults in terms of restricting disease progression.

Overall, the scientific evidence provided by the study regarding factors associated with prediabetes persistence and progression would facilitate policymakers in developing policies aimed at reducing disease burden and promoting public health. However, as a single-center, retrospective study with a relatively short follow-up period, the findings should be interpreted with caution regarding their generalizability.

More population-based, large-scale studies with longer follow-up durations are needed to further expand these findings and more conclusively understand the causal association of these factors with diabetes management.

A quick nap with deep N2 sleep could unlock hidden insights, as scientists find brainwave patterns during sleep best predict those breakthrough moments.

Study: N2 sleep promotes the occurrence of ‘aha' moments in a perceptual insight task. Image Credit: Hlib Shabashnyi / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal PLOS Biology, researchers found a role for sleep stage 2 (N2) and aperiodic neural activity in insight.

An insight, or “aha moment,” is a unique learning phenomenon that attracts significant research interest. The neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying insight have been described as restructuring existing task representations. Insight is often characterized by three key features: 1) an abrupt, nonlinear increase in task performance, 2) a variable, spontaneous delay before insight occurs, and 3) a selective occurrence in some individuals.

Sleep is a potential factor that facilitates the occurrence of insight. One study suggested that a full night's sleep is beneficial for insight and found that more than twice as many participants had insight into a hidden rule of a task after sleep. However, other studies found no beneficial effect of sleep on insight.

These divergent findings may be due to specific sleep stages differentially influencing insight. For example, an influential 2021 study by Lacaux and colleagues suggested that N1 sleep, the lightest stage of sleep, was a ""creative sweet spot"" for gaining insight.

Moreover, distinct cognitive tasks benefit differently from sleep. The current study specifically employed a perceptual insight task (the Perceptual Spontaneous Strategy Switch Task, PSSST), in contrast to the mathematical tasks used in some previous research, which may influence how sleep stages affect insight.

In the present study, researchers investigated the links between insight and different sleep stages in a preregistered conceptual replication of the work by Lacaux et al. They recruited individuals aged 18-35 with a normal sleep-wake cycle and without color blindness, learning difficulty, or sleep disorders. Participants performed a perceptual insight task before and after a brief nap.

Participants were presented with a stimulus of purple or orange dots that moved in one of the four orthogonal directions. Dot motion exhibited varying noise levels across trials, making motion judgment relatively easier or more complicated in different trials. The primary task consisted of nine blocks, each comprising 100 trials, during which participants were required to press a button in response to the displayed stimulus and observe the resulting feedback.

Only stimulus motion correlated with correct response in the first three blocks. After 3.5 blocks, stimulus color also began to predict the correct response. Participants were allowed a 20-minute nap after four blocks, during which sleep and brain activity were monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). Subsequently, participants completed the remaining five blocks.

The subtle change in task structure from the middle of the fourth block provided a hidden opportunity to improve strategy through insight. Further, insight was tracked by monitoring rapid increases in performance on high-noise trials. Performance on high-noise trials was stable before the task structure was modified. A sudden shift to high accuracy on high-noise trials could indicate (gaining) insight about the color-based strategy.

Notably, 15 subjects gained insight before the nap and were excluded from analysis. EEG data quality precluded sleep classification for seven cases. As such, 68 subjects were included in post-nap data analysis. Of these, 48 participants (70.6%) had an abrupt, nonlinear improvement in performance post-nap and were stratified as insight participants.

Insight subjects had significantly higher mean accuracy across trial types and lower reaction times by the first half of block 8. The authors suggest that this indicates the nap period improved insight, as the 70.6% insight rate is substantially higher than the 49.5% rate observed in a previous study by the same group, which used a similar task but had no delay period. However, the authors also note the important caveat that the study did ""not present a randomized manipulation of sleep, awake rest, and no rest.""

Further, participants were stratified into three groups according to their vigilance state during rest: no sleep, sleep stage 1 (N1), or N2 sleep. Eighteen individuals were awake during rest, 22 reached N1 sleep, and 28 reached N2 sleep.

About 85.7% of the N2 sleep group gained insight, while 63.6% of the N1 sleep group gained insight. In contrast, only 55.5% of those who were awake gained insight. Contrary to the previous findings, the study aimed to replicate the results; however, it found no evidence that N1 sleep promotes insight. Instead, the researchers explored whether N2 sleep was the primary driver of insight. Fisher's exact test indicated significantly higher insight prevalence following N2 sleep than without sleep. Results did not change when subjects with short N2 sleep episodes were excluded.

Notably, while the prevalence of insight was increased with N2 sleep, there was no impact on insight features (abruptness, delay, and selectivity). This means that N2 sleep increased the frequency of insight but did not change how abruptly, selectively, or with what delay insight occurred in those who experienced it. While the primary hypotheses about sleep stages were preregistered, further exploratory analyses examined the associations between aperiodic neural activity and insight, as prior studies suggested that regularization and noise facilitate abrupt, sudden performance changes (characterizing insight) and have been associated with aperiodic activity.

As such, aperiodic neural activity during the entire nap period was quantified by the spectral slope of the EEG power spectrum. The spectral slope was associated with stages of sleep and was the flattest in the no-sleep group and steepest in the N2 sleep group. Importantly, statistical model comparisons revealed that the spectral slope alone was the best standalone predictor of insight, subsuming the effect of sleep stage itself.

Finally, the team found that the spectral slope alone best predicts insight, rather than sleep stage or the combination of spectral slope and sleep stage. However, analyses on oscillatory activity showed no correlations with insight.

In summary, the findings suggest a beneficial effect of N2 sleep on the likelihood of insight. The spectral slope of the EEG power spectrum explained additional variance in the likelihood of insight beyond sleep stages and was the strongest individual predictor in statistical models. Thus, aperiodic neural activity but not oscillatory activity was the additional factor promoting insight. Since the spectral slope becomes steeper with sleep and predicts insight beyond sleep stages alone, deeper sleep may be necessary for insight.

The authors speculate that processes occurring in deeper sleep, such as synaptic downscaling (a form of neural regularization), may help create a ""clean slate"" that allows participants to more easily discover the hidden, optimal strategy after the nap. Future studies may evaluate the effect of a full night of sleep and different non-perceptual or non-mathematical tasks.

Children who consume the most low-calorie sweeteners aren't cutting as much sugar as hoped, raising concerns that these “healthier” products may reinforce poorer dietary habits.

A recent European Journal of Nutrition study examines the association between LCS product consumption and intakes of total energy, water, ultra-processed food and beverages (UPFB), and free sugars among UK children aged 4 to 18 years.

Excessive free sugar intake is associated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular events. A previous study estimated that UK children consume approximately 12% of their total dietary energy intake from free sugars, which is almost twice the UK Government and World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of 5%.

Younger children dominated high LCS consumption. Children in the High-LCS group averaged 9 years old, significantly younger than non-consumers (11 years) and showing early dietary patterning.

In the UK, one in three children aged 10 to 11 years is of an unhealthy weight. To address this, increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been a key point of intervention. To reduce obesity among children, several policies, including the Soft Drinks Industry Levy and the sugar reduction program, have been implemented to reduce the sugar content in foods and beverages. However, these strategies promoted LCS products that contain saccharin, sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and steviol glycosides as lower-sugar alternatives.

Although randomized controlled trials have indicated short-term advantages of substituting sugar-sweetened beverages with LCS alternatives in obese adults regarding weight reduction, longitudinal observational studies have presented contradictory results. Longitudinal studies have associated LCS consumption with increased risk of cancer, obesity, adverse cardiometabolic outcomes, and mortality.

The underlying mechanism by which LCS consumption increases the risk of cardiometabolic disorders is poorly understood. Scientists have proposed that early-life exposure to LCS may have influenced the physiological processes of sweet-taste response, eating patterns, and appetite during growth and development. LCS could cause gut microbial dysbiosis and induce low-grade inflammation, leading to impaired glucose metabolism and an increased risk of obesity.

It is essential to understand how LCS product consumption affects overall dietary patterns, which include both ultra-processed and minimally processed foods. This information will help policymakers to focus on strategies to improve dietary quality and healthy weight in children.

The current study hypothesized that higher levels of LCS product consumption lead to the formation of less favorable dietary patterns, characterized by the inclusion of higher levels of ultra-processed foods and lower levels of minimally processed foods. To test the hypothesis, data were collected from the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS) between 2008 and 2019, a nationally representative dietary survey.

The current study categorized 140 items as LCS products, which were consumed by NDNS participants. For each participant, the daily concentration of LCS products consumed was estimated relative to the total amount of food and beverages consumed.

Participants were assigned to four groups based on their concentration of LCS product consumption, including No-LCS, Low-LCS (less than 6.8% g/d), Mid-LCS (between 6.9% and 17.4% g/d), and High-LCS groups (above 17.4% g/d).

Stark ethnic differences emerged. 97% of high LCS consumers identified as White in 2008/09, versus 81% in the non-LCS group, revealing cultural or socioeconomic influences on dietary choices.

A total of 5,922 children were included in this study, with a median age of 10 years. Approximately 49.2% of the study cohort consisted of boys, 89.0% were of White ethnicity, and 64.9% had a normal body mass index (BMI). More than 36% of the participants belonged to the lowest household income tertile.

In comparison to other groups, children in the High-LCS group were younger and more likely to be of White ethnicity. Across survey years, the proportional distribution of children in each group, the LCS consumption characteristics, and the mean LCS intake have remained relatively unchanged in all study groups.

Between 2008 and 2009, 70.4% of participants had consumed LCS products, with a mean daily intake of 256.5 g. No significant change in prevalence and mean intake of LCS products was observed across the study period. Interestingly, between 2008 and 2009, a gradient of lower water intake was observed with increasing levels of LCS consumption.

In comparison to non-LCS product consumers, higher LCS product users tended to have lower intake of water, non-LCS ultra-processed beverages, and minimally processed beverages. While high LCS consumers initially had lower free sugar intake, this difference was no longer statistically significant by the end of the study period, showing a trend convergence over time.

The total energy intake for the Low-LCS and High-LCS groups showed a decline, with incremental yearly reductions of 14.8 kcal/day and 12.3 kcal/day, respectively, compared with the No-LCS group. Therefore, compared to non-LCS product users, a decline in total energy intake was observed among the highest consumers of LCS products.

Interestingly, all LCS consumption groups exhibited a declining trend in UPFB consumption over the study period. However, this positive trend was less pronounced in the High-LCS group. Similarly, the increase in minimally processed food and water intake over the 11 years was slowest in the High-LCS group, indicating a persistent and widening relative gap in dietary quality.

LCS consumers swapped beverage risks for food risks. While high LCS users drank fewer sugary beverages, they compensated with more ultra-processed non-beverage foods like snacks and ready meals – a dietary trade-off.

The current study demonstrated that higher LCS product consumption was not consistently associated with lower free sugar intake in children, as the initial benefit disappeared over time. Furthermore, the findings showed that while all children's diets improved in some ways, the improvements were slowest for children consuming the most LCS products. This indicates that these products may be part of a broader, less healthy dietary pattern and that their promotion represents a potential missed opportunity to encourage greater water consumption. In the future, more comprehensive research is needed to understand current dietary patterns and their impact on children.

The authors note several limitations, including the use of cross-sectional data, which prevents tracking individual dietary changes over time. They also point to the potential for residual confounding from unmeasured lifestyle factors and a possible underestimation of LCS intake due to the survey's data collection methods.

A sweeping analysis finds promising links between food choices and endometriosis risk, but doctors say dietary tweaks are no substitute for proven care.

Diet and Endometriosis: An Umbrella Review. Image Credit: Andrii Zastrozhnov / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journal Food, researchers in Italy evaluated whether specific dietary components can reduce the risk of or alleviate symptoms from endometriosis.

Notably, this research used an umbrella review methodology, synthesizing evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses to provide an overview of the relationship between diet and endometriosis.

High-fat dairy unexpectedly showed protective effects, reducing endometriosis risk despite its saturated fat content, suggesting components like calcium or vitamin D might counteract potential negatives.

Every ten United States (US) women who menstruate, one endures endometriosis, a misplaced-tissue disorder stealing productive years and fertility. Annual direct and indirect costs now rival those of diabetes, yet pain and infertility persist. Patients scour social media for food fixes, but headlines conflict: spinach is praised one week, and coffee is blamed the next.

Observational designs, tiny samples, and inconsistent intake definitions cloud guidance. Meanwhile, the global prevalence continues to climb as diagnostic delays persist for more than seven years. Because nutrition is modifiable, reliable synthesis could empower women to shop strategically and experience fewer health issues.

Further research is needed, specifically well-designed randomized trials that can turn clinical clues into clear treatment guidance.

Reviewers conducted an umbrella review in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual for Evidence Synthesis and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to September 30, 2024, for systematic reviews evaluating any dietary exposure among women with surgically or clinically confirmed endometriosis. Only reviews reporting human outcomes and full-text articles were eligible.

Titles and abstracts were screened in Rayyan, and methodological rigor was assessed using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR2); reviews scoring ≤5 in critical domains were excluded. Relative Risk (RR), Odds Ratio (OR), and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were extracted.

A random-effects meta-analysis in the Jamovi Metaumbrella module generated pooled estimates, heterogeneity via the I-squared statistic, tests for excess significance, and small-study effects using Egger regression.

Evidence certainty was graded across five classes, with class I indicating the strongest support. Disagreements were settled by consensus with a third investigator, and the protocol was preregistered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. No patient data were collected; therefore, ethical approval was unnecessary.

Cheese emerged as a standout protector, with women consuming it facing 30% lower diagnosis odds compared to low-intake groups in the strongest finding.

The search retrieved 1,169 unique records, and after removing duplicates and quality screening, ten systematic reviews remained, covering more than 120,000 women from Asia, North America, Europe, and Oceania.

According to the umbrella review, three reviews met every AMSTAR2 critical domain; the rest lacked protocol registration or funding disclosure, but none failed the risk-of-bias threshold. Heterogeneity for red meat analyses reached 82%, indicating substantial epidemiologic variability.

Vegetables produced the clearest protective signal. Women in the highest intake category had 41% lower odds of an endometriosis diagnosis compared to those in the lowest category (pooled RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.49-0.71).

Total dairy products followed: the umbrella review's pooled estimate showed an RR of 0.874, with a 95% CI of 0.81-0.95, while one included meta-analysis (Qi et al.) found an RR of 0.83, with a 95% CI of 0.74-0.93.

Cheese alone conferred a 16% advantage, and high-fat milk retained its benefit after fat stratification, suggesting that calcium, vitamin D, and butyric acid may outweigh concerns about saturated lipids.

Conversely, butter raised the risk by 27% (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.03-1.55), and high caffeine intake (>300 mg/day, roughly equivalent to three large filtered coffees) increased the risk by 30% (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.62). A broader definition of caffeine exposure still produced a 13% elevation (RR 1.13).

Of note, the results for trans fatty acids were ambiguous: while most evidence suggests that saturated and trans fats are harmful, one meta-analysis showed a possible protective association for trans fatty acids, a finding that the umbrella review described as “inexplicable” and in need of further investigation. Saturated and trans fatty acids trended harmful, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids and fish were neutral or mildly favorable, although CIs crossed unity.

Just 3+ daily servings of total dairy (milk, yogurt, cheese) was linked to a measurable drop in endometriosis risk, highlighting achievable dietary adjustments.

The review also highlighted the limited number of studies examining dietary supplements, such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and probiotics, with some evidence suggesting that these may reduce endometriosis-related pain; however, the findings remain heterogeneous and inconclusive.

Despite consistent directions, certainty for every association remained class IV (“weak”) because all source studies were observational and seldom used harmonized intake cut-offs or adjusted for confounders such as smoking or body mass index. Tests for excess significance suggested that positive findings might be overrepresented; however, sensitivity analyses excluding lower-quality reviews did not materially shift the pooled magnitudes or directions.

From a public health standpoint, the discussion section suggests that these numbers could translate into meaningful savings; however, no specific population-level projections were calculated in the review.

Because vegetables and affordable dairy foods are widely available, the findings offer an accessible starting point for symptom management while women await specialist care. However, clinicians should frame advice as low-risk experimentation, rather than a proven therapy; large, prospective dietary trials remain essential before firm guidelines can be issued.

Future work should standardize dietary assessment and oversample diverse populations, thereby clarifying whether observed changes reflect causal biology or systemic bias.

Additionally, the umbrella review discusses the possible role of yogurt and probiotics in positively influencing the gut microbiome, which may have relevance for symptom management, although evidence is still emerging.

Butter stood out as the clearest dietary risk, increasing endometriosis likelihood by 27% even after accounting for other fats and foods.

To summarize, evidence synthesized from ten systematic reviews suggests that diet probably influences endometriosis, yet certainty is low. Consistently, an abundant intake of vegetables and routine dairy consumption are associated with reduced odds, whereas butter and high caffeine appear to be detrimental.

Findings regarding trans fatty acids remain inconclusive and warrant further research. These patterns align with biological theories that involve oxidative stress, inflammation, and estrogen signaling, rendering them plausible despite observational limitations.

Because vegetables, yogurt, and milk are affordable, clinicians may recommend them as low-risk self-management tools while emphasizing that they do not replace established medical care. Dietary supplements and probiotics may offer additional benefits for some individuals, but further research is needed before firm recommendations can be made.

A global analysis reveals that bacteria in food animals and humans are sharing resistance genes through the use of agricultural antibiotics, highlighting an urgent need to rethink farm drug regulations.

In a recent article published in mSphere, researchers examined the global distribution of ionophore resistance conferred by two genes, narA and narB, and their genetic linkages to genes associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR). They found that 2,442 bacterial isolates from 51 countries contained narAB, often in conjunction with genes that confer resistance to critical human antibiotics. These results highlight the significant risks of co-selection for human-relevant AMR through the use of ionophores in agriculture.

Over 500 human carriers. The study identified narAB in human-derived isolates across multiple continents, directly challenging regulatory assumptions that these genes stay confined to farm environments.

Ionophores are antibiotics commonly used in animal agriculture, primarily as anti-coccidials in poultry and for growth promotion in cattle and swine. In 2022, they accounted for 37% of antibiotics used in U.S. food-producing animals.

Because ionophores are not used in human medicine due to toxicity, they are classified as low-risk for contributing to human AMR and are less stringently regulated than other antibiotics.

However, recent studies have raised concerns that ionophores could indirectly promote AMR through co-selection. This can occur in two ways: through physical linkage, where the genes are located near each other on the same piece of DNA (like a plasmid), or when they are present in the same genome of a largely clonal bacterial species. One focus has been on the narAB operon in Enterococcus faecium, which provides resistance to several ionophores and has been found on plasmids carrying vancomycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline resistance genes.

Co-selection could occur if such genes are transferred together, even in the absence of direct antibiotic pressure from MIAs. For example, a decline in vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus was observed in Norway after the use of ionophores in poultry ceased. Despite these signals, the full geographic spread and the consistency of AMR associations of narAB have remained largely unquantified.

Resistance beyond expectations, narAB-positive isolates carried resistance to last-resort drugs like daptomycin through mutations (liaR E75K), not just common antibiotics.

To address this knowledge gap, researchers used a publicly available global dataset to assess how widespread narAB is and to what extent it is genetically linked to clinically relevant AMR genes. The search focused on annotated bacterial genomes containing narA, and only isolates also containing narB were retained, resulting in 2,442 qualifying genomes. These were analyzed for host organism (such as human, poultry, or cattle), bacterial species, associated AMR genes, and country of origin.

To assess the potential for co-selection, the team measured the frequency with which narAB-positive genomes also contained resistance genes or mutations associated with MIAs. They calculated the average number of resistance genes and mutations per genome. They used statistical association tests to determine if particular AMR determinants were more likely to occur in narAB-positive isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Genes and point mutations with strong associations were flagged as potential evidence of co-selection.

The researchers also visualized the geographic spread and host species using maps and bubble plots, summarizing the prevalence of narAB in different bacterial species and host organisms, including humans. Their analysis focused on presence/absence trends, given uneven global sampling, and did not attempt to compare prevalence across countries.



Distribution of narA/B. (A) World map showing the geographic distribution of narAB. (B) Distribution of narAB amongst bacterial and host species. Bubble size is proportional to the number of detected isolates. Four bacterial species are excluded due to total sample sizes of less than 5 (Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria innocua, and Streptococcus agalactiae).

Four additional species (Campylobacter, Clostridium, etc.) showed narAB signals but were excluded from analysis due to small sample sizes, suggesting broader potential spread.

The study found narAB genes in 2,442 bacterial isolates from 51 countries, demonstrating global presence across all continents except Antarctica. The genes were identified in 10 bacterial species, predominantly Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium.

Isolates came from diverse hosts, including humans, cattle, swine, and poultry, and over 500 human-derived isolates carried narAB, challenging the assumption that these genes are limited to non-human contexts and underscoring the interconnectedness of human and animal health.

Genomic analysis revealed that narAB-positive isolates contained an average of 8.26 additional AMR genes and 2.13 point mutations conferring resistance. Common AMR genes included ermB (erythromycin resistance), tet(M) (tetracycline resistance), and aac(6′)-I (aminoglycoside resistance). Mutations associated with resistance to drugs like daptomycin and ampicillin were also detected.

In E. faecalis, 13 AMR genes, including all vanA cluster genes (linked to vancomycin resistance), showed strong positive associations with narAB. In E. faecium, narAB was associated with 11 AMR genes and 4 resistance-linked mutations.

These findings reveal a strong statistical pattern suggestive of co-selection, where ionophore resistance genes are genetically linked to AMR genes relevant to human health. The evidence supports the idea that ionophore use in agriculture may unintentionally select for broader AMR, including resistance to critically important antibiotics.

Funding transparency matters. This research received support from both Perdue Farms and a Canadian government grant, a reminder that industry collaboration can drive critical AMR surveillance.

This study challenges the long-standing assumption that the use of ionophores in livestock is unrelated to human antimicrobial resistance risks. The widespread detection of narAB in multiple countries, bacterial species, and even human-derived isolates suggests that ionophore resistance is not confined to animal agriculture.

The consistent genetic associations between narAB and resistance to medically important antibiotics, especially in Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, highlight how genetic linkage provides a clear pathway for co-selection, where ionophore use may indirectly promote clinically relevant AMR.

A key strength of the study is its global scope, using a large publicly available dataset to provide comprehensive genomic and geographic insights. However, uneven sampling limits the comparative assessment of prevalence across countries. Additionally, although the study reveals associations between narAB and AMR genes, it cannot definitively establish causality or the primary directionality of gene transfer; however, transfer from farm animals to humans appears most likely.

Overall, the findings suggest ionophore use may pose an underrecognized AMR risk, emphasizing the need to reconsider how such antibiotics are regulated and highlighting that even drugs not used in human medicine can contribute to the broader AMR crisis.

In a multi-institutional study published in Science Direct, researchers revealed that testing urine-based tumor DNA (utDNA) can help predict which bladder cancer patients are at higher risk for recurrence after treatment.

This study analyzed utDNA from patients in the SWOG S1605 trial, who were treated with atezolizumab, an immunotherapy drug. Researchers used the UroAmp test to examine urine samples from 89 patients at the start of treatment and from 77 patients three months later. The goal was to see if utDNA could help identify which bladder cancer patients are most likely to respond to immunotherapy.

This approach could help improve patient care by guiding more effective treatments and supporting more personalized plans. It means we may be able to tailor therapy sooner, reduce unnecessary delays and help patients avoid major surgery without compromising the quality of their care.""

Robert Svatek, MD, MSCI, professor and chair of urology at the Joe R. and Teresa Lozano Long School of Medicine at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio)

 A nationally recognized urologic oncologist with the Mays Cancer Center at UT Health San Antonio, Svatek is the leading expert in bladder cancer and a member of SWOG, also known as Southwest Oncology Group. SWOG is part of the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and one of the five leading cancer clinical trial groups in the United States.

The SWOG S1605 study was a phase 2 clinical trial testing atezolizumab in patients with high-risk bladder cancer that didn't respond to BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin) treatment, the main immunotherapy to treat early-stage bladder cancer.

 Samples were collected from participants before treatment and again three months later. Researchers used the UroAmp assay, a non-invasive urine test that detects bladder cancer–related mutations, to analyze utDNA and generate a genomic profile for each patient.

They found that utDNA levels were linked to how well patients responded after six months and how long they stayed cancer-free over 18 months. Patients with positive utDNA results were less likely to respond and more likely to have their cancer return.

According to the American Cancer Society, bladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer in the United States, with more than 83,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Of these cases, approximately 75% are non–muscle invasive, meaning the cancer has not yet invaded the bladder muscle.

Patients who don't respond to immunotherapy may face the difficult decision of either continuing therapies that spare the bladder but carry high risks of recurrence or undergo major surgery that removes the bladder and profoundly impacts one's quality of life.

This study offers new hope for patients with high-risk bladder cancer by showing that a urine-based DNA test can help predict who is more likely to benefit from immunotherapy. By identifying treatment response early, this approach could guide more personalized, bladder-preserving care and reduce the need for major surgery.

Ribosomes are tiny molecular machines inside all living cells that build proteins, and ribosome biogenesis is the complex, multi-step process by which they are made.

During brain development, neural stem cell proliferation relies on active ribosome biogenesis to meet high protein demand. This process involves the concerted action of numerous ribosomal RNA processing factors and assembly proteins. Studies have shown that precise regulation of ribosome biogenesis is essential for normal brain development and tumor prevention.

N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is a widespread post-transcriptional modification in eukaryotes that plays crucial roles in tissue development and homeostasis. However, the mechanisms underlying cellular adaptation to m6A modification and their impact on protein synthesis machinery have not been well understood.

In a study published in Science Advances, a collaborative team led by Prof. ZHOU Tao from the Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof. SHEN Bin from Nanjing Medical University has revealed that VIRMA, a protein highly expressed in the embryonic brain and various cancers, regulates brain development by modulating ribosome biogenesis.

VIRMA is an evolutionarily conserved core scaffold protein within the m6A methyltransferase complex and is its largest component. Using conditional knockout mice and neural stem cell models, the researchers explored the role of VIRMA in brain development through comprehensive biochemical analyses and multi-omics sequencing.

Through RNA and m6A sequencing and proteomics analysis, the researchers revealed that VIRMA depletion led to a significant reduction in m6A levels on mRNA, directly impacting the expression of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Specifically, VIRMA depletion prolonged the half-lives of mRNA involved in ribosome biogenesis, thereby impairing key steps in this process. Consequently, it triggered a p53-dependent stress response, disrupted global protein translation, and impaired cell growth and proliferation. These disruptions ultimately resulted in severe developmental defects.

To evaluate the broader relevance of these findings, the researchers performed preliminary analyses using human breast cancer (MCF7) and cervical cancer (HeLa) cell models. They observed comparable defects in ribosome biogenesis in VIRMA-depleted cancer cells, suggesting a potential conservation of this regulatory mechanism across cell types.

This study expands the understanding of the complex regulatory networks that govern protein synthesis and underscores the critical role of mRNA modifications in fine-tuning essential cellular processes.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New yeast model sheds light on proteasome and mitochondrial interaction","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250630/New-yeast-model-sheds-light-on-proteasome-and-mitochondrial-interaction.aspx","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 11:23:00 GMT","

A study by the Center for Redox Processes in Biomedicine (Redoxoma) led by Marilene Demasi from the Butantan Institute (São Paulo, Brazil) presents a valuable new experimental model for investigating the interaction between the proteasome and mitochondrial function. In eukaryotic cells, the proteasome is a protein complex responsible for eliminating damaged and nonfunctional proteins, thereby helping to maintain cellular balance and proper functioning.

In recent years, studies have revealed that the proteasome and mitochondria are more closely connected than previously thought. The proteasome plays a role in the quality control of proteins destined for the mitochondria, while mitochondrial metabolism affects the efficiency with which proteins marked for destruction are degraded.

Redoxoma, a Research, Innovation and Dissemination Center (RIDC) of FAPESP based at the University of São Paulo's Institute of Chemistry (IQ-USP) conducted research focusing on the effects of proteasome dysfunction in the C76S mutant strain of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The study revealed that deficiency in this system leads to increased mitochondrial oxidative stress. This was evidenced by increased hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release and a lower peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) concentration. Prx1 is a crucial enzyme in the removal of peroxides. In mammals, mitochondrial Prx3 is equivalent to Prx1 in yeast.

The most important thing about this work is that we've a yeast strain that can serve as a model for investigating proteasome deficiency in relation to mitochondrial metabolism, a model that didn't yet exist in the literature.""

Marilene Demasi, Butantan Institute

The study was published in an article in the journal Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics.

The researchers are now working to understand why Prx1 levels decrease in cells with compromised proteasomes. ""We don't yet know if there was a decrease in Prx1 gene expression, which is possible, since the proteasome also plays a role in gene transcription regulation, or if the protein oxidizes more. It may hyperoxidize and, as a result, be degraded more. Perhaps the excess peroxide is promoting its continuous degradation,"" says the researcher at the Butantan Institute.

To answer these questions, the group plans to conduct comparative transcriptome and proteomic analyses of the wild and mutant strains cultivated under respiratory conditions. The goal is to establish this strain as a model for studying the role of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in cell metabolism.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","In a first, Trump and GOP-led Congress prepare to swell ranks of U.S. uninsured","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250630/In-a-first-Trump-and-GOP-led-Congress-prepare-to-swell-ranks-of-US-uninsured.aspx","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 10:48:00 GMT","

Last September, Alton Fry went to the doctor concerned he had high blood pressure. The trip would result in a prostate cancer diagnosis.

So began the stress of trying to pay for tens of thousands of dollars in treatment — without health insurance.

""I've never been sick in my life, so I've never needed insurance before,"" said Fry, a 54-year-old self-employed masonry contractor who restores old buildings in the rural Appalachian community he's called home nearly all his life.

Making sure he had insurance was the last thing on his mind, until recently, Fry said. He had been rebuilding his life after a prison stay, maintaining his sobriety, restarting his business, and remarrying his wife. ""Things got busy,"" he said.

Now, with a household income of about $48,000, Fry and his wife earn too much to qualify for Georgia's limited Medicaid expansion. And he said he found that the health plans sold on the state's Affordable Care Act exchange were too expensive or the coverage too limited.

In late April, a friend launched a crowdfunding campaign to help Fry cover some of the costs. To save money, Fry said, he's taking a less aggressive treatment route than his doctor recommended.

""There is no help for middle-class America,"" he said.

More than 26 million Americans lacked health insurance in the first six months of 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The uninsured are mostly low-income adults under age 65, and people of color, and most live in the South and West. The uninsured rate in the 10 states that, like Georgia, have not expanded Medicaid to nearly all low-income adults was 14.1% in 2023, compared with 7.6% in expansion states, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.

Health policy researchers expect the number of uninsured to swell as the second Trump administration and a GOP-controlled Congress try to enact policies that explicitly roll back health coverage for the first time since the advent of the modern U.S. health system in the early 20th century.

Under the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" — budget legislation that would achieve some of President Donald Trump's priorities, like extending tax cuts mainly benefiting the wealthy — some 10.9 million Americans would lose health insurance by 2034, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office based on a House version of the budget bill.

A Senate version of the bill could result in more people losing Medicaid coverage, with reductions in federal spending and rules that would make it harder for people to qualify. But that bill suffered a major blow June 26 when the Senate parliamentarian, a nonpartisan official who enforces the chamber's rules, rejected several health provisions — including the proposal to gradually reduce provider taxes, a mechanism that nearly every state uses to increase its federal Medicaid funding.

The number could rise to 16 million if proposed rule changes to the ACA take effect and tax credits that help people pay for ACA plans expire at the end of the year, according to the CBO. In KFF poll results released in June, nearly two-thirds of people surveyed viewed the bill unfavorably and more than half said they were worried federal funding cuts would hurt their family's ability to obtain and afford health care.

Like Fry, more people would be forced to pay for health expenses out-of-pocket, leading to delays in care, lost access to needed doctors and medications, and poorer physical and financial health.

""The effects could be catastrophic,"" said Jennifer Tolbert, deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.

The House-passed bill would represent the largest reduction in federal support for Medicaid and health coverage in history, she said. If the Senate approves it, it would be the first time Congress moved to eliminate coverage for millions of people.

""This would take us back,"" Tolbert said.

The United States is the only wealthy country where a substantial number of citizens lack health insurance, due to nearly a century of pushback against universal coverage from doctors, insurance companies, and elected officials.

""The complexity is everywhere throughout the system,"" said Sherry Glied, dean of New York University's Wagner School of Public Service, who worked in the George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and Obama administrations. ""The big bug is that people fall between the cracks.""

This year, KFF Health News is speaking to Americans about the challenges they face in finding health insurance and the effects on their ability to get care; to providers who serve the uninsured; and to policy experts about why, even when the nation hit its lowest recorded uninsured rate in 2023, nearly a tenth of the U.S. population still lacked health coverage.

So far, the reporting has found that despite decades of policies designed to increase access to care, the very structure of the nation's health insurance system creates the opposite effect.

Government-backed universal coverage has eluded U.S. policymakers for decades.

After lobbying from physician groups, President Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned plans to include universal health coverage in the Social Security Act of 1935. Then, because of a wage and salary cap used to control inflation during World War II, more employers offered health insurance to lure workers. In 1954, health coverage was formally exempted from income tax requirements, which led more employers to offer the benefit as part of compensation packages.

Insurance coverage offered by employers came to form the foundation of the U.S. health system. But eventually, problems with linking health insurance to employment emerged.

""We realized, well, wait, not everybody is working,"" said Heidi Allen, an associate professor at the Columbia School of Social Work who studies the impact of social policies on access to care. ""Children aren't working. People who are elderly are not working. People with disabilities are not working.""

Yet subsequent efforts to expand coverage to all Americans were met with backlash from unions who wanted health insurance as a bargaining chip, providers who didn't want government oversight, and those who had coverage through their employers.

That led policymakers to add programs piecemeal to make health insurance accessible to more Americans.

There's Medicare for older adults and Medicaid for people with low incomes and disabilities, both created in 1965; the Children's Health Insurance Program, created in 1997; the ACA's exchange plans and Medicaid expansion for people who can't access job-based coverage, created in 2010.

As a result, the U.S. has a patchwork of health insurance programs with numerous interest groups vying for dollars, rather than a cohesive system, health policy researchers say.

The lack of a cohesive system means that, even though Americans are eligible for health insurance, they struggle to access it, said Mark Shepard, an associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. No central entity exists in the U.S. to ensure that all people have a plan, he said.

Over half of the uninsured might qualify for Medicaid or subsidies that can help cover the costs of an ACA plan, according to KFF. But many people aren't aware of their options or can't navigate overlapping programs — and even subsidized coverage can be unaffordable.

Those who have fallen through the cracks said it feels like the system has failed them.

Yorjeny Almonte of Allentown, Pennsylvania, earns about $2,600 a month as an inspector in a cabinet warehouse. When she started her job in December 2023, she didn't want to spend nearly 10% of her income on health insurance.

But, last year, her uninsured mom chose to fly to the Dominican Republic to get care for a health concern. So Almonte, 23, who also needed to see a doctor, investigated her employer's health offerings. By then she had missed the deadline to sign up.

""Now I have to wait another year,"" she said.

In January, Camden, Alabama, resident Kiana George, who's uninsured, landed in an intensive care unit months after she stopped seeing a nurse practitioner and taking blood pressure medications — an ordeal that saddled her with nearly $7,000 in medical bills.

George, 30, was kicked off Medicaid in 2023 after she got hired by an after-school program. It pays $800 a month, an income too high to qualify her for Medicaid in Alabama, which hasn't expanded to cover most low-income adults. She also doesn't make enough for a free or reduced-cost ACA plan.

George, who has a 9-year-old daughter, said she ""has no idea"" how she can repay the debt from the emergency room visit. And because she fears more bills, she has given up on treatment for ovarian cysts.

""It hurts, but I'm just gonna take my chances,"" she said.

Health insurance is fundamentally a financial product, intended to protect the policyholder's pocketbook from accidents or illnesses.

Researchers have known for decades that a lack of insurance coverage leads to poor access to health care, said Tom Buchmueller, a health economist at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business.

""It's only more recently we've had really good, strong evidence that shows that health insurance really does improve health outcomes,"" Buchmueller said.

Research released this spring by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that expanding Medicaid reduced low-income adults' chances of dying by 2.5%. In 2019, a separate study published by that nonpartisan think tank provided experimental evidence that health insurance coverage reduced mortality among middle-aged adults.

In late May, the House narrowly advanced the budget legislation that independent government analysts said would result in millions of Americans losing health insurance coverage and reduce federal spending on programs like Medicaid by billions of dollars.

A key provision would require some Medicaid enrollees to work, volunteer, or complete other qualifying activities for 80 hours a month, starting at the end of 2026. Most Medicaid enrollees already work or have some reason they can't, such as a disability, according to KFF.

House Speaker Mike Johnson has defended the requirement as ""moral.""

""If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system. You're cheating the system,"" he told CBS News in the wake of the bill's passage.

A Senate version of the bill also includes work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks for Medicaid recipients.

Fiscal conservatives argue a solution is needed to curb health care's rising costs.

The U.S. spends about twice as much per capita on health care as other wealthy nations, and that spending would grow under the GOP's budget bill, said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute, a think tank that supports less government spending on health care.

But the bill doesn't address the root causes of administrative complexity or unaffordable care, Cannon said. To do that would entail, for instance, doing away with the tax break for employer-sponsored care, which he said fuels excessive spending, raises prices, and ties health insurance to employment. He said the bill should cut federal funding for Medicaid, not just limit its growth.

The bill would throw more people into a high-cost health care landscape with little protection, said Aaron Carroll, president and CEO of AcademyHealth, a nonpartisan health policy research nonprofit.

""There's a ton of evidence that shows that if you make people pay more for health care, they get less health care,"" he said. ""There's lots of evidence that shows that disproportionately affects poor, sicker people.""

Labon McKenzie, 45, lives in Georgia, the only state that requires some Medicaid enrollees to work or complete other qualifying activities to obtain coverage.

He hasn't been able to work since he broke multiple bones after he fell through a skylight while on the job three years ago. He got fired from a county road and bridge crew after the accident and hasn't been approved for Social Security or disability benefits.

""I can't stand up too long,"" he said. ""I can't sit down too long.""

In February, McKenzie started seeing double, but canceled an appointment with an ophthalmologist because he couldn't come up with the $300 the doctor wanted in advance. His cousin gave him an eye patch to tide him over, and, in desperation, he took expired eye drops his daughter gave him. ""I had to try something,"" he said.

McKenzie, who lives in rural Fort Gaines, wants to work again. But without benefits, he can't get the care he needs to become well enough.

""I just want my body fixed,"" he said.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Gene therapy shows promise for reducing stroke risk in patients with sickle cell disease","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250630/Gene-therapy-shows-promise-for-reducing-stroke-risk-in-patients-with-sickle-cell-disease.aspx","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 04:21:00 GMT","

Gene therapy for sickle cell disease may help improve a major contributing factor to stroke risk in patients, reports a new study from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Many people with sickle cell disease experience increased brain ischemia, where oxygen is not delivered properly to brain tissues, potentially leading to strokes. A part of the risk for these events comes from increased blood flow speed in the brain. Findings from three patients in a gene therapy clinical trial showed that gene therapy treatment significantly improved blood flow in the brain. These results demonstrate that people with these risk factors may benefit from gene therapy and should be considered for future clinical trials of gene therapy. The findings were published today in the American Journal of Hematology.

We saw that after gene therapy, elevated blood flow speed in the brain came down to normal levels. This is the closest physiological evidence we have that gene therapy could be effective for patients with neurovascular disease who are at risk of or have had a stroke.""

Akshay Sharma, MBBS, MSc, corresponding author, St. Jude Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cellular Therapy

A small but significant percentage of patients with sickle cell disease are at an increased risk of stroke due to the condition's impact on blood flow in the brain. The crescent ""sickle"" shape of red blood cells characteristic of sickle cell disease cannot move through small blood vessels, including those in the brain. When those vessels become clogged, that region in the brain does not receive enough oxygen. To compensate for the lack of oxygen delivery, the body amps up the speed of blood flow, which increases the number of red blood cells moving through the brain and the total amount of available oxygen. This results in a decrease in the time oxygen molecules have to leave the red blood cells and enter the brain tissue, which can ultimately lead to brain ischemia. Brain ischemia is when a region of the brain is greatly deprived of oxygen, creating a significant risk factor for stroke, which can result in long-term damage.

""You can think of red blood cells filled with oxygen like a bus filled with people,"" Sharma said. ""If the bus is going too fast, passengers can't get off the bus, and oxygen is not delivered. However, if the bus slows down so passengers can safely hop off, as happens when hemoglobin levels rise, then oxygen gets properly delivered to the brain tissues."" 

The researchers measured gene therapy's effect on the flow of blood in the brain using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The study imaged the brains of three patients with sickle cell disease, before gene therapy and at one and two years after the treatment. Each patient's brain blood flow improved significantly, decreasing anywhere from 22% to 43%, reaching mostly normal levels, which appeared stable over time.

Results from the study compare well to previous studies measuring the impact of other treatments for sickle cell disease, including the drug hydroxyurea or blood transfusions. Hydroxyurea, the most common treatment for sickle cell disease, has only a small effect on brain blood flow, and while blood transfusions have a stronger positive impact on brain blood flow, the effect is transient because the patient must continually receive new transfusions for it to last. The researchers found gene therapy has a more substantial and long-lasting protective effect on the brain than either of these treatments.

Bone marrow transplants also normalize brain blood flow over the long term. While gene therapy and bone marrow transplantation were not compared directly in the study, the results suggest both treatments produce a similar return to normal blood flow in the brain that is durable over time. 

This study of three patients provides preliminary evidence for gene therapy's effect on stroke risk and requires follow-up studies to confirm the result. However, it adds to a growing body of evidence that gene therapy should be considered as a treatment option to protect brain health in patients with sickle cell disease.

The study provides support for new clinical trials for sickle cell disease gene therapy to include patients at risk for stroke. Historically, given the high-risk nature of their disease, these individuals have been excluded from gene therapy trials. 

""We now have emerging data to at least evaluate the efficacy of gene therapy in patients with a risk of or history of stroke,"" Sharma said. ""Until now, we only had one option that had a long-term impact on blood flow in the brain: bone marrow transplantation. But now we may also have gene therapy as another viable method to protect against neurovascular disease in people with sickle cell disease.""

New research highlights coffee's unique polyphenols as promising allies against type 2 diabetes, yet clinical proof remains the missing ingredient.

Review: Coffee and Its Major Polyphenols in the Prevention and Management of Type 2 Diabetes: A Comprehensive Review. Image Credit: Natasha_Kovtun / Shutterstock

In a recent review published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, researchers compiled data from nearly 150 publications to elucidate the effects of coffee and its metabolites on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They focus on evidence from clinical, epidemiological, and molecular studies to unravel coffee's lesser-known associations with T2DM and metabolic diseases.

Findings reveal that coffee-derived polyphenols exhibit significant blood sugar-modulatory effects, including the suppression of inflammation, enhancement of insulin sensitivity, antioxidant properties, and improved glucose metabolism. While this evidence suggests that coffee consumption benefits T2DM, the review highlights several key knowledge gaps, including optimal dosages, bioavailability challenges, and underlying mechanisms.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents one of this era's most significant public health crises. Occurring when the body is incapable of optimally managing circulatory blood sugar levels, the condition is growing at an alarming rate, surging from 200 million adult cases (1990) to more than 830 million cases (2022) just three decades later. Projections estimate 783 million cases by 2045, primarily due to aging populations, urbanization, and changes in lifestyle.

While several pharmacological strategies (e.g., the development of Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists [GLP-1 RAs]) and lifestyle interventions (e.g., the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet) have shown promise in mitigating T2DM's adverse outcomes, safe, cheap, and accessible preventive measures are still lacking.

Recent research suggests that coffee, one of the world's most popular beverages, is frequently linked to reduced T2DM incidence. Unfortunately, studies attempting to understand these trends often focus on one (caffeine) or a few coffee polyphenols and use correlation (rather than causation) for their inferences. Though widely consumed, coffee's metabolic impacts have only recently been dissected with the rigor typically reserved for pharmacological agents.

The present review aims to collate available data on coffee components previously linked to T2DM outcomes, focusing on five hydroxycinnamic acids found in coffee: 1. Chlorogenic acid, 2. Caffeic acid, 3. Ferulic acid, 4. p-Coumaric acid, and 5. Sinapic acid. It seeks to unravel how these polyphenols mechanistically alter glucose metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation at both cellular and systemic levels.

Study data were obtained through a systematic and structured review of 149 publications, which comprised epidemiological data, mechanistic studies, observational cohort studies, and clinical trials. The review organized and discussed these publications under the following key points: 1. Epidemiology, 2. Clinical trials, 3. Mechanisms, 4. Pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, and 5. Research gaps.

The review assessed and standardized each section for study quality, sample size, types of coffee used (filtered, espresso, decaf), and polyphenol content (composition and relative quantity). In doing so, the review sought to derive causal associations from the correlation-based investigations.

Potential anti-diabetic mechanisms of chlorogenic acid and related hydroxycinnamic acids. Red arrows indicate direction: ↑ increase, ↓ decrease.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that habitual coffee drinking (3-5 cups daily) results in a 20-30% lower risk of future T2DM incidence, highlighting the beverage's protective effects against systemic and cellular glucose imbalances. However, the review cautions that mechanistic and efficacy evidence remains largely preclinical. Notably, while the magnitude of their impact differed between coffee subtypes, both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee demonstrated similar benefits for T2DM, suggesting that compounds (polyphenols) beyond caffeine play key roles.

Clinical studies, particularly short-term trials, have revealed that chlorogenic acid-enriched coffees improve postprandial glucose levels by 6.9% and reduce fasting insulin levels. However, human trials show inconsistent results, especially in established T2DM, and adverse effects (e.g., hypertension, anxiety) may occur with high intake (>4 cups/day). The review underscores that long-term clinical data remains sparse for uncovering trends and predicting future outcomes.

Mechanistic studies have shown that chlorogenic acid and similar polyphenols inhibit carbohydrate-digesting enzymes and enhance glucose uptake in the muscle and liver, thereby promoting glucose homeostasis. Chlorogenic, caffeic, ferulic, and sinapic acids demonstrate consistent anti-inflammatory effects; p-coumaric acid also shows activity (e.g., TNF-α reduction in animal models), though evidence is less extensive.

Cell models demonstrated ferulic and caffeic acids' beneficial impacts on insulin receptor sensitivity. Bioavailability and metabolism investigations suggest that chlorogenic acid is partially broken down in the gut, significantly impacting gut microbiota profiles, which in turn may mediate some of the coffee-associated benefits for T2DM. Animal studies have consistently demonstrated metabolic improvements across insulin resistance and diabetes models, while ferulic acid has shown synergistic effects when combined with metformin. If confirmed, these findings demonstrate the potential for personalized future treatments.

The review highlights that contemporary studies share significant drawbacks despite their insights. These include: highly varied polyphenol dosing across trials (e.g., chlorogenic acid at 200–1200 mg/day in human studies), which impedes standardization; low bioavailability requiring efficacy enhancements; population bias from reliance on Asian/European cohorts; mechanistic uncertainty due to limited human evidence; potential adverse effects with excessive consumption; and drug interactions with anti-diabetic medications like ertugliflozin.

Nevertheless, this review underscores coffee's (specifically its polyphenols) untapped potential in preventing or mitigating T2DM. The authors call for rigorous, well-designed clinical trials and metabolic studies to establish coffee polyphenols as evidence-based interventions. In particular, methodological standardizations would hasten both research efforts and public health applications.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New AI tool helps clinicians identify brain activity patterns linked to nine types of dementia","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250630/New-AI-tool-helps-clinicians-identify-brain-activity-patterns-linked-to-nine-types-of-dementia.aspx","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 05:52:00 GMT","

Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that helps clinicians identify brain activity patterns linked to nine types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, using a single, widely available scan - a transformative advance in early, accurate diagnosis. 

The tool, StateViewer, helped researchers identify the dementia type in 88% of cases, according to research published online on June 27, 2025, in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. It also enabled clinicians to interpret brain scans nearly twice as fast and with up to three times greater accuracy than standard workflows. Researchers trained and tested the AI on more than 3,600 scans, including images from patients with dementia and people without cognitive impairment. 

This innovation addresses a core challenge in dementia care: identifying the disease early and precisely, even when multiple conditions are present. As new treatments emerge, timely diagnosis helps match patients with the most appropriate care when it can have the greatest impact. The tool could bring advanced diagnostic support to clinics that lack neurology expertise. 

Dementia affects more than 55 million people worldwide, with nearly 10 million new cases each year. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form, is now the fifth-leading cause of death globally. Diagnosing dementia typically requires cognitive tests, blood draws, imaging, clinical interviews and specialist referrals. Even with extensive testing, distinguishing conditions such as Alzheimer's, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia remains challenging, including for highly experienced specialists. 

StateViewer was developed under the direction of David Jones, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist and director of the Mayo Clinic Neurology Artificial Intelligence Program. 

Every patient who walks into my clinic carries a unique story shaped by the brain's complexity. That complexity drew me to neurology and continues to drive my commitment to clearer answers. StateViewer reflects that commitment - a step toward earlier understanding, more precise treatment and, one day, changing the course of these diseases.""

David Jones, M.D., Mayo Clinic neurologist 

To bring that vision to life, Dr. Jones worked alongside Leland Barnard, Ph.D., a data scientist who leads the AI engineering behind StateViewer. 

""As we were designing StateViewer, we never lost sight of the fact that behind every data point and brain scan was a person facing a difficult diagnosis and urgent questions,"" Dr. Barnard says. ""Seeing how this tool could assist physicians with real-time, precise insights and guidance highlights the potential of machine learning for clinical medicine."" 

The tool analyzes a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan, which shows how the brain uses glucose for energy. It then compares the scan to a large database of scans from people with confirmed dementia diagnoses and identifies patterns that match specific types, or combinations, of dementia. 

Alzheimer's typically affects memory and processing regions, Lewy body dementia involves areas tied to attention and movement, and frontotemporal dementia alters regions responsible for language and behavior. StateViewer displays these patterns through color-coded brain maps that highlight key areas of brain activity, giving all clinicians, even those without neurology training, a visual explanation of what the AI sees and how it supports the diagnosis. 

Mayo Clinic researchers plan to expand the tool's use and will continue evaluating its performance in a variety of clinical settings.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","Study provides insights into the immune response following pig-to-human kidney xenotransplants","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250630/Study-provides-insights-into-the-immune-response-following-pig-to-human-kidney-xenotransplants.aspx","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 11:27:00 GMT","

A pioneering study has provided unprecedented insights into the immune response following pig-to-human kidney xenotransplantation.

The findings, presented today at the ESOT Congress 2025, mark a significant step forward in overcoming the biggest challenge in xenotransplantation: rejection by the human immune system.

Using cutting-edge spatial molecular imaging, researchers mapped how human immune cells interact with pig kidney tissue in transplanted organs, revealing critical early markers of rejection and potential intervention strategies. The study, led by Dr. Valentin Goutaudier and a collaborative international research team (Paris Institute for Transplantation and Organ Regeneration & NYU Langone Transplant Institute), highlights key molecular mechanisms that could shape the future of xenotransplantation.

One of the most striking discoveries was that human immune cells were found in every part of the pig kidney's filtering system after the transplant. Researchers observed early molecular signs of antibody-mediated rejection as soon as Day 10 and peaking at Day 33, reinforcing previous findings that rejection begins rapidly but progresses over time. By tracking these immune responses for up to 61 days, the team identified a crucial window for targeted therapeutic intervention.

Our study provides the most detailed molecular map to date of how the human immune system engages with a transplanted pig kidney. By pinpointing specific immune cell behaviours and gene expressions, we can refine anti-rejection treatments and improve transplant viability.""

Dr. Valentin Goutaudier, Paris Institute for Transplantation and Organ Regeneration

The study's innovative approach used a bioinformatic pipeline to distinguish human immune cells from pig structural cells, allowing for precise mapping of immune infiltration patterns. Notably, macrophages and myeloid cells were the most prevalent immune cell types across all time points, further confirming their role as key mediators in xenograft rejection.

When targeted therapeutic interventions were introduced, immune-mediated signs of rejection were successfully weakened. Combined with novel spatial insights into how immune cells interact with pig kidney tissue, this marks a major breakthrough - paving the way for more refined anti-rejection strategies. These advances come at a pivotal time as the first US-based clinical trials of pig kidney transplantation into living human recipients begin in 2025.

With xenotransplantation poised to address the global organ shortage crisis, these findings bring researchers one step closer to making genetically modified pig kidneys a viable long-term solution. The next phase will focus on optimising anti-rejection treatments, refining genetic modifications in donor pigs, and developing early detection protocols to monitor and manage rejection responses.

""Understanding the specific immune interactions at a molecular level allows us to develop targeted interventions that can prevent rejection before it escalates,"" explained Dr. Goutaudier. ""This research lays the groundwork for safer and more effective pig-to-human transplants in the near future.""

As scientific progress accelerates, researchers remain cautiously optimistic that genetically modified pig kidneys could become a routine transplant option within the next decade. However, regulatory approvals will require consistent demonstration of safety and efficacy in diverse patient populations.

What you need to know about Denver in 5 min


The United States Women's National Soccer Team returned to Colorado this week — getting the same result: a victory.

Over 18,500 fans turned out to watch Coach Emma Hayes lead her team to a 4-0 win over  Ireland 4-0 at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City on Thursday night — mirroring their 4-0 victory over South Korea at the stadium last year. 

Their last trip to Colorado in June 2024 was the beginning of a road to redemption, with the team winning a gold medal at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris. 

But for all the excitement about the national team, plenty of fans on Thursday were also thinking about the city's soccer future — Denver's National Women's Soccer League club is scheduled to take the pitch in 2026. 

“Definitely a new team in Denver would be really cool for a lot of people and it'll definitely draw a lot of attention,” said Trinity Bulger, a nine-year-old soccer player who was celebrating her birthday at the match with her family. 

Her father, Jesse, said it meant a lot to bring his daughters out to the match. The family lives in Golden, the hometown of national team captain Lindsey Heaps. He believes Colorado's strong soccer community will support the new women's club.

“I think there's enough momentum here among women's sports and soccer specifically,” Bulger said. “There's a massive following, so I don't think it's going to be any problem filling that out on a regular basis.”

In January, the NWSL announced that it awarded Denver the league's 16th franchise after the new ownership group paid a record $110 million expansion fee. It didn't take long for the Mile High City to buy in. More than 10,000 people have placed non-refundable deposits for season tickets. 

The Cherry Creek School District Board of Education unanimously approved a deal to build the team's headquarters and training facility in Centennial in March. The club broke ground on the facility earlier this month.  

The Denver City Council plans to spend up to $70 million to provide land for the permanent stadium and fund surrounding improvements at Sante Fe Yards, with the team kicking in tens of millions more.

Denver NWSL Club president Jen Millet attended the match on Thursday, chatting with fans about the club. During a media scrum at halftime, she said the club met with South Denver residents to present renderings of the new stadium and talk about the club. “We have a great partnership with the city,” Millet said. “We broke ground at our training facility in Centennial a few weeks ago. So, we're really excited about the investment this ownership group is making to support these female athletes, give them a purpose-built training facility stadium that really is going to meet their needs as professional athletes.”

While the club says the project is on track, some fans say they're worried about the location of the stadium, ticket prices, and development around the stadium.

Megan Tate and her husband Will took their daughters, Ava and Olivia, to Thursday's match after missing out on the USWNT last year. The girls were decked out in American flag colors and tutus for the match. They live near DICK's Sporting Goods Park and attend lots of Colorado Rapids matches, but they're hoping the new club will be more family-friendly.

“We would love to see games earlier so kids can go. I think, at 7 p.m., we go to a lot of Rapids games, but it's hard because the games are so late,” Tate said. “Prices for games are expensive and we want to see it more available and accessible to all people.”

The family's also worried about getting downtown, but Tate believes that the owners have planned for the logistics and development around the stadium.

“At Dick's Sporting Goods Park, we have the stadium, but there's nothing around it. And that's been kind of a frustration with people living in this community,” Tate said. “I really do hope that with that stadium over on Santa Fe, they build up that area a little bit more. And I'm sure it's going to make it so much more accessible to so many other people in the community.”

Many fans showed up to the USWNT match wearing the jerseys of Colorado natives Heaps,  Sophie Wilson, and Mallory Swanson. The three weren't on the roster for this summer series of friendlies

Heaps attended as a spectator. She was one of several European-based players who were given a rest for the summer by Hayes. She currently plays for OL Lyonness of the Premier Ligue in France.

“We talked a little bit about even if she finds it really difficult to rest, that there's seven types of rest. And for her the mental rest is important,” Hayes said. “Just she's relentless all the time. She'll play soccer in her sleep.” 

The Colorado trio played important roles on the pitch in winning Olympic gold. But, off the pitch, the trio have gone through some important life events over the last year.

Last December, Heaps tied the knot with Tyler Heaps at The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs. Heaps is currently the sporting director of the San Diego FC and the youngest in Major League Soccer at the position.

“I said to her, ‘This is important to be somebody's wife and someone's daughter and someone's sibling,'” Hayes said. “And then, we both started laughing because I said, 'You're also someone's dog owner, so embrace this time because it won't come again.'”

Wilson also walked down the aisle with Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Michael Wilson in January. The two met while attending Stanford. Last March, the Windsor native became the highest-paid player in the National Women's Soccer League when she signed a two-year contract extension with the Portland Thorns. The Wilsons also announced they're expecting their first child in March. 

Wilson's Triple Espresso mate Mallory Swanson is also expecting her first child with her husband, Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson. The couple married in 2022. The Littleton native has scored 23 goals in 60 appearances since being traded to the Chicago Stars in 2020.  

Despite their absences, Kyla Wallace proudly wore the jersey of her favorite player Wilson. A soccer player herself, she says it's an inspiration seeing three USWNT stars come from Colorado.

“It's inspiring because people, even from not a huge soccer place, can still become stars,” said Wallace, who was with her mother Ashley, father Jonathan, and sister Aspen. “It's nice to hear that it's not impossible to become great at soccer yourself.” 

The beginning of the Emma Hayes era of the USWNT began in Colorado last summer. But, there were several more. 

The coach held her first training camp with the team on the campus of CU-Boulder since being hired away from Chelsea F.C. Women in November 2023. The team didn't disappoint in front of a sellout crowd in defeating South Korea.

That match featured a Colorado connection when Wilson set Swanson up for the opening goal in the 34th minute. Swanson finished with two goals and an assist. 

During Thursday's postgame press conference, Hayes said she was nervous during her first trip to Colorado. Being an outsider, she said she didn't know how she would be received. But the Colorado crowd accepted her as their own, she said, and she was more relaxed this time around. 

“I got my attitude strategies right. I remember being really parched last year. This year I felt really hydrated, which was good,” Hayes joked. “I think the atmosphere in this stadium is incredible. You really feel the fans are on top of the field and the players I think respond to that.”

Hayes said the Mile High City is a brilliant market for the NWSL.

“I think it will be a fabulous place to come and play, especially with this crowd. It's a great sports town, so I know it'd be a great market,” Hayes said.

The USWNT faced Ireland again at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati on Sunday. Now they head to Washington, D.C., to play Canada at Audi Field on July 2.

Women's Soccer

During an under-23 U.S. women's national team game against Germany on May 30, 18-year-old center-back Jordyn Bugg launched a long shot of a cross in the waning seconds of stoppage time. The ball landed just in time for Evelyn Shores to run onto and score past Germany's goalkeeper, giving the U.S. a 2-1 lead and dramatic victory in a small stadium just outside of Stuttgart.

Less than one month later, in Commerce City, Colorado, Bugg found herself replacing Naomi Girma as a substitute in the senior USWNT's meeting with the Republic of Ireland. By the time she entered the field in the 73rd minute, the U.S. held a commanding 3-0 lead; Bugg's assignment was to maintain the U.S.'s grip on the game.

“Honestly, I was a little nervous coming into the game, but I came in a time where it was really calm in the game and the information they gave me was just be calm, be yourself, just keep the game in the flow it is in,” Bugg told the media following Thursday's match, which ended 4-0. “I think I did a really good job and I think they prepared me very well.”

Under USWNT head coach Emma Hayes, life can come fast at a deserving player. Since stepping into her role just over a year ago, the former Chelsea manager has reorganized and fortified the talent pipeline of the women's national team — not only the senior side, but the under-23s — with a militancy never before seen on the women's side of U.S. soccer's ranks.

Hayes has said repeatedly that everything players do counts toward their invitations to camp, from club play to international performances at any given level. Joining Bugg in senior camp during this window are 21-year-old defender Lilly Reale, 23-year-old midfielder Sam Meza, and 24-year-old goalkeeper Angelina Anderson, who recorded a shutout on Sunday — all of whom were on the field for that under-23 win over Germany. (Per an agreement between U.S. Soccer and the German federation, each team was allowed to bring five over-age players to camp.)

The intention behind Hayes' strategy is to shrink the gaps she's identified between age groups within the national team setup, and also those that exist between those who typically start on the senior team and those who come off the bench. When Hayes first took the helm of the program, she admittedly pumped players with information in order to prepare them for Olympic competition. With that gold medal secured, she turned her sights to development and preparation for the World Cup, two different yet interrelated mandates. With the information logged and dispensed through both teams, Hayes is now focused on exposing players to a range of experiences.

In Colorado, the under-23s and senior team trained side by side. Ahead of Thursday night's game, Hayes reflected on how much the programs have changed with her new approach.

“Everything is earned, and the beautiful thing about where we are is I stood on the field yesterday with our team and thought, ‘We've got top quality out here. We've got top quality at home, and there are too many to name. We've got top quality on the field next to us, who are watching and aspiring up, and we've got all of our players looking back and saying, ‘Gosh, I've got such great memories,'” she said of the dual training groups. “But also, our senior players talk about how important the under-23s program is. They felt it was a missing gap for lots of them.”

Hayes was always obliged to strengthen her bench of senior players, if only to be able to respond to the inevitable absences that affect any elite athlete, from injuries to pregnancies to retirement. Triple Espresso, the superlative attacking trio of Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson, and Trinity Rodman, have collectively been missing in action since the start of this calendar year: Swanson and Wilson are pregnant and Rodman has taken an extended break to manage issues with her back. On the other side of the pitch, USWNT goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher announced her retirement from international soccer last November, throwing open the gates to the team's next No. 1 and exposing the lack of a clear pathway for qualified goalkeepers.

The first definitive step took place in January when Hayes selected 24 players for the inaugural Futures Camp run by her and her staff, along with all U.S. Youth National Team head coaches. The roster consisted of 14 professional players — including Bugg and Reale, along with Gisele Thompson, Claire Hutton, Michelle Cooper, and Avery Patterson, who also made the current senior team squad — and was described by Hayes as an opportunity to take a look at some newer faces who will soon by vying for spots on the senior team.

“It's a significant jump from college to the pro game and an even bigger jump to the elite international level, but we will be patient with all these players as we understand the process and want to help all of them reach their maximum potential,” she said at the time.

Another international window opened three months later and U.S. Soccer announced a 24-player roster for the under-23 camp, who trained alongside the senior team in Southern California as the latter geared up for a pair of matches against Brazil. Of the players named, 11 participated in Futures Camp, with Patterson, Hutton, and Cooper making their way straight onto the senior team. The U.S. split results across two legs against the 2024 Summer Olympic silver medalists in April.

Patterson's foray onto the senior team began with a bizarre elevator incident in which she got stuck between floors with defenders Alanna Cook and Becky Sauerbrunn during their time in LA. She's since earned five caps and scored a goal for the U.S.

“It's been a whirlwind,” Patterson said of her ascent on the USWNT following the team's first match against Ireland. “That elevator incident seems like it was a year ago, like how much I've grown as a player and person. I'm speechless, honestly, because it's crazy how much has happened in the past couple of months and has had such a positive impact on my life.”

And while the linear nature of the under-23 and senior USWNT teams suggests a unidirectional pathway, Hayes has again usurped the norm. She's shown that she sees the two groups as fluid spheres, which grants her the flexibility, wherever possible, to respond to changes in real time when a player experiences a dip in form or another is playing beyond their age and could benefit from time with a different team in camp, for example. That was how Hayes explained the absences of forwards Jaedyn Shaw and Mia Fishel, and midfielder Korbin Albert, all of whom have USWNT caps, from senior camp, and their inclusion on the under-23 roster that was announced on May 21 ahead of their two games against Germany.

“Yes, (Fishel) could come in and sit on the bench for (the senior team), but it's much better for her to go and play in Germany and get the experiences so that these players are tracking to compete in the place that we want them come 2027,” Hayes said following the announcement. “I think the trip to Germany for her, plus Jaedyn, plus Korbin, will be, again, another step in their development.”

That three senior-capped players teamed up with uncapped players and Hayes selected the latter for the current camp speaks volumes about the relatively blank slate with which she assesses players; senior caps alone aren't enough to justify a new invitation under her strategy. And because the under-23 camps are run in concert with the senior team, younger players are now receiving guidance they say has eased the transition from one team to another.

“The system that Emma's pushing right now is definitely one that takes some time to learn and feel comfortable in,” said Reale, who earned her first cap and start for the USWNT on Thursday against Ireland and assisted Alyssa Thompson for the team's fourth goal of the night.

“That time with the under-23s was an awesome opportunity to establish myself and try to figure out where I fit into that system, not only get some games and just play against some high level competition, but also just apply some of the things that Emma has been teaching us and wants to see more of so that we can fit into that system at the higher level,” Reale added.

Between the presence of Hayes and her coaching staff at previous under-23 camps and their close communication with the under-23 coaches about the team's standards and expectations, “we were able to coordinate and learn and grow throughout that camp,” she explained.

Hayes has continually emphasized the importance of international experience against top-ranked opponents to a successful national team career, which typically happens at the youth level. But given the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its unprecedented setbacks, she appears to also be accounting for that stolen time when granting younger or inexperienced players looks at the senior level.

Meza, who started in the second USWNT match against Ireland on Sunday, has won Concacaf titles at the under-15, under-17, and under-20 levels. Her journey on the national team was cut short during the pandemic, which saw the cancellation of the Under-20 Women's World Cup that year, a tournament in which Meza was likely to play. But after establishing herself as a pro, first with the Dallas Trinity in the USL-W (where she was playing on loan from the Seattle Reign) and then back with her home club, she caught Hayes' eye and worked her way back into camps.

“I've grown up in the U.S. youth system, and my cycle of under-23s kind of got canceled a little bit, so I hadn't been to camp in a while,” Meza said on Thursday. She called the pair of Germany games “really good exposure, and then, as we know, the under-23s are being used in a great way. I think it's going to benefit the U.S. in general. We have so many talented players, and to be able to harness and use those players in the right way is just going to be so beautiful.”

It also helps that each of the previously uncapped under-23 players in this window — Bugg, Meza, Reale, and Anderson — have all had strong starts to their NWSL seasons, which Hayes says she follows closely. Bugg has started each of Seattle Reign's 13 games, notched two goals, and intercepted an average of 1.73 passes per 90 minutes; Meza has recorded two assists for the same club and averages 4.7 tackles and 2.7 blocks per game; and Reale has shone at NJ/NY Gotham FC with a goal and an assist, with an average of 3.1 tackles each game. Anderson, meanwhile, has a 67.7 per cent save percentage and has an average of 1.54 actions taken outside the penalty area each game, per FBref.

As Hayes continues to fold younger and less experienced players into the USWNT, though, she is steadfast about her other values for individual player development: pacing and timing.

She described Bugg, who played the entirety of the second U.S. match against Ireland on Sunday, a “superb football player,” but was also candid about her path and the possibilities for her growth.

“I don't know whether she will be a candidate for 2027,” Hayes said, referring to the roster for the next Women's World Cup in Brazil. “But she will be for (the) 2028 (Olympics) and 2031 (World Cup), so a call up to the national team now, maybe a move back to under-23s in October, ideally a World Cup for the under-20s next September, this is the type of individual player development you have to get right.”

Herculez Gomez takes a look at what the USMNT still has to improve on after narrowly beating Costa Rica on penalties in the Gold Cup. (1:59)

MINNEAPOLIS -- As Mike Tyson once opined, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. But the United States men's national team went one better in its Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal matchup against Costa Rica.

On Sunday, the USMNT took multiple haymakers to the noggin. Granted, that's the norm in Concacaf, but in this match the U.S. stayed on its feet long enough to deliver the final blow, with Damion Downs converting the home side's final attempt in the penalty shootout to win the tiebreaker 4-3 after extra time finished 2-2. The U.S. will face Guatemala, winner of the day's other quarterfinal against Canada, in the semifinals Wednesday.

This match was filled with a level of turbulence no amount of Dramamine could counteract. Players alternated between villain and hero, sometimes within a single half. You had Max Arfsten conceding a penalty, assisting on Diego Luna's equalizer and scoring his first international goal, only to get beat in the run-up to Costa Rica's second. There was Malik Tillman, who missed a first-half penalty, assisted on Arfsten's goal, converted his attempt in the shootout and took heaps of abuse -- both physical and verbal -- from Los Ticos all game long.

But throughout the game's upheavals, the U.S. managed to stick to its plan. Luna looked bright in a creative role, and the midfield of Tyler Adams, Sebastian Berhalter and Luca de la Torre showed promise. All of it proved to be enough to advance.

""I think we showed great character, great character,"" U.S. manager Mauricio Pochettino said. ""OK, we [concede] a penalty, we get the penalty, we miss a penalty, and then the team keep going and keep believing in the way to play.""

The biggest hero of them all was Matt Freese. The New York City FC goalkeeper has had his share of difficulties during the tournament, too. The goal he conceded against Haiti was on him. He probably could have done better in the run-up to Alonso Martínez's 71st-minute equalizer, when he gave up a juicy rebound from Carlos Mora. And when the penalty shootout beckoned, there was a sense that Costa Rica, with legendary keeper Keylor Navas in net, had the edge.

But Freese possessed some advantages as well. After all, this is a man who during his college days at Harvard University did ""a very long research project on penalty kicks.""

""To be able to rely on that type of thing and deal with a lot of statistics and stuff like that, read the game and read their hips and things like that is massive,"" Freese said.

However, preparation will get a keeper only so far. The here and now in a shootout provides its own unique set of challenges, most of them psychological. Freese's save from Juan Vargas in the second round of spot kicks got the USMNT's nose in front, only for Berhalter to then sky his attempt over the bar. The miss required a mental reset for Freese, who then saved Francisco Calvo's attempt.

""After the first save, I went over to the corner and I kept repeating to myself, 'I want another, I want another,'"" Freese said. ""And then after the second save I did the same thing, kept telling myself, 'I want another.'""

The psyche job was needed. The U.S. had a chance to win the shootout in the fifth round, but Navas saved John Tolkin's effort. But Freese was ready again and denied Juan Rojas with the first kick in sudden death, leaving Downs to fire home the winner.

""I don't know about being sure of yourself to win. I think you've got to take it one by one,"" Freese said about the shootout. ""But I'm super, super grateful that I was able to help my team win today.""

Mauricio Pochettino believes his USMNT is starting to show its quality after the team advanced to the Gold Cup semifinals.

Everything about this game -- and this tournament -- has yielded layers of experience that are priceless for a young group. It's still unclear how many players from this roster will be around to contribute when the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins in a little less than a year -- especially when all the stars are reintegrated -- but it's imperative that they be ready if their name is called, and passing these kinds of tests will provide them with the kind of foundation that can't be obtained anywhere else. It's encouraging to see this group survive, and in some cases thrive.

""I think everyone in our team has that mentality, but there's going to be certain situations where you're tested, you know what I mean?"" Adams said. ""So you can see it in training. You can see it in some games, when games are easy. But it's when s--- gets hard [you find out] if you're going to step up to the plate. And tonight a lot of guys did that.""

This applies to Arfsten perhaps most of all. He said postmatch: ""I mean football is ups and downs. Everybody knows that. But for me it was just all about trying to make my mark on this game and get my 'get-back,' as some would say. And I feel like I did that, and obviously there's always room to improve, but I'm happy with how I showed resiliency.""

That said, there were plenty of other lessons to be learned from this match. They are the kinds of experiences that are easier to digest when you're winning, but could come back to bite the team later if they're not corrected. The U.S. seemed well on top after Arfsten's goal two minutes into the second half, and he clipped the crossbar eight minutes later. But the killer third goal never came, and as Costa Rica dug deep into its bench -- even as it was missing five players due to suspension or injury -- the match tilted in favor of Los Ticos.

""I think you can put the game to bed, and I think that's an important moment that if you give some of these teams life, then they're going to be able to take it,"" Adams said.

Semifinal opponent Guatemala, which survived a penalty shootout of its own to upset heavily favored Canada, has excelled at breathing life into games that appeared to be out of reach. The U.S. will need to be on its guard.

The veteran leadership on the team wasted no time after the match in imparting more wisdom. As the U.S. walked off the field, one could see defender Tim Ream with an arm around Berhalter, likely discussing the game's twists and turns and providing the nudge needed to move forward. But with every step, every triumph, and yes, even the mistakes, this USMNT is discovering a little bit more about itself.

Deficits can be overcome. Tactical problems can be solved. And it can deliver in the toughest of circumstances so that the team still comes out on top.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

The U.S. Men's National Team advanced past Costa Rica 4-3 on penalty kicks in the Concacaf Gold Cup Quarterfinal in a comeback victory Sunday.

Next, the USMNT will face Guatemala in the semifinal at Energizer Park in St. Louis (7 p.m. ET on FS1).

Guatemala entered the tournament as the third-lowest ranked FIFA team. With one upset at a time, the squad now finds itself in the semifinal for the first time since 1996. Guatemala stunned Canada in penalty kicks on Sunday after sneaking its way out of Group C with wins over Jamaica and Guadeloupe.

The Americans beat Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty shootout, much like Guatemala did in its knockout match at U.S. Bank Stadium. U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese made three saves in the shootout to send the USA through to the next round, and forward Damion Downs netted the final kick to secure the victory.

Before the quarterfinal, the United States came out of Group D unscathed, beating Trinadad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti. The Stars and Stripes finished the group stage with nine points while only conceding one goal.

The USA and Guatemala have met 27 times in history; the USMNT holds a winning record of 16-5-6. The two countries last met in the Gold Cup more than two decades ago in the 2007 group stage. The United States won that match 1-0.

It's been almost 10 years since the USMNT competed against Guatemala in a set of World Cup Qualifiers in 2016. None of the players on the current roster played in those matchups.

The USMNT has advanced to the semifinals in 17 of 18 total Gold Cups and will have a chance to reach its 11th title match.

MINNEAPOLIS (June 29, 2025) – The U.S. Men's National Team completed the comeback after trailing early and outlasted Costa Rica in an epic penalty kick shootout in the final quarterfinal match of this year's Concacaf Gold Cup.

With the match tied 2-2 at the end of regulation, the winner was determined by penalty kicks. Goalkeeper Matt Freese saved three kicks for the United States, including one from Costa Rica's Francisco Calvo, who converted a penalty in regulation, to lead the United States to victory. Damion Downs converted the last kick to send the U.S. through to the Gold Cup semifinals for the 17th time in the 18 editions of the tournament.

The USMNT advances to the semifinal where it will face Guatemala on Wednesday, July 2 at Energizer Park in St. Louis.

The United States entered Sunday's match at U.S. Bank Stadium as winners of Group D, going undefeated in the group stage with three wins over Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti. In those three matches, the United States only conceded once.

On the other side, Costa Rica advanced to the quarterfinals as the second-place team from Group A, also undefeated. Los Ticos earned wins over Suriname and Dominican Republic, then played head coach Miguel Herrera's home country of Mexico to a scoreless draw. Mexico finished as the group-winner based on goal differential.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino made three changes to the starting XI that faced Haiti last weekend, inserting Max Arfsten, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna. Seven starters were 25 years of age or younger, though everyone had seen Gold Cup action prior to Sunday's match.

The opening goal arrived for Costa Rica in the 12th minute after Arfsten was called for a foul inside the box. Defending his first penalty kick for the United States in his fourth straight start, Freese guessed correctly, diving to his left and getting a hand on the ball, but Calvo's hit had enough power to push past Freese and into the back of the net to give Costa Rica an early 1-0 lead.

Despite falling behind for the first time in this year's tournament, the United States looked determined and created several exciting moments. In the 19th minute, the USMNT's leading scorer this tournament, Malik Tillman, made some space outside the box using his dribble. Tillman cut back then sent the ball wide to Luca de la Torre on the flank. De la Torre's accurate cross set up an acrobatic volley for Luna, but the shot sailed high.

In the 31st minute, Costa Rica defender Juan Vargas took down Tillman with a dangerous foul near the endline. After VAR review, the official awarded a penalty kick to the United States. Tillman took the kick for the U.S., going up against Keylor Navas in goal for Costa Rica. Navas dove to his left, the opposite way of Tillman's low-driven shot, but the strike clanged off the lower left post. Reacting quickly, Arfsten chased down the rebound while the ball was still in play, cut back and fired a shot with his right foot, but Navas showed why he's one of the best goalkeepers in the world and jumped off the ground from the penalty attempt to get a hand on Arfsten's shot.

With pressure building in the closing moments of the first half, the United States pushed to find an equalizer before the break. And the relentless pursuit paid off with a goal from Luna. The midfielder corralled Arfsten's cross with a controlled first touch and set up his left-footed shot beautifully. His strike took a deflection on its way toward goal, enough to catch Navas off guard and the deflected shot spun into the back of the net to bring the score to 1-1 in the 43rd minute.

Ninety seconds into the second half, the USMNT scored a terrific goal to go ahead. Patrick Agyemang and Tillman were involved in the play, and Tillman swung the ball wide to an open Arfsten who was pushing high up the left side of the pitch. Arfsten closed in on the pass from Tillman and tucked it away with his right foot for his first international goal.

The United States nearly scored again moments later. In a play that looked reminiscent of the USA's lone goal against Saudi Arabia, Sebastian Berhalter delivered excellent service into the box on a direct free kick. Defender Chris Richards' header was on frame, but Navas made the save to keep his team within striking distance. The pair of Berhalter and Richards nearly connected again on another good look in the 67th minute.

With about 20 minutes to play in regulation, Costa Rica equalized. Carlos Mora cut through two defenders and took a shot on goal. Freese made the initial save at the near post, but the rebound fell right back to Mora. He slipped a short pass to Alonso Martínez who delivered from close range to tie the match at 2-2 in the 71st minute.

Both teams saw near misses in the final moments of regulation. For Costa Rica, it was a right-footed strike from Martínez that clanged off the post. Tillman, who got close several times throughout the match, just missed for the U.S. with a terrific strike that travelled high.

The match was tied 2-2 at the end of regulation and proceeded straight to a penalty kick shootout. Martínez opened with a controlled finish right down the middle. Tyler Adams answered for the USA. Freese saved the second attempt from Costa Rica's Juan Pablo Vargas, setting the tone that he was not to be underestimated.

With the kicks all tied up going into the fifth round, Freese came up huge twice more. He read Calvo and didn't flinch from his spot in the middle, staying in position to punch the shot away. On Costa Rica's next attempt, he sprawled out to his right to deny Andy Rojas, making his third save of the shootout.

That left the match at the feet of Downs, and the forward delivered to send the United States to the Gold Cup Semifinals.



Goal Scoring Rundown:



CRC – FRANCISCO CALVO, 12th minute: Costa Rica was awarded a penalty kick after the U.S. was called for a foul inside the box. After taking a brief pause, Calvo struck the ball low with his right foot. The strike was hit firmly enough to push past Freese's diving hand, and the ball rolled into the back of the net in the lower right corner. USA 0, CRC 1



USA – DIEGO LUNA (MAX ARFSTEN), 43rd minute: Arfsten crossed the ball to Luna near the top of the box. The midfielder controlled the pass with a deft touch. Luna's left-footed strike took a deflection and spun into the back of the net. USA 1, CRC 1



USA – MAX ARFSTEN (MALIK TILLMAN), 47th minute: On the attack, Agyemang dumped the ball to Tillman, who swung the ball wide to Arfsten. With space, Arfsten drove a low ball into the far side netting from the left side of the box. USA 2, CRC 1



CRC – ALONSO MARTÍNEZ (CARLOS MORA), 71st minute: Mora controlled his own rebound after his initial shot was saved by Freese and fed the ball to Alonso around the six-yard box. The striker slammed it into the upper left corner of the net to even the match. USA 2, CRC 2 FINAL.

The opening goal for the United States was the first career international goal for Diego Luna. The 21-year-old now has five goal contributions (one goal, four assists) in nine appearances this year.

Max Arfsten finished the match with two goal contributions. He scored his first international goal in the 47th minute and recorded his third career assist on Luna's goal.

Malik Tillman recorded his second career assist on Arfsten's goal. Tillman now has four goal contributions in his last four matches.

Tim Ream captained the United States for the 19th time.

The starting XI averaged 21 caps and 11 in official competition. The lineup had an average age of 25 years, 235 days.

The USMNT has advanced to the Gold Cup semifinals 17 times in 18 overall editions.

The USMNT moves to 20W-17L-7D all-time against Costa Rica and is 8W-0L-1D against Los Ticos in the Concacaf Gold Cup.

The U.S. men's national team are through to the Concacaf Gold Cup semifinals after a thrilling affair with Costa Rica. While their next test was expected to be a grudge match, an underdog had something else in mind.

Guatemala, the 106th ranked FIFA country in the world, pulled off a massive upset defeating Canada at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. As such, the USMNT will have to wait to exact their revenge from the Concacaf Nations League third place match and face Guatemala in the next round. 

Guatemala trailed early in the game after Jonathan David dispatched a penalty in the 29th minute. A Jacob Shaffelburg sending-off flipped the scrip in the second half as Rubio Rubin equalized. Luc De Fougerolles's missed penalty doomed Jesse Marsch's side in the shooutout as Guatemala celebrated one of the biggest upsets of the tournament.

While the USMNT will be favored, much like how Canada were, in the semifinals, the pressure to advance remains. They were favored against Costa Rica, but struggled to dominate. Max Arfsten righted his wrong of conceding a first half penalty by assisting Diego Luna and scoring his first senior international goal, but the result didn't come easy.

Costa Rica equalized in the second half to force a decisive penalty shootout. A treat, albeit a nervy one, for fans in attendance for both games. Matt Freese made three major saves to deny Juan Pablo Vargas, Francisco Calvo and Andy Rojas making up for a Sebastian Berhalter miss and John Tolkin's saved attempt. Damion Downs scored the final attempt of the game to push the USMNT over the line.

If they defeat Guatemala, they'll face the winner of Mexico and Honduras. The former dispatched guest nation Saudi Arabia in the quarterfinals while the latter pulled off their own upset eliminating Panama.

The US men's national team face upset-minded Guatemala in a 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup semifinal on Wednesday evening at St. Louis CITY SC's Energizer Park.

The winner meets Mexico or Honduras in the July 6 final at NRG Stadium in Houston, moving one step closer to winning the regional tournament.

This summer's Gold Cup offers the USMNT their last tournament preparation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's roster includes 15 MLS players.

After topping Group D with three straight wins, the USMNT needed penalty kicks to advance past Costa Rica in the quarterfinals.

Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna and Columbus Crew fullback Max Arfsten both scored their first international goals in the 2-2 draw, then New York City FC goalkeeper Matt Freese made three saves during spot-kicks. Damion Downs deposited the winning PK to settle a 4-3 shootout scoreline.

With their win, the USMNT advanced to the Gold Cup semifinals for the 17th time in 18 overall editions. They're chasing the program's eighth Gold Cup title and first since 2021.

Guatemala are fresh off one of their biggest results in program history, earning a 1-1 comeback draw vs. Canada in the quarterfinals before advancing 6-5 in penalty kicks.

Former Real Salt Lake striker Rubio Rubín headed home a second-half equalizer, cancelling out Jonathan David's first-half PK. José Morales scored the winning spot-kick and goalkeeper Kenderson Navarro impressed while filling in for the injured Nicholas Hagen (Columbus Crew).

Los Chapines, whose squad includes D.C. United defender Aaron Herrera and CF Montréal attacker Olger Escobar, are in their first Gold Cup semifinal since 1996. They keep defying expectations as the No. 106 team in the FIFA World Rankings.","{'href': 'https://www.mlssoccer.com', 'title': 'MLSsoccer.com'}","soccer"

MINNEAPOLIS — The U.S. men's national team scraped past Costa Rica in a dramatic Gold Cup quarterfinal here on Sunday, winning 4-3 on penalties after a 2-2 draw over 90 roller-coaster minutes.

The USMNT erased an early deficit, but blew a second-half lead. Then, after the 90 minutes ended level, it blew another lead in a roller-coaster shootout. But goalkeeper Matt Freese, in his first month as the U.S. starter, made three massive saves to one-up Costa Rican legend Keylor Nava and send the USMNT through to the semifinals, where they'll face Guatemala.

""Penalties are my thing,"" Freese said post-match. ""[On] the plane ride over here to Minnesota, I was studying penalties. I've been studying them all week and I was ready for it if we needed it.""

Freese first sprung low to his left. Conversions from Tyler Adams and Malik Tillman — who'd missed a penalty in regulation — put the U.S. ahead. But Sebastian Berhalter's miss relinquished the advantage.

Freese then stood his ground, in the center of the goal, to slap away a penalty from Francisco Calvo. That gave John Tolkin a chance to win the shootout for the U.S., but his well-struck penalty was saved by a sprawling Navas.

Freese, though, was not done. He denied Andy Rojas. Substitute U.S. striker Damion Downs then stepped up, scored, and sparked the wild celebrations.

The night began with the U.S. going behind in the 12th minute. Max Arfsten's clumsy tackle gave Costa Rica a penalty. Francisco Calvo converted.

And for 20 minutes thereafter, the U.S. struggled. After half an hour, it had two shots and zero on goal.

The USMNT looked as stagnant as ever, until Malik Tillman played a slick one-two with Patrick Agyemang. Tillman's cross came to nothing, but a Costa Rican follow-through caught his ankle. A few minutes later, referee Walter Lopez went to the monitor, and, after a VAR review, pointed to the penalty spot.

Tillman stepped up, and missed the penalty. But from there, the U.S. came alive.

Arfsten, who was at fault on both Costa Rica goals, set up Diego Luna for a deflected equalizer.

And then, after halftime, Arfsten put the U.S. ahead. Tillman, whose head had dropped after missing the penalty, engineered an incisive attacking move to set him up.

From then on, their first-half faults were forgotten. The U.S. looked comfortable. A semifinal matchup with Guatemala, and a path to a final against Mexico, seemed to have opened up.

But in the 71st minute, Costa Rica's Carlos Mora split Arfsten and Luca de la Torre, and knifed into the box. He fired a shot at Freese. He took the rebound, and teed up Alonso Martínez for Costa Rica's second goal of the night.

From there, it was Los Ticos who pressed for a winner. Martínez slammed a well-hit shot off the post in the 85th minute.

Neither side could find a winner, though, and a tense match went to penalties.

That's where Freese came up huge to send the Americans to the semifinals, where they'll face Guatemala on Wednesday in St. Louis.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Manchester City return to Orlando's Camping World Stadium on Monday night to take on Saudi Pro League giants Al Hilal in the last-16 of the FIFA Club World Cup.

It was a statement victory last time out for Pep Guardiola and his players as they brushed beyond Italy's Juventus courtesy of a 2-5 victory in Florida, securing themselves a first-placed finish in Group G.

That status as group winners also ensured a more favourable route to a potential final for the Premier League giants, positioning themselves on the left-hand side of the tournament bracket and avoiding some of Europe's biggest club sides.

The teams that Manchester City will certainly avoid unless they make it all the way to the Final in New York include Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid, and the reigning champions of Europe, Paris Saint-Germain.

From a team news perspective, Claudio Echeverri will remain sidelined as he continues his recovery from an ankle problem that could end his tournament as a whole, while Rico Lewis' three-match ban for a red card on matchday one will end after the clash with Al Hilal.

Ahead of the meeting between Manchester City and Al Hilal, FIFA have now announced the list of match officials to oversee proceedings at the Camping World Stadium!

FIFA have confirmed that Venezuela's Jesús Valenzuela has been appointed as the on-field match referee for Manchester City against Al Hilal at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida this week.

The 41-year-old official has been listed as an international referee for FIFA since 2013 having made his professional debut in the role back in the 2011/12 Venezuelan Primera División season.

Perhaps most notably in his career in terms of global recognition, Jesus Valenzuela was named CONMEBOL's best referee for 2021 by the IFFHS in December of that year.

The Acarigua-born official has so far taken charge of two matches at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup in Porto's 4-4 draw with Ahly and Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC, issuing nine yellow cards across those contests and awarding one penalty kick.

Accompanying Jesús Valenzuela at the Camping World Stadium on Monday night will be the appointed duo of Assistant Referees Jorge Urrego and Tulio Moreno, completing a team of Venezuelan officials on the pitch.

You can watch every single match at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup in the United States LIVE and FOR FREE

this summer!

Overseeing proceedings between Manchester City and Al Hilal from the positions in VAR will be Venezuelan referee Juan Soto as Video Assistant Referee, accompanied by Assistant Video Assistant Referee, Hamza El Fariq of Morocco.

Taking on the role of Support Video Assistant Referee for the match will be Spain's Alejandro Hernandez.

Standing between the Manchester City and Al Hilal dugouts headed by Pep Guardiola and Simone Inzaghi respectively will be Argentina's Yael Falcón as Fourth Official.

The contest has also seen a reserve official appointed in the role of ‘Fifth Official', according to FIFA's appointment list, in Argentina's Maximiliano Del Yesso.","{'href': 'https://sports.yahoo.com', 'title': 'Yahoo Sports'}","soccer"

Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola says his side could be ""exhausted"" after the CWC which might hamper their preparation for the new Premier League season. (2:20)

ORLANDO, Fla. -- Pep Guardiola has accepted that participation in the FIFA Club World Cup could ""destroy"" Manchester City's season but has hinted that other clubs not in the tournament are jealous they aren't taking part.

City face Saudi side Al Hilal here on Monday for a place in the quarterfinals.

Guardiola and his players have been in the United States for more than two weeks and could spend another two weeks away if they reach the final in New York on July 13.

He said he doesn't know how his players will react next season -- which starts Aug. 15 -- because the Club World Cup is the first edition of the new expanded version.

""After this, let's see what happens,"" said Guardiola. ""Let's see what happens after the final. We can rest and take the time that the Premier League has allowed us to rest and then we will see.

""Maybe in November, December or January, it will be a disaster, we are exhausted and the World Cup has destroyed us. I don't know, but it's the first time in our lives that this has happened.

""Mentally, I think in the past the players have played in World Cups or European Championships for their national teams, so it happens sometimes. You need a rest mentally sometimes, you can recover and then we will see when we come back.""

Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has been one of the fiercest critics of the Club World Cup, branding it ""a pointless competition.""

Klopp, now head of global soccer for Red Bull, predicted clubs involved could see ""injuries like never before"" next season.

When asked about the comments, Guardiola admitted he agreed with some of his old Liverpool rival's points. However, Guardiola hinted that other clubs would love to be in City's position.

""Listen, I fought a lot with Jurgen many, many times,"" Guardiola said. ""I know where his idea comes from. His comments [on the Club World Cup] didn't surprise me a lot. I understand him. I respect him. Now, he's stepped back from that position [as a manager] and I understand his argument, because I would defend his argument, as well.

""As managers, we don't organize the competitions. Once we are here, we are proud. Many, many teams complain about these competitions because they are not here; otherwise, they might love being here.""

""They would have their media and supporters here, and there would be income to be here and they would be happy to be here,"" he continued. ""Of course, it's not an ideal situation for the manager. Would I love to have two months to prepare for next season? Yes. Would I love to be refreshed for next season? Yes.

""But it is what it is. And we deserve what we have done in the past to be here. Once we are here, let's do our best possible.""","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","soccer"

Chelsea had to dig deep in their Club World Cup Round of 16 win against Benfica, however one player who played a key role could still be shipped out soon.

The Blues were 1-0 up with just four minutes to go before the players were forced off due to adverse weather conditions.

After a two-hour delay, Enzo Maresca's side were unable to hold out and conceded, sending the game to extra time.

Chelsea were finally able to put their dominance to good use. Goals from Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall set up a quarter-final tie with Palmeiras.

The goal was clearly long overdue from the France international, and the reaction of his teammates showed how much they had wanted him to score an important one again.

However, his future is anything but safe at the club, and his limited minutes in the second half of the season suggest he is not high in the manager's plans.

According to The Metro, the Blues have offered Arsenal the chance to sign Nkunku this summer. The report goes on to say that Tottenham and Manchester United have also been handed the opportunity to bring him in.

Despite scoring 15 goals for the club so far this season, only three of those came in the Premier League, and this included in a time when both Nicolas Jackson and Marc Guiu were injured.

With new signings set to join the squad, the future is not looking bright at all for Nkunku.

Around their game at the weekend, Chelsea closed in on two big signings that are set to transform their attack in the coming seasons.

Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro are set to be brought in to Maresca's squad ahead of the next campaign, with Pedro set to feature at the Club World Cup.

Chelsea already see Pedro as better than Nkunku in terms of how they fit in at the club, and he is likely to take his place in the first team squad going forwards.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

FIFA Club World Cup

The group stage of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup has concluded and 48 of the tournament's 63 matches have now taken place.

The competition, which is being hosted in the United States, drew plenty of criticism in the build-up — including for how many games were being held in large, out-of-town stadiums in cities traditionally lacking in football (or soccer) fandom.

So what have attendances actually been like? How many stadiums have come close to filling all of their seats? How have crowd sizes compared to the American-hosted 1994 men's World Cup and previous Club World Cups? And which have been the most and least-watched teams and groups at the tournament?

Here, The Athletic dives into the numbers and lays out the facts surrounding the attendances so far.

Firstly, this is what the attendance has been at each game so far at the tournament. The figures are based on FIFA's official attendances, which it says records the number of people through the turnstiles at each game (the below table is sortable).






FIFA has confirmed the attendance for both Mamelodi Sundowns vs Fluminense and Urawa Red Diamonds vs Monterrey (both played on June 25) was, by coincidence, exactly 14,312.

The 80,619 fans who watched Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain thrash Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California is the highest attendance of the tournament so far.

This match is, for now, the best-attended game in Club World Cup history. The previous highest reported attendances were the 73,000 who watched Manchester United vs Vasco da Gama (group stage) and Corinthians vs Vasco da Gama (final) at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro in the inaugural version of the competition in 2000.

The lowest attendance is the 3,412 present for South Korean side Ulsan HD's clash with Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa at the Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, Florida on June 17, which was also delayed for 65 minutes given fears of thunderstorms. The nearby Walt Disney World averages that many visitors roughly every 30 minutes.

The last men's World Cup game to have a lower attendance was Wales vs Hungary in a group-stage play-off in Sweden in 1958 (2,823) and the last Premier League match (excluding games during the coronavirus pandemic) to attract a smaller crowd was Wimbledon vs Everton at Selhurst Park in January 1993, with just 3,039 people at the ground.

It is not, however, the lowest-attended Club World Cup match ever (excluding games held during the pandemic). That distinction is held by the second-round match between Mexican club Leon and Japanese side Urawa Red Diamonds at the 2023 tournament in Saudi Arabia. Just 2,525 people (in a 27,000-capacity ground) watched Urawa win 1-0.

The average attendance at the 2025 Club World Cup has been 34,759. The average across the previous 18 — much smaller — editions that were not affected by the pandemic was 32,505. While, at face value, this suggests attendances have been better than usual for the tournament, larger stadiums have been used for this edition, which must be taken into account.



Here is the average attendance for each day of the tournament. The highest figure, on June 14, was set on the first day of the competition, when the only game was between Lionel Messi's Inter Miami and Egyptian side Al Ahly at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida.



The lowest was on June 25, when the final games in Groups E and F took place. Three of the four matches were attended by fewer than 15,000 people and just 14,312 people watched Monterrey's victory over Urawa Red Diamonds at the Rose Bowl. That meant more than 75,000 seats — a figure higher than Old Trafford's total capacity — were left empty at the stadium that hosted the 1994 World Cup final.

Looking at the 12 stadiums being used for the tournament, the Hard Rock Stadium tops the list for percentage of seats filled. The ground in south Florida has been, on average, 81.8 per cent full during its six games hosted so far. Notably, two of these matches have involved Messi. The lowest is the Inter&Co Stadium in Orlando, which has only been 19.9 per cent full.



The MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — which will host both the final of this tournament and next summer's World Cup, which the U.S. is jointly hosting with Canada and Mexico — has the third-lowest percentage of seats filled so far, with just under 45.

The club to have played in front of the most fans so far at the tournament are record 15-time European champions Real Madrid with a total of 197,474, averaging 65,825 over their three games. And the side to have been the least-watched are Mamelodi Sundowns, who totalled 31,730 at an average of 10,577 per game.

The group with the highest total attendance was Group B (PSG, Botafogo, Atletico and Seattle Sounders) with 289,725 at an average of 48,288 per match and the one with the lowest total attendance was Group F (Borussia Dortmund, Fluminense, Mamelodi Sundowns and Ulsan HD) with 104,026, averaging 17,338.

So, how does the group stage at the 2025 Club World Cup, with an average attendance of 34,759, compare to the 1994 World Cup in the U.S.? Well, that tournament 31 years ago averaged 67,526 for group-stage attendance — not far off double what we have seen this summer.

As for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, that averaged 51,188 in the groups and the average attendance across the 380 Premier League games in 2024-25 was 40,423.

But a word of caution when comparing different competitions across different eras: this is the first edition of the rebranded Club World Cup and it is far less popular than the World Cup and the Premier League, so the lower attendance figures are to be expected.

So while crowd sizes have not been — on the whole — disastrous so far, FIFA will hope they increase during the knockout stage. And, at next year's World Cup, the sport's governing body will be desperate to avoid the scenes we have seen at several games this summer, with well over 50,000 empty seats in some stadiums.

Even so, the added prestige and global interest in the World Cup will inevitably mean higher attendances in the group stage of that tournament — although ticket prices and difficulty in reaching some out-of-town stadiums could pose a challenge.

The FIFA Club World Cup has assumed the form that “most always assumed it would eventually take: that of a summer Champions League, played out in higher temperatures and emptier stadiums with stranger kick-off times and a smaller, but still entirely familiar, European cast,” according to Liam Twomey of THE ATHLETIC. There is “hope” that revenue from Club World Cup participation can “help clubs like Flamengo keep their best players for a little longer,” though many of the European clubs taking them away are “also getting richer in the United States this summer.” Twomey: “More likely is that this new competition, which some hoped might disrupt football's established order, simply ends up reinforcing it” (THE ATHLETIC, 6/29).

BROAD PLAN: THE ATHLETIC's Adam Crafton wrote for “bums on seats, and dollars in the bank,” Miami's “backdoor route” was “probably a sound analysis of the broader American market, which is often entranced by moments and characters.” And if the Club World Cup was to “stand a chance of take-off -- particularly after many false starts” -- Inter Miami F Lionel Messi's involvement represented FIFA President Gianni Infantino “taking a shot in the last-chance saloon.” Messi became the “face of the tournament,” building on his existing relationships with Adidas and InBev (who are also FIFA sponsors) to promote the competition, while FIFA's “marketing blitz on social media and on highway billboards placed Messi front and centre” (THE ATHLETIC, 6/29).

NOT ENOUGH FIREPOWER: ESPN.com's Lizzy Becherano wrote “not even Lionel Messi could bridge the talent deficit between MLS' biggest glamour club and Europe's elite.” Before leaving as Inter coach, Gerardo “Tata” Martino “voiced concerns” over MLS's roster restrictions, “warning that the strict rules work only to hinder the teams on an international setting.” Prior to the inaugural Club World Cup match, Martino's successor, Javier Mascherano, “complained about the club's lack of transfer business ahead of the competition.” The league's “inflexible system and the tight transfer window provided to teams by FIFA left Inter Miami at a disadvantage.” The MLS roster system and designated player structure “give way for squads to often seem imbalanced.” Becherano: “The MLS setup might work against other teams within the league, but the game against PSG once again exposed the divide between European and American soccer” (ESPN.com, 6/29). Messi said that Inter Miami had “left a good image” at the Club World Cup (ESPN.com, 6/29).

ROOM TO GROW: In San Diego, Tom Krasovic wrote “don't be too hard on MLS and America's soccer dreamers, however.” MLS is “still an infant by world soccer standards” with only 30 years of existence. Krasovic: “It's unfair to expect any MLS team to consistently match the football quality of Europe's better clubs.” MLS can “still produce entertaining soccer.” It “ought to be able to create a successful niche -- if its leaders sharpen their games.” The league “still can carve out a fruitful place on the global scene.” Krasovic: “MLS must make sure its economic model continues to allow for spendy approaches like Miami's. But the wrong conclusion would be for MLS to decide that jacking up its players' salaries will result in much better soccer. MLS should look to increase players' pay, but European leagues and the Saudi League will still live in a different financial stratosphere” (SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE, 6/29).

The Germany international's huge potential looks destined to go unfulfilled after he completed a shock cut-price move to FC Copenhagen

“[There's] a young player who plays for [Borussia] Dortmund called Youssoufa Moukoko,” Eto'o told GOAL when asked who he'd love to see as Barcelona's next big signing back in October 2020. “[He's] 15 years of age, and he's the next top player, for me, after [Lionel] Messi. As Messi gets older, we could prepare the future of Barcelona very well.”

Moukoko had not made a senior appearance for Dortmund at that stage, but he was already one of the most famous young players in Europe. That's because he scored an astonishing 141 goals in 88 games for BVB at youth level, and set ridiculously high targets for himself right from the start of his football journey.

""It is my goal to become a professional player in Dortmund, capture the Champions League with Borussia, and win the Ballon d'Or,"" Moukoko said in an interview with Sport BILD when he was just 13. He achieved the first goal the day after he turned 16, and came very close to picking up a Champions League winners' medal in 2023-24 under Edin Terzic.

But it's fair to say now that Moukoko will never win the Ballon d'Or. He only played 18 minutes in Dortmund's run to the Champions League final two seasons ago, and spent the 2024-25 campaign on loan at Nice, having been deemed surplus to requirements by Terzic's replacement, Nuri Sahin.

The so-called 'African Messi' did not find redemption in Ligue 1 either, which left Dortmund with no choice but to find a permanent buyer this summer. Step forward, Copenhagen.

Moukoko completed a €5m transfer to the Danish side at the weekend, ending his nine-year affiliation with BVB without a proper goodbye to the fans. The question is: how did his career at Signal Iduna Park tank so spectacularly? GOAL takes a look...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Spain Under-21 international is being heavily linked with a summer switch to the Emirates Stadium after a meteoric rise at the Mestalla

According to transfer guru Fabrizio Romano, Arsenal have reached an agreement on personal terms with Cristhian Mosquera, the Valencia academy product who made the final shortlist for the 2024 Golden Boy award. The Gunners saw their opening bid of £12 million ($16m) rejected by Valencia, but are hopeful of concluding a deal for the 21-year-old for around £17m (£23m) as Mikel Arteta aims to bolster his defensive ranks for the 2025-26 season.

Arsenal were also credited with an interest in Dean Huijsen before his move to Real Madrid from Bournemouth, but Mosquera represents a more affordable alternative who arguably has just as much potential to unlock as his Spanish compatriot. Indeed, Mosquera looks destined to become the next major success story to emerge from Valencia's esteemed academy, following in the footsteps of legendary figures such as David Silva and Raul Albiol.

Any La Liga fans who have watched Mosquera regularly over the past two years would attest to that, as would those who caught their first glimpse of the youngster during this summer's Under-21 European Championship. Arsenal are not on the cusp of signing merely a back-up player; Mosquera can compete with William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes for regular minutes if he continues to improve at such a rapid rate.

The question is; what makes Mosquera such an exciting prospect? GOAL brings you everything you need to know about the Gunners' latest target...","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Emi Martinez continues to generate transfer talk at Aston Villa, but Tony Dorigo would be ""surprised"" if the Argentine ended up at Manchester United.

World Cup winner Martinez appeared to bid farewell to the Villa Park faithful at the end of the 2024-25 campaign. It has been suggested that, in order to comply with Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), Unai Emery will need to generate funds from sales in the summer transfer window.

Martinez is among those to have seen a move mooted, with the Argentina international having attracted interest from the Saudi Pro League. He is, however, said to be waiting on attractive offers from Europe - with Premier League giants United mulling over an upgrade to Andre Onana in their goalkeeping department.

It has been claimed that Martinez would be open to heading for Old Trafford, with former Villa defender Dorigo - who was speaking in association with William Hill - telling GOAL when asked if those rumours come as a shock: “I am surprised. I watched him a few times last season and what a passing range he has got, yet alone being a great goalkeeper. Just the ball that he can pass out from the back is superb.

“But you look at that Villa setup with the manager, he has got things going really well, there is a great group there, playing in Europe, doing well, so I am a little surprised. Maybe he thinks Manchester United will turn it around and get back into Europe. Looking at last season, that is a big ask. I think he's a top keeper, but I would be surprised if he did go to Manchester United.”

Martinez has become a two-time winner of the FIFA Best Men's Goalkeeper award, with Dorigo adding when asked if the 32-year-old should be considered the best on the planet and whether his enigmatic antics sometimes distract from his ability: “We kind of remember the garish things that he does.

“If you take that away, you can't all the time, and look at how he performs, he is superb. He is the modern goalkeeper - playing out from the back, that sweeper keeper, he can do all of that and then some, being a great shot-stopper. He commands his box and I'm hard pressed to think of anyone that is better.”

Martinez is under contract at Villa until 2029, meaning that they have no need to sell if money can be raised elsewhere. The former Arsenal custodian has taken in 212 appearances for the Villans since joining them in 2020.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

Benjamin Bonzi wasted little time in notching the first major upset at Wimbledon, where he stunned ninth seed Daniil Medvedev 7-6(2), 3-6, 7-6(3), 6-2 on Monday.

The former Nitto ATP Finals champion, Medvedev, is currently 16th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. His opening-round defeat to Bonzi at Wimbledon comes after a second-round defeat to #NextGenATP Learner Tien at the Australian Open and a first-round loss to Cameron Norrie at Roland Garros last month.



Competing on the hottest opening day ever recorded at the grass-court major, according to the Met Office, the World No. 64 Bonzi's precision and patience from the back of the court proved too much for Medvedev during their first-round clash. He also overpowered Medvedev with a relentless barrage of serving.

 “This is special for me today,” said Bonzi in his on-court interview. “This is my first Top 10 win at a Slam. Obviously, it is always special at this tournament. The atmosphere, all the courts and the grass, everything really. I love this place, so it's very special and Daniil is a great player. He has reached two semi-finals. I knew it was a tough match, but sometimes it is better to play this kind of player in the first round. Anything can happen, so I'm very happy with the win.”

With his three-hour, seven-minute victory, Bonzi is into the second round at Wimbledon for the third time in his career. It marks the first time in seven SW19 appearances that Medvedev has failed to advance past the first round.

Bonzi struck cleanly from the baseline and found great success behind his own serve, which proved clinical in the first and third set tie-breaks. After improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Medvedev and earning the second Top 10 win of his career, the Frenchman will next face Jordan Thompson.

There were two grass-court ATP 250 events last week in the leadup to Wimbledon, with ATP Tour stars competing in Eastbourne and Mallorca. Taylor Fritz claimed his fourth Eastbourne trophy and Tallon Griekspoor emerged victorious in Mallorca. ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the PIF ATP Rankings as of Monday 30 June.



No. 29 Tallon Griekspoor, +5
The Dutchman dipped outside the Top 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings in February, but has stormed back into the Top 30. Griekspoor climbed five spots this week by winning his first ATP Tour title of the season in Mallorca, where he did not lose a set throughout the week. The champion defeated French lefty Corentin Moutet in the final.

Watch Final Highlights:

No. 54 Joao Fonseca +3 (Career High)
The Brazilian star Joao Fonseca continued his ascent this week to a career-high World No. 54. The 18-year-old reached the second round in Eastbourne, where eventual champion Taylor Fritz needed two days and three tight sets to eliminate the teen.

No. 62 Learner Tien +5 (Career High)
Learner Tien advanced to his first grass-court quarter-final on the ATP Tour when he reached the last eight in Mallorca. The American lefty upset World No. 10 Ben Shelton in the second round in straight sets before falling to eventual finalist Moutet.

No. 68 Hamad Medjedovic +5
The 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic reached the quarter-finals in Mallorca, his deepest run in a tournament since making the Marseille final in February. The Serbian ousted Nishesh Basavareddy and squeaked by Roman Safiullin in a final-set tie-break before losing to Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets.

No. 69 Corentin Moutet +14
Moutet made the biggest jump of any player in the Top 100 this week thanks to his run to the Mallorca final. After losing his first set of the tournament to Pedro Martinez, the Frenchman won eight consecutive sets to make the championship match, including straight-sets triumphs against former Jeddah competitors Tien and Alex Michelsen.

 Joao Fonseca continued his habit of making an immediate impact at the majors with a classy debut showing Monday at Wimbledon. 

 The #NextGenATP Brazilian raced past home favourite Jacob Fearnley 6-4, 6-1, 7-6(5) to become the first 18-year-old to reach the second round at the grass major since Carlos Alcaraz in 2021. Competing in the sort of stifling heat he would be used to at home in Rio de Janeiro, Fonseca produced a powerful display throughout and kept his cool in his only real moment of peril, when set point down at 5-6, 30/40 in the third set. 

 “At the beginning of the match both of us were very nervous, just making our serves and there were no rallies,” reflected Fonseca, when asked about his first impressions of stepping out to compete on the All England Club's Court 1. “It's just a beautiful court. It's unbelievable, it's a dream. I'm just very happy to have had this opportunity.” 

 “I've been working a lot and believing I can play good tennis. I think the key is [to] work, believe, and dream.” 

Wise words from the young star 🌟@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/JGZzRVK4hp

 Prior to January's Australian Open, Fonseca had not played a main-draw match at a Grand Slam tournament. Yet the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion stunned then-Top 10 star Andrey Rublev in Melbourne to announce himself on the world stage. After lifting his maiden ATP Tour title in February in Buenos Aires, the Brazilian then reached the third round of a major for the first time at Roland Garros. 

 Even with those recent standout performances in mind, the way Fonseca dismantled Fearnley at Wimbledon was impressive. Although he played qualifying for the event last year, the teenager had contested only four tour-level matches on grass prior to Monday's clash. He nonetheless had no trouble bringing his clean-hitting game to his least-familiar surface against Fearnley. 

 Joao Fonseca, It All Adds Up: 





 Fonseca produced red-hot streaks to claim each of the first and third sets. He won nine straight points from 4-4, 0/40 to win the opener, before reeling off five straight points from 2/5 in the third-set tie-break to complete his win. 
 The Brazilian's serve was the foundation of his two-hour, one-minute victory. He won 84 per cent (54/64) of points behind his first delivery, while his 31 winners included 11 aces. 
 With his victory, Fonseca rose three spots to No. 51 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He now leads Fearnley 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having also prevailed in their first-round clash in Indian Wells in  March. 
 “It means a lot. It's super special for me,” said Fonseca in his on-court interview. “It's my favourite Grand Slam since my childhood. I've been watching all the matches, so it's just a pleasure being here. I'm sorry for winning against a British guy, but thanks a lot for the support here. Thanks for respecting the tennis today. Jacob is a great friend, a great player and I'm looking forward to my next meetings against him.”

 “It means a lot. It's super special for me,” said Fonseca in his on-court interview. “It's my favourite Grand Slam since my childhood. I've been watching all the matches, so it's just a pleasure being here. I'm sorry for winning against a British guy, but thanks a lot for the support here. Thanks for respecting the tennis today. Jacob is a great friend, a great player and I'm looking forward to my next meetings against him.”

Stefanos Tsitsipas was forced to retire during his Wimbledon opener on Monday due to a back injury, with French qualifier Valentin Royer advancing to the second round on his debut at The Championships.

Royer led 6-3, 6-2 against the Greek, who received a medical timeout in the second set due to a back issue. The former World No. 3 Tsitsipas looked in discomfort at times during the 74 minutes on court and struggled with his movement and serve, making just 43 per cent of his first deliveries. Last week, Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill stated that the Greek had struggled with his back when practising with the Italian.

“It's tough to describe. I'm battling many wars these days,” Tsitsipas said following his retirement. “It's really painful to see myself in a situation like this. One thing that I absolutely hate doing is retiring or stopping a match, but I've never pictured myself being in a situation like this multiple times since the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin a couple of years back.

“Since that time, I've been very fragile with my body, and I've been battling a war of feeling healthy and feeling comfortable going to the extremes, which has been a difficult battle. So I really don't know. I feel like I'm left without answers. I don't know. I've tried everything. I've done an incredible job with my fitness. I've done an incredible job with my physiotherapy, so I've maximised on everything that I possibly can do. Right now I'm just absolutely left with no answers. I don't know what to do.”

Tsitsipas, coached by former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, leaves SW19 holding a 19-13 record on the season. The 26-year-old is the second men's seed to fall on Day 1, joining Daniil Medvedev.
Tsitsipas is currently 22nd in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, having failed to advance beyond the third round in any of his previous five events. The Greek is a former champion at the Nitto ATP Finals, competing at the prestigious year-end event on five consecutive occasions from 2019 to 2023. Tsitsipas' best result this year came in Dubai, where he lifted his 12th tour-level trophy.
“It's probably the most difficult situation that I've ever been faced with, because it's an ongoing issue that doesn't seem to be disappearing or fading off as much,” Tsitsipas added on his back issues. “Myself, as a person, I have a limit at some point, so I'll definitely have to have my final answer on whether I want to do stuff or not in the next couple of months.
“This is going to be hard, but if I see it going in that trajectory, there is no point at competing. If I'm not healthy, and I've talked about health so many times, if health is not there, then your whole tennis life becomes miserable.”
Royer was competing in just his second main-draw match at a major, having lost in the opening round at Roland Garros last month. The Frenchman, currently No. 99 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, fired 22 winners across the two sets against Tsitsipas and will next meet countryman Adrian Mannarino.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=atp+tennis","Fognini forces fifth set against Alcaraz in Wimbledon opener","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/alcaraz-fognini-wimbledon-2025-monday","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:29:52 GMT","

Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare on his return to Centre Court Monday, when he overcame Fabio Fognini and the intense London heat to reach the second round in five sets.

On the hottest opening day on record at The Championships, with temperatures reaching 31.4C, Alcaraz was made to work extremely hard against a free-hitting Fognini, who was competing at Wimbledon for the final time. In a topsy-turvy battle, which featured first-class shotmaking, Alcaraz showed his trademark grit to triumph 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 in four hours and 37 minutes. The Spaniard now holds a standout 14-1 fifth-set record, recently defeating Jannik Sinner in the Roland Garros final.

“I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because with the level he has shown, he can still play three or four more years,” said Alcaraz. “I have to give him credit for such a great match. Fabio is such a great player, he has shown in his whole career the level he has. I'm just a little bit sad that it's his last Wimbledon, but happy to have shared the court with him.”

Carlitos strikes again ☄️The defending champion battles past Fognini in an absolute five-set thriller, taking the win 7-5 6-7 7-5 2-6 6-1 🔥@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/XQw9T2Ycqg

Alcaraz arrived in London having won his past 18 matches – the longest winning streak of his career. Aiming to join Bjorn Borg and become just the second man in history to win the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years, few would have expected Alcaraz to struggle against the 38-year-old Fognini, who as the third oldest man in the men's singles draw, stepped onto court on the back of a 10-match tour-level losing streak.

Yet for periods, Alcaraz was in real trouble on Centre Court. With David Beckham watching on in the Royal Box, Alcaraz rallied from a break down in the third set and finally put the Italian to bed in a dominant fifth set. With his win, the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings avoided becoming just the third defending champion to lose in the first round. Manuel Santana fell in 1967 and Lleyton Hewitt in 2003.

“Playing the first match on Centre Court is never easy,” said Alcaraz. “I have been playing on grass pretty well, but Wimbledon is special. I can feel the difference between Wimbledon and the other tournaments. I just try to play the best I could, but I would say it could be better. I have to improve.”

Alcaraz also maintained his perfect first-round record at majors (18-0) and extended his winning streak at Wimbledon to 15 matches. He will next meet British qualifier Oliver Tarvet after the 21-year-old beat Swiss Leandro Riedi 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to earn victory on his major debut.

Alcaraz is chasing his sixth title of the season, highlighted by his fifth major at Roland Garros and ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome. Earlier this month, Alcaraz triumphed at The Queen's Club for the second time.



Alcaraz was not at his fluid best in his first set back on Centre Court since defeating Novak Djokovic in last year's final. The World No. 2 saved all five break points he faced in the opener and produced the key bit of magic on the Italian's serve at 5-5, lifting a lob over Fognini to gain the decisive break.

Alcaraz was unable to push on after winning the opener and struggled for consistency in the second set, committing 20 unforced errors to 13 winners. He was punished in the second-set tie-break when Fognini levelled on his fourth set point after Alcaraz pushed a short forehand wide.

In an entertaining third set, which featured full-length dives from both players, Fognini won one of the points of the tournament to move to break point on the Alcaraz serve when trailing 3-5.

The Italian pulled the Spaniard from side to side with his aggressive baseline hitting before he moved forward to push Alcaraz deep into the forehand corner with a volley. On the stretch, the Spaniard managed to hit the baseline with a lob, but the Italian replied with a fierce overhead before knocking away a backhand volley. The Italian raised his arms aloft and punched the air before he earned the break back on the following point.

Alcaraz would not be denied, though. He increased his intensity and consistency in the fierce heat to break the Italian in the 12th game and lead again.

Fognini refused to go away, however, and opened his shoulders to hit his flat backhand through the court during a red-hot fourth set. The ball flew through the burning London air to the tune of 14 winners in the set, with the Italian forcing a fifth set to the delight of the packed crowd.

Fognini's fifth-set record — 24 wins to 16 losses, including his legendary comeback against Rafael Nadal at the 2015 US Open — showed his fighting spirit. But on what was his final Wimbledon appearance, the former Top 10 star's magic finally ran dry as Alcaraz pulled away to claim victory in the decider.

Alcaraz, now 43-5 on the year, is aiming to become the fifth man to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles. Following his victory, Alcaraz joined the crowd in giving Fognini a standing ovation off court.

Tennis

Carlos Alcaraz is a walking tennis highlight reel, but the two seconds that best explain his brilliance on grass don't involve him hitting the ball at all.

A few times each match, Alcaraz will end up on defense in his backhand corner. His opponent will hit an approach shot and then go on the attack, transitioning from the back of the court to the front. Alcaraz will turn his shoulders to his left, extend his right arm and curve his racket down and around the outside of the ball, slicing it back.

As soon as he makes contact, the stopwatch starts.

The ball will arc from his opponent's right to their left, cutting through the air and getting lower and lower. As it floats, Alcaraz moves. The opponent might not realize it yet, but the point is flipping. The balance of power shifts, as the ball crosses the net and Alcaraz follows it forward.

Sometimes it will bounce, sometimes it won't. In either case, the opponent has gone from a position of power to a position of weakness, even with Alcaraz out of position. Against most players, nothing more than an average volley or pick-up would win the point. Against the two-time Wimbledon champion, only a brilliant, perhaps absurd shot will keep them in it.

Those two seconds explain why the other 127 players in the Wimbledon men's singles draw have one big problem: Alcaraz on grass. On Saturday he said that he thinks grass produces the loveliest tennis in the world.

“The style that the people bring to the court when they play on grass, I think is so beautiful,” he said.

“The sound of the ball. The movement is really tough, but when you get it, it's kind of you're flying.”

He would say that, about just about any surface. He has already won five Grand Slam titles at 22. Two on grass, two on clay, and one on hard courts. He would probably win a Grand Slam played on the moon.

Still, the two-time defending Wimbledon champion did something especially absurd the past couple weeks. He won the French Open on the clay of Roland Garros in Paris, took a few days to relax in Ibiza, Spain, and then went to Queen's Club in London to play a grass tune-up, where he waltzed to the title on the strength of the weakest part of his tennis: his serve.

It has long been the missing link in his game, but of late he has joked about wanting to be a serve bot, after changing his motion and learning to be more accurate, more often. If he serves like he did at Queen's, then the All England Club might save some time by handing him the trophy this week, instead of going through the formality of 127 matches. He averaged 12 aces per match and half of his first serves went unreturned. Across the past 52 weeks of tennis, Alcaraz has received no reply to 33 percent of his first serves.

That is a big jump, but the scariest thing about this is that Alcaraz hasn't won 27 of his 30 career matches on grass by being a serve bot. Last year's Wimbledon final apart, he's won most of them by not relying on it at all. He's even won some of them in spite of it. It's not even about the power of his groundstrokes, which are as much of an audio experience as they are a visual one.

That's because the Alcaraz of grass, or “grasscaraz” as he would have it, is a different experience to the Alcaraz of acrylic and clay — especially clay, on which he is also the best male player in the world. On grass, it's his footwork, his speed and his touch that propel him to victory. He does his most devastating work in the negative space: when the ball is floating over the net and when his opponent has it on their racket.

Tommy Paul, the No. 13 seed at Wimbledon, may be more qualified to talk about this than anyone. Last summer, Paul made the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and at the Paris Olympics, where the tennis was played at Roland Garros. He faced Alcaraz in both matches, 22 days apart.

Paul described the two experiences as he chomped on a sandwich in the mixed zone at Roland Garros, before heading back onto the court for a doubles match with Taylor Fritz. He won a set on the grass, and lost in straight sets on the clay, but that was best of three.

“On the clay, you can kind of escape some points,” he said.

“You can go from defense to neutral a little easier. On the grass, once you're on defense with him, it's pretty difficult to get out of that defensive position. He's so aggressive and closes the net so well.”

Players talk about feeling smothered when they play Alcaraz, of feeling like no matter what they do, he can get on top of them out of nowhere. Once he's in command of a point on grass, it's basically impossible to wrestle control back. At Queen's, he won 76 percent of the points in which he got into an attacking position.

But like those two seconds in which it looks like nothing is happening when everything is happening, Alcaraz's superpower emerges when he is behind, not ahead.

He is ridiculously fast. He's especially adept at taking those small steps that allow players to maintain their balance at high speed on the grass, stopping and pivoting out of tight spaces. That helps, but he also has the skill that makes the greatest player faster than everyone else: anticipation. The ability to see where the ball is going before it's actually going there.

“Not waiting to notice it when it comes over the net, but waiting for it when it comes off your opponent's racquet,” three-time Wimbledon champion Chris Evert said during a video call earlier this month.

This is why Alcaraz has a win rate on the grass that matches Rafael Nadal's on clay, albeit over a small sample size. It doesn't come from the kind of grass-court tennis that grows out of a dominating serve, the creed of seven-time champion Pete Sampras. It's closer to that of eight-time champion Roger Federer — but Alcaraz is getting closer to possessing the serve accuracy that made Federer's life even easier. If he unites those two poles, watch out.

Paul Annacone coached both those players.

“The best person on grass right now is Alcaraz, because he is this combination of Roger and Andre [Agassi],” Annacone said during a recent interview. “He can take it early and be on top of the net before you blink.”

It's what he does in that two-second window of genius. Alcaraz will sprint to catch up with a backhand and knife a short slice that passes just inches above the net. The opponent will chase in after it and have to hit the ball up, and Alcaraz, more often than not, is right there to intercept it and put it away. That's anticipation, but it's also the skill of that curving, arcing slice, and the seconds it buys him to turn a regulation volley for his opponent into a pressure shot that needs to be perfect to win the point.

He wins when he is in attack, and he steals the point when he is in defense. That's essentially unbeatable, especially if his serve is firing like it did at Queen's.

Alcaraz, who first played on grass in 2019 as junior at a tournament in Roehampton and then at Wimbledon, uses this two-shot combination on every court. But it's on grass, where the movement delta between him and everybody else not named Novak Djokovic is widest — and where time is more precious than any other surface — that it is most effective.

During his title run at Queen's, Alcaraz won 37 percent of points when his opponent was on the attack. The average for the rest of the draw was 27 percent.

At Wimbledon, Alcaraz stole 36 percent of those points in 2024 and 37 percent in 2023. In 2022, when he was still finding his way, his steal score was just 30 percent.

In last year's final against Novak Djokovic, he stole 39 percent of points, luring errors from Djokovic's racket on the volley. In his quarterfinal against Paul, he stole 45 percent.

“He can explode, stop and start before most people can think,” Annacone said.

Alcaraz said Saturday there is a fit between how he likes to play and the kind of tennis that excels on grass.

“I really want to hit slices, dropshots, going to the net all the time, playing aggressively,” he said.  “It's the style that you have to play.”

The funny thing about Alcaraz is he's often not great about talking about what makes him great. He's such an instinctive player that he often surprises himself with how good he is. After he won at Queens, he explained how low his expectations were about making the transition from clay to grass. He had just two days of practice on it before the tournament.

“It's really complicated,” he said of the switch. “I just came here with a goal to play two, three matches, to try to feel great on the grass and to give myself the feedback of what I have to improve, what I have to do better. But, you know, I just got used to the grass really quick.”

Indeed, he did, especially considering that it's not even his favorite surface. Clay is his favorite, he said. That figures, given he's the two-time defending French Open champion, too.

Men who play professional tennis really do have a big problem.

Tennis phenom and WNBA fan, Coco Gauff is ready to take on the grass courts of Wimbledon's garden-party, Grand Slam tournament. Coming off her recent win at Roland Garros, this young superstar is not letting up. At just 21, Gauff snatched her second Grand Slam title, she beat number one seated Aryna Sabalenka in a legendary win. 

According to WTA, Gauff's favorite artist is Beyoncè which is fitting because Coco is dedicated to constantly improving her aggressive, big serve game. And to win at the majors a player must have that “I grind till I own it,” type grit.

Gauff's favorite tennis players are the indomitable Williams sisters whose tenacity and fearlessness made her want to become a professional tennis player.

Born in Delray Beach, Florida, Coco started playing tennis at age 6. Both of her parents were athletes, Corey Gauff, a Georgia State basketball player and her mother, Candi Gauff wowed in gymnastics before competing in track and field at Florida State University. 

Coached by Jean Christophe Faurel and Matt Daly, Coco first cracked the Top 50 of women's tennis on February 24, 2020 coming in at No.49, after an appearance at Australian Open. At that major,  Coco defeated her idol Venus Williams in the first round and in the third round Gauff beat her first top five ranked opponent, Naomi Osaka.

Going three for three in finals in 2024, Coco won Auckland, Beijing, and a historic first Women's Tennis Association Riyadh title. With that success, she took home a record $4.8 million in prize money, the most ever awarded in women's professional sport. At the same event she defeated the No.1 and No.2 ranked players in the world, according to WTA. 

In 2023 winning on home soil at the US Open, Gauff took home three more titles, marking her first WTA 1000 title at Cincinnati and debut WTA 500 title at Washington DC, in addition to WTA 250 Auckland. 

Check out some of Coco's most memorable moments below:

The last trophies before the All England Club's show were handed out this weekend.

With Wimbledon kicking off this Monday, some well-known faces on the WTA and ATP tours have taken advantage of the final preparation tournaments to pick up a title and a fair amount of confidence.

A week after her unexpected marathon on her debut at the WTA 500 in Berlin, where she was the defending champion (losing 6-7(8), 7-5, 7-6(5) in 3h21 to Liudmila Samsonova), Jessica Pegula set the record straight. Still in Germany, but this time at Bad Homburg, the American was crowned for the second time in her career on grass thanks to four fine victories.

Although she needed three sets to get past Emma Navarro in the quarters and then Linda Noskova in the last four, she did not lose a set in the final against Iga Swiatek (6-4, 7-5 in 1h46), who has not won a trophy since Roland-Garros 2024. More aggressive, the Pole hit 30 winners (including 9 aces) but committed 39 unforced errors, a far too high total to hope to overcome ""Jpeg"". However, it was a positive week for her, as she reached her first final on grass – beating Jasmine Paolini in the semi-finals – and climbed back up to World No.4 on Monday.

""This tournament showed that there is hope for me on grass"", said Iga, who has been very unsuccessful on this surface since the start of her career.

For Pegula, who is one place spot ahead of Swiatek on the rankings, this third title of the year (after Austin and Charleston in the spring) comes at just the right time before taking part in another Major, undoubtedly more open than the other Grand Slam events.

""I feel like it's been that way for a few years now"", she told the press on her arrival at SW19, just 24 hours after her victory. ""With Marketa [Vondrousova], Barbora [Krejcikova], Elena [Rybakina] winning, it's a tricky surface. Honestly, I feel like it's not lucky but there's a lot of weird points and momentum swings and when someone's serving well, there's not much you can really do. Sometimes it's one let chord, you get the break, and the person wins the match.""

As a reminder, Jessica Pegula and Iga Swiatek were placed in the same half of the draw last Friday and could meet again in the semi-finals in London. But the road to the last four – with first matches respectively against Elisabetta Cocciaretto and Polina Kudermetova on Tuesday – promises to be long and particularly tricky.

Also on Saturday, the final of the WTA 250 at Eastbourne brought out the best in the new generation as it featured Maya Joint (19) against the revelation of the season Alexandra Eala (20). At the end of an intense match full of drama, the Australian lifted her second trophy of the season (after Rabat in May), but not without saving four match points in an unbreathable tie-break (6-4, 1-6, 7-6(10))!

""It was a very difficult match. That third set, I'm proud of myself for coming back and staying in the match. I think Alex played well today,"" Joint said. ""She definitely tested me. I think after the first set, she got a lot more aggressive with her balls. I was on the back foot, I felt like, for most of the match. I just needed to try to find a way to get back into it.""

Crowned twice in the last four events in which she has taken part, Joint will now be able to focus on a very difficult first round at Wimbledon, where she will face Liudmila Samsonova.

Taylor Fritz, who has already won the title in 2019, 2022 and 2024 in the south-east of England, added his name for the fourth time at this ATP 250 tournament by beating his compatriot Jenson Brooksby in the final (7-5, 6-1). Despite a break down in the first set, the American, who beat Joao Fonseca, Marcos Giron and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in three sets, came back to tie the score before unleashing his tennis to become the second most successful active player on grass (5) behind Novak Djokovic (8).

""I don't know what exactly it is about it, but I come here and always feel like I'm playing great tennis"", tried to explain the world No.4. ""It's always a great week for me. I think it always going to be a special place for me because it's where I won my first tour title.""

Placed in the bottom half (Carlos Alcaraz's section) of the Wimbledon draw, Fritz, who also won in Stuttgart a fortnight ago, is obviously one of the main candidates for final victory, although he will have to play a tricky first round against France's Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.

What could be better for building confidence and boosting sensations than a week without losing a single set before playing a Grand Slam? Not much, as Tallon Griekspoor can attest. In sunny Mallorca, the Dutchman won the third title of his career thanks to flawless victories over Ethan Quinn, Gabriel Diallo, Félix Auger-Aliassime and finally Corentin Moutet in the final (7-5, 7-6(3)). A very tight final match played out in particularly difficult conditions.

""It was super warm again. I guess when you have some nerves it feels twice as warm as it is"", Griekspoor explained following his success. ""I guess the wind was saving both of us a little bit. But it was hot, it was warm, such a battle. Happy with the result in the end. I think I served great in the tie-break and throughout the match. He made it very, very difficult for me. But like I said, finals are not easy to play, but happy with the win.""

Seeded No.31 at Wimbledon, Griekspoor will have to draw inspiration from Taylor Fritz in his opening match against Jenson Brooksby.","{'href': 'https://www.rolandgarros.com', 'title': 'Roland Garros'}","tennis"

LONDON (AP) — Ninth-seeded Daniil Medvedev is out of another Grand Slam tournament in the first round after losing to 64th-ranked Benjamin Bonzi 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2 at Wimbledon on Monday.

The 2.01-meter (6-foot-6) Russian, a semifinalist at the All England Club the last two years, also exited the French Open in the first round. And that followed a second-round loss at the Australian Open to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien.

“For the moment, I'm not that worried,” said Medvedev, who is ranked No. 9. “If I finish the year somewhere around (No.) 15 in the world, maybe I will be more worried. For the moment, I am not.”

The last time Medvedev lost consecutive Grand Slam first-round matches was in 2017 — at Melbourne Park in his major tournament debut, followed by Roland-Garros.

Medvedev lost in five sets to Cameron Norrie in Paris this year. In 2023, the Russian was seeded No. 2 at Roland-Garros and lost in the first round to Thiago Seyboth Wild, a qualifier who was ranked 172nd at the time.

Ahead of Wimbledon, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff showed that they had put any differences aside when they performed a TikTok dance together last week.

After Gauff defeated Sabalenka at Roland Garros earlier this month to win the French Open, Sabalenka made some controversial comments as she stated that she believed Gauff won not because she played great, but because Sabalenka did not perform well in the poor conditions and was overly emotional. Sabalenka went on to say she thought that Iga Swiatek would have defeated Gauff had she beaten Sabalenka in the semifinal.

Sabalenka received lots of backlash for her comments, and Gauff disagreed, pointing out that she had defeated Swiatek recently in straight sets. Sabalenka went on to release a statement and acknowledged that Gauff earned her victory. 

Sabalenka additionally messaged Gauff privately to apologize, and said she learned her lesson from her comments. 

""We've always been really good with Coco,"" Sabalenka said over the weekend. ""Honestly, as I said in my statement and in my message to her, I didn't want to offend her. I was just completely upset with myself and emotions got over me and I just completely lost it. ... I messaged her to apologize and make sure she understood that I didn't mean to offend her. And of course, she has my respect, she knew it, she knows it. I'm happy that she was like, 'All good, don't worry.' And yeah, as you saw in the video, we were good, we were friends. So, I hope the U.S. media can be easy on me right now.""

""I did what I did and I got what I deserved, I believe. It was a tough time for me. ... The lesson is learned and definitely not going to happen again.""

On Gauff's end, she said it was not hard to accept Sabalenka's apology and that she understood where Sabalenka was coming from with some of her comments after the French Open.

""I understood what she was trying to say,"" Gauff said. ""It was a terrible conditioned day. I don't think I was playing well either, so I understood where she was coming from. Some of the stuff she said in the presser I was a bit more surprised about. I'm not someone to hold a grudge, and when I was talking to my circle about it, I was like 'If she apologizes, I will be fine and we'll move on.' 

""She did, and she did again when I saw her before our practice,"" Gauff continued. ""It was water under a bridge. I know Aryna, and I felt like before that we got along pretty well anyway. It wasn't very hard to accept that apology. ... That [Tiktok] was to show people we are on good terms. ... I thought it would be a good idea for that so people could see it and move on because I think we're both tired of talking about it.""

SportsTak Desk

UPDATED: Jun 30, 2025 06:43 AM IST



With Wimbledon 2025 just around the corner, Coco Gauff has finally opened up about the comments made by Aryna Sabalenka following their intense showdown in the Roland Garros final. The American tennis star, who clinched her second Grand Slam title after a hard-fought 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 victory over Sabalenka, offered a calm and mature perspective on what many considered demeaning remarks from her rival.





Sabalenka had stirred headlines post-match by saying she was “too emotional” during the final and even claimed that Iga Swiatek would have beaten Gauff had the final featured those two instead. While many perceived the comments as dismissive of Gauff's achievement, the 20-year-old champion chose to rise above the controversy.

“It was a terrible condition day” – Coco Gauff shows maturity



During her pre-tournament press conference at Wimbledon, Gauff broke her silence, revealing what she communicated to her team in the aftermath of Aryna Sabalenka's remarks.

“Yeah, I mean, obviously, some people are critiquing what she said in the speech. I didn't really care about any of that because I know how it feels, and I understood what she was trying to say,” Coco Gauff explained.

“It was a terrible condition day. I don't think I was playing well either, so I understood where she was coming from with that.”

The 2023 US Open champion acknowledged that some of the things said during Sabalenka's post-match press conference caught her off guard, but she didn't dwell on it.



Forgiveness and closure'

Rather than holding a grudge, Coco Gauff took the high road, emphasizing that private acknowledgment was all she needed to move on.

“Obviously some of the stuff that was said in the presser, I think I was a bit more surprised about, but yeah, I'm not someone to hold a grudge.

“When people I was talking to in my circle about it, I was like, if she apologises, not even publicly, it was just more so privately, I will be fine and we'll move on.

“And she did, and she did again when I saw her before her practice and, yeah, it's just water under a bridge.”

Gauff also clarified that their relationship had always been cordial before the incident and that she believed Aryna Sabalenka's comments were misunderstood.

“I felt like before that we got along pretty well anyways before all that happened, so it wasn't very hard to accept that apology.

“And, yeah, I understand things weren't, I guess, translated as how she meant it to be, and she understood that, and I understood that's not what she meant.”

Looking ahead to Wimbledon

The practice session between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka on Centre Court has turned heads ahead of the tournament, signaling that whatever tension existed between them may now be firmly in the past. Gauff's poised and graceful response, coupled with her determination to focus on the game, speaks volumes about her growth both on and off the court.

Follow live updates and scores from Day 1 of the Championships at the All England Club in London

The 2025 Championships at Wimbledon are upon us as the All England Club opens its doors to the tennis world once again. 

Carlos Alcaraz is eyeing a third consecutive title at SW19, and opens up proceedings on Centre Court on Monday against Italian journeyman Fabio Fognini. Third seed Alexander Zverev is also in action on Monday, while British No 2 Jacob Fearnley faces highly-rated Brazilian Joao Fonseca.

On the women's side, Emma Raducanu begins her Wimbledon campaign on Court 1 on Monday against British wild card Mingge Xu. Raducanu is the third match on court. 

British No 2 Katie Boulter faces a tough first round test against ninth seed Paula Badosa in the second match on Centre Court, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka is also in action on Day 1. 

Follow live coverage of Wimbledon with The Independent's live blog below:

The rollercoaster continues! Two double faults put Raducanu under pressure, and Xu eventually breaks back - again! Raducanu leads 6-3, 3-2. 

Three breaks on the trot in this one as Raducanu wrestles back control, breaking Mimi Xu for a 3-1 lead in this second set. Can she back up the break this time? 

It's doubtful Carlos Alcaraz will need to be told. If the effervescent, at times mesmerising, 22-year-old Spaniard wants to claim his third consecutive Wimbledon title, he'll have to play a damn sight better than he did here on day one. For tennis's hottest property, this was a stutter of a start.

Gasps were aplenty at last Friday's draw ceremony when wily old fox Fabio Fognini was picked to face the defending champion. The old-school maverick is entering his final months on tour and, at the age of 38, seemed a routine first round conquest for Alcaraz, himself on an 18-match win-streak following his French Open triumph against Jannik Sinner. Yet the inspired Italian thrived in a final big-match moment here, conducting the 15,000 in attendance with a brash arrogance even if, in the end, he came up short.

Ultimately, Alcaraz prevailed in five captivating sets, emerging triumphant via a 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 scoreline, over four-and-a-half hours, on the hottest opening day in Wimbledon history. New knights of the realm Gareth Southgate and David Beckham endured their fair share of unconvincing victories in England colours and they witnessed another one here, perched in the front row of the Royal Box.

Kieran Jackson reports from Wimbledon:

What's this?! Raducanu races to 40-0 on serve courtesy of some brilliant serving but is pegged back to deuce - and Xu breaks back at the first time of asking! 

This was Fabio Fognini's last ever match at Wimbledon before bidding farewell to the sport. After that performance, Carlos Alcaraz isn't sure why!

“I don't know why this is his last Wimbledon, he can still play,” he said. “Unbelievable, I have to give him the credit. A great match, he's a great player. 

“A little bit sad that it's his last Wimbledon but happy to have shared the court with him so many times.”

Mimi Xu has grown into this match but has her resistance been broken? She had chances to hold in a mammoth service game but was eventually broken after multiple deuces. 

Emma Raducanu leads the teenager 6-3, 2-0. 

CARLOS ALCARAZ GETS IT DONE!

In a back-and-forth final game fitting of the match as a whole, Alcaraz holds to 15 to put an all-time classic Wimbledon first rounder to bed.

Fognini pushed the second seed to the limit, but when the pressure was on, Alcaraz's quality shone through.

What. A. Match.

Fogioni holds to 30 after another nervy service game in this fifth set.

He's on the board. Now, an on-fire Alcaraz serves for the match.

Elsewhere, Felix Auger-Aliassime has finally won that five-set epic against James Duckworth. 

Harriet Dart is now locked in a decider against Dalma Galfi, having split the first two sets 6-3 each.

Marketa Vondrousova has been pegged back to 5-4 from a 3-0 lead, after taking the first set 6-1, but she's serving for the match now.

And Henry Searle - boys' champion here two years ago - is staring down the barrel of defeat, 5-1 down to Ethan Quinn in the fourth set and two sets to one down. 

The wind is fully in Alcaraz's sails now!

Ace after ace, unreturned serve after unreturned serve, and the Spaniard holds to love.

He looked really out of sorts after the fourth set, but Alcaraz is now on the verge of getting through the first round unscathed.

I don't know why it is Fabio's last Wimbledon because the level he has shown shows he can still play for three or four more years.

I have to give him the credit for such a great match. He has shown the level and talent he has throughout his whole career and he has shown that once again today, so I'm just a bit sad that this is probably his last Wimbledon. I'm happy to have shared the court and locker room many times with him. We got to enjoy the last of him.

What. A. Match. 🤩Carlos Alcaraz wins an epic duel in the sun against Fabio Fognini, 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/JF9prwRk1q

The two players share a lovely embrace at the net and walk together to shake the umpire's hand. Alcaraz walks back onto court and points to Fognini for the crowd to give him some applause. Which they do. Amazing scenes.

The entire Royal Box are on their feet clapping. This is probably the last time Fognini will play on Centre and he gave it everything.

A touch of class from Carlos Alcaraz, who leads the applause for Fabio Fognini 👏#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/ZiRn7ya2aJ

Unreturned serve to open the game from Alcaraz followed by a drop shot winner, 30-0. Fognini stays alive with a forehand return winner down the line.

Another unreturned first serve gives Alcaraz his first match point. Top spin second serve into the corner, Fognini nets a backhand return.

GAME SET MATCH ALCARAZ!!!!!

Tremendous ovation from the Centre Court crowd as Fognini walks to the near side for what might be his last service game of the match. He deserves it because he has put on a show and given the fans value for their money.

Fognini drills a backhand into the corner for a winner, 40-30 and finishes the game in style, drilling a forehand winner down the line.

Alcaraz to serve for the match next!

Alcaraz wants this over and done with. He holds to love in about a minute and is now a game away from the match.

How will that delay impact things now? It starts brightly for Fognini as he builds a 40-15 lead. Alcaraz fights back and makes it decue then earns a break point.

Fognini saves it with a forehand winner but faces another break point against him when he nets a volley. Fognini miscues a backhand long and Alcaraz breaks.

Game over I think!

Rather repugnant scenes in this suspension of play on Centre Court. As a spectator is treated for what we should pray is ‘only' sunstroke, other fans whip out their phones to try to get selfies with Alcaraz. Utterly shameless.

Light applause from the crowd as the elderly woman is carried out on a chair by paramedics. Play about to resume on Centre.

Alcaraz is at one end of the court, keeping an eye on what is happening and twirling his racket. Fognini is at the other end, talking to his support box. 

No sign of any paramedics yet. But a chair is being brought out it appears.

Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur was reduced to tears after she was forced to retire from her round one match.

Jabeur was first out on Court 14 but after just 26 minutes of action in her match against Viktoriya Tomova disaster struck.

The Tunisian looked visibly distressed sat on her courtside seat and a medical time-out was called. 

She had her blood pressure taken and her vitals were checked before she was taken away off court for further examination. 

Despite a valiant attempt to return to play, Jabeur eventually made the call to retire.

'I wasn't expecting not to feel good,' Jabeur said in a statement after it was decided she would no hold a press conference.

'I've been practising pretty well in the last few days but I guess these things happen.

'I'm really sad. It doesn't really help me with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it was a very tough season for me. 

'So I hope I'm going to feel better and we'll see what's going to happen.'

The delay to treat Jabeur lasted 14 minutes before she attempted valiantly to try and play on.

But early in the second set with the sun beaming down and delivering scorching hot temperatures, Jabeur elected to retire.

The Tunisian was down 7-6, 2-0 when she brought an early finish to the contest. ","{'href': 'https://www.dailymail.co.uk', 'title': 'Daily Mail'}","tennis"

Most mornings you can find DJ Bennett, Belleview's first tennis champion in school history, in Auburn's tennis training facility recovering from an oblique strain. Through rounds of dead bugs and planks, Bennett prepares for her next chance to qualify for the U.S. Open before her 22nd birthday.

Just 10 years ago Bennett was forming the dream of playing professional tennis. In November, Bennett, Auburn's first NCAA women's singles finalist earned a slot in the first American Collegiate Wildcard Playoff. The first of four events Bennett will use to qualify for the U.S. Open in August.

""Every young tennis player dream about it, but not many people get to say that they're actually doing it,"" Bennett said. ""So yeah, 11-year-old, they would definitely be freaking out and would be proud.""

July marks a busy run of tournaments for Bennett. Her first tournament of the month is the McLeod for Health Florence Open in Florence, South Carolina during July 21-27. Then Bennett heads to Lexington, Kentucky for The Lexington Open that begins a day later on July 28. Weeks before the start of Auburn's 2025-26 season begins, the Tiger standout will compete in the Women's 35K ITF tournament in Southaven, Mississippi starting Aug. 4.

Those three opportunities are all less than a month away from the start of the 2025 U.S. Open. The draws for each tournament haven't released yet but there's an opportunity for Bennett to win prize money and her first taste of the biggest stage in American professional tennis.

 ""It was a long build up,” Bennett said. “I knew that I was in the event for November, since I made it to the finals of NCAA. I had a lot longer like mentally to prepare, knowing that I was going to be playing that event for like seven months.""

Now that eight months have passed Bennett is a strong tournament run from her first opportunity to make the U.S. Open main draw, but the hunt is far from over. Bennett is still a rising star in her sport. As a junior in college, she's in the perfect position to grow towards her childhood dreams.

Whether the 11-year-old girl who watches in wonder behind Bennett's mature exterior realizes or not the professional ranks are calling her name. With the trajectory she's on the phone won't stop ringing any time soon.

""It's nice that they have that option as well but that doesn't necessarily mean that it could go to like a college player,"" Bennett said. ""It could go to another American playing those tournaments, but it's still like a good opportunity and a good chance to have another shot at making it to New York in August.""","{'href': 'https://www.ocala.com', 'title': 'Ocala StarBanner'}","tennis"

The US Open stands at the center of a heated debate after tennis legend Martina Navratilova strongly criticized the tournament's new mixed doubles format. The controversy erupted when World No. 1 Jannik Sinner talked about his unexpected pairing with Emma Navarro by tournament officials without any prior communication between the players.

Speaking at a Wimbledon press conference, Sinner shared details about the unusual arrangement: “It was very unexpected, to be honest. I just met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked. We never texted to each other. It's actually a funny story. The tournament, they wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up.”

This revelation sparked outrage from Navratilova, who expressed her concerns through a series of tweets.

The tennis icon, who won 10 mixed doubles Grand Slam titles during her career, did not hold back in her criticism of the USTA's decision. The fact that the new format prioritizes entertainment over competition is what got on Navratilova's nerves.

The United States Tennis Association announced major changes to the mixed doubles championship earlier this year, moving the event from the main tournament week to August 19-20, 2025, during qualifying week. The new format reduces the field from 32 teams to just 16, with eight teams earning direct entry based on combined singles rankings and eight receiving wild card entries.

A STAR-STUDDED 🤩 lineup of teams have officially entered the reimagined US Open Mixed Doubles Championship!

The matches will follow a shortened format with sets played to four games instead of six, featuring no-ad scoring and tiebreaks at 4-4. Only the final will be played in the traditional format to six games. The prize money has been significantly increased to $1 million for the winning team, up from the previous $200,000.

Navratilova expressed her thoughts on the new changes and the pairing done by the USTA on X. She wrote: “It's an exhibition and I am fine with that. Shame for the people who specialize in doubles and mixed and many will miss out on the opportunity to play and make some good money. I hope it's not counted as a real tournament.”

— Martina Navratilova (@Martina) June 29, 2025

When a fan explained that the tournament will count as a standard GS Mixed, the tennis legend voiced her frustration. She stated the decision as wrong as she wrote: “How can it count when it is an exhibition where highly ranked doubles players who don't get a chance to play at all? That is just wrong. Makes a mockery of the title…just imo.”

— Martina Navratilova (@Martina) June 29, 2025

This new format faced sharp criticism from the defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as they declared the changes as “profoundly wrong” and a “profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players.”

Excitement has been building since the USTA revealed the initial 16 teams that signed up for the revamped US Open mixed doubles event earlier this month.The entry list produced a few surprising duos to say the least, including the one that landed on top of the combined entry rankings. That team? Three-time major winner Jannik Sinner and 2024 US Open semifinalist Emma Navarro.“It was very unexpected, to be honest,” laughed Sinner when asked about the partnership during his Wimbledon media day press conference over the weekend.

Nick Kyrgios has not played tennis on the ATP Tour since the Miami 2025 Masters 1000 in March

The days follow one another and look the same for Nick Kyrgios. Troubled by injuries for the past two years, the Australian player has not been able to return to full strength on the ATP Tour. While he had planned to play the grass and Wimbledon season, he finally announced his withdrawal on June 3.

Kyrgios confirms his intention to return to the circuit this summer, in Washington, and intends to also play the US Open and UTS in Hong Kong (October 14-15). He told Tennis Majors on Saturday in London while filming an episode of the show All On The Table, designed by UTS and broadcast on YouTube.

“I had an injury to my right knee a few days ago,” he revealed. I was just on the practice court, and my right knee was kicking me a little bit, it didn't calm down in time for the grass season. But I'm going to play in Washington (July 21-27) and do the American tour. In his Instagram post announcing his absence, he spoke of a “small incident along the way”.

Kyrgios has won Washington twice, in 2019 and 2022, and has not played there since winning the title three years ago. It will also be the first time since 2022 that the Australian player has participated in the American tour. He reached the quarter-finals of the US Open, beaten by Karen Khachanov in five sets, with big ambitions following his final at Wimbledon.

“I like the U.S. tour, but there's not a lot left in the tank,” Kyrgios said. “I don't think I have much tennis left. My body can't stand it too much anymore.” 

For the past two years, Kyrgios has not been able to play consistently, hampered by his wrist and knee.

Down to 637th in the world, Kyrgios will also play next October in the UTS Hong Kong tournament, the third stop of the UTS Tour after Guadalajara and Nîmes. This will be the second appearance of the Australian, who played one match at UTS New York in 2024.

“I'm just going to play UTS for the rest of my life! I'm really excited about it, especially because it's also going through Asia now. And obviously, I'm half Asian, so I'm looking forward to it. I have never been to Hong Kong. Never. It seems that it's great. I often go to Malaysia. I have like 30 cousins there, and… Yes. I'm very Asian. In the way I eat, and all that.”

It's been a whirlwind 2025 for Learner Tien.

The 19-year-old began the year with his first win at a Grand Slam at the Australian Open in January before becoming the youngest man since Rafael Nadal in 2005 to reach the fourth round.

In that same tournament, he announced himself to the world when he claimed his maiden Top 10 win by defeating Daniil Medvedev. 

Hailing from Irvine, California, Tien is the latest American star to emerge in recent years.

He honed his passion on community courts in Irvine under his father, and his early passion for the sport quickly turned into quality. 

“I started when I was little older than one,” Tien told the Guardian earlier this year. 

“I think (it was) one of my dad's old rackets that were lying around. 

""So they didn't really even expect for me or my sister to start playing tennis that young. 

""It's not like they were prepped with little kiddy rackets or anything.

“My parents would play recreationally. I got to the courts a couple times a week, just with my dad, just watching him play in random men's leagues. 

""So that's kind of how I got introduced. Eventually my dad started taking me to the courts, randomly feeding me balls from a pretty young age, and then it kind of just progressed from there on.”

Tien went on to excel in junior tournaments and secured a spot in the prestigious United States Tennis Association youth development programme.

Although tennis for a while wasn't Tien's priority, he had entered high school early at the age of 11 after being homeschooled by his mom, who named him Learner in homage to her profession as a teacher.

“The tennis wasn't really in the picture yet,” Tien says. 

“My sister is a few years older than me, so my mom retired when my sister was born, so she was already just at home with my sister starting to teach my sister. So she just thought she'd teach me, too.

“I started school young. I would work through the year. I wouldn't have summer break and stuff like that. I would just work throughout the year. So I just naturally finished those early grades pretty quick. And then, yeah, I didn't see really a reason just to stop me there. So I just went into high school.

“I obviously like tennis more than I like school, so it was a good motivation for me to kind of get away from school just to go and play. But throughout juniors, my parents did a very good job, honestly, of not putting a lot of pressure on me to win""

Now it's June 2025, and tennis is definitely Tien's priority.

Following the Australian Open, the 19-year-old stepped onto the famous clay of Roland-Garros, where he automatically qualified for with his World No. 67 ranking.

That French Open dream was cut short, as Tien faced a mammoth task in the first round with World No.3 and last year's finalist Alexander Zverev standing opposite him.

He was beaten in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. 

But fast forward a month, and Tien has fared better in the first round  of another Grand Slam. 

On the opening day of Wimbledon, the young American cruised to victory against fellow countryman Nishesh Basavareddy. 

He secured a 7-6, 6-3, 6-2 win on Court 6 to advance to the second round at the All England Club.

""To play here is really cool. I think if you told both of us a long time ago that this would happen, we would both be really happy,"" Tien said, after his first win at Wimbledon that came over a friend he first met on court at Under-8 level. 

""I honestly just think that it's cool we got to play each other here on this stage. We've been playing for a long time through juniors, national tournaments, challengers.""

Tien, who will play Holger Rune or Nicolas Jarry next, is regarded as one of the brightest talents in tennis, and he has been touted as a future top 10 player. 

Speaking exclusively to talkSPORT earlier this year, long-time broadcaster Jonathan Overend discussed how far the American can go.

""I think he's a real talent, a real prospect. And the really exciting thing for tennis in 2025 is there's a crop now of teenage talents,"" Overend explained. 

""And for a little while we've been looking down the rankings and thinking, 'Okay, where are the really young players? Where are the breakthrough players?'

""But last year was a breakthrough year. Not just Tien, Alex Michelsen also had a great year from the United States.

""We've got the young Brazilian, Joao Fonseca, who is potentially going to be a future world number one.

""I'd be maybe a little bit more confident in saying Fonseca is a future top 10 and potential grand slam champion than Tien. But champions come in different models.

""They're not all the big, brash, big hitters. Fonseca can whack players off the court. We've seen that already.

""Tien, a little bit more crafty, might rely on those longer matches, the physicality of things, and his all-round stroke play.

""But there's no doubt there are a lot of real teenage talents out there who are going to be challenging at the top of the men's game.

""I'm not talking here top 50 players. I'm talking potential top 10 players in the not too distant future.""

Overend went on to suggest the likes of Tien, Fonseca and Michelsen can one day climb the rankings to lead a new generation of players. 

He continued: ""There are loads of them (young stars). 

""And that's what's really exciting, because I think for the casual tennis fans, people have been saying for the last couple of years now, 'What's going to happen after Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic?'

""You know, where are the next players? Well, the answer is there's loads of them.

""They're all over the place. They're all around us. That's what's making this tennis season so exciting, that we're now building a crop of players who could win the big titles in the next couple of years.""

Benjamin Bonzi stuns Daniil Medvedev in the first round at Wimbledon, winning in four sets. (0:39)

WIMBLEDON, England -- Ninth-seeded Daniil Medvedev is out of another Grand Slam in the first round after losing to 64th-ranked Benjamin Bonzi 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2 at Wimbledon on Monday.

The 6-foot-6 Russian, a semifinalist at the All England Club the past two years, had also exited the French Open in the first round. And that followed a second-round loss at the Australian Open.

""For the moment, I'm not that worried,"" said Medvedev, who is ranked No. 9. ""If I finish the year somewhere around [No.] 15 in the world, maybe I will be more worried. For the moment, I am not.""

The last time Medvedev lost consecutive Grand Slam first-round matches was in 2017 -- at Melbourne Park in his major tournament debut, followed by Roland-Garros.

Medvedev lost in five sets to Cameron Norrie in Paris this year. In 2023, the Russian was seeded No. 2 at Roland-Garros and lost in the first round to Thiago Seyboth Wild, a qualifier who was ranked 172nd at the time.

The 2021 US Open champion took out his frustrations on his racket, smashing it to the ground after Bonzi had got the better of him in the third set.

""I was surprised by his level,"" Medvedev said of Bonzi, who had not won a match on grass in three years. ""... There was not much I could do better. Every shot that I played today, even good shots, he had an answer. Today, he barely missed. When you're on fire, everything goes in.

""Whatever I did on the court, it was not bothering him too much. Everything he did was tough for me to play. I fought. I tried.""

Spectators used umbrellas, hats, newspapers and any other makeshift item they could grab to get a respite from the sun and the roasting conditions, but the players got only a 10-minute break at the end of the third set with Wimbledon's heat rule coming into force as the temperature soared above 90 degrees.

That did little to revive Medvedev, however, as he immediately fell behind 2-0 in the fourth set and could not recover.

""This is special for me today,"" Bonzi told the crowd. ""This is my first top-10 win at a Slam. I love this place. ... I had nothing to lose and I played my A-game.""

After shaking hands with Bonzi, Medvedev's anger boiled over and he again gave his rackets another brutal battering -- this time against his courtside chair and bag.

""I'm for sure very disappointed about the fact that I lost,"" Medvedev said.

Last Word On Tennis

Tennis news, analysis, tournament coverage, and rumors

Wimbledon has kept itself different from every other Grand Slam with different rules and nomenclature. The fact that men's tennis is called gentlemen's tennis just elevates the class of the event. Every athlete has to don white clothes to maintain the purity of the event. These differences make Wimbledon a tournament that is very close to everyone's heart.

The 148-year-old traditions of the event however will go through a slight change this time around. Wimbledon will follow the path that the Australian Open and US Open have taken up when it comes to “line umpires.” The tournament Down Under and in the Flushing Meadows have replaced line judges with electronic line calls.

What that has done is taken out the challenges the players can take to challenge line calls. Wimbledon, too, from the 2025 edition will not be following the traditional line judges' call, and will shift to electronic line calls. With this development, the French Open remains the only Grand Slam with the line judges still making the line calls.

It is a disappointing move as it takes away a very integral decision-making section away from the sport. The very fact that the players have to be alert enough to change a wrong call is something that has kept the crowd engaged for all these years. Without a doubt, there is a certain increase in accuracy of the judgements with electronic line calls. However, the pleasure of a human correcting a human error and earning a point through sheer alertness has been robbed of the sport.

Traditional fans would only hope for the tournament organizers of these established Grand Slams to understand the excitement and interest the challenges had kept alive all these years.

Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare on his return to Centre Court Monday, when he overcame Fabio Fognini and the intense London heat to reach the second round in five sets.

On the hottest opening day on record at The Championships, with temperatures reaching 31.4C, Alcaraz was made to work extremely hard against a free-hitting Fognini, who was competing at Wimbledon for the final time. In a topsy-turvy battle, which featured first-class shotmaking, Alcaraz showed his trademark grit to triumph 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 in four hours and 37 minutes. The Spaniard now holds a standout 14-1 fifth-set record, recently defeating Jannik Sinner in the Roland Garros final.

“I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because with the level he has shown, he can still play three or four more years,” said Alcaraz. “I have to give him credit for such a great match. Fabio is such a great player, he has shown in his whole career the level he has. I'm just a little bit sad that it's his last Wimbledon, but happy to have shared the court with him.”

Carlitos strikes again ☄️The defending champion battles past Fognini in an absolute five-set thriller, taking the win 7-5 6-7 7-5 2-6 6-1 🔥@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/XQw9T2Ycqg

Alcaraz arrived in London having won his past 18 matches – the longest winning streak of his career. Aiming to join Bjorn Borg and become just the second man in history to win the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years, few would have expected Alcaraz to struggle against the 38-year-old Fognini, who as the third oldest man in the men's singles draw, stepped onto court on the back of a 10-match tour-level losing streak.

Yet for periods, Alcaraz was in real trouble on Centre Court. With David Beckham watching on in the Royal Box, Alcaraz rallied from a break down in the third set and finally put the Italian to bed in a dominant fifth set. With his win, the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings avoided becoming just the third defending champion to lose in the first round. Manuel Santana fell in 1967 and Lleyton Hewitt in 2003.

“Playing the first match on Centre Court is never easy,” said Alcaraz. “I have been playing on grass pretty well, but Wimbledon is special. I can feel the difference between Wimbledon and the other tournaments. I just try to play the best I could, but I would say it could be better. I have to improve.”

Alcaraz also maintained his perfect first-round record at majors (18-0) and extended his winning streak at Wimbledon to 15 matches. He will next meet British qualifier Oliver Tarvet after the 21-year-old beat Swiss Leandro Riedi 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to earn victory on his major debut.

Alcaraz is chasing his sixth title of the season, highlighted by his fifth major at Roland Garros and ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome. Earlier this month, Alcaraz triumphed at The Queen's Club for the second time.



Alcaraz was not at his fluid best in his first set back on Centre Court since defeating Novak Djokovic in last year's final. The World No. 2 saved all five break points he faced in the opener and produced the key bit of magic on the Italian's serve at 5-5, lifting a lob over Fognini to gain the decisive break.

Alcaraz was unable to push on after winning the opener and struggled for consistency in the second set, committing 20 unforced errors to 13 winners. He was punished in the second-set tie-break when Fognini levelled on his fourth set point after Alcaraz pushed a short forehand wide.

In an entertaining third set, which featured full-length dives from both players, Fognini won one of the points of the tournament to move to break point on the Alcaraz serve when trailing 3-5.

The Italian pulled the Spaniard from side to side with his aggressive baseline hitting before he moved forward to push Alcaraz deep into the forehand corner with a volley. On the stretch, the Spaniard managed to hit the baseline with a lob, but the Italian replied with a fierce overhead before knocking away a backhand volley. The Italian raised his arms aloft and punched the air before he earned the break back on the following point.

Alcaraz would not be denied, though. He increased his intensity and consistency in the fierce heat to break the Italian in the 12th game and lead again.

Fognini refused to go away, however, and opened his shoulders to hit his flat backhand through the court during a red-hot fourth set. The ball flew through the burning London air to the tune of 14 winners in the set, with the Italian forcing a fifth set to the delight of the packed crowd.

Fognini's fifth-set record — 24 wins to 16 losses, including his legendary comeback against Rafael Nadal at the 2015 US Open — showed his fighting spirit. But on what was his final Wimbledon appearance, the former Top 10 star's magic finally ran dry as Alcaraz pulled away to claim victory in the decider.

Alcaraz, now 43-5 on the year, is aiming to become the fifth man to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles. Following his victory, Alcaraz joined the crowd in giving Fognini a standing ovation off court.

Stefanos Tsitsipas was forced to retire during his Wimbledon opener on Monday due to a back injury, with French qualifier Valentin Royer advancing to the second round on his debut at The Championships.

Royer led 6-3, 6-2 against the Greek, who received a medical timeout in the second set due to a back issue. The former World No. 3 Tsitsipas looked in discomfort at times during the 74 minutes on court and struggled with his movement and serve, making just 43 per cent of his first deliveries. Last week, Jannik Sinner's coach Darren Cahill stated that the Greek had struggled with his back when practising with the Italian.

“It's tough to describe. I'm battling many wars these days,” Tsitsipas said following his retirement. “It's really painful to see myself in a situation like this. One thing that I absolutely hate doing is retiring or stopping a match, but I've never pictured myself being in a situation like this multiple times since the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin a couple of years back.

“Since that time, I've been very fragile with my body, and I've been battling a war of feeling healthy and feeling comfortable going to the extremes, which has been a difficult battle. So I really don't know. I feel like I'm left without answers. I don't know. I've tried everything. I've done an incredible job with my fitness. I've done an incredible job with my physiotherapy, so I've maximised on everything that I possibly can do. Right now I'm just absolutely left with no answers. I don't know what to do.”

Tsitsipas, coached by former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, leaves SW19 holding a 19-13 record on the season. The 26-year-old is the second men's seed to fall on Day 1, joining Daniil Medvedev.
Tsitsipas is currently 22nd in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, having failed to advance beyond the third round in any of his previous five events. The Greek is a former champion at the Nitto ATP Finals, competing at the prestigious year-end event on five consecutive occasions from 2019 to 2023. Tsitsipas' best result this year came in Dubai, where he lifted his 12th tour-level trophy.
“It's probably the most difficult situation that I've ever been faced with, because it's an ongoing issue that doesn't seem to be disappearing or fading off as much,” Tsitsipas added on his back issues. “Myself, as a person, I have a limit at some point, so I'll definitely have to have my final answer on whether I want to do stuff or not in the next couple of months.
“This is going to be hard, but if I see it going in that trajectory, there is no point at competing. If I'm not healthy, and I've talked about health so many times, if health is not there, then your whole tennis life becomes miserable.”
Royer was competing in just his second main-draw match at a major, having lost in the opening round at Roland Garros last month. The Frenchman, currently No. 99 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, fired 22 winners across the two sets against Tsitsipas and will next meet countryman Adrian Mannarino.

Tsitsipas' best result this year came in Dubai, where he lifted his 12th tour-level trophy.

“It's probably the most difficult situation that I've ever been faced with, because it's an ongoing issue that doesn't seem to be disappearing or fading off as much,” Tsitsipas added on his back issues. “Myself, as a person, I have a limit at some point, so I'll definitely have to have my final answer on whether I want to do stuff or not in the next couple of months.

“This is going to be hard, but if I see it going in that trajectory, there is no point at competing. If I'm not healthy, and I've talked about health so many times, if health is not there, then your whole tennis life becomes miserable.”

Royer was competing in just his second main-draw match at a major, having lost in the opening round at Roland Garros last month. The Frenchman, currently No. 99 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, fired 22 winners across the two sets against Tsitsipas and will next meet countryman Adrian Mannarino.

There were two grass-court ATP 250 events last week in the leadup to Wimbledon, with ATP Tour stars competing in Eastbourne and Mallorca. Taylor Fritz claimed his fourth Eastbourne trophy and Tallon Griekspoor emerged victorious in Mallorca. ATPTour.com looks at the movers of the week in the PIF ATP Rankings as of Monday 30 June.



No. 29 Tallon Griekspoor, +5
The Dutchman dipped outside the Top 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings in February, but has stormed back into the Top 30. Griekspoor climbed five spots this week by winning his first ATP Tour title of the season in Mallorca, where he did not lose a set throughout the week. The champion defeated French lefty Corentin Moutet in the final.

Watch Final Highlights:

No. 54 Joao Fonseca +3 (Career High)
The Brazilian star Joao Fonseca continued his ascent this week to a career-high World No. 54. The 18-year-old reached the second round in Eastbourne, where eventual champion Taylor Fritz needed two days and three tight sets to eliminate the teen.

No. 62 Learner Tien +5 (Career High)
Learner Tien advanced to his first grass-court quarter-final on the ATP Tour when he reached the last eight in Mallorca. The American lefty upset World No. 10 Ben Shelton in the second round in straight sets before falling to eventual finalist Moutet.

No. 68 Hamad Medjedovic +5
The 2023 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion Hamad Medjedovic reached the quarter-finals in Mallorca, his deepest run in a tournament since making the Marseille final in February. The Serbian ousted Nishesh Basavareddy and squeaked by Roman Safiullin in a final-set tie-break before losing to Felix Auger-Aliassime in three sets.

No. 69 Corentin Moutet +14
Moutet made the biggest jump of any player in the Top 100 this week thanks to his run to the Mallorca final. After losing his first set of the tournament to Pedro Martinez, the Frenchman won eight consecutive sets to make the championship match, including straight-sets triumphs against former Jeddah competitors Tien and Alex Michelsen.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:wtatennis.com","Wimbledon draw: Krejcikova opens vs. Eala; Vondrousova in Sabalenka's path","https://www.wtatennis.com/news/4297611/wimbledon-draw-krejcikova-opens-vs-eala-vondrousova-in-sabalenkas-path","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:37:01 GMT","

Barbora Krejcikova will open her Wimbledon title defense against Alexandra Eala, while Aryna Sabalenka's section of the 2025 draw includes Carson Branstine, Marketa Vondrousova, Emma Raducanu and McCartney Kessler.

Reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova will open her title defense next Tuesday against 2025 breakout star Alexandra Eala on Centre Court -- one of several first-round clashes to circle in the draw for the 2025 Championships.

Krejcikova missed the first five months of 2025 with a back injury and had to withdraw from this week's Eastbourne quarterfinals citing a thigh injury. Eala captured the tennis world's attention in March by defeating three Grand Slam champions -- Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek -- to reach the Miami semifinals. The 20-year-old Filipina has reached her first grass-court final this week in Eastbourne.

Elsewhere, No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka's section features a host of potential obstacles as she bids to progress beyond the semifinals for the first time. The three-time major winner opens against fast-rising qualifier Carson Branstine, and potential third-round opponents include 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova, Nottingham titlist McCartney Kessler and 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu.

No. 2 seed Coco Gauff will start against the big-hitting Nottingham finalist Dayana Yastremska, with former World No. 1 Victoria Azarenka potentially awaiting in the second round and 2020 Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin projected in the third round. Meanwhile, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, playing the final Championships of her career, will face No. 10 seed and 2024 quarterfinalist Emma Navarro in the first round.

Looking ahead, potentially intriguing second-round matchups include No. 3 seed Jessica Pegula against Queen's champion and 2022 semifinalist Tatjana Maria, former Roland Garros champion Ostapenko against two-time runner-up Ons Jabeur and Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen against former World No. 1 Naomi Osaka.

[1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. [6] Madison Keys[4] Jasmine Paolini vs. [5] Zheng Qinwen[7] Mirra Andreeva vs. [3] Jessica Pegula[8] Iga Swiatek vs. [2] Coco Gauff

This week in Wimbledon qualifying, Carson Branstine served notice of her confidence.

""Maybe not everyone knows me, but I think I can beat anyone out there,"" the Canadian said after defeating Lois Boisson, her second upset of a No. 1 seed in as many grass-court tournaments this year. The 24-year-old will get a shot at a third against Sabalenka.

Should the World No. 1 survive Branstine -- and, indeed, a guaranteed former Wimbledon quarterfinalist in Round 2, either Marie Bouzkova or Lulu Sun -- she'll still have to navigate a section that includes two of this year's grass-court titlists just to reach the fourth round. That includes Vondrousova, who defeated Sabalenka en route to the Berlin title last week. A silver lining is that these dangerous opponents will have to take each other out first: Vondrousova opens against Kessler, and the winner will potentially face Raducanu in the second round. Raducanu herself faces an intriguing start against a British compatriot, 17-year-old wild card Mingge Xu.

No. 14 seed Elina Svitolina, a two-time semifinalist, is projected to be Sabalenka's fourth-round opponent.

Meanwhile, Australian Open champion Keys opens against the hard-hitting Elena-Gabriela Ruse, the runner-up in 's-Hertogenbosch two weeks ago. Ruse stretched Keys to a 7-6(1), 2-6, 7-5 scoreline in the Australian Open second round. She is projected to face No. 29 seed Leylah Fernandez in the third round, should the 2021 US Open finalist get past another teenage British wild card, Hannah Klugman, in the first round. Potential fourth-round opponents include No. 9 seed Paula Badosa and No. 22 seed Donna Vekic, a semifinalist last year.

Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Aryna Sabalenka, Marketa Vondrousova, Elina Svitolina, Donna Vekic

First-round matches to watch:

Last year's finalist, Jasmine Paolini, has built on the momentum of her 2024 breakthrough this season, most notably claiming the Rome title on home soil last month. The Italian opens against former No. 11 Anastasija Sevastova, the 35-year-old currently making a comeback from both maternity leave and an ACL injury. Sevastova also has prior form on grass: between 2016-18, she reached three consecutive Mallorca finals, claiming the title in 2017.

Two big hitters lie in Paolini's projected path before the quarterfinals: No. 30 seed Linda Noskova in the third round and No. 13 seed Amanda Anisimova in the fourth. Anisimova was a 2022 Wimbledon quarterfinalist, and reached her first grass-court final at Queen's two weeks ago.

No. 5 seed Zheng lost in the first round last year to eventual quarterfinalist Lulu Sun, and starts against another potential banana skin this year. Doubles World No. 1 Katerina Siniakova has beaten Zheng in both of their completed meetings -- both of which have come on grass, at Wimbledon 2023 and Berlin 2024. Should the Chinese player survive Siniakova, she could face Osaka for the fourth time -- if Osaka gets past qualifier Talia Gibson. Zheng leads her head-to-head against Osaka 2-1, including their only grass-court meeting at Berlin 2024.

No. 12 seed Diana Shnaider, the 2024 Bad Homburg champion, is Zheng's projected fourth-round opponent. Shnaider's path includes two former Top 5 players, Ostapenko and Jabeur, with serious grass-court credentials but question marks over their form and fitness. Jabeur exited Eastbourne in the first round this week to Maya Joint, while Ostapenko suffered an ankle injury at the same tournament that forced her to retire against Eala in the second round.

Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Jasmine Paolini, Ons Jabeur, Jelena Ostapenko

First-round matches to watch:

Watching the 37-year-old mother-of-two Maria slicing her way to the Queen's title was a reminder that old-school finesse can be as effective -- if not more -- on grass than modern-day power. She'll have another shot at a big-name upset if she meets Pegula in the second round, having won both of her previous meetings against the American -- albeit on clay in 2011 and 2016 respectively. Maria will have to defeat Katie Volynets first, while Pegula opens against Elisabetta Cocciaretto.

Maria isn't the only mother to watch in this quarter. Kvitova, who announced this week that she will retire from the sport this year, will be appearing at Wimbledon for the last time. Despite having only won one match since returning from maternity leave in February, the Czech will be motivated to go out on a high. The winner of her match against Navarro could be on course to meet either Krejcikova or Eala in the third round.

Meanwhile, former Eastbourne champion Belinda Bencic's comeback from maternity leave started superbly, with the Abu Dhabi title in February rocketing the Swiss player back into the Top 100, but was set back by an arm injury ahead of Roland Garros. Bencic is in Pegula's section of the draw, and will start against big-serving Alycia Parks.

As well as the trio of mothers, the best teenager in the world -- Dubai and Indian Wells champion Mirra Andreeva -- is also in the third quarter. The 18-year-old No. 7 seed reached her first Grand Slam fourth round at Wimbledon two years ago, but has won just one match on the surface since. She opens against Mayar Sherif, and is projected to face either Navarro or Krejcikova in the fourth round.

Another 2007-born player, Iva Jovic, could be one to watch in the third quarter as well. The 17-year-old American is on an eight-match grass-court winning streak after capturing the Ilkley WTA 125 title and then coming through qualifying. She opens against Suzan Lamens and could face No. 18 seed Ekaterina Alexandrova in the second round.

Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Barbora Krejcikova, Petra Kvitova, Tatjana Maria

First-round matches to watch:

The last time Gauff faced Yastremska was arguably a turning point in her season. She had not reached a semifinal in the first four months of 2025, and in her opening match in Madrid dropped the first set 6-0 to the Ukrainian. But Gauff clawed back a 0-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory -- and went on to make three consecutive clay-court finals, culminating in her second major crown at Roland Garros. In the rematch, Yastremska comes in with better form on grass, having made the Nottingham final while Gauff lost her Berlin opener to Wang Xinyu.

Gauff's draw doesn't get any easier. She'll face either Azarenka or in-form qualifier Anastasia Zakharova in the second round. She's defeated projected third-round opponent Kenin in both of their meetings this year, including a 6-0, 6-0 whitewash in Miami -- but Kenin won their only previous grass-court encounter at Wimbledon 2023. Potential fourth-round opponents include big-serving No. 19 seed Liudmila Samsonova, fast-rising 19-year-old Maya Joint -- who has reached her first grass-court final in Eastbourne this week -- and last year's Eastbourne champion, No. 16 seed Daria Kasatkina.

Former World No. 1 Iga Swiatek is in a position she's rather unaccustomed to. Her No. 8 seeding is her lowest in over four years, since she was also seeded No. 8 at Roland Garros 2021. The Pole did not reach a final in over a year, since winning her fifth major title in Paris last year -- but she snapped that drought in Bad Homburg this week to notch the first grass-court final of her career.

After her semifinal exit at Roland Garros to Sabalenka, Swiatek told press that a silver lining was that she would be able to do a proper grass-court pre-season for the first time rather than needing to decompress after a gruelling clay swing. Could Swiatek be a dark horse at Wimbledon? She opens against Polina Kudermetova, and is projected to face No. 26 seed Marta Kostyuk in the third round.

All eyes could be on a marquee fourth-round match between Swiatek and No. 11 seed Elena Rybakina, the 2022 champion. Rybakina -- who led Swiatek 6-1, 2-0 at the same stage of Roland Garros before falling -- starts against Armenian No. 1 Elina Avanesyan, and is projected to meet No. 23 seed Clara Tauson in the third round.

Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Elena Rybakina, Victoria Azarenka

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Kimi Antonelli collided with Max Verstappen on the opening lap of the Austrian Grand Prix, marking the end of a wholly underwhelming weekend for the Dutchman.

Max Verstappen had a weekend to forget at the Red Bull Ring as his race came to an end on the opening lap due to a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, leading to the Dutchman labelling himself “unlucky”.

While McLaren have consistently appeared to be the strongest team throughout the season, Verstappen has kept himself firmly in the battle in the Drivers' Standings, but his Championship ambitions took a major knock at the Austrian Grand Prix.

After showing good signs of pace in practice, he was unable to set a final flying lap in Qualifying as Pierre Gasly's spin brought out the yellow flags, preventing the Red Bull driver from cutting down his lap time.

This led to him starting the race from P7, two spots ahead of Antonelli. In the expected first lap chaos, the Italian locked the rear wheels of his car and struggled to make the corner, tagging Verstappen and taking them both out of the race.

Asked to explain his perspective of the incident, Verstappen said: “Unlucky, I guess. It is what it is. I spoke quickly to Kimi, he came with me to the hospitality.

“I think every driver has made a mistake like that. No one does that on purpose as well so for me, that's not a big deal.

“It was not the weekend that I guess we hoped for pace wise. Then of course we were a little bit unlucky in Qualifying with that yellow flag, otherwise you start a bit further ahead.

""Then the race was unlucky again. Sometimes you have those weekends.”

The result marked Verstappen's first DNF since the 2024 Australian Grand Prix and meant that Red Bull scored no points at the circuit, with Yuki Tsunoda finishing last in the order – he was embroiled in a number of incidents with Franco Colapinto, earning him a 10-second time penalty when he tagged the Alpine driver into a spin.

Meanwhile, it was Antonelli's third DNF of the season, and he was immediately regretful following the collision when speaking to media afterwards, with the Italian hit with a three-place grid drop for Silverstone as a result.

“I think I had a normal start, then going up to T3 I was just trying to maintain the position,” he said. “I didn't want to do anything because I knew there was no space in front, but then when I hit the brake I locked the rear and I got caught by that.

“When I locked the rear, I lost the car and then I had to first avoid the Racing Bull [of Liam Lawson], but then I just couldn't stop the car. Unfortunately I hit Max and I just feel very sorry towards the team, and him of course.

“I just apologised straight away. I recognise it's all on me and I just feel sorry because I ended my race, but I ended his as well.”

It was a fight between the McLaren drivers during Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring, with Lando Norris beating Oscar Piastri to the win.

Lando Norris returned to winning ways at the Austrian Grand Prix after getting the better of McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri in a head-to-head scrap for victory – title rival Max Verstappen having been eliminated in a first-lap incident.

Norris converted pole position into the lead at Turn 1 but soon came under intense pressure from championship leader Piastri, who launched several attacks and at one point muscled his way past, only for the positions to be swiftly reversed.

After a particularly close call under braking for Turn 4, which saw Piastri lock up and almost run into the back of Norris, the Australian went slightly longer on his starting set of tyres in an attempt to build an advantage for the remainder of the race.

While Piastri lit up the timesheets in phases across the second and third stints, Norris had just enough pace in hand to hold onto P1 and take the chequered flag – marking his third win of the season and first victory since last month's Monaco Grand Prix.

Race results

FORMULA 1 MSC CRUISES AUSTRIAN GRAND PRIX 2025

In the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who travelled home pre-race for “personal reasons”, the upgraded Ferraris had quiet but fruitful races en route to a podium with Charles Leclerc and fourth-place result with Lewis Hamilton.

George Russell was the sole Mercedes finisher in fifth, with rookie team mate Kimi Antonelli dramatically running into Verstappen under braking for Turn 3 on the opening lap – eliminating both drivers from the action. The stewards later gave Antonelli a three-place grid penalty for his next race.

Liam Lawson capitalised to convert his top-six grid slot into a top-six finish, ahead of Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso and Kick Sauber's Bortoleto, who scored his first F1 points after a monumental scrap with the two-time World Champion.

A strong recovery from the back of the grid brought a third successive points finish for Nico Hulkenberg, and gave Sauber a double points reward, while Esteban Ocon rounded out the top 10 places for Haas.

Ollie Bearman followed team mate Ocon home in 11th, with Isack Hadjar 12th in the other Racing Bulls machine and Pierre Gasly dropping from points contention to 13th amid severe balance problems aboard his Alpine.

Next up was Lance Stroll, whose eye-catching practice pace could not be carried over to Qualifying or the race, while Franco Colapinto (Alpine) and Yuki Tsunoda (Red Bull) were the final drivers to cross the finish line.

Colapinto came close to contact with Piastri in the closing stages of the race when the McLaren man was putting a lap on him, an incident that earned the F1 returnee a five-second penalty but did not impact his finishing position.

Tsunoda was hit with a 10-second penalty of his own for sending Colapinto into a spin earlier in the race, with Verstappen and Antonelli joined on the sidelines by Williams drivers Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz – the latter unable to start after getting stuck on the grid.

Following that dramatic clash with team mate Piastri in Canada last time out, Norris came back fighting when he hit the track at the Red Bull Ring – the Briton displaying rapid pace through practice before charging his way to pole position in Qualifying.

Norris ended Q3 a whopping half a second clear of nearest rival Leclerc, with Piastri having to settle for third after being hindered by yellow flags on his final run, and reigning World Champion Verstappen also losing out to the caution down in seventh.

As the anticipated two-stop race approached, amid rising air and track temperatures, it was revealed that the majority of the field would be starting on medium tyres, with Gasly, Hadjar, Colapinto, Bearman and Hulkenberg opting for softs.

There was drama on the formation lap, though, with Sainz struggling to pull away from his P19 grid slot and getting left behind. “The car is stuck in first gear,” the Spaniard said over the radio, before he eventually drove off while Race Control abandoned the start.

Another formation lap followed some 10 minutes later, with Sainz sadly unable to take the start after returning his Williams to the pit lane, where it overheated. Alonso also noted the high temperatures, reporting that his seat felt like it was “200 degrees”.

When the race eventually began, Norris made a strong enough getaway to retain his pole advantage into Turn 1, while Piastri swept around the outside of Leclerc for P2 and Russell went wheel-to-wheel with the Ferraris.

As the field roared towards Turn 3, where Norris covered off Piastri, more drama ensued when Antonelli lost control of his Mercedes under braking and slammed into Verstappen's car – putting both drivers out of the race. Lawson was fortunate to avoid being a third retirement.

“I got hit like crazy,” a sweary Verstappen rued over the radio, as Antonelli admitted he simply “lost the rear”. With the Dutchman and Italian debriefing at the side of the track, the Safety Car was brought out to allow marshals to clear the track.

On Lap 3 of 70, Bernd Maylander peeled back into the pits and released the remaining 17 drivers – Norris handling the situation well to hold the lead over Piastri, Leclerc, Hamilton, Russell and Gasly, with a fast-starting Albon up to seventh.

“Lewis just closed the door under braking,” argued Russell over the radio after a failed move on the seven-time World Champion for fourth at Turn 4, with several drivers engaging in battle but no more incidents occurring for the time being.

Turn 4 was the scene for another heart-in-mouth moment a couple of laps later when Piastri – having remained within a second of his team mate – used the Drag Reduction System to get perilously close. “Your call on the racing situation,” came a follow-up message from the Australian's race engineer.

With Gasly's soft tyres seemingly degrading, Albon continued his progress thanks to a clean move for sixth place under braking for Turn 3. The Frenchman would soon come under pressure from Bortoleto, Lawson and Alonso in the remaining top 10 spots.

On Lap 11, the lead battle kicked off again when Piastri used DRS to grab the lead from Norris into Turn 3. A lock-up at the apex left the door ajar, though, and Norris duly reclaimed P1 with a switchback on the run to Turn 4, where Piastri snatched a brake once more.

As the laps ticked by, Piastri remained glued to Norris' gearbox, having several sniffs at another overtake but not quite managing to find a way past. How much longer could his starting set of tyres hold on while running in the dirty air of his team mate?

Elsewhere, Bearman, Gasly, Hadjar, Hulkenberg and Colapinto were all early stoppers as tyre strategies began to play out, while Williams' day went from bad to worse when Albon was called back to the pits to retire amid apparent technical trouble.

Lap 20 brought another flashpoint in a tense battle between Norris and Piastri, with the latter locking up heavily into Turn 4 and almost running into the back of his team mate. Norris subsequently took to the pit lane for a fresh set of tyres, while Piastri continued on his way.

“Let's see your pace in free air now,” was the message to Piastri, who opted to continue on his way rather than immediately respond to Norris – albeit with a sizeable flat spot. “The data looks OK to continue,” his engineer subsequently confirmed.

Piastri decided that enough was enough at the end of Lap 24 and pitted for his own set of fresh hard tyres, coming back out some 5.5 seconds behind Norris. Leclerc and Hamilton pitted shortly afterwards, meaning McLaren were now back in their 1-2 positions.

As the race settled down again, with Norris further extending his lead to 6.5 seconds, Piastri's engineer gave him some “feedback” from the McLaren pit wall. “The manoeuvre in Turn 4 with the front lock-up was too marginal,” he warned.

Splitting the Ferraris of Leclerc and Hamilton, fourth-placed Lawson and fifth-placed Alonso were now the only drivers yet to pit. With new tyres at his disposal, Hamilton soon worked his way past both drivers – including a bold move on the outside of Lawson at Turn 6.

Then came more drama at Turn 4 when Tsunoda, having already engaged in battle with Stroll, tipped Colapinto into a spin. That forced the Japanese driver back to the pits for a new front wing, while Colapinto tumbled down the order.

It was not much better for the other Alpine of Gasly, who was valiantly holding onto a points-paying position but faced huge problems in the cockpit. “I have no grip... I'm about to spin every corner,” he shouted over the radio, with a swear word for good measure.

Tsunoda was promptly given a 10-second penalty for the incident with Colapinto, before stops from Lawson and Alonso at the halfway mark meant every driver had now pitted – those two seemingly on course for the alternate one-stop approach.

With 35 laps to run, Norris led Piastri by 5.3 seconds. Leclerc sat around 14 seconds further back in third, from Hamilton, Russell and squabbling Kick Sauber pair Bortoleto and Hulkenberg (who had charged forward with that early stop and some undercutting). Haas duo Ocon and Bearman were eighth and ninth, with Gasly – who was losing ground amid ongoing issues – circulating in 10th.

Lawson and Alonso sat just outside the points following their stops, but with the prospect of making up some places as rivals pitted for a second time, while Hadjar, Colapinto, Stroll and the penalised Tsunoda brought up the rear.

Back at the front, Piastri was starting to put Norris under pressure again, reducing his team mate's advantage to three seconds with that tyre delta. “He's mainly quicker in high-speed,” Norris was told, along with some time loss through traffic.

Norris gained a bit of breathing space a few laps later when Piastri ran wide at Turn 1 and clattered the kerbs, while Hamilton's hopes of cutting the gap to team mate Leclerc and challenging for a podium were dented by a similar mistake at Turn 3.

With the two-stoppers cycling through their final tyre changes, radio messages picked up Hamilton commenting that “I don't want to stop”, having reported that his rubber felt fine. No positions were lost when he returned to the track, at least.

Norris was next in on Lap 52, followed by Piastri one tour later – both drivers taking on medium tyres and the positions remaining unchanged. The gap between the papaya cars now stood at 3.5 seconds, with a potential grandstand finish in store.

However, Piastri's efforts to cut Norris' lead were hampered by traffic. With Colapinto and Tsunoda battling for position at Turn 3, the Argentinian wildly cut back across the track and forced Piastri onto the grass – earning him a five-second penalty.

From there, Norris managed the gap back to Piastri and calmly worked his way through more traffic – which involved Alonso and Bortoleto's feisty exchange – to seal the deal and bag the win, cutting his team mate's championship advantage to 15 points.

Leclerc completed the podium over Hamilton, followed by Russell, a high-flying Lawson and Alonso, who narrowly beat Bortoleto to seventh via some brilliant late racing but could not take the shine off the Brazilian's maiden F1 points finish.

Hulkenberg and Ocon were the final points scorers in ninth and 10th, from Bearman, Hadjar, Gasly and Stroll, with the penalised Colapinto and Tsunoda the final classified drivers at the end of their bruising afternoons behind the wheel.

As mentioned above, Verstappen and Antonelli both watched the race from the paddock after their first-lap collision, while Williams suffered one of their worst days of the season thanks to Albon and Sainz's double elimination.

“It was a tough race, pushing the whole way through – tricky, hot, tiring – but a perfect result for us a team,” said Norris. “A 1-2 is exactly what we want and we did it again, so I'm very happy. We [me and Piastri] had a great battle, that's for sure. It was a lot of fun – for me a lot of stress, but a lot of fun! A nice battle, so well done to Oscar. Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was obviously tough, especially when he was in DRS. The DRS [effect] is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well. He was still quick, so it was good fun.”

F1 will travel directly from Spielberg to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix over the weekend of July 4-6. Head to the RACE HUB to find out how you can follow the action.

The drivers and teams report back on all the action at the Red Bull Ring from the Austrian Grand Prix.

Norris got a great start, as did Piastri behind. The Australian picked off Leclerc through Turn 1, and from there it was a two-horse race to the flag. Piastri was within DRS range of Norris for the entire first stint, even overtaking for the lead, but immediately lost out as Norris pulled out the switcheroo and cut back inside his team mate. There was one tight moment where Piastri locked-up as he tried a move, the team warning him that that was on the edge. But then they pitted Norris and left Piastri out.

Norris got the undercut advantage and wound up with a six-second lead through the second stint. They pitted one lap apart for the final stint, and Piastri was pushed onto the grass as he came out alongside Colapinto. That cost him time – and as he chased back to his team mate, he wound up just two seconds adrift at the flag. A race of what might have been for the Australian, while Norris was faultless in recording his third win of the season.

Lando Norris, 1st

""I'm very happy with the result, a 1-2 is the perfect finish for us as a team. Oscar and I had a great battle, which was a lot of fun, and we were able to maximise the pace of the car and the strategy.

""Thanks to the team for the upgrades and all of their work to get us to a place where the car was able to pull away. Now, onto my favourite weekend of the year, Silverstone.""

Oscar Piastri, 2nd

""That was an intense race. I'm happy we've come away with a 1-2 after some really good racing. After a solid start, I was close to the win, but it was tough to make progress to close the gap again after the first stop.

""A big thank you to the team for the great car they've given us. To have the pace to pull away from the field whilst battling each other was impressive, and something we can be proud of. Now, onto Silverstone.""

Andrea Stella, Team Principal

“A perfect conclusion to a very competitive weekend, and a nice way to bounce back after a tough week in Canada. It's been made possible by great work from the trackside team, and also a wonderful effort from everyone at the factory to deliver an upgrade that has made the MCL39 a faster car.

“The racing was great today between Lando and Oscar: fair, robust in a couple of moments, but with mutual respect. This is exactly what we want to see between our drivers.  Lando drove a perfect weekend with a dominant Pole position, which he managed to convert into his third victory of the season. Oscar made a position at the start, overtaking Charles Leclerc, and then stayed right on Lando's gearbox for the first stint and very close until the end of the race.

“We're going to enjoy the moment – but not for very long as our focus must shift to the British Grand Prix. We want another strong performance at our home race, for our technical partners, our commercial partners and most of all, our many fans at Silverstone who have been with us all the way on this remarkable journey.”

Leclerc thought about a move on Norris into Turn 1, but as he pulled out of it, he created a gap for Piastri to squeeze through. That left him third and that is where he stayed pretty much all race – recording a comfortable podium, if a slightly dispiriting one given the gap the McLarens ahead wound up creating. Hamilton had to fight with Russell to get P4 back after losing out on the opening lap, soon  pulling away from the Mercedes in the opening stint. He briefly tried to close in on Leclerc, but a moment of understeer sent him wide and cost him a few seconds. That left him too far back to chase, and he brought his car home a lonely fourth.

Charles Leclerc, 3rd

""I rate our weekend as a team really well. We brought some upgrades which helped us to take a step forward and start closing the gap to McLaren. Unfortunately, they were just faster today.
In the first corner, I wanted to close in on Lando (Norris), but that left the door open for Oscar (Piastri) who was able to pass me for second place. I pushed a lot on the first stint and had quite a bit of degradation, but that's part of the game. We don't have any regrets today. We gave it everything and extracted the maximum from our race. We will continue to work hard to make more progress with the aim of getting back onto the top step of the podium. That's our main priority and the whole team deserves it.""

Lewis Hamilton, 4th

""It's been a solid weekend for the team – we continued to improve our qualifying pace and the team did a great job throughout. We didn't have the race pace we expected, but still, we came away with some solid points and a podium, which is something we can be proud of. We'll analyse the data carefully to understand where improvements can be made. Thank you to everyone at the track and at the factory for their hard work and commitment. We remain focused and I'm looking forward to my first home Grand Prix with Ferrari.""

Jerome D'Ambrosio, Deputy Team Principal

""We can be happy with this result. For a while now, Fred's been saying we just need to put everything together and have a clean weekend and that's what we did. Today, in a clean race, both our drivers ran a very similar pace. Obviously, the gap to McLaren is still big, especially during the race, but we'll keep on pushing to close it down. The gaps between the teams change from race to race, so you just have to focus on yourself and do the best you can. Today, we moved back up to second in the Constructors' even if by an extremely small margin and everyone in the team is keen to keep pushing to improve and do even better.

""As for stepping into Fred's shoes, the reality is that in this team we have a lot of good people who know what they're doing and so it didn't really change anything in the process. The team operated well and the race was pretty straightforward from our perspective.""

Verstappen's race was over on the opening lap. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time as Antonelli tagged him into a spin, hitting the rear of the Red Bull hard enough to cause race-ending damage for the Dutchman. That left Tsunoda as the only Red Bull driver out there. He collided with Stroll early on as he tried to barge past the Canadian, which the stewards decided was a racing incident. But they handed Tsunoda a 10-second time penalty for his collision with Colapinto, who he tagged into a spin. That required a new front wing, and the long stop dropped Tsunoda down the back of the field on a day where P10 looked possible.

Max Verstappen, DNF

“The incident with Kimi on the first lap was unfortunate but no one does that on purpose and I knew it was an accident. He apologised to me when we were walking back from the track and he came to my room afterwards to apologise again, we get on very well, he is an amazing guy and a super talented driver. P6 for Lawson this weekend is fantastic. Unfortunately for us this weekend there weren't a lot of positives and although we were unlucky with the yellow flag in qualifying yesterday and the incident today, we lacked pace throughout. We will have a look at everything we did from this weekend, I know how hard the Team work and we need to get a better understanding of the car. We have had some amazing performances at this track in the past and I am the most disappointed about this result in front of a home crowd, but we will continue to try and do our best and my mentality and focus will not change.""

Yuki Tsunoda, 16th

""Firstly, apologies to Franco the move on him was a bit unnecessary, it was my mistake and I am sorry to my Team for the damage that caused and the time it cost us. It has been a poor day, and I am not sure what I am doing wrong right now, it is hard to find the reason behind why I can't get it right in this car. The one lap pace is getting better but in terms of long run pace, the tyres feel like they are degrading lap by lap and very quickly. It feels like the track is chewing the tyres and it is really difficult to figure out why currently. I want to look through it with my Team and explore it more to find something different to do. I am really trying to get it right; I will look deeper into things and work harder to find the reasons. I need to focus on myself and want to improve. It is very frustrating, but I find myself in this situation and I have to resolve it myself. At the same time, I need to find the key to unlock the performance, whether it be technique or approach to this car.""

Christian Horner, Team Principal

""It was a horrible race for us and desperately unlucky for Max to be taken out at turn 3 when he had done nothing wrong, he had a good start and made good progress. It's a shame, I don't think we would have been racing the McLarens today but we would have been racing the Ferraris pretty hard. With Yuki it was again not a great race, he had damage to the front wing, a penalty and so on, unfortunately for us it was a weekend to forget.""

(Photo by Andy Hone/LAT Images)

Antonelli came into Turn 3 a little hot after spotting a gap on the inside, and locked up. That sent him straight on and while he managed to avoid Lawson, he couldn't avoid the Red Bull of Verstappen. He hit the RB21 hard enough to send both Verstappen and himself into immediate retirement – but held his hands up and apologised immediately. He was handed a three-place grid drop for the next race.

Russell picked off Hamilton into Turn 1, but lost the place back quite quickly. On a hot day, his Mercedes dropped back from the Ferraris as he couldn't keep pace out there. Fifth was a case of damage limitation on a weekend that did not seem to play to his team's strengths.

George Russell, 5th

""This Austrian Grand Prix weekend just confirmed where our strengths and weaknesses are with the W16. When it's too hot, we tend to underperform, and we really struggle to keep up with the leaders' pace. P5 was therefore the maximum we could have done today. Finishing 60 seconds away from the winning driver in Lando (Norris) shows the work we need to do. Thankfully, we know the areas where we need to improve and we will be working hard towards this.

""We now quickly move on to next weekend. Silverstone last year was a really good race. We got pole position and showed good potential before our retirement. The team tends to do really well at the British Grand Prix so hopefully we can replicate that once again. We have our fingers crossed that the conditions will be slightly cooler than this weekend and we can get back in the fight for the podium.""

Kimi Antonelli, DNF

""I am very disappointed with how today played out. After the lights went out, I was just trying to maintain my starting position but made a mistake coming into Turn Three and that cost me a lot. I did not brake too late but after trying to avoid Liam (Lawson) I locked the rear brakes. I then locked the front brakes too and could not avoid the crash with Max (Verstappen).

""We didn't get to see how our race would have played out so apologies to the team. I also want to say sorry to Max for ruining his race too. This was a big mistake, and I know we could have fought for a good result without it. Thankfully, we've got a race straight away next weekend, so our full focus is already on Silverstone.""

Toto Wolff, Head of Mercedes-Benz Motorsport

""Today was not how we wanted things to go. The mistake made by Kimi was unfortunate, but this is what racing is. We now need to analyse what happened to understand better why the tyres locked the way they did. It was a shame for Kimi, us as a team, and also for Max (Verstappen) too, but this is just part of racing sometimes.

""George meanwhile had a lonely race. He ultimately maximised the car we had today, but he was not threatened by those behind but neither had the pace to challenge the Ferraris or McLarens ahead. The limiting factors for us are a more abrasive asphalt, longer corners and high temperatures. That is what we faced today but the gap we saw today was too big to reduce it down to those three elements alone. We will look at all the data and find solutions. Fortunately, we get back racing straight away next weekend. We are more confident heading there as the lower temperatures should help us perform better and we have been competitive at Silverstone in recent years.""

Andrew Shovlin, Trackside Engineering Director

""It is a shame that Kimi's race got cut short at Turn Three. He locked the rear axle going into the corner, tried to avoid the cars ahead but unfortunately locked the front brakes too and ran into Max (Verstappen). This unfortunately marked the end of his race in Austria.

""On the other side of the garage, George struggled a lot with his tyre degradation. The conditions were much warmer than what we had in Free Practice and managing his tyres carefully was the only choice he was left with. The high temperatures here just showed where our weakness is again, and we will work really hard to solve this for the upcoming races.

""After struggling this much in hot races, we now have a better understanding of where we stand and what needs to be done to perform better. The next few days will see intense work from the team and hopefully we will be able to fight for a podium in Silverstone.""

Lawson was very fortunate not to be fully collected by Antonelli on the opening lap, riding his luck although he picked up some damage after bumping his way past the Mercedes. From there, the team opted to try a one-stop race for the Kiwi, and it worked out perfectly. He had to contend with Alonso on his rear wing for the majority of the race, but didn't put a foot wrong and came home a career-best P6. Hadjar was forced wide through Turn 1 on the opening lap, and again through Turn 3. That led to an early pit stop, and left him needing a very long final stint on the hards. On aging tyres, he dropped back through the order.

Isack Hadjar, 12th

“It was a frustrating day. We did a very good race and we were comfortably in the points until 15 laps before the end of the race. We made the strategy work very well and race pace-wise we were good; I was feeling fast. Unfortunately, though, we picked up some floor damage in Turn 1, and from there, I was losing more than 1 second per lap, so it was definitely a tough end for us. It's a shame, as without the floor damage and after Liam finishing in P6, it could have been a double team point finish. Overall, the team did a really good job this weekend, considering the fast turnaround we made from Friday to Saturday, so well done to everyone. I'm looking forward to getting back to racing in Silverstone in only a few days.""

Liam Lawson, 6th

""It was a great weekend, and it feels good to execute everything well. It's been a tough season so far, with a lot of potential, and in this race, we were quick where it mattered and managed to see it through. After the first lap, I thought it might be over, but the team made a brave call with the one-stop strategy, it worked out perfectly. Full credit to them, they've been working incredibly hard behind the scenes, and I'm super proud. The car was really fast all weekend, we're constantly pushing and making small adjustments to make it more comfortable. The goal now is to carry this momentum through the rest of the season. We need to take the positives, keep fighting, and keep scoring points.”

Laurent Mekies, Team Principal

“We left Canada with a bit of a bitter taste, with such a tight midfield any little mistake cost loads. Arriving in Austria, we were eager to deliver a strong result in front of the incredible Red Bull Ring crowd. This circuit is a world-class venue, and racing here feels like coming home for us.

""Today's race began with Liam starting from the third row in P6, thanks to an exceptional performance yesterday that showcased his speed. It's never easy to start in a new team midseason, and he needed time to get used to our car. Yesterday's great laps show the progress he is doing, together with the team. Isack's starting position did not reflect his true potential this weekend. He demonstrated again his speed on this short yet challenging circuit, where a fraction of a second can significantly make the difference on the standings. The race was an incredible fight on a burning hot track.

""It did not look very bright after the first lap when both our cars were involved in incidents and lost many positions. From that point onward both Liam and Isack drove an incredible one stop race, whilst most of the field elected to 2-stop, and this allowed us to fight our way back to the very top of the midfield. The pace and the race execution were brilliant, Liam was unstoppable and defended for 70 laps to Fernando.

""As for Isack, only some debris that we picked up in the second part of the race stopped us from achieving a double points finish as we lost a very large amount of downforce on his car. It's a well deserved reward for the relentless hard work of all the women and the men in Faenza and Milton Keynes. We believe we are moving in the right direction. With Silverstone just around the corner, we look forward to another thrilling home Grand Prix. The British GP is always a sold-out spectacle, and we will reset and try our best to put on a solid performance once again for our fans and employees.”

Alonso had a very good race in Austria, one of just two drivers to make the one-stop strategy work. He started on the mediums and swapped to the hards, and had to absorb heavy pressure late on from Bortoleto. He lost out briefly but was able to gain the place straight back, some very clever racing from the veteran on show with the fight taking place while the race leaders were lapping the duo. As for Stroll, he was forced wide by Tsunoda early on, and never recovered to come near the points.

Fernando Alonso, 7th

""After starting P11, I'm really happy to finish P7 today in Austria. Our one-stop strategy worked really well. I was unsure about it this morning because of the heat, but it paid off and the team made the right decision. I was able to use DRS throughout the race and I was a bit lucky in the final laps - one more lap would have been too much. It's great to end a tough weekend on a high, and the team's hunger is clear to see. Let's carry this momentum into Silverstone next week.""

Lance Stroll, 14th

""We knew coming here it was always going to be a difficult weekend. We showed some early signs of decent pace in Free Practice but couldn't keep the positive momentum with the hotter temperatures over the rest of the weekend. It was always going to be challenging starting the race so far back today, but I also struggled with tyre degradation early on and we had to adapt our strategy because of that. We will have to look into it and use the coming days to prepare for Silverstone where we go again next week.""

Mike Krack, Chief Trackside Officer

""A well-planned and executed one-stop strategy helped us secure seventh place this afternoon. Fernando managed the tyre plan perfectly and made the most of a good track position just behind Lawson. It was not an easy strategy to convert, but credit to Fernando and the team for making it work. Lance pushed hard and was involved in a few battles throughout the field, but he suffered with high tyre degradation and points were out of reach for him today. Our attention now turns to the British Grand Prix in just a few days' time. We will look to score more points in our home race.""

Kick Sauber scored with both cars for the first time this season, their upgrades doing the business in Austria. Bortoleto started well, kept out of trouble and looked on for big points. In the end he wound up behind the one-stopping duo of Alonso and Lawson, running out of time to pick them off although he had a very good go on the last few laps of getting past his manager. As for Hulkenberg, he started last and yet climbed up into the points in a very good drive. He kept out of trouble, picked his battles wisely and grabbed his third points finish in a row.

Nico Hulkenberg, 9th

“It's a great feeling to be in the points for the third time in a row – especially after a tough qualifying yesterday. We executed a solid race today: aggressive strategy, early first stop, and we managed to make the tyres last while keeping the pace strong. That paid off. I've always felt even more confident with our race pace, and today we were able to make the most of the opportunities. Since Barcelona, we've found a better balance with the car and the performance is coming together more consistently. That's encouraging. We've shown consistent good performance three times in a row now on different track layouts. Double points for the team is a fantastic result – and I'm really happy for Gabi scoring his first points in F1. Big congratulations to him, well deserved. Another six points in the bag, a happy team, and positive momentum. Let's keep pushing.”

Gabriel Bortoleto, 8th

""What a race! I am thrilled to have scored my first points in Formula One, especially as we achieved a double points result, too. It was an amazing race – super intense from start to finish, and I am really proud of what we have done today, together, as a team. The pace was strong, the strategy worked out just right, and the whole team did an incredible job. We put the weekend together, stayed sharp in every moment, and I finally got my first points. This is a testament of how much progress we have made and of what we are capable when everything clicks. This is just the beginning, though: for me, it means to keep pushing, keep improving, and aim for even bigger results. The battle with Fernando [Alonso] at the end was a fun one – he didn't make it easy! – but today was really about the team and taking this important step forward together.""

Jonathan Wheatley, Team Principal

""A fantastic result for the team here in Austria. Nico becomes the first Sauber driver since Valtteri in 2022 to score points in three consecutive races – and it's only the eighth time in our 32-year history that a driver has climbed from 20th or lower to finish in the top nine. We hadn't finished in the top eight here since 2001 – so this result is something very special for the team.

“Gabriel was on a medium – medium – hard strategy and showed strong pace but, unfortunately, got caught in traffic and lapped by the McLarens near the end – otherwise, I think he could have finished higher. He's shown impressive pace and consistency all weekend and truly deserves his first points in Formula One. With Nico, we took a bold approach on a soft – medium – medium strategy, and his smart, measured drive delivered our first double points finish of 2025.

“Huge credit to everyone at the factory – Mattia and the whole team have done an outstanding job bringing these upgrades. The tools are correlating well, the car is responding, and the team is executing to increasingly high standards. We leave Austria energised for Silverstone and ready to fight for every place and for every point.""

Haas might have struggled for one-lap pace this weekend, but their race pace was good. They split strategies, starting Bearman on the softs and Ocon on the mediums. Both made up places and got their elbows out, and briefly it looked like they might score with both cars too. But Bearman's second stop dropped him back, and both he and his team mate ran out of time to chase down Hulkenberg ahead. Still, Ocon scored which is important as the midfield fight tightens up once again.

Esteban Ocon, 10th

“I'm very happy, looking at where we were in qualifying it's a great recovery by the whole team. We got a point for consolation but it means a lot as it shows we have a really good race car, we just need a bit more in qualifying, trying to get a bit more performance. The car was very solid and reliable, and I thank the team for that – as we ended in the interesting positions at the end. It was tough racing out there today, how I like it, but it was a bit too tough perhaps because it could've cost us a lot more – but we should be pleased with the point.”

Oliver Bearman, 11th

“It was a good race overall, we made good progress. On the first stint on softs, I had a good opening stint but it left us with a lot to do on the next two sets of tyres. We really struggled in the middle stint and that's where my race came undone. The final run was a bit better but I had to go quite early onto the mediums, so it was another long stint. Overall, I'm glad with the progress we made getting to P11 and P10 with Esteban, we had good race pace today.”

Ayao Komatsu, Team Principal

“To get to P10 from P17 is positive – normally a very good result. What's not as good is with Esteban I think we could've done even better. Esteban's driving was really good, his first and second stints were so strong, I feel we may have pitted just a bit early on the first stop. That eliminated the chance to do a one-stop race with him which I think we could've done with his tyre management and pace. On Ollie's side his first stint on softs was good, and the pit stop was good, but it was the second stint on hard tires where he just had no pace and fell backward. We don't understand that yet, so we need to look into it. It's good we scored a point but our competitors scored more so we have some catching up to do in Silverstone. We have a new package coming for the next race, so we need to get the maximum out of it – a tenth makes a big difference – so we need to be on it.”

The two Alpine drivers had eventful races. Gasly had a great start on the soft tyres, but once those ran out of life, he dropped back. The Frenchman fought his way back into the top 10, but his second stop dropped him into traffic and he couldn't recover late on a day where many of Alpine's rivals scored. As for Colapinto, he was tagged into a spin by Tsunoda. Those two had multiple moments throughout the race, and were busy fighting when Piastri exited the pits. Colapinto seemed to not see the McLaren and forced him wide onto the grass – a move that earned him a five-second time penalty.

Pierre Gasly, 13th

“A very disappointing afternoon in the end for the team. We have a lot to understand and analyse as I just felt a lack of grip all race and really struggled across all the stints. I am not sure why, maybe some damage to the car, maybe not, but we need to review this one in detail as it was a very long afternoon and a frustrating outcome. We had a very good start, up to sixth place at the end of the first lap. After that, there is not much to say other than it being a difficult race. We move onto Silverstone straight away now for the home race of Enstone. It is always a fantastic event and one I look forward to going to, this time aiming to bounce back from this tough weekend.”

Franco Colapinto, 15th

“It was a hot and frustrating afternoon today. We had a good start but as the race went on, we struggled with the car and the balance, which did not really work for us as a team. We lacked pace today and we suffered more with the tyres than usual with high degradation. Right now, we do not know why, so we need to sit down together as a team and carefully review it. I had the incident with Tsunoda at Turn 4, which set us back a bit and lost us some time. Yuki came to me and said sorry afterwards, but it's a pity as the car felt different following the contact, potentially due to some damage. We have a short time between now and Silverstone where we will go back to the factory at Enstone and work hard with the aim of coming back stronger at the team's home race next weekend.”

Flavio Briatore, Executive Advisor

“Ultimately, we have lost ground to our direct rivals in the Championship after another race without scoring points and, frankly, this level of performance is increasingly concerning. While yesterday the car was quick and should have been well inside Q3 with two cars, Sundays are a very different story for us and it is important we understand why this is, especially if we want to turn this season around from this difficult position.”

Williams had a day to forget in Austria. Sainz didn't manage to pull away on the Formation Lap to cause the start to be aborted. He did manage to get away, whizzing round to pull into the pits and start from there. But then his brakes caught fire, and the damage done by that and extinguishing the flames damaged his car too badly for him to take part in the race. Albon had a great getaway when the race did start, and was running solidly in the points. But just after his pit stop, he was called back by the team to retire the car with an issue. That is Albon's third DNF in a row.

Alex Albon, DNF

""A very frustrating and disappointing day. We had a great start; we were a bit fortunate as the waves parted for us, but we were in the right place at the right time, had a good car, executed a nice overtake on Pierre [Gasly] and were pulling away from the cars behind. Then we ran into this issue which looks similar to the one in Canada, but we need to review it. We've had three DNFs in a row and it's the same car as it was at the beginning of the year, so we need to investigate why it was more reliable then. It's possibly the temperatures that we're running at, but it is in the races that we are suffering. We can't afford for it to happen at Silverstone as that's a good track for us and we've missed out on points today, so we need to deep dive and find a solution.""

Carlos Sainz, DNS

""Too many issues yesterday, too many issues today. This weekend I couldn't show the true pace that I know we had and that leaves me frustrated. However, it's time to stay focused and work even harder as a team to learn from this tricky period and bounce back. I'm fully confident that if we manage to execute clean weekends, better results will come soon. Up next is our home race at Silverstone, so let's keep pushing to make the most out of it!""

James Vowles, Team Principal

""A very disappointing day. We had the pace today to comfortably finish sixth, and yet we walk away with a double DNF. We had two different issues that need to be understood to make sure we rectify them going forward. We're on a good journey towards building a fast car but we're not complete yet in terms of operation and reliability. We 13 races in front of us this season and they're key races to build this muscle and this capability to make sure that, as we move up the grid and we get faster and faster, we're able to fight at the front with the very best.""

Mario Isola, Motorsport Director

“The first race weekend in the height of summer saw our tyres behave as expected, both yesterday in qualifying and today in the race. Over 70 laps run in very high temperatures – the track varied between 52 and 55 °C – degradation across the three compounds was higher than during Friday free practice, when temperatures were between 15 and 20 °C lower, however not by a significant amount.

“All three compounds proved they could play their part, both at the start, with five drivers choosing the C5 for the first stint, while Stroll tried to do something different, fitting it with about 15 laps remaining. As expected, the two-stop was the quickest strategy, but those who tried the one-stop proved to be pretty competitive, to the extent of finishing in the top ten. In terms of performance, the Hard and Medium proved to be quite similar, while the Soft was competitive in the opening laps, but then obviously dropped off, starting from around laps 7 and 8.

“Now we head for Silverstone, a track that is always very hard on tyres. We have chosen a trio of dry weather compounds that is a step softer than in the past (C2, C3 and C4) and we are keen to see how they will perform and what effect this will have on race strategy.”

Watch the opening lap of the Austrian Grand Prix as McLaren's Lando Norris led the race while drama unfolded further behind.

Amid scorching temperatures, Lando Norris clung onto the lead at the start of the Austrian Grand Prix in a chaotic race start that saw multiple position changes and retirements for Max Verstappen and Kimi Antonelli.

The start was initially aborted as Carlos Sainz – who reported issues with his Williams when he exited Q1 on Saturday – found himself stuck on the grid at the beginning of the formation lap. While he eventually got going, his return to the pits prompted a fairly intense fire around his rear brakes and he was forced to retire straight away.

At lights out, Norris and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc both got a good launch, but the lead McLaren was able to fend off the Monegasque's challenge heading into the first corner. This allowed Oscar Piastri, who started from P3, to charge past Leclerc and claim second place on track.

Further back, Kimi Antonelli locked up and drove straight forward into Verstappen, resulting in both being stranded on the circuit and retiring from the race as the Safety Car appeared while their their cars were recovered.

Yuki Tsunoda endured another tough weekend at the Austrian Grand Prix, the Red Bull driver crossing the line in 16th and last place.

Yuki Tsunoda cut a downbeat figure after ending the Austrian Grand Prix in 16th and last place, with the Red Bull driver admitting that he is finding it “really, really hard” to figure out the reason for his struggles in the RB21.

Qualifying had already proven tough for Tsunoda, who exited in Q1 after only managing to secure P18 on the grid. From there he faced a tricky afternoon at the Red Bull Ring, during which he received a 10-second time penalty – along with two penalty points – for causing a collision with Alpine's Franco Colapinto.

While the Japanese driver avoided any further punishments when he was investigated for allegedly forcing Aston Martin's Lance Stroll off the track in another battle, he was unable to make much progress through the field and crossed the line down in P16.

Reflecting on his race after jumping out of the car, Tsunoda – who has finished outside of the points for the last four Grands Prix – was left searching for answers over how he can improve.

“To be honest the move on Franco was a bit unnecessary,” the 25-year-old said. “I could probably wait one more lap, but that was a pretty bad move for myself.

“Otherwise the pace itself was pretty poor as well – not sure what I'm doing wrong, to be honest. I have to look through harder, but to be honest it's really, really hard to find the reason for what I'm doing so wrong to drive this slow.”

With the British Grand Prix just a few days away as the second stop of a double header of races, Tsunoda was quizzed on whether he would use the limited time before that event to try to understand the car further, or if he would instead take more of a break following a tough weekend.

“I will look through more,” the Red Bull driver explained. “I just have to investigate more, and if I can do something different in driving style or if I can take something that Max [Verstappen] is doing differently compared to myself, whatever it is, I'll try, from left to right, everything, and keep improving.”

It was a difficult day all-round for the Milton Keynes-based outfit, with Verstappen out of the running on Lap 1 following a collision with Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, for which the Italian received a three-place grid penalty for next weekend's race at Silverstone.

Lando Norris triumphed at the Austrian Grand Prix following a thrilling battle with the other McLaren of Oscar Piastri, while there was plenty of action unfolding behind them...

The Austrian Grand Prix provided a thrilling weekend of action for Round 11 of the 2025 F1 season, with plenty of big talking points emerging from the Red Bull Ring.

Lando Norris bounced back from his Canada crash to seal victory, coming out on top after another nail-biting scrap with McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri – while, behind them, Red Bull endured a nightmare outing at their home event, Gabriel Bortoleto broke his points duck and several famous faces watched on. Here's our round up of all the highlights from the Austrian Grand Prix weekend...

A badly judged overtake attempt last time out in Canada saw Norris and Piastri clash, with the former retiring from the race while Piastri's eight-race streak of podium finishes also came to an end.

The pair reset for another round at the Red Bull Ring, with Norris clearly meaning business as he established a comprehensive gap over his team mate in Qualifying, but Piastri was far from fazed, declaring he was “not planning on finishing third”.

He quickly followed through on his words at lights out, charging past Charles Leclerc and immediately launching a challenge on Norris for the lead of the race. In possibly one of the most thrilling intra-team battles of the last few years, the two engaged in a race-long fight that involved each side of the McLaren garage going head-to-head, bringing strategy and tyre management into the on-track contest.

Norris had the clear advantage of starting on pole position, but Piastri rapidly shut down the gap and pursued the Briton with DRS for the entirety of the first stint.

In a moment that surely saw the team pit wall hold their breath, Piastri darted past Norris on Lap 11, snatching the lead albeit for only a short time. The original leader remained by his side and prevented him from edging further ahead, reclaiming first place as quickly as he'd lost it.

The tension didn't end there as the Australian endured another heart-in-mouth move soon afterwards – closing in on Norris once again, he locked up just behind and came agonisingly close to colliding with the rear of his car, but fortunately only emerged with an uncomfortable flat spot.

With the first round of pit stops beginning to kick off, the pair never got quite as near each other on track again, as Piastri's choice to stay out for four laps longer than Norris led to a six-second gap between them. A seemingly endless stream of backmarkers, including Franco Colapinto who forced Piastri off onto the grass unaware he was behind, further halted the Australian's ambition to return into DRS range, and Norris was able to endure the constant pressure until the chequered flag fell.

Looking at past results, this weekend should have been a return to glory for the Milton Keynes-based outfit – Max Verstappen holds the most pole positions and most victories in Austria and, of course, the circuit itself bears Red Bull's name in the team's home country.

Hordes of people rocked up in orange for the occasion, ready for another Verstappen masterclass in the Styrian hills. But they were swiftly disappointed by the conclusion of Qualifying as the Dutchman ended up in P7, deterred from setting a second flying lap due to the yellow flags shown whilst Pierre Gasly recovered from a late spin.

The session was similarly, if not more, disastrous for Yuki Tsunoda, who failed to progress to Q2 for the second time in the last three rounds and was resigned to start the race from P18 on the grid.

While Verstappen labelled the result “painful”, he also admitted that there could be “some surprises in the race”, which certainly proved to be accurate. Maybe he was expecting some drama at the front that he could capitalise on, but the drama actually ended up involving him.

Just a few corners into the opening lap, Kimi Antonelli locked up his rear tyres and found himself unable to make the corner, instead plunging straight on into the lead Red Bull to take both himself and Verstappen out of the race.

His remorse was evident as the two were seen talking whilst their cars were recovered, and the rookie confirmed that he had apologised immediately after the incident that caused the reigning World Champion's first DNF since the 2024 Australian Grand Prix. Antonelli still received a three-place grid drop for the upcoming round at Silverstone for causing a collision.

Tsunoda was forced to take on the role of the sole remaining Red Bull, but little went well for him. On Lap 30, he was passed by Colapinto's Alpine and, determined to reclaim the position, he threw caution to the wind and ended up clipping the Argentine's right rear tyre to send him into a spin.

He then headed to the pits to replace his damaged front wing and dropped to last in the order, with things going from bad to worse as he was handed a 10-second time penalty for the collision, well and truly confirming his P16 result.

Amid a wealth of collisions and mechanical failures, it's nice that at least one driver experienced the best weekend of their F1 career so far – enter Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto.

The combination of returning to a circuit he performed superbly at in his junior career and finding the rhythm he has been searching for in the C45 came together to produce the rookie's first F1 points.

After making it into Q3 for the first time this season, Bortoleto raced those around him masterfully, including his manager/mentor Fernando Alonso – the two engaged in a heartwarming battle for P7 in the final laps of the Grand Prix, with the former World Champion clinging onto the position.

He was later seen hugging the Brazilian and congratulating him on defending his Qualifying position to finish in eighth place, just ahead of his team mate Nico Hulkenberg.

Aside from Alonso, another driver to make the one-stop strategy work was Liam Lawson, who achieved his best Qualifying result so far (P6), in a similar vein to Bortoleto. He started and finished as the lead Red Bull-backed racer, securing an important six points for Racing Bulls as he escaped up the road from the Alonso-Bortoleto battle on the penultimate lap.

Saturday's Qualifying was an exciting affair, with Norris grabbing pole for Mclaren. Having sat out FP1, Norris topped FP2, FP3, Q1 and Q2 – so it was no surprise when he grabbed the P1 grid slot.

What was a surprise was the margin, the biggest of the season so far at 0.521s. That is a mighty gap at any circuit, but at Austria where the track is one of the shortest of the calendar, it laid down a form marker that Norris is back in business.

Yes, there was the caveat that a few drivers including Piastri did not get to complete – or even start – their second runs in Q3 thanks to yellow flags, but even so, Norris looked untouchable over one-lap.

It was the perfect response to some Q3 mistakes earlier this season, and his race-ending collision with his team mate in Canada.

News broke on Sunday that Austria has been handed a contract extension and will be on the calendar until 2041. It is a firm favourite with fans and drivers alike, and one of the most picturesque tracks the F1 circus visits.

Plenty of stars wanted to judge that for themselves, with Liverpool's former manager Jurgen Klopp attending the race on Sunday. He spent time in the Racing Bulls garage and perhaps that was what inspired such a strong performance from the team, with Liam Lawson grabbing a brilliant sixth-place finish.

Eric Bana was also spotted in the Austria paddock, the actor no stranger to the world of F1 as a big sports fan.

It remains to be seen if Pierre Gasly approached him for tips – after F1 The Movie star Brad Pitt cited Gasly as the driver most likely to make it in Hollywood, Gasly joked he might have to turn to acting as a second career unless he started scoring points.

And what did he fail to do in the race? Score points. Hollywood might beckon for Pierre.

McLaren's Oscar Piastri was determined to return to his winning ways at the Austrian Grand Prix, but his race-long battle with Lando Norris ended in a second-place finish.

Although he applied relentless pressure to eventual winner Lando Norris throughout the Austrian Grand Prix, Oscar Piastri was unable to find a way past his team mate during the battle and settled for second place.

After the McLaren pair came to blows last time out in Canada, there were plenty of tense moments as Piastri continuously fought to take the race lead at the Red Bull Ring. Frustrated after a badly timed yellow flag in Qualifying, he was eager to get back to the front as soon as possible.

He started from P3 on the grid but did not stay there for long, capitalising on Charles Leclerc's failed challenge on Norris at lights out to sweep past the Ferrari and launch the prolonged attack on his team mate.

The Australian crept closer and closer until he momentarily snatched the lead on Lap 11, making the most of a small error Norris made at Turn 1. However, the Briton stayed close and the two went side-by-side through Turn 4, ending with him reclaiming first place.

Following the eventful race Piastri summarised that the battle was “intense”, adding: “I hope it was good watching because it was pretty hard work from the car! I tried my absolute best.

“I probably could have done a better job when I just got ahead momentarily, but it was a good battle. A bit on the edge at times and probably pushed the limits a bit far, but it was a good race.”

One of those 'on edge' moments came on Lap 20 when Piastri locked up in the middle of an overtake attempt, coming remarkably close to making contact with the rear of Norris' car. The two kept it clean and the latter peeled off into the pits, while Piastri opted to stay out for another four laps.

He hoped to use the advantage of having fresher tyres later on in the race, but a slow stop meant he returned onto the track six seconds adrift of Norris. Even once he cut the gap down, the challenge of passing numerous backmarkers prevented him from getting back into DRS range.

Despite missing out on the win, Piastri was pleased with the outcome and said: “That's what we're here to do, try and race each other and try and fight for wins. That's what we did today, it was close for me but not quite enough.

“Thanks to the team – to have the kind of pace that we did whilst battling each other, it was very impressive so I can't thank the team enough for the car we've got.”

Asked to elaborate on whether he expected to engage in a race-long battle, he added: “Yeah, I thought it was possible. I think Qualifying yesterday was unfortunate with the yellow flag. I feel like the pace this weekend has been good.

“I think once I could stay in the DRS it felt pretty good, afterwards once I dropped out after the first stop it was tough to make the progress to get back. Some things to go over and see if we could have done anything better.”

Lando Norris was delighted to take victory at the Austrian Grand Prix following a close battle with McLaren team mate Oscar Piastri.

Lando Norris was delighted to lead a McLaren 1-2 with his victory at the Austrian Grand Prix, which came following a “tough” race-long battle with team mate Oscar Piastri that caused the Briton “a lot of stress”.

Both papaya cars made a good start when the race got underway at the Red Bull Ring, Norris maintaining his lead from pole position while Piastri took a position from Ferrari's Charles Leclerc to move up into P2.

A thrilling scrap then ensued across the opening stint which saw Piastri make several attempts at overtaking Norris. The Australian briefly got ahead at one stage, only for the other McLaren to quickly surge back in front.

The fight started to heat up again during the final stages of the 70-lap encounter, but Norris managed to maintain enough of a gap to seal his third win of the season, crossing the line 2.695s clear of Piastri.

Asked after jumping out of the car about how he had handled the pressure throughout the race – which took place in hot conditions in Spielberg – Norris admitted that it had not been an easy afternoon at the wheel of the MCL39.

“It was a tough race,” the 25-year-old conceded. “Pushing the whole way through. [It was] tricky, hot, tiring, but a perfect result for us a team – a 1-2 is exactly what we want and we did it again, so I'm very happy.”

The result marked a strong turnaround for Norris following the nightmare end to his race last time out in Canada, in which he collided with Piastri during the closing laps and was forced to retire from the running.

This time the intra-team duel remained clean, but Norris acknowledged that Piastri gave him quite a tough challenge throughout the event in Austria.

“We had a great battle, that's for sure,” the British driver said. “It was a lot of fun, for me a lot of stress but a lot of fun! A nice battle, so well done to Oscar.

“Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was obviously tough, especially when he was in DRS. The DRS is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap, but once I did I could manage things pretty well. But he was still quick, so it was good fun.”

Norris' victory means that his gap to leader Piastri in the Drivers' Championship now stands at 15 points ahead of McLaren's upcoming home race at Silverstone on July 4-6.

Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri secured a 1-2 for McLaren at the Red Bull Ring after a series of tense battles.

Lando Norris came out on top in a fierce battle with his McLaren team mate in the Austrian Grand Prix, crossing the line marginally ahead of Oscar Piastri as Ferrari's Charles Leclerc took the final podium spot.

It was an action packed race at the Red Bull Ring, starting with Kimi Antonelli locking up and taking out Max Verstappen on the opening lap before Norris and Piastri began their intense fight for the lead.

The Australian momentarily took P1 on Lap 11 before Norris reclaimed it and later became the first McLaren to pit for fresh tyres, while Piastri elected to stay out for four more laps. His advantage of newer tyres disappeared as both contended with getting past backmarkers, ultimately leading to the Briton finishing just over two seconds ahead of his team mate.

Elsewhere, both Williams drivers retired from the race with mechanical issues, with Carlos Sainz unable to even start the Grand Prix as his rear brakes caught fire in the pit lane. It was a much better race for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto, who maintained his Qualifying position of P8 to secure his first points of the season.

Mercedes endured a difficult Austrian Grand Prix as Kimi Antonelli crashed out on the first lap and George Russell finished a distant fifth.

Toto Wolff was left to rue a challenging Austrian Grand Prix for Mercedes after Kimi Antonelli's first-lap collision with Max Verstappen and George Russell's lonely run to fifth position.

Winners last time out at the Canadian Grand Prix, Mercedes continued where they left off with a pace-setting display in first practice at the Red Bull Ring, but that would prove to be the high point of their weekend.

After Qualifying fifth and ninth respectively, Mercedes' hopes of turning the situation around were severely dented at the start of the race when Antonelli lost control of his car under braking for Turn 3 and collected Red Bull rival Verstappen.

From there, Russell was the Silver Arrows' sole representative and had to settle for converting his starting position – finishing a minute behind the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

Asked to reflect on the race, beginning with Antonelli's incident, which earned the rookie a three-place grid drop, Mercedes boss Wolff said: “We always knew that eventually… No, I word it differently. These mistakes happen.

“The rears blocked on the car. I'm not entirely sure it was his [Antonelli's] fault or a system. I haven't seen any data or heard anything, because obviously we were concentrating on the race. But that happens, you know.

“It's unfortunate for Max and Red Bull that Kimi hit him, but it's racing.”

Asked if he had spoken with Antonelli about what happened, Wolff shared: “Yeah, he came into the garage quickly. I said, ‘Well, that wasn't great', which he obviously knew, but he said the tyres just blocked and we need to analyse that.

“It's a shame that Max… that we took another car out with us, but that can happen to the great ones, to the inexperienced ones, to the experienced ones – it's just part of F1.”

Wolff then reflected on Mercedes' wider weekend performance, having gone from pole position and victory with Russell in cooler Montreal conditions to finishing third-best behind McLaren and Ferrari amid the Spielberg heat.

“When you look at our performance last year, we won, we won the race here,” said Wolff, pointing to Russell capitalising on Verstappen and Norris' clash. “We were, I don't remember, 10-15 seconds behind the leaders, and that was a very solid performance.

“This year we're a minute behind the leaders, so that is clearly out of the ordinary what happened today. We do experiment at the moment a little bit, how to position, how to put the car on track, where we put the balance, and clearly this one we got wrong – and we know that.

“I think it's not only down to asphalt, long corners and heat. Clearly that's not our sweet spot, but it doesn't explain the gap, and I think we know why, but in hindsight you always know.”

Mercedes dropped back to third in the Teams' Championship standings following Sunday's race, a point behind Ferrari, who scored strongly with Charles Leclerc in P3 and Lewis Hamilton in P4.

Ferrari could not make it onto the podium last time out in Canada, but Charles Leclerc put them back in the top three at the Austrian Grand Prix.

Charles Leclerc praised Ferrari for their “great job” in delivering effective upgrades at this weekend's Austrian Grand Prix, after he and the team returned to the podium places.

Ferrari brought floor upgrades to the SF-25 at the Red Bull Ring in a bid to get their season back on track following an up-and-down sequence of races that swung between fighting for trophies to struggling for minor points.

Having split McLaren pair Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri in Qualifying, thanks in part to the Australian being hampered by yellow flags, Leclerc dropped to third at the first corner and held that ‘best of the rest' spot thereafter, with team mate Lewis Hamilton backing him up in fourth.

Reflecting on Piastri's first-lap pass, and how his race unfolded from that point, Leclerc said: “I was not planning to try and overtake in Turn 1, actually. I don't think it's very much possible here to try to go around Turn 1.

“As soon as I had a good start I was side-by-side and that was basically my position, then I had to brake early, Oscar overtook me around the outside, so there wasn't much I could have done better there.

“But to be honest, if I would have kept second place, I'm pretty sure I would have got overtaken very quickly afterwards because they [the McLarens] were just too quick today.

“We still need to work hard. The team has done a great job in bringing those upgrades and we did steps in the right direction, but we are still missing a little bit of pace.”

Asked if he feels like there is now “light at the end of the tunnel” for Ferrari, Leclerc replied: “I hope so! I mean, we are working in the right direction for sure – this weekend proves it.

“I think we have done small steps in the right direction. We need to be careful to judge too quickly our upgrades. It does everything we wanted, but we need to wait maybe two or three races in order to judge it properly and to judge our actual pace properly.

“We are going in the right direction. I hope that we can bring new parts as soon as possible and if that's the case then I hope that this will close the gap even more so with the McLaren.”

Hamilton was also keen to “take the positives” from the weekend – pointing to both Ferraris finishing within half a minute of winner Norris after some much bigger deficits so far this year.

“I think I'm slowly making progress, which is a real positive,” the seven-time World Champion said after the race. “We've made progress as a team, which is really positive.

“It's great for us to be the second-fastest team this weekend and to be so close to… we're not a minute down [on the leaders], which is really positive.

“Obviously we can't do what the McLarens can do at the moment, but this is really I think down to the great upgrade that we had, and I think we had a better execution as a team this weekend.”

As for whether he and Ferrari can use the weekend as a stepping stone to more success, Hamilton continued: “I can see Qualifying is getting better. My race pace is not very good.

“I'm really struggling with the balance in the race. I had massive understeer in the low-speed and massive oversteer in the high-speed – nothing I could do with my tools could fix that.

“Also we have brake problems all the time, so I was struggling with the brakes, having to manage the brakes the whole race, which is never great and that was losing time – but we'll take the positives this weekend!”

Ferrari have moved back up to second in the Teams' Championship following Sunday's race in Spielberg, one point ahead of rivals Mercedes, who failed to score with Kimi Antonelli after the rookie ran into Max Verstappen's Red Bull on the opening lap.

TRACK INTERVIEWS
(Conducted by Davide Valsecchi)

Q: Lando, what a race. What enormous pressure. How did you handle it? From outside, that was just epic.

Lando NORRIS: Yeah, it was a tough race. You know, pushing the whole way through. Tricky, hot, tiring. But the perfect result for us as a team, a one-two is exactly what we want, and we did it again. So, I'm very happy. Probably the best comeback after Canada.

Q: What a turnaround. How did you handle Oscar Piastri in the first 20 laps? At a certain point when he overtook you just up there in Turn 3, you had a great battle.

LN: We had a great battle, that's for sure. Yeah, it was a lot of fun for me. A lot of stress, but a lot of fun. Yes, a nice battle. So well done to Oscar. Hopefully, it was a nice one for everyone to watch. But inside the car it was tough, especially when he was in the DRS. The DRS is so big around here, it's hard to get him out of the gap. But once I did, I could manage things pretty well. But yeah, he was still quick. So, it was good fun.

Q: Congratulations. It was a great show.

LN: Thank you.

Q: Oscar, congratulations. How was it drom inside the car because it was impressive how you could pressure for all the first 20 laps. It was just something unbelievable. How was it from inside?

Oscar PIASTRI: Intense. I hope it was good watching because it was pretty hard work from the car. So yeah, I tried my absolute best and probably could have done a better job when I just got ahead momentarily, but yep, it was a good battle. A bit on the edge at times and probably pushed the limits a bit far. But yeah, it was a good race. You know, that's what we're here to do, try and race each other and then try and fight for wins, and that's what we did today. It was close for me but not quite enough. So, thanks to the team. To have the kind of pace we did whilst battling each other was very impressive. So, I can't thank the team enough for the car we've got.

Q: After yesterday and your Friday, did you expect to be so competitive, to fight Lando all through the entire race?

OP: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was possible. I think qualifying yesterday was unfortunate with the yellow flag, and then I felt like the pace this weekend has been good. So, I think once I could stay in the DRS, I felt pretty good. Afterwards, once I dropped out after the first stop, it was tough to make the progress to get back. But yeah, some things to go over, see if we could have done anything better.

Q: Congratulations. Lovely show.

OP: Thank you.

Q: Charles, tell me your feeling after you're back on the podium. I think at the beginning you wanted to fight for victory, but then the pace was there. What do you think? How do you rate your weekend?

Charles LECLERC: I rate our weekend as a team really well. But unfortunately, the pace today was just not enough. In the first corner I was thinking about going, but Lando closed the door, and then that left the door open to Oscar. I lost second place there. But anyway, I think they were too fast for us to stay in second, so third was the best we could do. I don't regret much of what we've done today. I think we've done our maximum, just not enough pace.

Q: Tell me about your Ferrari. The move at Turn 3 was good because behind there was contact. Probably it was better to stay calm in that corner. And about your Ferrari, seems that during the weekend you improved a bit, then in the race, in the first part, you were closer. What's your feeling inside the car?

CL: Yeah, in the first stint I think I over pushed a little bit at the beginning trying to follow them, then I degraded a little bit more. But it's part of the game. I've tried, at the end, and it didn't make it today. I think eventually we need more pace. We've brought some upgrades this weekend and they definitely helped us to do a step forward, but we need to keep pushing in that direction in order to close the gap to the McLaren that for now are too quick.

Q: About the next races, because we are missing a victory this year. Tell me about the next races.

CL: I'm missing it too. So, I'll give it all to try and be back on the top step of the podium. Obviously, this is our main priority. The whole team deserves it, and hopefully it will be at the next race in Silverstone. We'll give it all.

PRESS CONFERENCE

Q: Congratulations, Lando. It was a thrilling victory for you today. What was the most pleasing aspect of it for you?

LN: Crossing the line at the end! That was the best bit, but there was plenty of fun along the way, with Oscar, in the first stint especially. Some close moments, some good battles. Just a lot of laps of looking in my mirrors out of Turn 1 and all the way down to Turn 3. Stressful for sure, not the most comfortable position to be in, but it was a good battle between us. And then quite a long race from that point onwards because I never had a lovely gap, and Oscar kept coming at me the next two stints. So, yeah, good fun, but a tricky race, but well managed.

Q: This was the first time that we've seen you and Oscar going wheel to wheel for a prolonged period. Did you learn anything new about him today?

LN: No. I mean, we just had some good battles, and we've had a couple in the past. Granted, they probably didn't last as long as they did today, but no, I think we both knew what to expect from each other. We both want to race hard and race fair. It goes both ways, and of course, kind of have to put Montreal behind us and behind me for sure. It's something I wish never happened, but it was nice that we could go out and have a good battle and push things to the limits. There were still some close moments, but nothing that would make Andrea or the pit wall sweat too much.

Q: The pace today, Lando, was frenetic. You were twenty seconds ahead of Charles in third place. Were you pushing hard in all three stints?

LN: Yeah! Especially stint one. I think we got, like, ten laps here, and the gap was already, like, five seconds. And I knew what our pit stop window was going to be or was planning to be. And I was like, there's no chance we're going make it to the pit stop here. Oscar was pushing too, and I think we knew quite quickly that we weren't racing the Ferraris behind with a quick race car, and it was kind of eyes forward. But the first stint was difficult just because I couldn't get my battery up, and it was quite a strategic part of the race. And I was just always vulnerable for those reasons. But as soon as I did the pit stop, I could get the battery back up for the first time, and then I could be a little bit more comfortable.

Q: This is a great springboard for you ahead of your home race at Silverstone next weekend. Are you expecting the updated parts on the McLaren to perform strongly through Silverstone's fast sweeps?

LN: I mean, our strengths here were the high speed, so I want to hope it's a similar case next weekend, but it's still a very different track. It's a different layout. We're not going to take anything for granted. But the upgrades were working as they should have done today, and that's certainly a good sign. So I think we give a lot of credit to everyone back in MTC and to the whole team for giving us another very, very good car, upgrades that we just can put on – they've been a little while and we've been pushing with things – but we put them on the car, and they worked as they should. So we're satisfied. The team is satisfied and excited for next weekend. The best race weekend of the year, in my opinion. To have my own grandstand, to have the British fans for McLaren and for myself is something I'm looking forward to for sure.

Q: Alright. And very well done today. Thank you, Lando. Oscar, let's come to you now. Can we start by talking about that battle with Lando, what you learned about him, how close it was?

OP: I mean, again, there have been a few battles in the past, not just last week, but last year and the year before. So, I think we both knew what to expect. It was a tough battle. It was close at some points, probably pushing the limits a bit much from my side once or twice. But we're fighting for race wins in Formula 1. It's going to be pretty tough work and pretty hard. I thought it was an entertaining race. After the first stop, maybe we didn't do the right thing giving Lando some breathing room, but the first 20 laps were pretty intense. So, it was a good battle.

Q: Why did you pit four laps later than Lando?

OP: I knew that I was always going to be pitting second in that scenario. For me, it felt like if I couldn't stay within DRS, then getting back inside one second was going to be very, very tough. So, I kind of wanted to go a bit different and give myself some fresher tyres and hopefully be able to use them at the end of the stint. It didn't really pan out that way, unfortunately, but that was the thinking at least. We'll go back and look and see whether that was the right thing to do. In the moment, I was always going to lose some amount of time by pitting a lap later, so I kind of went, why not try something a bit different?

Q: It was a great battle with Lando. Just how crucial was it for you to pass Charles on the run to turn one?

OP: Yeah. It made a big difference. It meant I could stay in DRS from the start, and DRS is very powerful here. So that certainly helped in the battle at the start. That was an important moment of the race, and then it pretty quickly became clear that it was just going to be a fight between us two. That was a key moment.

Q: It was a fight between you two here. Given what you now know about the car, do you think it'll be a two-horse race at Silverstone next weekend as well?

OP: I hope so, but you never know. Canada, we kind of thought we'd be good there, and we weren't. Here, we expected to be good, but probably not as good as we have been. I think we should be confident that we'll be decent, I think that's fair to say. But how quick we are, we'll find out next week.

Q: Alright. Oscar, very well done to you as well. Thank you. Charles, let's come to you. Your third podium in four races. What were the key moments for you this afternoon?

CL: Oh, I did not expect that question. There weren't very many key moments on my side. Obviously, the start, I wish I had done a bit of a better job to be completely alongside Lando. Maybe that would have changed a little bit for three or four laps. I don't think we had the pace to stay there in front. Basically, from Turn 1 one to the end, it was a very boring race. I was on my own, just trying to manage quite a few issues that we had on our side. Let's not call them issues, but we've got to do some management in the situation we're in at the moment. I won't go into the detail, but the lift and coast was a little bit frustrating. We paid a bit of the price for it on the first stint, but then the second and last stint were a bit more positive, which was good. But there weren't many key moments apart from the start.

Q: Having put a race distance on the upgrades this weekend, are you confident that they are a good step forward?

CL: They are definitely a step forward. Yes. And I think it helped us to be on the podium today. The team has done an incredible job at pushing to try and get them as early as possible. I know that they are still pushing extremely hard to have other upgrades as soon as possible, which I hope will make another difference and will help us to be a bit closer to McLaren, to Red Bull in their good days, or to Mercedes even in their good days. So, yeah, we are pushing hard, and I hope that we see the result as soon as possible.

Q: Are you surprised by the pace of McLaren this afternoon?

CL: Surprise is probably not the right word. The first stint was poor on our side, but the second and last stint I thought were reasonable, but I've got to look. I mean, I was obviously focused on my race, and I didn't see all the lap times. I saw the gap at the end of the race, and it's not the gap that you would want to see, but that's unfortunately the gap that we've had, if not more, since the beginning of the season. For us, we are working a little bit in relative to the others. And for now, this weekend, it's a step forward, and I hope that we can do another one as soon as possible.

QUESTIONS FROM THE FLOOR

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Lando, you mentioned Canada and wanting to put that behind you. How perfect a response has this whole weekend felt? Because you've been P1 every single session. And to soak all the pressure that Oscar put you under, does it feel like you've maybe not proved a point, but to yourself even just to bounce back like this?

LN: I mean, it's certainly, yeah, it's fulfilling for me. It gives me good confidence. I don't need to prove any points or prove anything to anyone, honestly. I like to prove things to myself, probably more than anything. So certainly, it's been a good clean weekend from FP2 onwards. Felt very comfortable and very on top of the car and performed exactly as I want to and as I need to. I just had a clean weekend. That's what I had. It's not that I've not been able to do it before and the pace has always been there at certain points. It's just there's been some different reasons for different things. But certainly, coming in today and yesterday to do the job that I did, I'm pretty happy with. But it doesn't come easily. It doesn't come just because I've turned up this weekend and things are better. I'm working a lot. I'm doing a lot more work than I used to away from the track with the team, on the simulator, with my own team, trying to improve everything that I can, both on and off the track. I think it's more a positive thing to see a lot of those things paying off immediately. Good step in the right direction. Still need more, so want more. So, we'll keep working.

Q: (Leonid Kliuev – Grande Premio Brazil). Question for Oscar. Do you think the team should have insisted on pitting you right after Lando and give you a chance to win?

OP: I don't know yet. We'll go back and look through it. Like I said before, I think I was always going to lose time by pitting second. I had past experience of being just stuck outside DRS, and that was a pretty painful place to be in the past. So, I didn't really want to be there again. In the moment, I thought that giving myself a bit more work to do but with better tyres was going to be an interesting option. With hindsight, yeah, maybe you can say it wasn't the right call, but there's a lot of things you can say in hindsight.

Q: (Lawrence Edmondson – ESPN) Another question for Oscar. The team described that move at Turn 4 as “too marginal” over the team radio. Sorry if you've already gone through this, but what was your interpretation of that? And Andrea said you apologised as soon as you crossed the line or at least acknowledged as soon as you crossed the line that perhaps it was a step too far in aggression.

OP: Yeah. I mean, I thought it was a fair comment. Locking up and missing the back of your team-mate by not a lot is certainly pushing the boundaries. Even if I hadn't been told anything, I didn't think it was a wise decision to try that one again. So, yeah, a fair comment and nothing more than that.

Q: (Zsolt Godina – F1Vilag.hu) Charles, on Friday, you seemed to struggle quite a bit with the pace, but for Saturday your pace improved quite a lot. Was that the result of some setup changes or what happened?

CL: Yeah. We changed quite a lot of things on the car. Obviously, I missed FP1, so FP2 was all about trying to understand where we were. Then for FP3, we did a big change in order to re-centre ourselves. I think we did a really good job from Friday to Saturday, only with one session to be able to re-centre ourselves. As soon as I got into the car in FP3, the car was feeling a lot better. I didn't do the long runs with the setup of today, but there weren't any bad surprises as well. I think we did a good job by maximising the car potential this weekend.

Q: (Luke Smith – The Athletic) Another one for Lando. You talk about those improvements and that work you've been doing. You and Will were having quite a lot of chatter through the race, and you were asking quite openly, like, look, I need help in some of these corners. Is that part of that extra work you've been doing? Because it does seem that you guys are not talking more on the radio, but at least more about those sort of granular details in terms of where can I find more pace in particular corners?

LN: It's part of it. Probably not the precise stuff that I've been working on, but that's just part of the general improvements we've been trying to make. I think it was more normal improvements that I've been trying to make. Just things you need when you're trying to win a race. As much as I like to not have any radio and just do my own thing and concentrate, when you've got some quick guys behind you or ahead of you, there's nothing wrong with asking for a bit of guidance and a bit of help every now and then. I'm just trying to utilise the guys I've got around me. My engineers, my performance engineers, they're looking at a lot more data than I can see. Obviously, I'm the one in the car, but when you've got a guy catching you here and there and there are some corners where you can improve, then I want to know those things. I would say that's nothing more than just general improvements but also me trying to be a bit more accepting of some help sometimes.

Q: (Phil Duncan – PA) Lando, you spoke about Silverstone there and your own grandstand and the 140,000 fans. Does that bring any extra pressure? Are you ready to use that to your advantage to get a second win in as many weeks? And to Oscar, obviously Silverstone is Lando's home turf. You two guys are leading the world championship. Are you braced at all for an uneasy or perhaps hostile reception from the British fans?

LN: I mean, I certainly hope that part's not going to happen. The British fans are normally very accepting for all of us and especially for us as McLaren. So I think the first point should be for all the fans to embrace everyone and to support everyone. Certainly, for me, I don't think there's any more pressure. Of course, it's a place I want to win more than anywhere else, but it doesn't change anything. It just puts a bit more of a smile on my face every morning when I wake up. It probably distracts me in a good way more than anything. Now I've got my own grandstand, and I've got more reasoning for different things. More of a positive distraction, I would say, more than a pressure. There's pressure in every race. There's pressure to win today, to be on pole yesterday. I don't think I can put myself under any more pressure. That doesn't change anything. More just something to look forward to, to enjoy every day, enjoy every lap, enjoy the experience, because it's still for me an experience to have my own grandstand, to have so many of my fans there supporting me, cheering me on. Very excited for it. Kind of want to go there now, but I could do with a good sleep as well.

OP: I don't think so. A couple of years ago they were chanting my name in the crowd, so that was unexpected. I'm not sure I'll quite get that again, which is fair enough. I feel like the fans in general this year have been a bit nicer to us. We didn't even have Max Verstappen fans booing us today, so that was a nice change. They've always been very accepting of me. Obviously, I race for a British team, and I think they're big fans of everything papaya and that includes both of us. I'm expecting there to be a lot more Lando fans than me fans, but that's fair. It's his home race as well, so I think it'll be fine.

Q: (Axelle Valliére –  MotorsInside.com) Question for all three. During the race, we still saw a lot of times cancelled because of track limits. However, this morning we know now the track will be on the calendar for many years. So, what do you think? Maybe the track is not adapted for actual F1?

LN: I'm very surprised that there were track limits. Maybe Turn 3. Where? I think we just went off track. When we made a mistake, we locked up. The thing is we get a penalty for making a mistake. You get a warning for making a mistake.

Q: (Axelle Valliére –  MotorsInside.com) There were no penalties today, but there were a lot of times cancelled. Is it a problem?

LN: No.

CL: I don't think it's a problem anymore. I think the changes that have been made to the track are actually pretty good to stop the problem that there was before. So, yeah, it's not a problem. Actually, I think it shouldn't anyway be a discussion. I don't know if anybody took a penalty today, but I feel like it's already a big penalty enough, as Lando was saying. It's enough of a penalty to go off now on a track like this. I don't think it's a problem.

LN: Yeah. I agree. They've got the gravel in the main corners where if you go off, you're going to gain time, and you can't gain time anymore. I went off, and I lost a lot of time. We just get the warnings now, but only when we lock up and go off. Same as me last year. I got a five-second penalty for trying to overtake, trying to race in a race. Makes sense. But those things, I think it's a bit stupid. But no, I think this track's a lot better than a couple years ago. It was like 200 off tracks. Now it's, I think, no penalties.

Haas chiefs Gene Haas and Ayao Komatsu are both gearing up for Formula 1 outings as the team continue their 10th anniversary celebrations.

Haas have announced that team founder and owner Gene Haas, as well as team boss Ayao Komatsu, will get behind the wheel of Formula 1 machinery at the upcoming Goodwood Festival of Speed.

After marking their 200th F1 start at the recent Canadian Grand Prix, the US-led operation will continue celebrations with a series of activities at the annual motorsport gathering, which features a world-famous hillclimb.

This includes Gene Haas driving the 2023-specification VF-23 on Friday, July 11, with Komatsu also making an appearance in the following season's VF-24.

Haas revealed that the pair got their first taste of F1 machinery together during a private shakedown at Silverstone a couple of weeks ago, with Gene completing a handful of laps on the Stowe track configuration.

Kazuki Nakajima, Vice Chairman of Toyota Gazoo Racing Europe, will kick off the four-day event by driving the VF-23 on Thursday, July 10, alongside Komatsu in the VF-24, before full-time Haas drivers Ollie Bearman and Esteban Ocon take over weekend driving duties.

Alongside their hillclimb activities, Haas will have a strong presence within the Ballroom Paddock, showcasing the VF-16 – the team's first F1 car – as well as the VF-25, which will be raced in the British Grand Prix just a few days before.

Haas' activities at Goodwood coincide with the Festival of Speed's celebration to mark the 75th anniversary of the F1 World Championship – several other teams and drivers up and down the grid are also set to attend the event.

Gareth Edwards takes the directing reins while original screenwriter David Koepp returns for this chapter about an extraction team seeking genetic samples from massive creatures in a tropical biosphere.


							By 

	David Rooney


Chief Film Critic


	Dr. Henry Loomis, the paleontologist played by Jonathan Bailey in Jurassic World Rebirth, at one point laments the public's diminished interest in seeing the same old prehistoric creatures. That prompted the bottom line-driven folks at InGen, the billion-dollar biotech corporation that specializes in resurrecting extinct animals, to start crossbreeding new species. “Engineered entertainment” is what Henry calls it. The same descriptor could apply to Gareth Edwards' new chapter in the cloned dinosaur franchise birthed by Steven Spielberg more than three decades ago. There are some mighty new monsters on the prowl, but this is primarily an assembly of recycled story beats.

	Which is not to say the movie doesn't deliver adrenalized action, excitement and white-knuckle close encounters with giant beasts whose rampaging anger at times gives them a weird kinship to the cruelly exploited carnival attractions of Tod Browning's Freaks. How can you not feel a little bad for a hulking great mutant called a Distortus Rex — or D. Rex, just to make it more humiliating — with a head like a beluga whale? Men playing God rarely works out well, and these hybrid Mesozoic throwbacks have good reason to be pissed.

Release date: Wednesday, July 2Cast: Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Ed Skrein, Luna Blaise, David Iacono, Audrina Miranda, Philippine Velge, Bechir SylvainDirector: Gareth EdwardsScreenwriter: David Koepp, based on characters created by Michael Crichton

									Rated PG-13,
								2 hours 14 minutes			






	Returning screenwriter David Koepp co-wrote the 1993 Spielberg original with sci-fi author Michael Crichton, on whose books the movies were based, as well as the 1997 sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park. While Koepp did not write Jurassic Park III, he had a hand in shaping the plotline. It's predominantly the first and third installments that yield the abundant déjà vu moments in Rebirth.

	











	But whatever the new movie lacks in originality, it makes up for in propulsive narrative drive, big scares and appealing new characters played by a terrific cast — even if they are mostly cut from an existing mold.


	Colin Trevorrow got the second trilogy off to a strong start in 2015 with Jurassic World, and J.A. Bayona's sequel, Fallen Kingdom, scored points for invention, switching gears into haunted-house territory. But the closing installment, Dominion, exposed a franchise gasping for creative oxygen, shifting away from creature-feature horror to ho-hum action-adventure. By going back almost to basics, Rebirth delivers on the promise of its title.


	At the end of Jurassic World Dominion, humans and dinosaurs were edging toward co-existence, with lots more prehistoric clones out in the world beyond their sanctuary. But modern-day Earth's atmosphere has proved inhospitable to the creatures, with many dying out or migrating to a tropical band around the equator that resembles their native Mesozoic Era climate. Tourism to the area is strictly prohibited.


	A prologue set 17 years before the main action takes place in a secret InGen research and development facility on Isle Saint-Hubert near Barbados. When the containment system malfunctions due to a stray Snickers wrapper, a technician watches in horror as her lab partner is ripped apart and eaten by a mostly unseen genetic dino-mutation.


	Back in the film's present, slick Big Pharma executive Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) puts together an illegal expedition to accompany him to the island and help extract DNA from the three most gargantuan species inhabiting land, sea and air — respectively, the herbivorous titanosaurus, the aquatic mosasaurus and the flying quetzalcoatlus. Scientists at his corporation, ParkerGenix, believe those samples contain the key to revolutionary heart disease medication, worth trillions to whomever lands exclusive control.

	











	Krebs first enlists Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson), a tough ex-special forces operative, now a private contractor in situational security and reaction — “a mercenary,” as Dr. Loomis, who's next on the recruitment list, puts it in a good-natured dig. Still hurting from the loss of her training mission partner in Yemen, Zora sees Martin's $10 million fee as an avenue to retirement from a punishing field. (Though judging by how comfortable Johansson looks in tank tops, cargo pants and grimy sweat, Zora seems unlikely to bow out anytime soon.)


	They rendezvous in a Suriname port town with Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali), captain of the Essex, a repurposed military patrol boat that will get them to Isle Saint-Hubert. Like his old friend Zora, Duncan is still pained by a tragic family loss; the two of them pull a crafty move to get Krebs to bump up Duncan's fee.


	Duncan's crew includes obnoxious head of security Bobby Atwater (Ed Skrein), Haitian co-pilot LeClerc (Bechir Sylvain) and deckhand Nina (Philippine Velge). Anticipating the order in which they become dino-snacks is a fun guessing game.


	Because it wouldn't be a Spielberg-affiliated Amblin picture without at least one kid in peril, an initially separate plot strand tracks a family sailing trip aboard La Mariposa, a sloop skippered by Reuben Delgado (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo). Since his divorce, Reuben's daughters, college-age Teresa (Luna Blaise) and 11-year-old Isabella (Audrina Miranda), have lived with their mother. The vacation is Reuben's attempt to reconnect with them, though he's not thrilled to have Teresa's lazy stoner boyfriend Xavier (David Iacono) along for the ride.

	











	In the first of the many extended action set-pieces that are director Edwards' forte, La Mariposa is sideswiped by a mosasaurus and capsized. The Essex picks up the family's mayday signal, and while Martin — gradually revealed to be the usual unscrupulous corporate creep — insists on sticking to their extraction mission, not getting sidetracked with search and rescue, he's overruled by the others.


	Koepp's script, after taking its time over character development, sticks to the recipe: Add dinosaurs and stir. That accelerates once the Essex gets hammered by a spinosaurus attack, with Teresa in a hairy close call that reveals further damning evidence of Martin's untrustworthiness. They veer into the rocky shallows of Isle Saint-Hubert, hoping the predators will be too large to follow. But they end up shipwrecked there, with the Delgado group separated from their rescuers.


	Shot (like Spielberg's original) with Panavision cameras and anamorphic lenses on 35mm, the jungles of Thailand that stand in for the island offer spectacular visuals. DP John Mathieson's dynamic shooting style keeps the pulse racing as the two parties weave their way through dense vegetation in which every unnerving sound or rustling of leaves amps up the tension.


	Given that the abandoned InGen facility runs on geothermal power from hot springs, they figure it will be the best place to get help. A gas station convenience store certainly makes it ideal for product placement — Dr. Pepper, Lay's potato chips, Cheetos, etc. — not to mention the best place to replicate the kitchen scene in Jurassic Park in which velociraptors stalk two children. This time it's a squawking quetzalcoatlus, smart enough to follow the fleeing humans into the underground tunnels that connect the village.

	











	That same pterosaur species features in a scene in which Zora and Henry rappel down a vertiginous cliff to an ancient temple carved into the rock face, where they extract a sample from a nest of quetzalcoatlus eggs. Mom is not pleased to find them in the rookery.


	Much of the humor comes from bespectacled Henry's lack of preparedness for field operations, having spent his working life in museums, and from his bantering flirtation with Zora. Bailey and Johansson, both in excellent form, inject a lot of charm into the evolving rapport between these two opposites — one an idealistic science guy, the other a swaggering combat vet who nonetheless is receptive to Henry's misgivings about the ethics of the ParkerGenix plan.


	One of the most memorable sequences — and the one that most recalls the poetic, quasi-spiritual sense of wonder in Spielberg's original — is when they reach a lush green valley full of grazing titanosauruses. Henry is like an enchanted child, dumbstruck at the sight of these gentle giants and almost unable to contain his emotions as he strokes one of the creatures' massive legs. Alexandre Desplat's rich orchestral score, incorporating John Williams' classic theme music, effectively punches up action scenes, but it's especially lovely in these tender moments.


	The other major source of heart in the movie is the growing closeness of the Delgado family. Having Isabella shocked into silence by the ordeal but rediscovering joy through a cute critter she carries in her backpack and names Dolores — a puppy-like, animatronic creature known as an aquilops — is so Spielbergian it's corny. But the sweetness is also disarming. Likewise, Reuben's increasing respect for Xavier, who turns out to have more going for him than his flaky slacker demeanor might indicate.

	











	Franchise superstar the T. Rex, with its bilious roar and tiny hands (I'm not going there), makes a welcome return. Woken from sleep on the banks of a river on which the Delgados attempt a raft escape over rapids, the massive therapod thunders after them — it swims! — in a scene that reaches peak nail-biting suspense when Isabella is separated from the group.


	The blend of physical locations with sets and digital imagery is seamless and the CG work on the creatures is first-rate, notably so in the scary climactic stretch when the lumbering D. Rex joins the fray. Edwards clearly is a devoted Spielberg fan, embedding subtle homages throughout, notably in the open water sequences that recall Jaws. Jurassic World Rebirth is unlikely to top anyone's ranked franchise list. But longtime fans (count me among them) should have a blast.

""The team were dealing with a live situation, but with hindsight, we should have pulled the stream during the performance,"" a statement from the U.K. public broadcaster said.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	The BBC “regrets” not pulling its livestream of a Glastonbury performance in which rap duo Bob Vylan chanted “death, death to the IDF.” IDF stands for Israel Defense Forces.


	The television partner of the U.K.'s biggest music festival released a statement Monday as the fest wound down, hours after U.S. star Olivia Rodrigo wrapped up with her headline set.




	The BBC drew widespread criticism for airing the set on its livestream. “Millions of people tuned in to enjoy Glastonbury this weekend across the BBC's output, but one performance within our livestreams included comments that were deeply offensive.”

	The corporation continued: “The BBC respects freedom of expression but stands firmly against incitement to violence. The antisemitic sentiments expressed by Bob Vylan were utterly unacceptable and have no place on our airwaves. We welcome Glastonbury's condemnation of the performance.”


	The judgment on Saturday to issue a warning on screen while streaming “was in line” with the BBC's editorial guidelines, it also said, and a decision was made not to make the set available on demand. “The team were dealing with a live situation, but with hindsight, we should have pulled the stream during the performance. We regret this did not happen.”


	Concluded the BBC: “In light of this weekend, we will look at our guidance around live events so we can be sure teams are clear on when it is acceptable to keep output on air.”

	











	In a statement posted to Instagram, one half of the rap duo, Bobby Vylan, said: “Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place…. As we grow older and our fire starts to possibly dim under the suffocation of adult life and all its responsibilities, it is incredibly important that we encourage and inspire future generations to pick up the torch that was passed to us.”


	But Glastonbury organizer Emily Eavis also took to the social media platform to condemn the anti-IDF chants. “Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech, or incitement to violence,” Eavis wrote.


	Eavis continued: “As a festival, we stand against all forms of war and terrorism…we will always believe in — and actively campaign for — hope, unity, peace and love”, adding a performer's comments “should never be seen as a tacit endorsement of their opinions and beliefs…. With almost 4,000 performances at Glastonbury 2025, there will inevitably be artists and speakers appearing on our stages whose views we do not share.”


	U.K. prime minister Keir Starmer was among the critics of Bob Vylan's set.


	It was a politically charged event this year. It often is as Glastonbury attracts a left-leaning crowd, but more so than ever, the polarizing politics of the current day were felt. Also on Saturday, Irish rap trio Kneecap voiced their pro-Palestine views and used the platform to criticize the U.K. and U.S. governments, as well as the U.S. media.

The actor has previously shared the difficulty some folks have pronouncing his given surname.


							By 

	Kimberly Nordyke


Managing Editor, Digital


Rob McElhenney has filed legal documents to change his name.


	The actor reportedly signed the docs Thursday requesting that his surname be changed to Mac — so his new name will be Rob Mac, according to multiple outlets.




	The It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia star has previously discussed his intention to make the change due to the difficulty some people have pronouncing it.


	“As our business and our storytelling is expanding into other regions of the world and other languages in which my name is even harder to pronounce, I'm just going by Rob Mac,” he recently said in an interview with Variety.

	McElhenney is also co-owner of Wrexham AFC football (soccer, for U.S. readers) club with Ryan Reynolds. The duo, who purchased the team in 2020, also serve as executive producers on the FX docuseries Welcome to Wrexham, which follows the team. The network recently renewed the Emmy-winning series for a fifth season and revealed details about a spinoff series, Necaxa.




			Related Video		







	In 2023, Reynolds created a musical video for McElhenney's birthday in which he taught people how to pronounce the name with the help of some famous faces, including Kaitlin Olson, McElhenney's wife and Sunny co-star.


	“Sure, he's got a pretty face that people know they know,” Reynolds sang. “They think they recognize him from his big-time TV show. But despite the accolades, despite the load of fame, one thing that they do not know is how to say his name.”

	











	The lyrics go on to explain that the name rhymes with “tackle penny.” 


	“It's McElhenney, it's McElhenney, while ways to massacre and mispronounce it there are many. It's McElhenney, it's McElhenney, if there was doubt, now there won't be any. It's McElhenney!” the song continued.


	For her part, Olson previously said the couple's two young sons were still getting used to the idea: “The kids are really not happy about it, because they have that last name. And so do I, legally!”


The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to McElhenney's reps for comment.

""We want this to be an open house for artists, songwriters or any creator to come in, hang out and create content, connect with their fans or connect with other artists,” Apple Music's top exec Oliver Schusser says. 


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


Apple Music has unveiled a new studio near its Culver City headquarters, an expansive 15,000-square-foot space the streaming service hopes will serve as an all-in-one creative hub where musicians can come for radio interviews, write and record new music, conduct photo shoots and film video content.


	Apple Music Studios opens this summer and will serve as the home for some of Apple Music Radio's marquee programming including the Zane Lowe Show. Apple didn't disclose how much the studios cost to develop, but the construction and the tech in the building is significant. The aesthetic is very Apple: warm wood floors, sleek black walls, and pops of color. The building features two large radio studios decked out with specially made spatial audio speakers built into the ceilings. The rooms also feature customizable light and screen settings, as well as hidden cameras built directly into the walls. The studios are large enough to work both for interviews and intimate concert experiences for a small number of attendees.

	“We want this to be an open house for artists, songwriters or any creator to come in, hang out and create content, connect with their fans or connect with other artists,” Apple Music's top executive Oliver Schusser tells The Hollywood Reporter. “This is our interpretation of the intersection between technology and the arts.”

	Aside from the radio studios, the building also has a 4,000-square-foot soundstage that can be used for live performances or screenings, a photo studio as well as edit bays for content. Fitting to Apple Music's continued push to evangelize spatial audio on the platform, the studio also has a spatial audio mixing room on site. 


	“We intentionally made it so it could be highly adaptable to any sort of creative,” Apple Music co-head Rachel Newman says. “It's a blank space on purpose, so that an artist can come in and create whatever they want. Radio was always a front door for us to work closer with artists, and now they'll be able to do so much more. Photography, writer's rooms. We wanted the ability to scale and fit into any kind of vision the artist might have.” 


	Apple unveiled the studio Monday as the company celebrates exactly 10 years since Apple Music first launched back in 2015. Schusser says Apple developed the new space as the platform had “outgrown” its original studios as Apple Music's content has become much more involved with video. The new space, Apple says, is far more accommodating for more types of video content when artists come in for collaborations. 


	Schusser says the studio reflects the company's continued focus on fostering an active listening experience, recalling that when the service launched 10 years ago, his team was “worried that music in the streaming era would become a commodity.” 

	











	“There was a fear that customers would just press a button and play music in the background and that'd be it,” Schusser says. “That's why we focused on Apple Radio. We wanted to build a music service for music fans, a platform where artists could express themselves and showcase their music since there's not many platforms left where they can do that anymore. The studio expands on that.”


	Natalie Eshaya, head of Apple Music Radio, says the new space offers reflects Apple Music Radio's evolution in the years ahead to further expand beyond audio into wider content. 


	“The root of it is that traditional radio format, a host speaking to an audience and artists having a way to connect to their fans through radio. But I think where we've evolved things is, it's not just audio, there's a visual element in all the things we do.”


	With Apple Music Studios unveiled, Apple Music also announced special programming for this week to celebrate 10 years of service. That kicks off this morning with Don't Be Boring: The Birth of Apple Music Radio with Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden, which is airing on Apple Music Radio from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. PST. Apple will also be airing a special on 10 years of Apple Music until 4 p.m. PST.


	Lowe and Darden will host a live show from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. today as well, featuring an unspecified lineup of artists who've “shaped the trajectory” of the platform. 

	











	Separately, starting July 1st, Apple Radio will also begin to showcase the 500 all-time most-streamed songs on Apple Music, finishing with the top 100 on July 5th. Apple Music users will also get access to an all-time replay feature, which will tell them their own individual most-streamed songs since they first joined Apple Music.

Senior Entertainment Reporter


Finn Wittrock and Alexandra Daddario are sinking their teeth into a biopic movie telling the story of Hershey chocolate founder Milton S. Hershey.


	Director Mark Waters‘ forthcoming feature Hershey has wrapped principal photography after filming for over seven weeks throughout Hershey's home state of Pennsylvania. Wittrock stars as Hershey, while Daddario plays his wife, Catherine “Kitty” Hershey. 




	The first look at the pair in costume can be seen above and below in behind-the-scenes set photos.

Hershey centers on the eponymous figure who dealt with early setbacks before building one of the world's most recognizable brands and was also known for contributions to education and his community. Alan Ruck, Richard Kind, David Costabile, Heléne Yorke, Michael Moreland Milligan, Francesca Faridany, Daniel David Stewart and Dina Spybey-Waters round out the cast.

	











	“As we wrap, I feel most grateful to the people of Pennsylvania, who have supported us and actively participated in making this shoot a success,” says Waters. “I feel immense pride in what we've been able to do here, particularly in the fully committed performances of Finn Wittrock and Alexandra Daddario, who have given their hearts and souls to portray two figures whose legacy still resonates today.”


	Waters (Mean Girls) directs Hershey from a script by Sharon Paul and Timothy Michael Hayes. Paul, Mark Tilghman, Mary Aloe, Joshua Harris and Will Hardy produce the film. Hershey hails from Dandelion Media in collaboration with the Hershey Entities and in association with Aloe Entertainment, Peachtree Group and RCM3.

	











Hershey filmed across 17 locations in Pennsylvania and used thousands of pieces of chocolate throughout the shoot. Set between the early 1870s and late 1910s, the film spans nearly five decades in Milton S. Hershey's life.


	UTA Independent Film Group is representing worldwide rights as the film seeks distribution.


	Waters is represented by UTA. Wittrock is repped by CAA, Mosaic, Weissenbach Management and Schreck Rose. Daddario is repped by CAA and Untitled Entertainment.

Charli xcx has responded to “boomer comments” about her Glastonbury set on the Other Stage on Saturday night (June 28). The Brat star drew one of the weekend's biggest crowds for her set on the festival's second-biggest stage; The 1975, Neil Young and Olivia Rodrigo were booked for Pyramid, while Loyle Carner and The Prodigy joined her on the Other.

	On Sunday night (June 29), Charli posted a string of comments on X (formerly Twitter) addressing critics of her set. “like the idea that singing with deliberate autotune makes you a fraud or that not having a traditional band suddenly means you must not be a ‘real artist' is like, the most boring take ever. yawn sorry just fell asleep xx,” she wrote.

	Charli then shared a five-star review from The Guardian, before closing with: “really enjoying these boomer vibe comments on my glastonbury performance. it's super fascinating to me.” See her posts below.


	The set was well-received by many outlets and fans, though a minority of fans posted their displeasure. One called it “one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life,” and another said she “sounds so bad she has to sing with so much autotune every time she performs live.”


	The set was broadcast live on BBC One and on the channel's streaming service iPlayer. The performance followed her Coachella slot in April, and the Brat run is due to continue in the coming weeks before her final scheduled date in South Korea on Aug. 15.


	During the Glastonbury performance, Gracie Abrams performed the famous “Apple” dance for the big screens, following other stars who've joined in on the viral trend at Charli's shows recently, including Chappell Roan and Lorde.

Ticketek reported over 370,000 tickets sold on June 26, making it the biggest day for overall ticket sales in the company's history.

	Jessica Lynch



AC/DC's long-awaited Power Up stadium tour Down Under is already proving a powerhouse, smashing records with its opening onsale. 


	On June 26, Ticketek reported a record-breaking 370,000 tickets sold across all events on its platform, setting a new all-time daily sales record for the company. Of those, more than 320,000 tickets were for AC/DC's Power Up tour alone, making it the biggest concert onsale day in Ticketek's 40-plus year history. 


	The figure smashes the band's own 2009 benchmark during the Black Ice tour and drove the majority of sales traffic across the platform that day. The remaining ~50,000 tickets were sold for other events including Lightscape, NRL matches, AFL fixtures, and major theatre productions. That feat eclipses the band's own 2009 Black Ice tour, which previously held the record and ultimately moved over 650,000 tickets nationwide.

	“These results are a reflection of the collaboration, passion, and sheer effort from every part of our business,” said Cameron Hoy, Ticketek Entertainment Group's Head of Global Ticketing. “I'm incredibly proud of what the team have accomplished.”


	Ticketek data shows that more than 1.7 million fans queued online across all tour stops when tickets went live. Several dates sold out within hours, prompting additional shows in major cities. Since then, the run has grown from five to nine concerts due to overwhelming demand, making it one of the largest national rock tours of the year.


	Produced by TEG Van Egmond, the Power Up tour marks AC/DC's first Australian trek in nearly a decade and follows the release of their ARIA No. 1 album Power Up in 2020. The band's return has ignited fan fervor, with both legacy listeners and new generations flocking to secure their seats.


	Joining the tour as special guests are Amyl and the Sniffers, winners of multiple ARIA and Rolling Stone Australia Awards.


	The last time AC/DC toured Australia and New Zealand was in 2015 on their Rock or Bust tour, which sold over 520,000 tickets across 11 dates, including two shows in Auckland and Wellington.

Bob Vylan isn't making any apologies for its unambiguously pro-Palestinian performance at yesterday's Glastonbury Festival. The group, made up of singer Bobby Vylan and drummer Bobbie Vylan, made waves yesterday by advocating for a free Palestine and an end to Israel's obliteration of Gaza during their set. As they performed, the group chanted “Free, Free Palestine,” “Death, Death to the IDF,” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine must be, will be, free,” and inspired the crowd to join them, which festival organizers, apparently, found more “appalling” than the 55,000 Palestinians killed by the Israeli government since the war began two years ago. In a statement, Glastonbury organizers said they “stand against all forms of war and terrorism,” except those, apparently, committed by Israel, and accused Bob Vylan of antisemitism, hate speech, and attempting to incite violence. Nevertheless, Bobby Vylan doesn't appear phased by the noise. In an Instagram post captioned “I said what I said,” Bobby Vylan wrote that he was setting a good example for his daughter and the younger generation by speaking out. In fact, he's already moved on to more important things: Like his daughter's school dinners.

“As I lay in bed this morning, my phone buzzing non stop, inundated with messages of both support and hatred, I listen to my daughter typing out loud as she fills out a school survey asking for her feedback on the current state of her school dinners,” he said, causing American followers to wonder why we don't get school dinners, too. “She expressed that she would like healthier meals, more options, and dishes inspired by other parts of the world.” Vylan says that hearing her “voice her opinions on a matter that she cares about and affects her daily” gave him hope for the future. “Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place.” Ultimately, without addressing the outsized controversy surrounding the performance, which has already garnered the attention of the Department of Justice, he reiterates the importance of encouraging and inspiring “future generations to pick up the torch that was passed to us.”

“Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change,” he continued. “Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online, and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered. Today it is a change in school dinners, tomorrow it is a change in foreign policy.”

Bob Vylan wasn't the only one to stand up for Palestine at Glastonbury. Irish rap trio Kneecap also called for a “Free Palestine” and chanted “Fuck Kier Starmer” during their slot, but that was already censored by the BBC, which did not air Kneecap's performance.

There's a line in the first act of Jurassic World Rebirth that threatens to tank the whole exercise. Paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) is hosting mercenary Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson) and pharmaceutical businessman Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) at his shuttering dinosaur museum. Their mission? Go to an uninhabited island full of wild dinosaurs, extract blood from three of the biggest creatures, and bring it back so that Big Pharma can make cutting-edge, life-saving, incredibly profitable heart medicine. But Henry didn't realize he'd be advising on the task in person, and refuses to set foot on the island. “Ever see a dinosaur in the wild?” asks Martin, which stops Henry in his tracks.

Martin has to qualify that he doesn't mean dinosaurs at a zoo or in academia, because the past 10 years of Jurassic World have brought back dinosaurs in a fully-functioning amusement park, set them free from captivity, and let them roam undomesticated across the world. In terms of tempting wonder, it's a massive compromise from the eye-popping, giddy, tearful reception the dinos received in 1993 (Alan Grant falls to the ground, for Christ's sake!) and it reveals the core issue with Jurassic World Rebirth. Humans have meddled too much in the sandbox of Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park, and evoking the first film's blend of earnestness and cynicism requires navigating all the interceding guff that has polluted its appeal.

Don't worry about those, Jurassic World Rebirth says via Martin Krebs, this is the real deal. But despite being the most technically adept Jurassic film since 2001—delivering many dino skirmishes, a competent understanding of action editing and pacing, and no locusts to speak of—Rebirth never escapes its own production backstory: a swiftly assembled brand correction steered by competent hired hands. The Jurassic franchise has continued to harm its reputation with baffling choices and tired retreads, and the seventh entry gets a moderate stamp of approval only if one agrees that it's the last one.

Rebirth begins well. Seventeen years ago, everything went awry on Ile Saint-Hubert, the island where the Jurassic World dinosaurs were genetically engineered. Director Gareth Edwards—the Rogue One and Godzilla filmmaker who knows how blockbusters should be lit and composed, if nothing else—gives audiences a scintillating kill to whet our appetite: A scientist clad in a crisp white Andromeda Strain-style suit is trapped behind a heavy blast door, which is the third time the director has pulled this trick in his five-film career, although it's the first time the victim has died at the hands of a dinosaur.

After jumping to the present, Rebirth takes its time, assembling its team with an unwarranted patience that will have audiences wondering, “When are they going to get to the dinosaur island?” That Rebirth is the second-longest Jurassic film should raise some eyebrows; only once the characters wash ashore on Saint-Hubert, about an hour into the film, does the subsequent survival adventure enliven the story. The weak, obvious, and oversnarked characterization courtesy of screenwriter David Koepp (who previously wrote the first two Spielberg-directed films) sabotages several actors' chances of giving a good performance—Jonathan Bailey and Rupert Friend just about clear this bar, but Scarlett Johansson is helpless as a smug and sarcastic antiheroine. Granted, the characters become far less grating in the face of immediate danger; the ensemble does a good job of channeling urgent, quick-thinking heroics in the face of dino-doom.

A twist in the tale is that Jurassic World Rebirth has two storylines. The A-list cast embarks on their fetch quest to sample blood from dinosaurs of sea, land, and air, while single dad Reuben (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) leads a yacht trip with his two daughters Teresa (Luna Blaise) and Isabella (Audrina Miranda), along with Teresa's irksome, layabout boyfriend Xavier (David Iacano). They are rescued from capsizing by sea captain Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali) and inadvertently brought to Saint-Hubert's shores. Even though the family drama suffers from the same repetitive, cloying simplicity as Zora and Henry's predictable ethical conflict (are they okay with giving miracle medicine to greedy pharmaceutical conglomerates?), Rebirth alleviates some of its troubles by cutting between its two undercooked storylines. 

Neither of these arcs are convincing on their own terms, but Rebirth‘s structure forces the film to highlight only the most watchable bits. The best stretches of Rebirth amount to back-to-back suspense and survival scenes from those alternatively seeking treasure and safety. The T-Rex—the alleged king of the dinosaurs whose dominance has been diminished since one ran amok through San Diego in the The Lost World—features in Rebirth‘s most exciting and well-designed action scene, where Reuben's family tries to escape on an inflatable raft without arousing the attention of a sleeping Rex. It's a moment lifted from Crichton's original novel, and Edwards lends an edge-of-your-seat aggression to the creature's animal instincts, playing precisely with perspective and geography and never letting the audience think they're safe for longer than a moment. Paired with a raid on a Quetzalcoatlus nest in a cliffside temple, Rebirth proves it can deliver on pulse-quickening monster action in a classic adventure movie mold.

But 2025 may just be too late to inspire excitement for photorealistic, expertly animated monster carnage. In the past decade, how many fearsome creatures have been deployed by the Avatar movies, the MonsterVerse, and a whole trilogy of Jurassic World films? When Jurassic World Rebirth reveals the identity of the dangerous experimental dinosaur that triggered an island-wide evacuation, one's first mental association is Alien: Resurrection—and therefore, last year's brand-exploiting Alien: Romulus—the wonderment promised by the film's throwback, legacy-honoring tone dwindles, and cynicism takes hold. Jurassic World Rebirth‘s attempt at rejuvenating its franchise mirrors the vitality of its once-extinct reptiles: This movie may have breathed life back where once it was thought lost, but this life is not pure or sustainable.

We've seen characters wake up from comas and stumble around asking random pedestrians what year it is. We've even seen a character wake up from a coma to no pedestrians at all because 99% of them were turned into rage-fueled zombies. Somehow, this writer would argue, Ryland Grace's (Ryan Gosling) situation is even worse. 

In the first trailer for Project Hail Mary, Phil Lord and Chris Miller's adaptation of The Martian author Andy Weir's novel of the same name, Ryland wakes up from his coma in space, several light-years from his apartment back on Earth. Still not convinced that's worse than the zombie apocalypse? He's not an astronaut, as he emphatically tries to explain pre-coma to a scientist played by Sandra Hüller; he's a 6th grade teacher. Oh, and everything on Earth will be destroyed if he doesn't complete his mission. It's not a great situation, by any means.



There's a lot happening in this trailer. Hüller's character's team reveals that almost every star in the solar system has been infected by some sort of mysterious substance… except one. Why? No one knows. Well, someone might. It's the (seemingly) friendly alien Ryland meets on his solo mission. He's living an absolute nightmare, but at least he's not alone. Maybe it isn't as bad as the zombie apocalypse after all.

Project Hail Mary also stars Lionel Boyce, Ken Leung, and Milana Vayntrub. The film wakes up in theaters March 20, 2026.

It's time to bring out the champagne for Apple Studios, which just scored its best opening weekend ever with Joseph Kosinski's F1. The Brad Pitt-led film fast-tracked to an impressive $56 million in North America with an additional $88 million overseas, no doubt spurred on by the racing league's massive international fandom. That puts the fast-driving feature at a $144 million total, Apple Studios' first major box office win.

For context, Killers Of The Flower Moon, which previously held the title for Apple's best opening weekend with $23.2 million domestic (per Variety), only made $159 million internationally during its entire run. Apple Studios took a risk with F1‘s $200 million+ production budget (albeit a small one considering the tech giant's humongous coffer), but the studio's decision to partner with Warner Bros. for distribution purposes seems to be paying off in spades. In addition to the undeniable draw of the F1 name, people also raced to theaters to experience the latest fast-moving vehicles from Top Gun: Maverick team Kosinski (director) and Jerry Bruckheimer (producer) on the biggest screen possible. Deadline reports that the film made over $12.8 million on IMAX screens alone, which represented 23% of its domestic total. It's only the eighth film in IMAX history to index over 20% during an opening weekend.

F1 also zoomed past this weekend's other major opening, M3GAN 2.0. The dancing robot didn't just have a bad race; she didn't even make the podium, landing in fourth place with $10 million. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the franchise's turn toward chatbot screenings and plots about AI seems to have landed pretty flat. It might be time for this one to power down for good.

Those who received invitations to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's highly exclusive wedding likely gave considerable thought to what to wear. After all, this was the wedding of the year, if not the wedding of the decade. But what do you wear to the pajama party of the year?

The A-listers who attended the couple's glamorous Venice wedding looked stunning in designer suits and dresses from Oscar de la Renta, Dolce & Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, and other renowned brands. But the feathers, lace, and velvet guests wore to the pajama party on June 28 didn't disappoint, either.

The pajamas worn to this wedding pajama party were not the kind of clothes most of these celebrities probably sleep in. This was an opportunity to showcase another carefully selected outfit. For some, it was all about creating a sexy, alluring look. For others, it was stylish comfort. 

Leonardo DiCaprio, wearing a black baseball cap pulled down low, opted for a more relaxed look in a burgundy, button-up pajama top and matching pants. Over it, he wore a black jacket.

CBS News journalist Gayle King also looked more comfortable, wearing a white tank top dress with a colorful robe thrown over it in green, blue, yellow, and tan. Her bestie, Oprah, went a little more glam in a shiny brown satin pajama set. The turtleneck top was cinched at the waist and featured feathered cuffs. 

Producer Brian Grazer was set to party and sleep in his satin animal-print button-down pajamas. 

Along with the more laid-back and casual looks were lavish and sultry looks from the Kardashians, Jenners, and others. Kris, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner were spotted together on one of the water taxis headed to the Arsenale di Venezia. 

Kendall wore a royal blue suit and shorts outfit, with a gauzy hood to match. Kylie wore a silver, fringed crop top and a white skirt, while Kris was the more extravagant of the three in her patterned gray and white outfit, featuring a black feather boa on top.

Italian model Vittoria Ceretti and former “Dancing With the Stars” contestant Brooks Nader also looked stunning, but the showstopper of the night was Kim Kardashian.

The business mogul and reality star wore a low-cut, sultry corset over a tiny tulle skirt, with sheer stockings held up by garters. She also carried a satin and tulle cape, but it did little to cover her sexy outfit.

Along with their own fancy and stylish pajamas, guests were gifted footwear from the Bezos. The men received Vibi Venezia blue velvet Venetian slippers. Women, however, were given Amazon plush, black open-toe slippers.

Whoopi Goldberg has announced that she is joining the cast of the Italian soap opera “Un Posto al Sole.”

The news comes amid her temporary hiatus from “The View.“

Goldberg will appear as a recurring character on “Un Posto al Sole.” 

In a June 27 Instagram post, the actress announced her new role, saying:

“I just wanted to stop in and say how happy I am to be joining Un Posto Al Sole. They know it's a crazy idea, I know it's a crazy idea, but what a wonderful thing to do.”

She ended the video by acknowledging her lack of fluency in Italian but said that she — and presumably the show's creative team — “worked it out.” 

The Instagram caption reads: 

“A surprise is coming to #UnPostoAlSole: @whoopigoldberg joins the cast! Her character will be part of a special storyline and will appear in multiple episodes in 2026 on @instarai3 and @raiplay_official.” 

According to Deadline, the Italian soap has been on the air since 1996 and is the first soap entirely produced in Italy.

The Ghost actress seems to have a deep connection to Italy.

“Goldberg has long expressed adoration for Italy and its people, as she frequently travels there (and posts videos and images to social media) while on vacation from moderating The View,” Entertainment Weekly reports. 

Goldberg's immense range has defined her career for decades. 

Her work in various fields earned her EGOT status, making her the first Black woman in history to achieve the coveted title.

According to Biography.com, she earned a Grammy Award for a recording of her one-woman show in 1985.

After starring in Ghost, she was nominated for and won an Oscar in 1991.

She won Emmys for “Beyond Tara: The Extraordinary Life of Hattie McDaniel” and “The View”, and a Tony for producing “Thoroughly Modern Millie.” 

Goldberg reflected on her career in a May 2024 interview with CBS Mornings, saying:

“You may not like me, but you cannot deny what I can do,” Goldberg said. “And that is the thing that I get to walk in my truth every day. I am good at what I do. I am, regardless of whether you think I'm cute or sexy, whatever, doesn't matter. You can't do what I can do.”

What do you think about Whoopi Goldberg's new role? Let us know in the comments below.

If you are a fan of “General Hospital,” then you already know all about Drew Cain, played quite brilliantly by Cameron Mathison. He is hated even more than the clear-cut mobsters on the long-running daytime series, and that is largely due to the great job the actor is doing.

“General Hospital” has turned the former good guy into a villain in just a few short years. Drew's manipulative, dirty-handed antics have nearly everyone in Port Charles gunning for him, except Willow. According to Parade, speculation is circulating about Cameron Mathison's potential departure from the role.

Port Charles is a small town located in upstate New York, featuring a diverse cast of characters who rarely agree on much of anything. The fact that everyone wants Drew gone at the exact same moment in time speaks to how awful he actually is. Tracy is fighting hard to prevent Drew from successfully claiming the Quartermaine name as his own, and Nina cannot fathom the grasp that Drew has on her daughter, Willow's, heart. 

Michael refuses to allow his children to see their mother as long as she remains with Drew. He knows that Drew used their young son, Wiley, to try to manipulate custody, and he wants the congressman to disappear. Sonny and the rest of Michael's family have all gone rounds with Drew as well.

Then there is the fact that he is blackmailing Portia, leaving her husband, Curtis, to use his media to do some of Drew's bidding. Just about every bad situation in town has Drew's fingerprints all over it. So many characters on General Hospital have recently said that Drew needs to be taken out for his horrible actions. 

In the land of soap operas, the more people start mentioning the wishful demise of another, the more likely it is to happen. Since everyone is after Drew, it has led to questions about his future on “General Hospital.”

Neither ABC nor Mathison has indicated that the character is being written out of the show. Mathison's plate is full, as he also appears in Great American Family movies and hosts the game show “Beat the Bridge.”

It certainly seems like the writers are laying the groundwork for a whodunit murder mystery, and with July sweeps coming up soon, it may be the perfect time for Drew to finally get what he deserves!

Nicole Scherzinger was over the moon when she became a Tony Award winner recently, and there was one Bravolebrity in particular who was cheering her on.

She recently revealed her close connection to a cast member from “The Valley” during an appearance on Andy Cohen's radio show in May.

When Nicole sat for an interview with Andy Cohen, she shared some interesting details on her connection to Zack Wickham, one of the biggest pot-stirrers on “The Valley.”

“He was my assistant. He actually was my sister's best friend growing up in Kentucky, and so I kind of got stuck with Zack—I'm just kidding! So, when he moved to L.A., he needed a job. He was my assistant for many years.”

Nicole continued, saying, “Zack is actually very intelligent, and he thinks fast and on his feet. His big dream was to become a reality TV star…that's all he talked about 24/7,” she said. “When I heard that it happened, I was over the moon for him.”

Nicole is really rooting for him, and she is hopeful that the Bravo audience will embrace him. “I hope they get to see all the good sides of him because he's very funny, full of life, and he's got a great effervescent energy,” she told Andy.

Zack took to Instagram to comment on Nicole's interview, saying, “Fam for life. [Nicole] love you!” with a heart.

A post shared by Comments By Bravo (@commentsbybravo)

Zack recently gave Bravo's The Daily Dish an update on his current career and also his future goals. Now, he primarily works with either celebrities or social media influencers. “I'll either do a social media campaign for them, or come up with like the overarching, creative directing [for] a brand deal they have,” he explained.

“The Valley” star also hopes to start an LGBT organization focused on healthcare. “It's an education-based charity. That's like my big goal for let's say two to three years out—to have it up and running.”

“There are just so many times that as a person in the LGBT community, we are scared to go to the doctor because we don't want to get misinformation or don't wanna be discriminated against,” he said. “That's been my biggest passion… that I'm just now starting to figure out how to make it into a reality.”

The “Jurassic” franchise has long become a lot like the bioengineered mutant dinosaur — amusingly dubbed “Distortus Rex” — that escapes from an InGen research facility in the series' loud nap of a new installment: Pointless to keep alive but impossible to kill. 

The mere existence of Gareth Edwards' “Jurassic World: Rebirth” would have been enough to clarify that condition, and yet this back-to-basics standalone — arriving just a few summers after the franchise's bone-dumb second trilogy ended with a billion-dollar blah — takes pains to remind us that the “Jurassic” period won't stop printing money just because Universal doesn't know how to spend it. To misquote a certain mathematician: “Your executives were so unpreoccupied with whether or not they should, they didn't stop to think if they could.” 

 








Related Stories Vin Diesel Teases a ‘Fast and Furious' Reunion with the Late Paul Walker's Character in Final Franchise Film ‘Project Hail Mary' Trailer: Ryan Gosling Tries to Salvage the Sun (and Save the Universe) in Astronaut Drama 

In that sense, and in that sense only, I have no choice but to admit that Edwards' installment lives up to its much-advertised promise as a tribute to the 1993 masterpiece that started it all. “Rebirth” certainly isn't any better than the previous five sequels that have already hatched from the original (though I'm relieved to report that it's less bloated and self-impressed than the last three), but the sheer nothingness of its spectacle — combined with a complete non-story that feels like it was 65 million studio notes in the making — allows it to become a singularly perfect legacy for Steven Spielberg's classic about how people lack the power to control their own creations. 

 










Life finds a way, and no “Jurassic” movie since the first one has more convincingly illustrated how, in the absence of evolution, survival is forced to become its own reward. 

That idea is baked into the premise of David Koepp's script, which takes place 32 years after “dinosaurs came back,” and roughly a decade after people grew bored of them (Koepp very much included). Parks aren't profitable, museums are empty, and the fine citizens of DUMBO just honk their horns at each other when a massive herbivore escapes from the zoo for a nap under the Brooklyn Bridge. And as if things weren't bad enough for our cold-blooded friends, it turns out that global warming isn't the best vibe for prehistoric lizards, and most of the remaining dinosaurs have retreated to a handful of equatorial islands whose climate more closely resembles the ancient world. We don't bother them, they don't bother us, and nature is left to run its course — or it would have been if not for all of those meddling corporations.

This time it's a pharmaceutical giant called ParkerGenix, whose scientists have discovered that a trillion-dollar cure for heart disease could be cultivated from the blood of the three biggest dinosaurs left on Earth. Naturally, they want to brand it before anyone else gets the chance (nothing revs up the imagination like a race for medical patents!), which is why they've given sleazebag goon Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend, serving yassified Dennis Nedry) the blank check necessary to hire a team capable of going to Skull Island — or whatever the abandoned InGen testing site is called — and getting the samples ParkerGenix needs. 

 










Leading the pack is former special-forces operative Zora Bennett (a pathologically chipper Scarlett Johansson, often rocking some casual Linda Hamilton cosplay), who's allegedly still reeling from the death of a beloved colleague on her most recent mission. I say “allegedly” because she never shows a hint of human emotion, even after witnessing the death of a beloved colleague on her current mission, but everyone makes a point of paying their condolences for her loss. After walking away with $200 million of ParkerGenix's money, Zora will be able to pay for them herself. 

Her Suriname-based war buddy Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali, whose role is all presence and no acting) is hoping for a similar reward. Getting rich wouldn't ease the grief he feels for his dead son, which is a mighty cheap device for a movie so uninterested in its characters (Koepp's script doesn't exactly follow through on the notion of people internalizing “life finds a way” on their own terms), but getting chewed alive by dinosaurs wouldn't hurt the guy anymore than he already is. Ed Skrein is definitely also there, along with Bechir Sylvain and Philippine Velge, who might as well be wearing t-shirts that say “eat me first.” Styled to look like Steve from “Sex and the City,” “Wicked” star Jonathan Bailey rounds out the team as the bookish paleontologist Henry Loomis, who studied under franchise icon Dr. Alan Grant, but is still dumb enough to go to an InGen island full of untamed dinosaurs.

 










Adventurous dad Reuben Delgado (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) might be even dumber for thinking he can sail around it, as the known existence of prehistoric species doesn't stop him from steering his two daughters — and the older one's wastoid boyfriend — straight through Mosasaurus territory as they make their way across the Atlantic. (These characters are introduced with a Vampire Weekend song, which is an amusingly multiplex-brained way of teeing up the fact that Reuben's eldest is going to NYU in the fall.) Zora's crew bails them out from the inevitable attack that follows, but the dinos return with a vengeance, and it isn't long before all of the film's characters find themselves stranded on the same island where the Distortus Rex escaped from its enclosure during the film's prologue (a sequence that bears an uncanny resemblance to the prologue from Edwards' own “Godzilla,” and is worth noting in a movie that betrays almost no other trace of its director's fingerprints). 

From there, the rest of the film adheres to video game logic: If Zora's team can successfully extract blood from a swimming dino (the aforementioned Mosasaurus), a land dino (Titanosaurus), and a sky dinosaur (Quetzalcoatlus), they'll unlock the secret fourth boss you've spent the whole movie waiting to show up. Spoiler alert: It does! Distortus is a big ugly chungus, and it basically does so little that its enormous paw tracks are the only impression its capable of leaving behind. 

 










That would be disappointing in and of itself, but it's even more so with an effects wizard like Edwards at the helm, whose “Godzilla” remains among the most sweeping and majestic monster movies of the 21st century (in addition to being an unfathomably perfect audition reel for directing a “Jurassic” sequel). It's no secret that Edwards joined “Rebirth” just a short while before it raced into production, and that Universal targeted “The Creator” creator because he was one of the only proven filmmakers capable of delivering a CGI-fest like this in time for its predetermined summer 2025 release date. And as we all remember from “Jurassic Park,” there are never any negative consequences for operating on a timeline that prioritizes shareholder value above structural integrity.

It would be disingenuous to suggest that “Rebirth” is totally deprived of tolerable setpieces and/or well-engineered thrills; the T-Rex cameo has some fun with an inflatable raft, while the Quetzalcoatlus sequence introduces a high-flying pinch of “Indiana Jones” into a movie so desperate to coast off Spielbergian magic that it doesn't seem to care where it comes from. Edwards might have done better to set his sights on Joe Johnson-level fun, as “Rebirth” — which channels the straightforwardness of “Jurassic Park III” — would kill for a single moment that matches the aura of the Pteranodon emerging from the fog. Alas, to a less explicit but similarly enervating degree as the previous “Jurassic World” titles, this movie is undone by its need to make dinosaurs feel modern enough to compete against the rest of today's multiplex fare. 

 










Much as I appreciate Edwards' decision to shoot on 35mm film, his facility with CGI ends up being less of a feature than a bug in the context of a franchise that requires your brain to believe in the context of its franchise. The dinosaur attacks in the original movie are so terrifying because of how palpably they collapse 65 million years of animal instinct — and how credibly they straddle the line between nightmare fuel and waking life. 

When the T-Rex runs its claws along the unelectrified fence of its paddock, our intellectual discomfort at the idea of playing God suddenly crystallizes into the stuff of clear and present danger. When the kids are hiding from the Velociraptors in the kitchen, the suspense is rooted in the bone-deep belief that the dinosaurs are as real as the humans they're trying to eat and vice-versa, and that belief was sustained by the simplicity of the action at hand. “Jaws” works because the shark didn't, and “Jurassic Park” endures as a movie for the same reason it failed as a destination: People could only exert so much control over the attractions. “Rebirth” has a scene where a pair of Titanosauruses make out. 

It's great that Edwards can make a Mosasaur look tangible enough to touch as it glides under the surface of the ocean, but his film's pencil-thin characters betray the reality of the CGI dinos chasing them, who seem that much faker as a result of the ability to make them do whatever the director wants. It's no wonder that none of the kids in “Rebirth” are ever sufficiently petrified about their situation, or that “Jurassic Park” continues to be the only one of these movies that doesn't feel like watching people enjoy a theme park ride second-hand. 

 










Needless to say, “Rebirth” doesn't do itself any favors by so frequently harkening back to the original. Bad as some of the previous sequels have been, none of them have been so eager to measure themselves against Spielberg's masterpiece. Nothing in this movie is quite as maddening as the second trilogy's attempt to make audiences invest in a specific Velociraptor (though Edwards half-heartedly tries to sweeten us on an adorable baby Aquilops named Dolores), but the extent to which this franchise is just fending off its own extinction has never been more obvious than it is in during the “Rebirth” sequence that pays homage to the kitchen encounter from the first movie. The “Jurassic” sequels were bad enough when they made an effort to evolve — they're even less worth seeing now that they already come pre-fossilized. 

Universal Pictures will release “Jurassic World: Rebirth” in theaters on Wednesday, July 2.

Indie-rock stalwarts Deerhoof will be removing their music from Spotify. “‘Daniel Ek uses $700 million of his Spotify fortune to become chairman of AI battle tech company' was not a headline we enjoyed reading this week,” the band wrote in a statement shared online. “We don't want our music killing people. We don't want our success being tied to AI battle tech.”

Along with being the the co-founder and chief executive of Spotify, Daniel Ek is the founder of an investment fund called Prima Materia. It was reported earlier this month that Prima Materia led a new round of investment in Helsing, a defense company that sells software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to inform military decisions. Prima Materia has been investing in Helsing since 2021, and the new round of funding amounts to 600 million euros ($693.6 million). Helsing currently operates in the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.

Beyond the opposition to Ek and Prima Materia's investments, Deerhoof criticized Spotify's utility for artists and status as a music-discovery platform. “Spotify is flushing itself down the toilet,” the band said. “Eventually artists will want to leave this already widely hated data-mining scam masquerading as a ‘music company.' It's creepy for users and crappy for artists. Music-making lasts forever but this or that digital get-rich-quick scheme is sure to become obsolete.”

Deerhoof continued: “One of the claims often made about Spotify is that it theoretically makes one's music discoverable by anyone who signs up, no matter how remote they may be from the self-proclaimed centers of hipness. But just because someone is far from Western gatekeepers does not mean they lack culture, or need to hear our band. Deerhoof is a small mom and pop operation, and know when enough is enough. We aren't capitalists, and don't wish to take over the world. Especially if the price of ‘discoverability' is letting oligarchs fill the globe with computerized weaponry, we're going to pass on the supposed benefits.”

Deerhoof closed their statement by acknowledging that their disappearance from Spotify will not be immediate. “We aren't sure exactly how soon the takedowns can happen, but it will be as soon as possible,” they wrote. “We want to thank our various labels for their support on this tricky decision. The grunt work of pulling content off of Spotify is something they're now tasked with, and they are sharing the financial hit. We know we are asking them to make a sacrifice, and it means a lot to us.”

Joyful Noise Recordings, the label behind numerous Deerhoof releases, shared a statement in support of Deerhoof's decision to leave Spotify. “Since the dawn of streaming, independent artists and labels have essentially been forced to participate alongside various streaming entities in order to survive, entities that are often funded by sources that do not align with our values,” the label wrote.

“As an independent record label, we serve the artist,” Joyful Noise continued. “It is ultimately their decision to present their material on whichever platforms they choose. It is with this in mind that we hold no judgement towards any artist that wishes to keep their music on the platform.”

The label concluded: “However, we encourage any true music lover to buy directly from artists or the label as much as possible. This ensures financial sustainability for the artist and independent label community that supports them.”

Deerhoof, who recently released the new album Noble and Godlike in Ruin, join Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, India.Arie, and Crosby, Stills & Nash as artists who have pulled music from Spotify in recent years.

Young, who has long criticized digital streaming platforms for audio-fidelity reasons, pulled his catalog from Spotify in 2022 in opposition to the platform's then-exclusive deal with podcaster Joe Rogan. At the time, he said that Rogan was spreading misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. He returned his music to Spotify in 2024 after Rogan's Spotify exclusivity ended and his podcast became available on competing platforms from Apple and Amazon.

Joni Mitchell pulled her music from Spotify in solidarity with Neil Young, as did Graham Nash. Mitchell returned to Spotify in 2024, while Nash and his band Crosby, Stills & Nash's boycott lasted a handful of months. India.Arie protested Spotify around the same time as Neil Young, too, but she returned to the platform in 2023.

Mortality is a fragile thing and, when keeping the company of animals, knowing the inevitability of death feels all the more acute. This kind of relationship can buoy a life; its ending is a kind of bone-deep pain that is often misunderstood but fertile for vulnerable expression. For over 20 years, Blonde Redhead's Kazu Makino has been writing songs about horses. The band's 2004 4AD debut, Misery is a Butterfly, excavates a riding accident that left Makino trampled with a broken jaw that prevented her from singing. Despite the maudlin title, it is an album about enduring, and ends with the danceable “Equus,” a nod to the equine that shares a name with a play from the 1970s about a teen boy with an evangelical obsession with horses. On stage, it is the animals who are hurt—the boy's love is beastial and perverse, leading him to blind what he can't physically hold—but there are overlapping sentiments about what gets lost in translation when the human and non-human collide.

Makino's ambitions as a rider never faltered and subsequent Blonde Redhead records are rife with references to her horse, Harry, whose death she mourned with “Rest of Her Life” on the band's 2023 Sit Down for Dinner. “I had this image in my head as I was writing it that I'm on top of [a] mountain screaming and singing, and then [I] hear [an] echo back, but the echo is somehow in a different voice. It's singing back something that I didn't sing,” she said about the song in an interview with Tone Glow. “I wanted that to happen to me.” Enter the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, who join Makino and her bandmates, twin brothers Amedeo (guitar/vocals) and Simone Pace (drums), on a re-imagining of the track that makes her vision real. The collaboration front-loads the first half of The Shadow of the Guest, a collection that iterates on Sit Down for Dinner, houses ASMR tracks made for an Isabel Marant runway show, and twice refreshes “For the Damaged Coda,” an accidental hit serviced by a Rick & Morty sync.

This kind of revision has been part of Blonde Redhead's practice for nearly their entire tenure. Their catalogue is punctuated with EPs and expanded singles that make material from their full-lengths brand new: French and Italian re-lyricizing of Melody of Certain Damaged Lemons tracks; David Sylvian karaoking Butterfly's “Messenger.” Hell, they recorded a slicker version of Fake Can Be Just as Good instrumental “Futurism vs. Passéism” on its follow-up, In an Expression of the Inexpressible, with added vocals from the album producer, Fugazi's Guy Picciotto, waxing philosophical en Français.

On Shadow, choir versions become investigations into Sit Down for Dinner's expansiveness: The Brooklyn Youth Chorus shout and falsetto alongside Makino's mourning; harmonies cascade in controlled chaos on “Before”; “Via Savona” is buttressed by the lush arrangement of young voices. Close listening suggests that the vocals are additions to the older tracks, and this distracts on “Savona” but especially “Coda.” The juice isn't worth the squeeze. How much more can be taken from a bonus track that's a quarter century old? And yet! It reprises again as “Oda a Coda” in which the band is totally absent, replaced by mariachi players who bring to it joyous melancholia.

Call them curators, if that suits you, but it doesn't make their sweeping cultural production any less real. In “Extreme Realism,” the affect theorist Brian Massumi offers in his many definitions of the real that it is “an enactive speculation on its own production, as a complete proposition.” Blonde Redhead is a relational project. Their music is a threshold that can be crossed variously and sometimes leads to new rooms that didn't previously exist.

“Have you heard?” Greta Kline once sang, “I am so young.” But alas, that was a decade ago, when the young New York City songwriter got stuck fielding the media's fixation on her age as she shot from uploading lo-fi demos to Bandcamp to being a genuine DIY-pop icon. Since then, the process of aging has become a throughline in her songs, as Frankie Cosmos—perhaps nowhere more clearly than on Different Talking, her sixth proper full-length, a tribute to holding your younger self with you as you grow. “I'm older now than before,” she sings softly on “Wonderland,” toward the album's end, “More solid now than before… I know myself even more.”

The self-knowledge Kline confesses on Different Talking comes courtesy of collaboration. Kline has performed and made records with a full band in the past, but here, Alex Bailey, Hugo Stanley, and Katie Von Schleicher helped arrange and produce the tracks as a truly cohesive unit, not as accessories to a solo project. They made the record in an upstate New York house over 40 days—the first self-produced Frankie Cosmos record since Kline's teenage DIY era. “Tomorrow” feels like a bridge to those early, uncomplicated Frankie Cosmos tracks: strummy guitars and a wistful vocal melody (plus a reference to Kline's beloved late dog, Joe Joe, a fixture in her songs), rendered in a crisper, clearer definition. But much of the record sounds more like a scaled-up team effort. “Your Take On” teeters close to eruption, like a minimalist pop take on a thrashing full-band rock song; “Wonderland” rides a syncopated rhythm and a grooving bassline; “Against the Grain” ends with pulsing, warbling layers of synth and guitars. The record is punctuated by winking details, like the squawking guitar riffs that dot “Porcelain” or the way the psych-lite “Joyride” fades out like a tape player powering down.

Different Talking doesn't stray from Frankie Cosmos' predilection for short songs—only two tracks of its 17 pass the two-and-a-half-minute mark—but Kline and the band make each feel like a universe in miniature. The timeline of her lyrics zooms out, marking time through the markers of gentrification you can't avoid if you stick around any city long enough. “Unrecognizable street,” she mourns on “Porcelain,” “With a brow salon where formerly/Emptiness reigned.” Towards the album's end, she lists some banal but inevitable disappointments of her hometown: “Damn this city,” she sings, “Everything's a pothole or a restaurant/And smells like pot.” But then, the song turns from jaded indignation towards quiet appreciation: “My loss isn't everybody's loss,” she admits, before admiring the iridescence of a sunset.

These intimate, internal changes thread through the lyrics of Different Talking. Kline chides herself for “acting like I'm 27”: an age that can seem impossibly old before you reach it, and naively young once it's in the rearview. She ponders her “one gray hair” while knowing that “time is both frozen and moving faster than we can see.” As Frankie Cosmos has cycled through various chapters—the solo Bandcamp uploads, the more fleshed-out studio albums, various full-band iterations—each has felt like a scrapbook capturing a particular slice of coming-of-age. More than a decade removed from her critical breakthrough, Kline's songs still carry the soft-spoken sweetness of her earliest releases, but this fuller sound grounds the music—sturdy enough to expand into a new sonic territory without losing its center, able to consider a longer arc of the passage of time. On “Against the Grain,” Kline sums up this newfound perspective, an understated yet wise thesis statement for the album as a whole: “Trying to take it in while I'm here,” she sings, “Trying to feel the awe, the fear.”

“The whole period of my existence seemed to be placed before me in a kind of panoramic review, and each act of it seemed to be accompanied by some reflection on its cause, or its consequences,” wrote British naval officer Francis Beaufort, recollecting his near-death by drowning in 1791. This is an early account of what psychologists now call a “life review,” the moment before death during which your life flashes before your eyes. Drew Daniel recently realized that if Matmos could experience a life review, it would likely be pretty metal: He and his partner M.C. Schmidt have been gathering metallic sounds over the whole course of the band's existence, sampling everything from squeaky hinges to cannons on their travels around the world.

This archive forms the basis of Metallic Life Review, an album built around metal objects that have crossed Matmos' path over the course of their career. What would be a heady concept for most bands is tame for Matmos, who have made a name for themselves by mining the sounds of surgeries, telepathy, and doing the laundry. The record is a sequel of sorts to 2019's Plastic Anniversary, which drew from a wave of plastic detritus including riot shields, vinyl LPs, and breast implants, in a seriocomic demonstration of the way that deathless substance infiltrates our lives (and our bodies). But this album is less obvious in its social critique and more traditional in its instrumentation—for every nitrous oxide canister or cheese grater, there are several more gongs, steel tongue drums, cymbals, glockenspiels, and tubular bells. The more relevant precursor is Matmos' 2010 collaboration with Sō Percussion, Treasure State, a suite of songs inspired by the acoustic properties of things like water, cactus needles, and yes, aluminum. Metallic Life Review shares the same fascination with materiality, reveling in metal's musical attributes.

Daniel points to industrial stalwarts Einstürzende Neubauten as an influence on Metallic Life Review; that group's bang and clang are clearly evident in the clattering rhythms of tracks like “The Rust Belt.” But metal can also be mellow, melodic, even sensuous. “Norway Doorway” begins with a door, recorded in Oslo, whose hinges are hysterically creaky, screaming out like Foley work in a bad horror film. As the song folds in propulsive percussion by Thor Harris, the creak begins to sound more like a soulful saxophone—the hinge hasn't changed, but a new context reveals its musicality. “Steel Tongues” plays a similar trick by burying a cemetery gate in an innocuous setting: Its rattling and groaning lose their morbid effect against a lullaby melody courtesy of Horse Lords' Owen Gardner on glockenspiel. These touches owe less to '80s industrial than to Harry Partch, who invented instruments made from artillery shell casings and aircraft bomber nose cones for surprisingly delicate, complex pieces.

The biggest leap the duo takes is not conceptual but compositional. The 20-minute, multi-part title track had its genesis in the usual Matmos way, with individually recorded sections that they mixed and matched to their liking on tour. Instead of stitching the final product together on a laptop, though, they followed the lead of Throbbing Gristle's Heathen Earth, a gnarly live-in-studio first take. Daniel and Schmidt shake themselves loose of the DAW's fixed grid for an organic groove that builds percussive momentum, subsides into a meditative sample of church bells, and then rallies for a second, noisier crescendo.

The animating idea of the life review, that autobiographical flash at the moment of death, sometimes gets buried under the weight of all this metal, its achingly personal connotation clashing with cold iron and steel. But at the end of the recording process, the phrase abruptly took on a tragic new resonance. Susan Alcorn, the legendary pedal steel guitarist who supplies the haunting twang on “Changing States,” passed away in January 2025. David Lynch, to whom “The Chrome Reflects Our Image” is dedicated, died the same month. A secondary meaning of the life review is perhaps more suitable: that of a therapeutic process of telling stories about ourselves, of remembering where we've been and who we are. Though Matmos are not about to end, Daniel and Schmidt use Metallic Life Review as an opportunity to reflect on their career, their friends, and their influences, crafting a makeshift memorial with a brilliant, mirror-like sheen.

Foo Fighters have shared a cover of “I Don't Wanna Hear It,” a song from Minor Threat's first 7"" release. According to the YouTube description, Foo Fighters recorded the instrumentals in 1995, and Dave Grohl finished his vocals in 2025. Listen to the cover below.

Grohl is a longtime fan and admirer of Ian MacKaye and his bands Minor Threat and Fugazi. As a teenager, he famously wrote MacKaye a letter, and, in his late twenties, he cited Minor Threat as one of his five favorite hardcore bands. “They sort of made hardcore what it is, with Ian's vocals and the whole straight-edge ‘no drink-no drugs' thing,'” he told Melody Maker. They started a new era. Although they were kind of minimalist about it, they were really talented musicians and they rocked.”

Foo Fighters have been relatively quiet since releasing But Here We Are, their first album after the death of drummer Taylor Hawkins, in 2023. They'll return to the stage in October, but it will be without Josh Freese, who briefly took over for Hawkins on drums.

	Over the weekend, British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan performed at Glastonbury where they urged the crowd to chant “free Palestine” and “Death, death to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces],” which caused controversy amid Glastonbury organizers. Now the U.S. Department of State is taking action against the band, revoking their U.S. visa. The duo was set to begin a U.S. tour this fall.


	“The @StateDept has revoked the US visas for the members of the Bob Vylan band in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants,” Christopher Landau, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, wrote on social platform X. “Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.” Bob Vylan was slated for a tour through the U.S. this fall.

The @StateDept has revoked the US visas for the members of the Bob Vylan band in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants. Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.


	“Their chants very much crossed a line and we are urgently reminding everyone involved in the production of the Festival that there is no place at Glastonbury for antisemitism, hate speech, or incitement to violence,” festival organizer Emily Eavis said in a statement.

	Following their set, singer Bobby Vylan defended their stance via Instagram, captioning his post with, “I said what I said.”


	He wrote that he had been “inundated with messages of both support and hatred.” He added that he was inspired by his daughter responding to a survey on school meals and that “listening to her voice her opinion” reminded him that “we may not be doomed after all.”“Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place,” he continued. “As we grow older and our fire possibly starts to dim under the suffocation of adult life and all its responsibilities, it is incredibly important that we encourage and inspire future generations to pick up the torch that was passed to us. Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change. Let them see up marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered. Today it is a change in school dinners, tomorrow it is a change in foreign policy.”

	The group's booking agent, United Talent Agency, has also reportedly dropped the band from its roster, per the Hollywood Reporter.


	Bob Vylan's performance followed Kneecap's much-discussed set at Glastonbury, where that band also voiced their support of Palestine. Kneecap's Mo Charra was charged with a terror offense after he allegedly displayed a Hezbollah flag onstage during a show in London late last year. Kneecap's set was not livestreamed as planned by the BBC.

	Much like President Donald Trump, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is no stranger to taking advantage of the trappings of elected office to make a quick buck or glitz up her surroundings. In 2021, public records showed that the then governor of South Dakota spent almost $70,000 installing a sauna, chandeliers, and luxury decor in the governor's mansion. Last year, she was sued by a consumer protection group after producing undisclosed advertisements for a Texas dental group. The secretary has more recently sported a $50,000 watch while touring a Salvadoran torture prison. She also had a Gucci purse stuffed with over $3,000 in cash stolen from her at a D.C. restaurant earlier this year. 


	Noem's salary as governor was $130,000, but it wasn't her only source of income while leading South Dakota. According to a Monday report from ProPublica, she received tens of thousands of dollars from a dark money group, possibly in violation of campaign finance laws. 

	











	Tax records reviewed by ProPublica show that in 2023, during Noem's tenure as governor of South Dakota, a group listed as “American Resolve Policy Fund” paid Noem $80,000 that never made it onto her public ethics disclosures.


	The payment was made to an LLC in Delaware under Noem's name. According to the documents reviewed by ProPublica, the $80,000 deposit from American Resolve came only four minutes after the LLC was officially registered. Officially, Noem was paid for helping the group — which does not disclose its donors — fundraise. The group would go on to run social media attack ads targeting local news outlets reporting on Noem's alleged misuse of taxpayer funds during her time as governor. 

	











	While lawmakers helping nonprofits and other political groups fundraise is not unusual, it is not a common practice for them to be rewarded with a five figure deposit to their personal corporate account. “There's no way the governor is supposed to have a private side business that the public doesn't know about,” Lee Schoenbeck, a long-time Republican attorney and lawmaker, told ProPublica. “It would clearly not be appropriate.”

	The findings relate to a larger pattern in the manner in which Noem — and the Trump administration as a whole — treat public funds. The Associated Press found that she racked up over $150,000 in personal and national campaign travel expenses that were ultimately footed by the state, including as she campaigned for Trump in 2024 (and raised her national profile in the process). The same report calculated that the governor's office spent a staggering total of $640,000 in travel-related costs during Noem's six-year tenure, including $7,555 on plane tickets to Paris and hunting trips to Canada. 


	Noem has ascended to a prominent position in an administration that is quickly becoming the most corrupt in American history. The president's family is raking in cash across a stuffed portfolio of money-grubbing schemes centered around access to the presidency, and while essentially offering the wealthy access to the White House. Birds of a feather flock together, and Noem has made herself at home in the nest.

	It's good to have these guys back. In the first decade of the 2000s, there were few hip-hop acts with standards as exacting as the Clipse's. While others originated the idea of making music about moving weight, Gene and Terrence Thornton, a.k.a. Malice and Pusha T, elevated it to a high artform — every bar stylized to the max, sleek and imposing at every turn, smacking down every MPC-mashing sound sculpture their friends the Neptunes hurled their way. Their music-industry troubles were as legendary as their verbal gifts; while they were always warmly embraced by their fans, from the cross-country hustlers who nodded along to “Grindin'” in 2002 to the blog-era rap fiends who downloaded every installment of the We Got It 4 Cheap mixtape series a few years later, the major-label system consistently struggled to make the most of their talents. Now, a decade and a half after their last album together, the brothers from Virginia have reunited. What does a new Clipse album sound like in a world where they're rightfully acknowledged as two of the greatest ever to pick up a mic?

	











	The first thing you'll notice after hitting play on Let God Sort Em Out is how much they've both grown. If the Clipse's 2006 masterpiece, Hell Hath No Fury, led with a winking apology to their mother for a sinful lifestyle (track two, “Momma I'm So Sorry”), this one begins by honoring her memory and her impact on their lives in genuine, vulnerable terms. “Lost in emotion, Mama's youngest/Trying to navigate life without my compass,” Pusha confesses over the contemplative piano keys of “The Birds Don't Sing.” “Some experience death and feel numbness/But not me, I felt it all and couldn't function.” It's a strong contribution to the canon of great rap songs about moms — and then Malice comes in with an even more moving verse about losing their father a few months later: “The way you missed Mama, I guess I should have known/Chivalry ain't dead, you ain't let her go alone.” Two of the game's most brilliant villains have matured into eloquent eulogists.

	Thankfully, the rest of the album shows they're still the ice-cold lyrical kingpins you remember. “Chains & Whips” boasts a squeaky, freaky beat from their old buddy Pharrell (who produced this album solo, after his split from Neptunes wingman Chad Hugo) and a scene-stealing verse from Kendrick Lamar. (“I don't fuck with the kumbaya shit,” Kendrick notes, just in case you slept through the last 15 months.) “P.O.V.” is a showcase for their finest luxury-car wordplay (“The only Audi here is driven by my au pair”); “EBITDA” makes a memorable hook out of the biz-school term for “earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization”; “F.I.C.O.,” as in credit scores, recounts high-stakes turnpike trips vividly enough to send a chill up your spine. The songs that aren't named after acronyms are just as excellent.

	When they open up emotionally, it's always fascinating to hear, as on “All Things Considered,” which features unguarded verses from both brothers. “My homies that didn't die was all in prison/Visits behind the glass, my mirror image,” Malice says, referencing the events that led to the Clipse's first parting of ways 15 years ago. On the gospel-tinged “So Far Ahead,” he explains once again why he walked away from the group to make faith-based music, yielding the instant-classic hip-hop quotable “I've been both Mason Bethas.” 


	Pusha's solo career, which he began reluctantly after his brother's change of heart, has succeeded spectacularly well. He's recorded some of the most impressive rap albums of the past decade on his own, carving out a new lane of high-budget, lyrically formidable grown-man music. There are times when Let God Sort Em Out feels more like a continuation of that path — a top-notch Pusha solo album with more Malice verses — than it does like a sequel to Lord Willin' or Hell Hath. Then again, how many artists in any genre who debuted 23 years ago still sound the same as they did back then? Time passes and people change, but the important truths remain. This is an album that underscores several of them: Whatever the year, Pusha and Malice are richer than you, smarter than you, and much better at making rap music than you'll ever be. Amen.

	Singer/songwriter and actress Kate Nash took aim at a broad range of celebrities and their politics during her Glastonbury set Sunday night, according to British media reports, firing salvos at J.K. Rowling, Rod Stewart, and even 1975 singer Matty Healy‘s mom.


	Nash, who recently dropped the anti-transphobia single “GERM,” directed her harshest words at the Harry Potter creator: “The loudest feminist voice in the U.K. is currently transphobic,” she said, “and that is something that I take very fucking personally, as a feminist and a feminist with trans friends in my life, trans people that I love and that are very important to me. “Dismantling systems of oppression lies at the very core of feminism, so transphobia is not fucking feminist. And just because you're a fucking millionaire and a fucking bully with an army of trolls on the fucking internet, I don't give a fuck mate.”

	Nash then, somewhat bafflingly, shifted her focus to actress Denise Welch, Matty Healy's mother. “The music industry doesn't know what to do with me,” she said. “They tried to get rid of me, but they didn't. There is a record executive sweating their tits off with Matt Healy's mum.”Before she played her song “Dickhead,” she said: “Fuck Rod Stewart. This one goes out to Keir Starmer, J.K. Rowling, Rod Stewart and Nigel fucking Farage.” Stewart recently sparked controversy by voicing support for the right-wing Reform U.K. party and its anti-immigration leader Nigel Farage in a newspaper interview, claiming Britain needed to “give Farage a chance.”

	











	Earlier in the same festival, the hip-hop/punk act Bob Vylan faced criticism from event organizers after he led the crowd in a chant of “death to the I.D.F.,” while Irish act Kneecap's set  — which also included criticism of Stewart — was left off the BBC's telecast following their vocal anti-Israel advocacy.

	Andrew Perez



	Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who's famous for his former hospital company's record-setting Medicare fraud settlements, is currently leading an effort to make Donald Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” even more painful for America's poor. 


	The legislation already cuts $930 billion from Medicaid, the nation's government health insurance program for low-income and disabled Americans, and would eliminate coverage for millions. Scott's amendment, expected to get a vote Monday, would take away another $313 billion in state Medicaid funds and force hundreds of thousands of additional people, at least, off the program.


	Scott has framed his proposed Medicaid cuts as necessary to preserve the program “for those who truly need it” — and not “able-bodied” adults. “If you don't want to work, you're the one who decided you don't want health care,” he recently said on Fox News. He's suggested Democrats are using tax dollars to “give illegal aliens Medicaid benefits,” even though undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, claiming that blue states want to “exploit this safety net.”

	











	Ironically enough, some of the claims against Scott's old hospital company revolved around exploiting Medicaid, and billing for services that patients didn't need. 


	Scott's office did not immediately respond to Rolling Stone's request for comment Monday.


	The senator resigned as CEO of the hospital chain known as HCA Healthcare in 1997 amid an ongoing federal probe and a series of whistleblower complaints. He has long faced attacks from Democrats over the $1.7 billion that HCA paid to resolve fraud allegations in the early 2000s. Some of the allegations involved Medicaid.

	











	In late 2000, as part of the “largest government fraud settlement ever” with the Justice Department, HCA pleaded guilty to criminal conduct and agreed to pay over $840 million in fines, penalties, and damages to resolve claims of unlawful billing practices.

	Among the claims HCA settled over: The company was accused of billing “Medicare, Medicaid, the Defense Department's TRICARE health care program, and the Federal Employees' Health Benefits Program, for lab tests that were not medically necessary” and “not ordered by physicians.”


	HCA was accused of “upcoding,” or pretending patients were sicker than they were in order to increase reimbursements to its hospitals. “The guilty plea includes one count relating to this upcoding practice,” the Justice Department wrote in a press release. The company was also accused of billing Medicaid “for home health visits for patients who did not qualify to receive them or were not performed,” the department said.


	The civil and administrative settlement agreement between HCA and the U.S. Justice Department said the company, from 1995 to 1998, submitted claims to Medicaid, Medicare, and TRICARE, “(a) for visits to patients who did not qualify for home health services because (i) the patients were not homebound, (ii) there was no medical need for such services, or (iii) there was no medical need for skilled services; (b) for visits that were not provided; (c) for visits to deliver services that were in fact or should have been provided by an assisted living facility.”


	HCA and the Justice Department entered into an additional settlement agreement in 2003, in which the company agreed to pay another $631 million to resolve false claims it submitted to federal health programs. 


	In a civil settlement agreement, the Justice Department wrote that health regulators “contend that they have certain administrative claims against HCA under the provisions for permissive exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs.”


	Under both agreements, the Justice Department announced that HCA would pay millions of dollars to state Medicaid agencies: $13.6 million in 2000, and then $17.5 million in 2003. The department said the latter figure represented “direct state losses.”

Charli XCX has responded to the online critiques of her performance at Glastonbury on Saturday night. Following her set, which was broadcast live on BBC's iPlayer in the U.K., many viewers took to social media to criticize her use of autotune and to call her “the worst performer.” 


	In a series of tweets, Charli XCX dismissed the controversy and defended her creative choices. “like the idea that singing with deliberate autotune makes you a fraud or that not having a traditional band suddenly means you must not be a ‘real artist' is like, the most boring take ever. yawn sorry just fell asleep,” she wrote.

	She added, “but to be honest… i enjoy the discourse. imo the best art is divisive and confrontational and often evolves into truly interesting culture rather than being like kind of ok, easily understood and sort of forgettable.”


	After sharing a five-star review of her set, she noted, “really enjoying these boomer vibe comments on my glastonbury performance. it's super fascinating to me.”

Unidentified Flying Object, or better known as a UFO.

Wyoming has many stories of people seeing something in the sky that doesn't belong there. Shoot, there are many stories of Wyomingites having stories of being abducted.

In reality, what's the likelihood you'll see a UFO in Wyoming?

New research reveals that we rank #10 on the list of states where you're most likely to see a UFO, with 71 sightings per 100,000 people or a 1 in 1,408 chance of seeing a UFO. Research from the betting analysis website Action Network shows that not only are people reporting UFO sightings, but with 210 online searches per month, 35 people per 100,000 are searching for information about UFOs.

As we approach World UFO Day on July 2, will the number of sightings or reports increase? Research suggests that the heightened sense of awareness surrounding the day is likely the reason for the increased reports. If you're a betting person, why not take a gamble?

According to the number of reports filed with the National UFO Reporting Center, the United States has the highest number of reported sightings. This is likely due to the center being located in the US and originating from here.

Social Media has led people to try to go above and beyond to ""go viral,"" and some of the reported sightings can likely be false, as a means to generate clicks. It's challenging to know what to believe, especially with the advancement of AI.

Programs like Sky360, a citizen science project that monitors the skies worldwide, were developed to track celestial phenomena globally, enabling a better understanding, identification, and analysis of these phenomena.

ROSWELL, N.M. — Aliens of some sort are ready to take over Roswell for the UFO Festival to celebrate the 78th anniversary of the UFO incident near the city.

City leaders say they're starting their celebrations early.

“What we have different coming out this year is, the number one thing we have going on, the event is starting the this year on a Thursday instead of on a Friday,” organizer Barbara Gomez said.

The festival will kick off with a drone show Thursday. They will also have a Walk of Fame ceremony, honoring Glen Davis. Davis is the mortician involved with the 1947 UFO incident. They will also have a pet costume contest and ufologists will also speak.

“Don Schmidt, Travis Walton, Tom Reed, Kathleen Martin, Jennifer Stein, some of these are very well-known ufologists that can speak about the truth of this, or is it? Is it the truth, or is it not? But you can decide about that,” Gomez said.

Even floods last October couldn't keep the UFO Festival from landing this year.

“That convention center has still not been repaired. So, the people that were there at the convention center have moved downtown,” Gomez said.

Regardless, Gomez expects to see a lot more aliens walking around this year.

“They literally have 10,000 people go through the UFO Museum during the UFO weekend. So that's not including the people on the streets, the people coming to listen to music. So we can estimate anywhere from 15 to 18,000 people come here,” she said.

With the Reno Air Races around the corner in Roswell, Gomez believes the festival will only see more visitors in the years to come.

“We always see a lot of people during the UFO [Fest]. It's not only nationally known, it's internationally known, so I think that it'll bring a lot of focus to Roswell. And so when the air show gets here, it's going to put it have a bigger impact, not only for Roswell, but the surrounding communities within the area,” she said.

Entry to the UFO Festival is free. It starts this Thursday, July 3, and goes through Sunday, July 6. The city will close Main Street the entire weekend.

Old Mutual Life Assurance got shareholder approval to merge with UAP Life Assurance in 2021

Old Mutual Holdings Plc (formerly UAP Holdings Ltd) has received regulatory approval to proceed with the next phase of merging its life insurance businesses in Kenya.

The transaction involves the transfer of the long-term life insurance business of Old Mutual Life Assurance Company Ltd (OMLAC) to Old Mutual Life Assurance Kenya Ltd (OMLAK).

The East African financial services group received shareholder and regulatory approval in the year 2021 to merge its Old Mutual Life Assurance Company Ltd and UAP Life Assurance Ltd (UAP Life) with the aim of building a more streamlined life business.

The approval cleared the way for the conversion of Old Mutual Life Assurance into a closed fund (meaning, no new policies are issued), and all new life business was subsequently written under UAP Life.

UAP Life was later renamed to OMLAK in May 2022, as part of the group's rebranding exercise.

The group disclosed through a notice to its clients dated June 25 that it has received approval from the regulator to proceed with the next phase of the merger between OMLAC and OMLAK.“We are pleased to notify you that we have now reached the next milestone in our journey to simplify and strengthen our life assurance services. We have received further approval from the Insurance Regulatory Authority to proceed with the next phase of the merger between OMLAC and OMLAK,” said Loreen Makwanya, the managing director of OMLAC in the notice seen by The EastAfrican.

Continuity“We ... wish to advise that there shall be no change in the level or quality of services provided to you during this transition and thereafter. All existing policies with OMLAC shall continue to be valid and in force under the maintenance of OMLAK. OMLAK will continue to honour all the policy commitments that would have been performed by OMLAC,” she said.“There will be no changes to the terms, benefits or obligations under the existing policies. Additionally, all policy holders will continue to receive appropriate customer support, including claims processing services as was being provided to them before,” she added.

Old Mutual Holdings is an East African financial services group that comprises seven subsidiaries that underwrite life and non-life insurance risks in Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan and Rwanda, a stock brokering company in Uganda and two property companies in Uganda and South SudanIts life insurance business registered an improvement, with its profit before tax more than doubling to Ksh682 million ($5.28 million) in 2024 from Ksh263 million ($2.03 million) in 2023. This improvement was largely driven by higher investment income arising from fair value gains from equity investments and government securities.

Paranormal entities, UFO, and shady government agencies all feature in Tom DeLonge's debut movie. Watch the trailer…


				By Team SciFiNow		      	
30-06-25

Directed and co-written by Blink–182's Tom DeLonge – alongside Ian Miller – Monsters of California is a brand new sci-fi adventure drama which follow a trio of friends on the hunt for paranormal entities and UFOs.

Check out the trailer here…



The movie takes place in Southern California and follows teenager Dallas Edwards (Jack Samson) and his wayward friends Riley (Jared Scott) and Toe (Jack Lancaster), who are on a quest for the meaning behind a series of mysterious, paranormal events. It's years on from his dad's disappearance and, although his family are still grieving, they're starting to move on with their lives… but Dallas believes there's much more to what happened than meets the eye.

Spending his time in haunted houses, paranormal hunting and getting stoned with his best friends, he's convinced that other life forms live among us, but when they uncover government secrets that his fighter pilot father left behind, they set off on a mission to find out the truth.

With the military – led his Uncle Myers (Casper Van Dien) – on their case and the help of his dad's old colleague Dr. Walker (Richard Kind), the friends embark on a wild and dangerous adventure that takes them to the heart of UFOs and other unexplained phenomena. Can they uncover the truth about his father and unravel the hidden, extraordinary secrets held deep within secret Governments organisations, or will they pay the ultimate price?

“It's a throwback to Steven Spielberg movies and Stranger Things,” Casper Van Dien explains of the movie when we spoke to him last week about the movie.

“The Six Million Man, Star Trek, Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind… all these different things have meant so much to me and the last scene in Monsters of California feels like that for me,” he continues.

“I just hope the movie makes people excited and inspires them. And I hope Tom gets to direct again because I think he did a great job.”

Monsters of California will be released on UK digital platforms 7 July 2025

Our favorite wayward sons might carry on to Season 16! Just when we thought we were finally free from the emotional rollercoaster that was Supernatural, Jensen Ackles comes swaggering in, teasing the possibility of donning flannel once again as Dean Winchester. Of course, we're talking about the Winchesters. When have they ever gotten anything without a catch? 

Honestly, they should just make a deal with Crowley, be done with it, and give us fans a new season. 

Ackles starred as Dean Winchester in 15 seasons of the fantasy drama show Supernatural, alongside his TV brother, Jared Padalecki. The show follows two brothers as they hunt demons, ghosts, and other supernatural beings as “hunters.” It aired from 2005 until 2020. Supernatural gained such a cult following that even though it's been off the air for five years, Ackles, Padalecki, and Misha Collins, who played the guardian angel Castiel, are still being invited to fan-organized conventions to this day. 

So, for Ackles to reveal that there's a chance for a new season, fans are obviously already losing their minds. 

In an interview with Collider, the actor-musician admitted that it's his schedule that keeps season 16 from happening. Ackles is currently involved in four Amazon Prime Video series: The Boys (which will have him reunite with Padalecki and Collins for the final season), Vought Rising, Gen V, and Countdown. He said of his schedule, “Well, it sounds like Amazon's going to have to come up with an idea on that one, because they're controlling my schedule right now.” 

Unofficially, there are no go signals yet from the powers that may be. However, both Padalecki and Ackles have expressed their interest in returning. Ackles said, “We continue to talk about it. If it happens, then let's go.” 

The Boys is officially ending, Countdown already premiered, and Vought Rising doesn't have an official premiere date yet. Surely, Amazon can lend Ackles for Supernatural Season 16. Of course, the writers for the next season would need to get creative with how they could top Season 15's ending, and how they could bring Dean back from the dead. (Sure, they've done it a couple of times, but his death in Season 15 felt final.) 

Sam's happy ending (sort of) of living a normal life, dying of old age, and reuniting with Dean in Heaven was already a fitting conclusion for a character who just wanted to be a regular dude. 

Nevertheless, if they do make it happen, we're sure they'll do right by the characters fans have loved for 15 years. As for us, honestly, we'd be more than happy with a whole season of bloopers and behind-the-scenes footage.

Unidentified Flying Object, or better known as a UFO.

Wyoming has many stories of people seeing something in the sky that doesn't belong there. Shoot, there are many stories of Wyomingites having stories of being abducted.

In reality, what's the likelihood you'll see a UFO in Wyoming?

New research reveals that we rank #10 on the list of states where you're most likely to see a UFO, with 71 sightings per 100,000 people or a 1 in 1,408 chance of seeing a UFO. Research from the betting analysis website Action Network shows that not only are people reporting UFO sightings, but with 210 online searches per month, 35 people per 100,000 are searching for information about UFOs.

As we approach World UFO Day on July 2, will the number of sightings or reports increase? Research suggests that the heightened sense of awareness surrounding the day is likely the reason for the increased reports. If you're a betting person, why not take a gamble?

According to the number of reports filed with the National UFO Reporting Center, the United States has the highest number of reported sightings. This is likely due to the center being located in the US and originating from here.

Social Media has led people to try to go above and beyond to ""go viral,"" and some of the reported sightings can likely be false, as a means to generate clicks. It's challenging to know what to believe, especially with the advancement of AI.

Programs like Sky360, a citizen science project that monitors the skies worldwide, were developed to track celestial phenomena globally, enabling a better understanding, identification, and analysis of these phenomena.

The 5 Best Songs Of The Week


When two ultra-prolific solo projects join forces and collaborate, what do you call that? They're not solo projects anymore, right? Or maybe they're just two lonely travelers whose paths happened to intersect for a brief moment. I don't know. Superdestroyer is an anonymous bedroom punk situation from Columbus; his most recent LP, Hell is real and all your friends are here., dropped last month. PhonesWithChords, meanwhile, is the alter-ego of Tennessee resident Nick Webber, and he's released two albums, Let's Fall In! and piecemeal, thus far in 2025. Now, Superdestroyer and PhonesWithChords have gotten together to make a collaborative EP called Surrealist Love Songs.

Surrealist Love Songs drops next month, and its Bandcamp genre tags tell a story: “5th wave emo,” “bummer punk,” “downtempo.” The two artists have shared the new song “a psychic link in perpetuity.” It sounds like an old Saves The Day track that's being played on toy keyboards and recorded underwater. Below, you will find “a psychic link in perpetuity” and the Surrealist Love Songs tracklist.

Surrealist Love Songs by Superdestroyer

TRACKLIST:
01 “Together we form a circuit”

ROYAL fans have spotted a bizarre detail in Meghan Markle's latest Instagram post where she is ""picking"" fresh fruit from her garden.

The seemingly candid image of the Duchess of Sussex, 43, is captioned ""Weekend plans: pick, snack, repeat"", along with a peach emoji.

However, wild conspiracy theories have emerged from users on social media questioning what has actually been captured in the photo posted to Meghan's lifestyle brand As Ever Instagram account.

The mother-of-two can be seen reaching up to a tree full of fruits, but the apricot she has between her fingers is the only one that looks ripe.

The intention behind the photo appears to be Meghan freshly pulling a newly ripe apricot from the branch.

However, people have noticed the contrast in colour between the fruit she is holding in comparison to rest of the one's on the tree which are green.

One Reddit user asked: ""I'd like to know, in what parallel universe does a single apricot ripen on a tree when the rest are still green?""

Another responded sarcastically: ""Yes, amazing isn't it, despite all the other fruit being green, plus she's 'picking' from inside the tree, where the fruit often take slightly longer to ripen, she's found a perfect, glowing, ripe apricot.""

Others have pointed to the way the apricot is not even connected to the tree, and The Duchess appears even to be holding the fruit upside down.

""Is it just me or is that fruit not even attached to the tree and she's just holding it in place to make it like she's picking it fresh off the tree?""

Another stated: ""She can't even fake plucking fruit from a tree properly. 

""At least photo-shop the fruit on the tree to make them orange.""

A third speculated: ""Holding a store bought ripe apricot up to the tree, upside down…""

In defence, one person wrote: ""She never explicitly said that she picked that one!

""She's simply noting that the Whole Foods one happens to be similar to hers.""

The colour difference may also be due to the lighting, or editing in the photograph.

Apricots are current in season in Santa Barbara, where Meghan and Harry currently live. 

This is not the first time perfectly captured shots posted by The Duchess of Sussex have been questioned by royal fans.

Last month, she posted a image of their family beagle, Mia, sniffing a basket of fresh vegetables that were supposedly homegrown.

People were suspicious, however, as they had no mud on them which is characteristic of produce grown at that time of the year after just being picked.

At the beginning of the year, Meghan teased a new project by writing a near-perfect cursive digits of 2025, which also consisted of a blunder.



But eagle-eyed fans also here noticed a clue that revealed it was not the first time The Duchess had attempted to write the numbers, as she walked past another 2025 written in the sand.

A mistake in another of Meghan's As Ever posts, where a small black mouse cursor could be seen on the left edge of the image.

Many West Virginia fans did not handle the news of Darian DeVries' sudden departure well.

And that's understandable.

Just days after learning the Mountaineers were snubbed by the NCAA Tournament Selection Committee, DeVries was announced as the new head coach of Indiana.

Two gut punches in just a few days.

Perhaps in part a byproduct of frustration, a wave of silliness ensued from the country roads.

In the eyes of West Virginia fans on the fringe, it goes something like this:

Tucker DeVries, who was already a likely NBA Draft choice ahead of the 2024-25 season, and who, off to a great start, had done nothing but enhance that draft stock, chose to postpone his multi-million dollar NBA career for a year by faking an injury, while also sabotaging his father's first season (also off to a great start) as a high major college basketball coach.  And likewise, Darian was on board with stalling his son's professional career for an NIL deal worth far less than an NBA contract, while also risking a blemish on his coaching resume.

Okay, that's not what they think at all, but it is effectively what one is saying in order to believe the nonsense that's out there.

For his part, West Virginia AD Wren Baker seems to understand that lunatic fans are a net negative to his school, so he's having no part of their conspiracies.

Baker says what really happened is what DeVries said happened — Indiana came calling after they announced Mike Woodson's retirement, and it was one of those rare opportunities he couldn't pass up.

“There were multiple other schools who had reached out to Darian because there were several jobs that were open before the season closed. I know factually that he declined to talk to those schools. The only one that I'm aware of that he entertained at all was Indiana,” Baker said on Big 12 Today.

Some of the other jobs that opened before the end of the season included Miami, Florida State and Virginia.  Impartial national observers all agreed Indiana was the best available position.

Why would DeVries find IU compelling? The facts conspiratorial West Virginia fans want to ignore are staring them right in the face:  Indiana is a more prestigious program, has better resources, is in a better conference, is closer to DeVries' Midwest roots, and it pays better.

It's a no brainer for a basketball junkie like DeVries.

And Baker acknowledges it while squashing the sour grapes.

“In situations like this, people will conjure up a lot of ‘this happened and that happened.' I probably have more knowledge of the facts because I was inside,” Baker said.  “Whether it was Tucker's injury or there's all kinds of crazy things that are out there. I believe that for whatever reason, he felt like Indiana was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and it was one of the few he would probably leave for, and it just happened to open at the wrong time.”

No doubt frustrated by having to replace DeVries after just one season in Morgantown, Baker is taking the high road, and setting a good example for WVU fans to follow.

“Coach DeVries did a really good job coaching the basketball team this year.  He deserves credit for that,” Baker said.  “We should have been in the NCAA Tournament.  I'm not somebody who cries and moans in public a lot, but that was an absolute travesty that team didn't get in.

“Darian and I enjoyed a good relationship, and I'm grateful for the progress we made in our program last year and wish we would have been able to continue.”

            President Donald Trump is threatening to impose higher tariffs on Japanese exports to the United States over what he claims is the country's unwillingness to buy American-grown rice.
    


            “They won't take our RICE, and yet they have a massive rice shortage. In other words, we'll just be sending them a letter, and we love having them as a Trading Partner for many years to come,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
    


            Trump's claim that Japan “won't take” rice from the US isn't true. The country bought $298 million worth of rice from the US last year, according to US Census Bureau trade data. Between January and April of this year, Japan bought $114 million worth of rice.
    


            However, it's unclear if Japanese officials involved in ongoing trade negotiations between the two countries have said they will stop buying rice from the US in the future. Representatives from Japan's embassy in the US did not immediately respond to CNN.
    


            A 2021 report published by the Office of the United States Trade Representative under former President Joe Biden stated that “Japan's highly regulated and nontransparent system of importation and distribution for rice limits the ability of US exporters to have meaningful access to Japan's consumers.” A source familiar with Trump's thinking told CNN that's what he was referring to in his post.
    


            Trump has said recently that his administration plans to send some foreign countries letters advising them of what their new tariff rates could be, following the pause of his April “reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners.
    


            And in a Fox News interview that aired on Sunday, Trump singled out Japan as one of the possible countries set to receive a letter.
    


            “Dear Mr. Japan, here's the story: You're going to pay a 25% tariff on your cars,” he said.
    


            Trump's Truth Social message comes with just days to go until the July 9 deadline when his 90-day pause on those “reciprocal” tariffs expires. It's unclear what will happen to tariff rates for the dozens of impacted countries.
    


            Before Trump announced the pause, Japanese exports were briefly subjected to a minimum tariff rate of 24%. Since the pause went in effect, they've been subject to the universal 10% rate.

‘Extremely tragic situation' as all six people onboard Cessna 441 bound for Montana died in crash on Sunday 

Six people were killed when a small plane crashed minutes after taking off from an Ohio airport, officials said.

The Cessna 441 with six people on board crashed near Youngstown-Warren regional airport on Sunday morning, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Authorities remained on the scene on Monday.

There were no survivors, Anthony Trevena, the executive director of Western Reserve Port Authority, said at a news conference. The victims were taken to the Trumbull county coroner's office, Trevena said, but he did not release their names.

It was difficult to get to the site of the crash, the Howland Township fire chief, Raymond Pace, said.

“We're very fortunate. This is a extremely tragic situation, but it could have been worse,” Pace said, noting that there were three houses near the spot where the plane crashed.

Publicly available flight tracking data showed that the plane's destination was Bozeman, Montana, said Michael Hillman, president of the aviation company JETS FBO Network.

“These were the best of the best in terms of the folks here at the field, as well as the pilots. I can't say enough about them,” Hillman said at the news conference. “I'd give anything to rewind the day and take them to breakfast instead.”

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate and the NSTB will lead the investigation.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","world"

            A victim of the antisemitic attack in Boulder, Colorado, earlier this month has died and additional victims have been identified, the Boulder County District Attorney's Office said in a statement Monday.
    


            Karen Diamond, 82, “died tragically as a result of the severe injuries that she suffered in the attack,” the statement says. She is the only victim to have died since the incident.
    


            “This horrific attack has now claimed the life of an innocent person who was beloved by her family and friends,” Boulder County District Attorney Michael Dougherty said.
    


            Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Diamond's passing was “deeply felt by the Boulder community and our entire state, particularly within our strong Jewish community.”
    


            “My heartfelt condolences go out to her friends and family. Karen was taken from us too soon, and we mourn her loss while remembering her life and the impact she had on those who loved her,” Polis said in a statement.



            Prosecutors said the total number of victims has increased to 29, and the charges against suspect Mohamed Soliman have been updated and amended.
    


Their synagogue taught them to build peace. An antisemitic attack is testing their resilience



            Soliman, a 45-year-old from Egypt, is now facing two first-degree murder charges – one for extreme indifference and the other with intent and after deliberation, the district attorney's office said. Both of those charges are related to Diamond's death.
    


            Under an amended complaint, the prosecutor's office said, Soliman is now facing more than 100 charges, including murder and attempted first-degree murder, assault, attempted assault, using and attempting to use an incendiary device and animal cruelty. Some of the charges also come with crime of violence sentence enhancers.
    


            If convicted, Soliman faces life in prison without the possibility of parole for each of the murder charges in his state case. His preliminary hearing in the matter is scheduled for July 15.
    


            Soliman is being represented by the Colorado Office of the State Public Defender, which has a standing policy not to comment on criminal cases.
    


            Soliman is also facing federal hate crime charges related to the attack. He has pleaded not guilty to those charges. Additional federal charges could be brought against Soliman in the wake of Diamond's death but prosecutors have not yet decided whether to do so, a Justice Department official said.

Follow:


            More than 40 people have been killed in an Israeli airstrike that hit a cafe near the port in Gaza City, according to the head of the territory's largest hospital.
    


            Dr. Mohammad Abu Silmiya, the director of Al-Shifa hospital, said in an update on Monday night that at least 41 people had been killed and 75 injured in the strike.
    


            Videos geolocated by CNN show thick smoke rising from the scene as well as widespread damage to the cafe and the surrounding area. They also showed bodies being removed on stretchers.
    


            The Israel Defense Forces told CNN it was looking into the circumstances around the strike.
    


            The Al-Baqa cafe was a well-known spot for students, journalists and remote workers, as it offered internet and a place to work by the Mediterranean coast.
    


            Silmiya told CNN that “most of the casualties are women and children,” including many students who were at the cafe for internet access.
    


            He also said the hospital was short of ICU beds and anesthetics to treat the casualties. The death toll increased Monday night after some people died from their injuries.
    


            “We are treating the injured on the hospital floor as no rooms and hospital beds are available,” the hospital director added.
    


            Among those killed was a freelance journalist, Ismail Abu Hatab, according to other journalists at the scene.
    


            The Hamas-controlled Government Media Office said his death brought to 228 the number of journalists killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since October 2023.

MOSCOW, June 30. /TASS/. Russia is seeking to halt Western military training programs for Ukrainian troops; mass protests in Serbia turn violent; and the trade war between the US and China cools down. These stories topped Monday's newspaper headlines across Russia.

 

One of Russia's non-negotiables for a peace deal on Ukraine is that Western countries stop training Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel, Ambassador-at-Large of the Russian Foreign Ministry Rodion Miroshnik told Izvestia. The diplomat emphasized that the participation or complicity of other nations in the conflict must cease in any form. Large-scale training programs for Ukrainian soldiers were launched by London and Brussels in 2022, and nearly 130,000 individuals have undergone instruction over the past three years. Meanwhile, the demilitarization of Ukraine and the elimination of future threats from its territory remain among the stated objectives of the special military operation, as repeatedly underlined by President Vladimir Putin. Although experts believe the suspension of these training initiatives is unlikely in the near term, Russia will continue to pursue their termination.

""A comprehensive plan has been put forward by the Russian side, and undoubtedly, the involvement or complicity of other countries is a key issue that must be ended in all forms - including the supply of weapons and the training of Ukrainian militants. All of this constitutes direct participation in the conflict. A genuine demonstration of intent to resolve the situation would be the cessation of these programs,"" Miroshnik told Izvestia.

Currently, two major programs are in operation for training AFU soldiers in the West. The United Kingdom is conducting Operation Interflex, while Brussels is overseeing the training of Ukrainian military personnel through the European Union Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM). The United States is also participating by training Ukrainian troops at its bases in Germany, where they undergo accelerated instruction based on NATO standards to prepare for combat operations against Russia.

""Any support provided to Ukraine that enables it to continue hostilities or plan terrorist operations does not contribute to conflict resolution and constitutes a hostile act against Russia,"" Deputy Speaker of the Federation Council Konstantin Kosachev told Izvestia.

The actions of NATO and the UK show they are not interested in pursuing compromise or advancing negotiations on matters such as prisoner exchanges and the repatriation of bodies - processes that are already underway. Efforts to shift the situation are being met with hostility and new provocations, Chairman of the Federation Council Committee on Foreign Affairs Grigory Karasin told Izvestia.

 

On June 29, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic delivered a televised address to the nation following a large protest that took place the previous evening in the capital, which featured a number of violent incidents. According to official data from the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the protest drew 36,000 participants (independent observers estimated this figure at up to 140,000), roughly three times fewer than the largest protest in March. However, this time, clashes broke out between demonstrators and law enforcement officers. Analysts interviewed by Vedomosti warn that the protests in Serbia are becoming increasingly radicalized, raising concerns of a potential color revolution scenario fueled by internal frustrations and geopolitical narratives, even though the current movement may lack a unified direction.

The formal trigger for the new mass protest was Vucic's failure to comply by the end of June 28 with an ultimatum issued by students, who continue to demand an investigation into the November 2024 tragedy at the Novi Sad railway station and the dissolution of parliament. After the main protest came to a close, radicals wearing masks emerged among the disgruntled demonstrators, setting off flares and attacking the police with sticks and stones. In response, police used force and other crowd control measures, which the opposition used as evidence that the protest had taken a radical turn.

The latest protests were notably more aggressive with signs of increased pressure from demonstrators, deliberate provocations, and confrontations with security forces being clearly evident, and ultimately materializing, Program Manager at the Russian International Affairs Council Milan Lazovic told the newspaper.

According to the expert, the trend toward radicalization in Serbian protests is deeply concerning. If future demonstrations follow a similar violent trajectory, it could be a sign of an impending ""color revolution"" in Serbia. This process is fluid, with tactics being adapted to the evolving domestic political situation. For instance, under the pretext of fighting corruption, young people are being actively mobilized, while a ""Russian card"" is provocatively played, with some suggesting Vucic is betraying Russia. There is also intense speculation surrounding Kosovo, with claims that Vucic is ceding ground there as well and may soon formally recognize the region's independence.

Recently, protesters have appeared somewhat unorganized, lacking any clear objective, meaning there is currently no immediate threat to the government, Research Fellow at the Institute of International Studies at MGIMO University Anastasia Maleshevich said. Nonetheless, in the long term, public discontent will only grow, as the protest movement is rooted in substantial grievances and will not dissipate due to temporary setbacks, the expert asserted.

 

The trade deal reached between the United States and China following several rounds of negotiations does not signal a de-escalation of tensions between the two powers, but it does open the door for further discussions in a more mutually acceptable environment, Kommersant writes. According to official statements, the agreement enshrines a new baseline for tariff levels and likely entails the lifting of export restrictions on rare earth metals to the US and on ethane exports to China. The agreement itself will not be made public, and analysts remain cautious in assessing its specifics or the scale of mutual concessions. Despite a flurry of negotiations with numerous trade partners, Washington has not yet finalized deals with most of them. The US appears willing to wait for more favorable terms, thanks to its comparatively lower dependence on these countries.

According to Trump's statements, Washington's tariffs on Chinese goods will now be set at 55%, while Beijing's duties on American imports will stand at 10%. During the ""tariff race"" in April, mutual tariffs had soared to prohibitive levels - 145% on the US side and 125% on the Chinese side. ""The announced 55% US rate still requires clarification, analysts believe Trump may have factored in existing tariffs dating back to his first term into this new figure,"" the newspaper writes.

According to Kommersant, given that neither side has disclosed the full details of the agreement, analysts are reluctant to say who the better end of the deal. Judging by select official comments, the agreement appears to be a temporary measure designed to facilitate the continuation of negotiations wihout exposing either side to immediate risks from a further decline in trade volume. Both the US and China have acknowledged the significant economic damage inflicted when the trade war was at its peak.

President Trump has also indicated that Washington is working on several other trade agreements, including an imminent deal with New Delhi. According to Trump, the US aims to achieve the complete removal of trade barriers hindering American exports to India, and in return is prepared to reduce its own tariffs to a minimum. However, due to the general vagueness of most of Trump's remarks, it remains difficult to assess the likelihood of such a deal materializing.

 

Hungary has successfully secured a relaxation of US sanctions that had hindered the expansion of its Paks Nuclear Power Plant. Licenses for transactions related to nuclear energy have been granted, including to Gazprombank, which remains under US sanctions but was slated to participate in financing the 12.5 bln euro construction project. Experts interviewed by Kommersant believe that the project's implementation will boost Rosatom's reputation as a reliable international partner.

Russia and Hungary signed agreements in late 2014 for the construction of two new units based on VVER-1200 nuclear reactors at the existing Paks Nuclear Power Plant. The project is expected to more than double the plant's capacity to 4.4 GW. According to Rosatom, construction was originally scheduled to begin in 2024, but progress on the project had stalled.

Rosatom confirmed that the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has decided to exclude certain activities of Russian banks and insurance companies from financial sanctions, specifically for projects related to nuclear energy, including Paks II. ""This will allow us to move forward with the implementation of the project with our Hungarian partners under the current contract,"" the company said.

Sergey Rozhenko, Head of Energy Analytics at Kept, emphasized that the Paks II project is vital for Hungary's energy sector, as it will enable the country to produce up to 50% of its electricity independently of external suppliers. It is also significant for affirming Rosatom's standing as a dependable partner, and for demonstrating that Russia consistently fulfills its obligations, which is a particularly important quality in the nuclear industry.

""The US returning to a pragmatic approach is a welcome development. However, most sanctions remain in place, along with the informal self-censorship practiced by many companies. This has already spurred the development of alternative supply and financial chains, a process that now appears likely to be brought to completion,"" the expert noted.

 

At the beginning of the year, many considered the ruble to be overvalued. However, by the end of the first half of the year, the Russian currency not only failed to weaken but continued to appreciate. Currently, the interbank exchange rate for the US dollar stands at approximately 78.5 rubles, while the yuan is trading at 10.94 rubles on the Moscow Exchange. Market fluctuations have not impeded the ruble's Q2 rally, as it steadily approached the peaks of 2022 and even pre-pandemic levels. This trend has had a positive effect on inflation but a less favorable impact on the competitiveness of Russian exporters and the federal budget, Izvestia writes.

The ruble's strengthening in Q2 2025 occurred independently of external factors or macroeconomic performance. Despite the suspension of ceasefire discussions on Ukraine, oil prices remaining below last year's levels, and clear signs of an economic slowdown, the ruble maintained its upward trajectory. Against the yuan, the ruble gained 5% over the three-month period - a similar increase was observed relative to the US dollar.

Chief Economist at Gazprombank Pavel Biryukov told Izvestia, ""In our view, the current supportive factors, tight monetary policy and subdued demand for foreign currency, may begin to weaken in the second half of the year. This could lead the ruble to revert toward more sustainable levels. We project the ruble to reach 91-93 per dollar (12.5-12.7 per yuan) by the end of the third quarter, and to move into the range of 96-99 per dollar (13.4-13.7 per yuan) by year-end.""

Dmitry Vishnevsky, analyst at Tsifra Broker, also believes that the ruble is headed for depreciation in his take to the newspaper. ""By the end of Q3 2025, we expect the dollar-to-ruble exchange rate to be in the 78-80 range, close to current levels, due to strong foreign currency sales by exporters (up to 90% of revenues) and the Central Bank's high key interest rate (20%). However, by year-end, the ruble may weaken to 100-105 per dollar, driven by declining oil prices, rising imports, and potential monetary policy easing. We also foresee ruble depreciation against the yuan, with a forecast of 13-13.5 by year-end.""

Suspect charged with 12 hate-crime counts over attack as officials say Karen Diamond died from ‘severe injuries'

An 82-year-old Colorado woman who was injured in a molotov cocktail attack on demonstrators in support of Israeli hostages earlier in June has died, according to court documents filed on Monday.

Karen Diamond died as a result of “the severe injuries that she suffered in the attack”, Boulder county district attorney's office said in a statement. She died on Wednesday, according to the Boulder Jewish Community Center.

Diamond was among the people attacked while participating in a walk by Run for Their Lives, a group that advocates for the release of 50 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas since the 7 October 2023 attack.

The Boulder county district attorney's office announced that after Diamond's death, it is filing additional charges – including first-degree murder – against Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, an Egyptian man charged in the attack.

Soliman had previously been indicted on 12 hate crime counts in the 1 June attack in downtown Boulder. He was charged with trying to kill the eight people who were hurt when he threw molotov cocktails – bottles filled with flammable liquid that are ignited – as well as other people nearby.

He also allegedly injured one dog. Soliman has pleaded not guilty.

Soliman's attorney, David Kraut, entered the not guilty plea on Soliman's behalf during a hearing on Friday. Soliman was being represented by public defenders who typically do not comment on their cases to news media.

Investigators say Soliman told them he intended to kill the roughly 20 participants at the weekly demonstration on Boulder's Pearl Street pedestrian mall. But, they say, he threw just two of his over two dozen molotov cocktails while yelling: “Free Palestine.”

Michael Dougherty, the district attorney, said that the “horrific attack has now claimed the life of an innocent person who was beloved by her family and friends”.

Soliman, who is also being prosecuted in state court for attempted murder and other charges, told investigators he tried to buy a gun but was not able to because he was not a “legal citizen”.

Soliman did not speak during Friday's hearing, and he listened to translations provided by an Arabic interpreter through headphones.

The Egyptian national has been living in the US illegally with his family, according to federal authorities.

Soliman is reported to have been living in the US illegally with his family, and had posed a gardener and wore a construction vest to get close to the group before launching the attack, prosecutors allege. They say the victims were targeted because of their perceived or actual national origin.

An attack motivated by someone's political views is not considered a hate crime under federal law.

The attack attributed to Soliman came days after two employees at Israel's embassy in Washington DC were killed in a shooting incident outside the Capital Jewish museum. A suspect, Elias Rodriguez, 31, has been charged in the Washington DC attack, which is being investigated by the FBI as an act of targeted violence.

My youngest son attends a university in Taipei. Throughout the past two years, whenever I have brought him his luggage or picked him up for the end of a semester or the start of a break, I have stayed at a hotel near his campus. In doing so, I have noticed a strange phenomenon: The hotel's TV contained an unusual number of Chinese channels, filled with accents that would make a person feel as if they are in China. It is quite exhausting.

A few days ago, while staying in the hotel, I found that of the 50 available TV channels, six were Chinese — including China Central Television, several regional Chinese stations and a channel from Hong Kong. Three were news stations.

It is shocking that a major hotel in Taiwan would so openly provide Chinese TV channels and news stations, and in such disproportionate numbers. Meanwhile, several well-known and credible international news stations were absent from the hotel's offerings.

Taiwan claims to embrace globalization and has expressed aims to become a bilingual and international society, yet it is effectively isolating itself by locking its perspective into the framework of Chinese-produced television programs.

It is well-known that China does not have press freedom — its news stations are state-owned and operated, serving only to praise the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and lacking fair and objective reporting. In contrast, several news channels based in Taiwan take a clear, pro-China stance, often maliciously criticizing Taiwan's government, while reporting on China with yearning and admiration.

Such Taiwanese media — which specialize in discrediting Taiwan's democratic government and glorifying an authoritarian regime — in addition to Chinese news stations that aim to indoctrinate, have been made available for Taiwanese and foreign travelers' enjoyment. That would undoubtedly deal a serious blow to Taiwan's image of internationalization.

Taipei is a leading city, and as such, it should become a window into Taiwan for the international community. In addition to broadening the global perspective of Taiwanese, it should also serve as a benchmark city that allows foreign visitors to witness the level of the nation's internationalization.

However, judging by the selection of TV channels available at hotels in Taipei, it seems that there is instead self-restriction. Airing an excessive number of Chinese TV channels diminishes Taiwan's international standing.

Taiwan's hotels seem all too willing and eager to broadcast Chinese state-run news, generously helping the CCP promote itself and embellish its international image. It appears that, for Taipei to truly achieve internationalization, it should start by diversifying the TV channels offered in its hotels.

As tensions rise across both regions, the behavior of global powers, especially the US under the US President Donald Trump, signals how alliances, deterrence and rapid military mobilization could shape the outcomes of future conflicts. For Taiwan, facing increasing pressure and aggression from China, these lessons are both urgent and actionable.

A lieutenant colonel flying a U.S.-made F-16 fighter jet was killed during the overnight aerial strike while on duty, the Air Force said on June 29. 

Russia launched a ""massive"" missile and drone strike across Ukraine early on June 29, unleashing 537 aerial targets, including 477 drones and 60 missiles, according to the Air Force.. 

Maksym Ustymenko, born in 1993, was killed after shooting down seven aerial targets, the Air Force said in a statement. The Air Force added that his aircraft was damaged while he was trying to shoot down the last one, losing altitude and crashing.

""Maksym Ustymenko did his best to take the plane away from the settlement, but did not have time to eject,"" the Air Force said on Telegram, honoring that he died ""like a hero."" 

""The work of Ukrainian pilots is extremely dangerous and risky, both when striking enemy ground targets and repelling air attacks,"" the Air Force added, saying that the F-16 pilots destroy dozens of Shahed-type drones. 

In his evening address, President Volodymyr Zelensky posthumously awarded Ustymenko with the Hero of Ukraine award. 

""Today, he was killed defending our skies and our people from yet another massive Russian attack... It is painful to lose people like him,"" Zelensky said in offering condolence to loved ones.

Russia has intensified its aerial campaign on Kyiv and other cities over the past month. Zelensky said that Russia has launched over 2,700, or roughly 9.5%, of the total number of Shahed-type drones deployed during the entire full-scale war in June alone. 

Though well protected with Western air defense systems compared to other cities, Kyiv has also faced a number of deadly attacks in June, with the June 17 missile and drone strike on Kyiv killing 30.  

 The Air Force said that Ukraine had to use ""all available means"" to repel the Russian aerial attack overnight on June 29, including elite F-16 jets. 

Ukraine received its first batch of F-16 jets in the summer of 2024, but it has not revealed many details about how and where they are used in operations since they are a high-priority target for Moscow. Their pilots have received months of training abroad. ","{'href': 'https://kyivindependent.com', 'title': 'The Kyiv Independent'}","world"

Prime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 in June. Canada and the U.S. are set to restart trade talks after Canada removed a tax on digital services that had angered Mr. Trump.Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press

Prime Minister Mark Carney “caved” to Donald Trump when he told the U.S. President during a Sunday phone call he would be scrapping Canada's digital services tax on foreign tech giants, the White House said Monday.

Karoline Leavitt, Mr. Trump's chief spokeswoman, told a press briefing Monday that Mr. Carney telephoned Mr. Trump to inform him that Ottawa would be cancelling the tax, two days after Mr. Trump threatened to walk away from trade talks and impose retaliatory tariffs over the levy, and one day before the first payment of the tax was meant to be collected.

“It's very simple: Prime Minister Carney and Canada caved to President Trump and the United States of America,” Ms. Leavitt said. “The President made his position quite clear to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister called the President last night to let the President know that he would be dropping that tax.”

Mr. Carney, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said that talks between Canada and the United States on ending a damaging four-month trade war resumed Monday morning.

Explainer: Canada cancelled its digital services tax. What was it and why did the U.S. hate it?

He did not respond to a question about the “caved” comments and declined to explain what Canada received in return for scrapping the digital sales tax that targeted foreign tech giants, chiefly U.S.-based companies including Amazon, Google, Meta, Airbnb and Uber.

Mr. Carney said the DST was part of “broader negotiations” with the United States and adding it would have to been inefficient to charge firms and then end up refunding the levy later. “it doesn't make sense to collect tax from people and then remit them, remit them back.”

Ms. Leavitt said Canada's move, for which the U.S. conceded nothing in exchange in the trade talks, showed that Mr. Trump “knows how to negotiate” and “every country on the planet needs to have good trade relationships with the United States.”

“It was a mistake for Canada to vow to implement that tax, that would have hurt our tech companies here in the United States,” she said, adding that Ottawa's concession is “a big victory for our tech companies.”

Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, confirmed to Fox News on Monday morning that Canada-U.S. trade talks will restart.

“Oh, absolutely,” he said, when asked if the two sides would immediately resume negotiations. 

It was only late Sunday, hours before the first digital services tax payments were due, that Mr. Carney's government announced it was scrapping the levy.

Mr. Hassett said Mr. Trump raised the DST with Mr. Carney at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., earlier this month. The President then threatened on Friday that, if the tax remained in place, he would break off trade talks and impose more tariffs on Canada in seven days.

“One of the things that the President asked for,” at the G7, Mr. Hassett said, “was that they would take the DST tax off. It's something that they've studied, now they've agreed to and, for sure, that means that we can get back to the negotiations.”

The tax, which would have imposed a three-per-cent levy on digital services by major tech companies, was passed by Canada last year with the first payments due to be collected June 30.

University of Ottawa professor Michael Geist said Canada came out of this exchange with Mr. Trump looking weak.

Robyn Urback: The digital services tax was bad policy, but killing it now makes us look terribly weak

Prof. Geist said the digital sales tax was a “real card with billions of dollars in tax revenue” and Canada should have kept it in reserve.

He said Ottawa should have announced it was delaying implementation of the DST while it was conducting trade talks with the United States.

Instead, the federal government ended up cancelling the tax in order to get back to the table.

By scrapping the DST now, Canada has “given up what was a non-trivial card and they basically used it to get back exactly where they were a week ago,” Prof. Geist said.

Canada and the U.S. are in negotiations towards a trade and security deal as Mr. Carney aims to have Mr. Trump's tariffs removed. 

In an interview with Radio Canada Monday, Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne played down the scrapping of the DST. He said it was always a “transitional measure” introduced because a global pact on taxation of tech giants not been reached. Talks will continue on a global measure, he said.

Canada faces tariffs of 50 per cent on steel and aluminum exported to the U.S., 25 per cent on autos, as well as blanket tariffs on all other goods exported outside the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA.)

At the G7, Mr. Trump and Mr. Carney set a deadline of July 21 to finish the deal.

After that, there may be a further renegotiation of the USMCA.

Lifespans, traditions and societal expectations have all changed yet the transition from adolescence to adulthood remains rigid.Isabella Falsetti/The Globe and Mail

Guy Stecklov is a demographer in the Department of Sociology and a faculty affiliate of the Stone Centre for Wealth and Income Inequality at the University of British Columbia.

Canada faces two profound challenges. The first is well-documented: our aging population and its implications for public finances, health care and labour supply. The second remains less visible but equally urgent: a developmental crisis among our youth, driven by technological disruption and a dangerous mismatch between modern life and the institutions meant to guide young people toward adulthood. 

The solution lies in recognizing these as interconnected opportunities, rather than separate problems. As an innovative solution for these difficult times, Canada should institute a universal civic gap year for all youth.

The average Canadian life span is now 81 years, which is about 50-per-cent longer than a century ago. This triumph of development and public health has fundamentally altered life's rhythm. We marry later, if at all, have children later or remain childless, and retire later. Yet one crucial stage has remained relatively rigid for nearly half a century: the transition from adolescence to adulthood. High school still ends at 17 or 18, post-secondary studies begin immediately, and most youth enter the work force by their early twenties, with a small fraction delaying due to graduate schooling. 

University, college or learning a trade? For today's students, the choice isn't so simple

This rigid timeline increasingly fails our young people. Growing research by psychologists such as Jonathan Haidt and Jean Twenge reveals a mental health crisis fuelled by social media, online gaming, declining exposure to healthy risk-taking and unstructured play, and a wholesale erosion of real-world interactions. Youth reach traditional milestones – graduation, university entrance – at almost the same ages as previous generations, but with dramatically diminished developmental readiness. Rising anxiety, stalled motivation, and difficulty forming adult identities are the visible symptoms of a deeper structural problem.

Canada should create a universal, publicly supported civic gap year – a new developmental stage between high school and post-secondary education or full-time employment. This wouldn't be a break from life or a luxury vacation, but a formative experience designed to support social, emotional, and civic development while channelling youthful energy into meaningful community, provincial and national priorities.

Civic gap year participants might serve in schools, long-term care facilities, community health organizations, environmental and sustainability projects, housing initiatives and other areas of public need. This service would help young people build essential social and practical skills, meet other Canadians from across the country, and reflect on their place in society. These real-world interactions and experiences have become increasingly absent for many youth across Canada and from many Western societies. 

The program could offer multiple pathways, including a potential voluntary military track that would benefit Canada's chronically understaffed armed forces. Academic and trade-school credits could provide youth from disadvantaged communities with opportunities to catch up to their more privileged peers. 

Operationally, the program would be administered federally but delivered locally through partnerships with provinces, municipalities and non-profit organizations. Participants would receive modest living stipends, housing support where needed, and educational credits or tuition subsidies, ensuring accessibility regardless of family income.

Young adults increasingly find their best financial move is to live with their parents – is that bad?

This investment would yield dividends far beyond individual development. In an era of rising polarization and social fragmentation, building civic identity and trust among young people is vital to democratic health. A shared year of service offers a powerful mechanism for cultivating common purpose and social cohesion across backgrounds, regions and perspectives. 

The economic benefits would be substantial. Youth would contribute meaningful labour to understaffed sectors while developing skills and networks that enhance their long-term productivity. Society would benefit from their service while investing in more capable, connected citizens. 

Critics might argue that Canada cannot afford such a program. But the reality is that we cannot afford to complacently march ahead in these threatening and unsettling times. The costs of youth mental health crises, social fragmentation and developmental delays far exceed the investment required for structured civic service. Moreover, extending the human lifespan by decades while ignoring the need to reconsider the transition to adulthood is short-sighted. Adolescents and young adults continue to march through a rigid series of educational transitions that have changed little in terms of timing and duration. This inflexibility is surprising given that these young adults have so many more years to expect to live after schooling completion, and in spite of altered patterns of development among youth and young adults. 

We've made dramatic progress increasing the lifespan of Canadians. Now is an essential moment to strengthen the pathways that lead young people into productive adulthood. A civic gap year represents more than policy innovation – it's a national commitment to developing youth not just as future workers, but as engaged citizens capable of meeting the challenges of an increasingly complex world.

Jon Bon Jovi is standing in the way of a mystery buyer and one of the biggest real estate deals in US history.

The American rock star is the last obstacle to an anonymous client who has been quietly assembling one of the most valuable private estates in the country.

So far, the unnamed buyer, whose identity is a closely guarded secret, has paid roughly $250 million (£182 million) for four separate homes in Florida's Palm Beach – and is pushing for more.

The mystery investor wants the $42 million (£31 million) mansion belonging to Bon Jovi, who has resisted staggering overtures to sell his property, people familiar with the situation told the Wall Street Journal.

Palm Beach is a sought-after address for the US and international elite. Possible buyers suggested by estate agents include Bill Gates and the Microsoft-linked billionaires Steve Ballmer and Charles Simonyi.

“The buyer is looking for privacy and safety, and they want to be comfortable within their four walls. And as a result of that they buy their neighbours,” Dana Koch, a local agent of the Corcoran Group, told The Telegraph.

Bon Jovi's home would be the fifth separate property to be added to a growing assemblage on the exclusive North Ocean Boulevard.

The properties, which are five miles from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, so far include two ocean-front lots previously owned by William Lauder, the billionaire cosmetics heir.

Mr Lauder is said to have listed them for a combined $200 million (£146 million) in 2023 before they were sold for an undisclosed figure earlier this year.

In early June, the same deep-pocketed buyer paid $18 million (£13 million) for the Mediterranean-style house across the street.

The sellers, retired attorney Thomas Harvey and media executive Cathleen Black, had purchased it for $4.25 million (£3.1 million) in 2018, according to the Wall Street Journal. Mr Harvey is said to have been unaware of the identity of the buyer.

Then, earlier this week, the property next door to the former Harvey home sold for $30 million (£22 million) to a limited company tied to the same buyer. The same property, around half an acre, sold for around $5.25 million (£3.83 million) in 2017.

“They are what we call ‘make-me-move prices',” Mr Koch added. “They're significantly above the market, so you're going to be open to having that conversation.”

The property market in Palm Beach has been on an unprecedented upswing since 2020, with record deal after record deal.

The area's luxury lifestyle, pristine beaches and exclusivity have attracted wealthy buyers at home and abroad, especially those relocating from high-tax states like New York.

The accumulation of seafront properties and the buying out of neighbours is not unusual for the tropical safe haven, yet it is the mystery around the buyer that has garnered attention.

Ken Griffin, the enigmatic financier, turned heads with his plans to build the most expensive home on earth, a $1 billion (£730 million) mega-estate.

He has spent more than $400 million (£292 million) since 2012 to piece together an ocean front compound in Palm Beach.

A person close to the Gates Foundation told the Wall Street Journal that Mr Gates was not the mystery buyer. Bon Jovi was contacted for comment.

The upset victory of the Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani over the centrist veteran Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic mayoral primary New York City has many on the Left seeing the dawn of a new socialist era. But the election results show that the real class conflict in the Big Apple is not between the Haves and the Have-Nots, but between the Haves and the Have-Mores.

Some factors in this election are unique to New York's ethnic mix. Mamdani won the Hispanic vote, perhaps thanks to a backlash against Donald Trump's deportation policies, and as the first potential South Asian mayor of New York City (born in Uganda, he is of Indian descent) he did well among Asian New Yorkers, particularly Muslims.

What about income? The richest and poorest New Yorkers voted against him, as did the black middle class and working class. Mamdani's base is what has jokingly been called “the Commie Corridor” in Brooklyn and part of Queens, where young white progressives have created a bohemian culture similar to that of college towns. Mamdani also did well among affluent New Yorkers in the tier below the very rich, as Michael Lange has pointed out in The New York Times: “In tony, liberal neighbourhoods like Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, known for their tree-lines streets and multimillion-dollar brownstones, Mr Mamdani trounced Mr Cuomo by more than 35 points.”

The claim that Mamdani won by campaigning on the issue of “affordability” is hard to reconcile with the fact that he did better among upper-middle-class white voters than among working-class and middle-class black voters. But the definition of “affordability” is subjective. Young hipsters in Brooklyn and affluent professionals in Manhattan may make more money than black janitors in the Bronx or white nurses' aides in Queens, but they feel that they are poor, because they have champagne tastes on beer budgets.

Metropolitan professionals are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the super-rich, whether as employees of major business, finance, law, and media firms, as nonprofit staffers or professors whose institutions depend on the charitable giving of the wealthy, or as civil servants in cities that depend on taxing a small number of wealthy individuals and enterprises. Nevertheless, as I can attest, having lived in Manhattan for half a decade in the 1990s, many professionals seethe with envy of the rich.

Even a six-figure income may not enable academics, journalists, nonprofit staffers, lawyers, or doctors to afford a townhouse on the Upper West Side, a weekend place in the Hamptons, or a cook and a French au pair. According to a recent study by SmartAsset, to “live comfortably” in New York City a family with two children needs $318,406, more than £231,000, while a single individual needs an annual income of $138,570, compared to $75,000 for a single in Houston, Texas. No wonder New York is losing residents to Texas.

The division between the metropolitan rich and metropolitan professionals plays out on multiple fronts: housing, transit, and domestic help. In cities like New York, even professionals making a few hundred thousand dollars a year cannot afford to buy one of the townhouses or luxury condos they covet in nice neighbourhoods. Instead, they are forced to pay crazy rents in order not to suffer the indignity of living far from Manhattan and commuting for an hour or more each day like lowly proles. The rich can Uber or Lyft their way everywhere, but that is costly for merely affluent professionals who may be forced to endure the forecast of hell that is the New York City subway system.

But the biggest divide between the rich and the affluent has to do with servants. Truly rich households in America tend to be one-earner couples, in which the man is the sole breadwinner and the wife doesn't work (at least for wages; it can be exhausting to bark orders at the help all day). And in a reversal of the pattern for most of the last century, rich American women are now having more children than less affluent women in the US.

In contrast, the typical professional-class household in cities like New York consists of two college-educated professionals, both of whom must work so that their joint income allows them to eke out a barely-comfortable existence in one of the priciest places on earth. If they have children, they must rely on paid child care.

The truly rich can afford to pay Mary Poppins along with Jeeves quite well. But metropolitan professional households with children and two full-time working parents with professional careers cannot afford to spend much on nannies and maids. They may be progressive in their attitudes toward trans rights and DEI, but professional couples in big cities rely on a pool of low-wage, mostly foreign-born domestic workers who can be paid low wages in cash, with no payroll taxes, no benefits and no retirement security.

This explains the panic among metropolitan professionals caused by Trump's deportations. Every illegal immigrant in the US could be deported and the rich in Manhattan and elsewhere could still afford not only maids and nannies but also drivers, tutors, personal shoppers, dog walkers, butlers, and personal yoga instructors, if they chose. But without cheap illegal immigrant labour, the precarious finances of many two-earner professional couples would collapse.

One way to keep the wages of menial servants low enough for professional households to afford them is to let taxpayers pick up the tab for many of their expenditures. The public grocery stores in New York City proposed by Mamdani are for the nannies and maids and Uber drivers – not their professional class and rich employers, who will continue to shop at upscale stores like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's. Better yet, if the maid can drop her children off at a publicly-funded daycare centre on the way to clean the professional couple's apartment, the taxpayer's assumption of her childcare costs makes it easier for her to survive on her paltry wages.

To be sure, Mamdani has proposed raising the minimum wage in New York City to $30 an hour. But everyone knows that is not going to happen, making it safe for progressive New Yorkers to pay lip service to high wages and unions while paying their menial servants in cash off the books in the black market for labour.

In this way, the benefits of cheap labour for elites are privatised while the costs are socialised. A century ago in the US, the non-Marxist crusade in favour of municipal ownership of water and electric utilities was called “sewer socialism”. The 21st century Left has come up with something new: “servant socialism”.

Whether Mamdani can be elected mayor of New York City remains to be seen. But the intra-elite class dynamic seen in the Democratic primary will continue to be played out in New York and other plutocratic cities around the globe. What drives it is the desire of the ambitious professional-class Haves to live like the truly rich Have-Mores – at taxpayer expense, if that can be arranged.

The deadly aid site protocol is called “Operation Salted Fish,” the Israeli name for the children's game.

Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size.

Israeli soldiers are ordered to treat crowds of Palestinians gathered to receive humanitarian aid in Gaza as a “hostile force” and communicate with the desperate aid seekers by opening fire, according to a new report citing soldiers who were deployed in Gaza.

Haaretz, echoing reporting by Palestinians and humanitarian groups on the ground, reports that Israeli soldiers are told to shoot at crowds to prevent them from approaching an aid site before it's open. The fact that they are civilians doesn't matter, soldiers say, and military leaders pay no mind as to whether or not civilians are killed as a result.

The military uses “everything imaginable” to fire on the crowds, including heavy machine guns, tanks, grenades, and mortars, one soldier said, referring to the area around the U.S.- and Israel-backed “aid” sites as a “killing field.”

Get the latest news and thought-provoking analysis from Truthout.

“At night, we open fire to signal to the population that this is a combat zone and they mustn't come near,” one officer said, describing the supposed security practices for the site. “Once, the mortars stopped firing, and we saw people starting to approach. So we resumed fire to make it clear they weren't allowed to. In the end, one of the shells landed on a group of people.” 

The protocol, one soldier said, is called “Operation Salted Fish,” a reference to the Israeli name for the children's game, “red light, green light.” 

Indeed, Palestinian officials and journalists have repeatedly reported Israel hitting crowds with tank fire and other heavy weapons, often causing hundreds of casualties at once, on a near-daily basis.​​ Israeli forces have killed at least 583 Palestinians and injured 4,186 more at sites operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the Gaza Ministry of Health has reported.

In some instances, soldiers are supposedly also firing at crowds near “aid” sites in order to protect private contractors who are demolishing homes in Gaza nearby. Sources said private contractors are “making a fortune” by demolishing homes in Gaza, with the government paying out the equivalent of $1,500 per home. 

The Israeli military has claimed that they are simply firing “warning shots” at aid seekers. However, even if this were a legitimate practice, it seems to be yet another coverup from the military as soldiers say they've been instructed to open fire directly on civilians. 

Soldiers say that this and other practices have made Gaza into a combat zone unlike any other, where there are no rules about who constitutes a legitimate target or whether or not there are instances where soldiers should restrain from fire. Because of the lack of any guidelines or restraints, not only is live fire toward civilians allowed, it's effectively encouraged, soldiers said.

“Technically, it's supposed to be warning fire — either to push people back or stop them from advancing,” one reserve tank soldier told Haaretz. “But lately, firing shells has just become standard practice. Every time we fire, there are casualties and deaths, and when someone asks why a shell is necessary, there's never a good answer. Sometimes, merely asking the question annoys the commanders.”

This practice, of seemingly using the “aid” sites as a honeytrap, comes after Israel has spent the last 20 months systematically starving Palestinians in Gaza, pushing the entire territory into or on the cusp of famine, experts have said. 

“The moral aspect is practically nonexistent,” said one military figure, who recently attended a higher-level meeting within the military. “No one stops to ask why dozens of civilians looking for food are being killed every day.”

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump will visit a new immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades on Tuesday for what's expected to be the site's official opening, showcasing what critics are condemning as an inhumane makeshift prison camp and what supporters are embracing as a national model for aggressively ramping up detention and deportation efforts.

Florida officials have raced to erect the compound of heavy-duty tents, trailers and temporary buildings in a matter of days, as part of the state's muscular efforts to help carry out Trump's immigration crackdown.

The facility is located at an isolated airfield about 45 miles (72 kilometers) west of downtown Miami and is surrounded by swamps filled with mosquitoes, pythons and alligators. Dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” by state officials, supporters say the reference to the notorious federal prison and the harshness of the conditions at the facility are meant to be a deterrent.

“There's really nowhere to go. If you're housed there, if you're detained there, there's no way in, no way out,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said in an interview with conservative media commentator Benny Johnson.

Here's what to know.




Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis confirmed on Monday that Trump will attend what's expected to be the official opening of the facility, which is estimated to cost $450 million a year. The expenses are to be incurred by Florida and reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, a U.S. official said.

“When the president comes tomorrow, he's going to be able to see,” DeSantis told reporters. He added that “I think by tomorrow, it'll be ready for business.”

The governor, who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the Republican presidential nomination last year, said he spoke with Trump over the weekend. He also said the site obtained approval from the Department of Homeland Security.

The site's remoteness hasn't stopped hundreds of environmentalists and immigrant advocates from coming to protest what they say is a cruel political stunt that will threaten the treasured and ecologically sensitive wetlands.

State officials say the installation, which could ultimately house 5,000 detainees, is critical to support Trump's mass deportation agenda, which has resulted in a record-high number of detentions, totaling more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019. 

State officials have commandeered the land using emergency powers, under a years-old executive order issued by DeSantis during the administration of then-President Joe Biden to respond to what the governor deemed a crisis caused by illegal immigration.

Florida has raced ahead with the construction on county-owned land over the concerns of local officials, activists and Native American tribal leaders who consider the area sacred.

By relying on executive orders, the state is able to sidestep purchasing laws and fast-track the project, which critics have said amounts to an abuse of power.

The orders grant sweeping authority to the state's head of emergency management, Kevin Guthrie, including the power to suspend “any statute, rule, or order” seen as slowing the response to the emergency, and the ability to place select law enforcement personnel from across the state under his “direct command and coordination.”

“Governor DeSantis has insisted that the state of Florida, under his leadership, will facilitate the federal government in enforcing immigration law,” a DeSantis spokesperson said in a statement.

“Florida will continue to lead on immigration enforcement.”

Immigrant advocates, environmental activists and Native Americans advocating for their ancestral homelands held a protest near the airstrip Saturday.

Hundreds of demonstrators lined part of U.S. Highway 41 that slices through the marshy Everglades — also known as Tamiami Trail — as dump trucks hauling construction materials lumbered into the airfield. Cars passing by honked in support as protesters waved signs calling for the protection of the expansive preserve that is home to Native communities and endangered species.

In Big Cypress National Preserve, where the airstrip is located, 15 traditional Miccosukee and Seminole villages, as well as burial grounds and ceremonial sites, remain.

Worries about environmental impacts have also been at the forefront, prompting the Center for Biological Diversity and the Friends of the Everglades to file a lawsuit Friday to halt the detention center plans.

U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem has applauded the effort and the agency's “partnership with Florida.” 

“We are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal aliens,” said Noem in a written statement provided to the AP. 

The facility is meant to help the Trump administration reach its goal of more than doubling its existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds.

A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation bill approved last month by the U.S. House of Representatives includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation.

A U.S. official said immigrants arrested by Florida law enforcement officers under the federal 287 (g) program will be held at the facility, as well as immigrants in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Under the revived 287 (g) program, local and state law enforcement officers can interrogate immigrants in their custody and detain them for potential deportation.

Agencies across all 67 Florida counties have signed more than 280 such agreements, more than a third of the 720 agreements ICE have reached nationwide.

'Hannity' panelists Matt Towery and Robert Cahaly discuss the American people's thoughts U.S. strikes on Iran.

U.S. women's soccer legend Abby Wambach admitted in a recent podcast interview that President Donald Trump and his administration are ""geniuses"" in at least one thing.

Wambach, along with author Glennon Doyle, opened up about what she called a ""complicated"" relationship with the U.S. and lamented that Trump and his officials were able to get their voters to rally and elect him as president once again in 2024.

She spoke to MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace on her ""Best People"" podcast.

""I think about it from a team perspective, because I have so much experience being in a community of a team,"" Wambach explained. ""And being a person who represented this country, and I consider myself very patriotic in many ways, and yet my relationship with my country is very complicated because of all the things that go on inside our administration, the things that we are seeing.

""But I do believe that one of the things that Trump and the administration are geniuses at is getting people to believe they are a part of this community. This community piece, allows people to not pay attention to every little thing. They're stoking them in a way that keeps them believing that they are part of something that is good even if there are some consequences that are happening in order to get to this. Like it is like the ends justifies the means in some way.""

Wambach said that when someone is trying to develop so-called ""team culture,"" what Trump and his administration have done in that development is a ""very smart way to do it.""

However, Wambach believes some Trump supporters are having second thoughts.

""I think that you are seeing some folks going, ‘Wait a second I didn't sign up for all of this,' and that is laughable to me because he wasn't hiding the playbook. They just didn't believe, I think part of them probably felt like, ‘Oh the playbook is just like that is just never going to happen, right like that is too far down that is never going to happen. Let's just get him in office he is a good businessman.' I also think there is probably a sector of people that are like, ‘Yeah we want all of this stuff to happen.'

""There is, I think there is a smaller version, but I do think some of the folks that voted for him are probably questioning their vote and also embarrassed to go back on it. It is once you get entrenched in that community, it's like if you get out where do you go, it is almost like there is no place for folks who actually want to jump ship to land because they can't see themselves in all of our world.""

Trump touted his poll numbers earlier this month, saying his approval rating was ""the highest it's ever been.""

Carson Branstine was already a fan favorite before she entered the first round of Wimbledon against the top-ranked women's tennis player in the world, Aryna Sabalenka.

Branstine, of Canada, starred at Texas A&M and helped the Aggies to a national championship before she turned pro. She was able to make the final bracket for Wimbledon after she tore through the qualifying rounds, defeating one-time U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu, Raluca Georgiana Serban and Lois Boisson.

However, what captured the attention of social media before the match against Sabalenka was her status as a fashion model. Branstine is signed with Wilhelmina Models and the Neal Hamil Agency.

She opened up about funding her tennis dreams through modeling in an interview with reporters ahead of Wimbledon earlier this month.

""I wasn't signed by these agencies because of my tennis — it was for my look. Modeling and tennis are weirdly similar – you are an object a lot, and people sometimes forget you're a person too.""

While Branstine fell to Sabalenka in straight sets, she gave the Belarusian a run for her money in the second set, losing 7-5.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:washingtonexaminer.com","DOJ charges hundreds of people in $14.6 billion healthcare fraud takedown","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3458120/hundreds-charged-doj-largest-healthcare-fraud-takedown/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:51:01 GMT","

The Justice Department on Monday announced charges for 324 people, including nearly 100 medical professionals, in what the DOJ called the largest healthcare fraud takedown in U.S. history.

The $14.6 billion crackdown spanned all 50 states and included charges ranging from opioid trafficking and telemedicine fraud to transnational identity theft schemes. Of the total charged, 77 defendants were prosecuted by state attorneys general, while the remaining 247 face federal charges. Authorities said they seized over $245 million in cash, luxury vehicles, cryptocurrency, and other assets.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said the takedown “delivers justice to criminal actors who prey upon our most vulnerable citizens and steal from hardworking American taxpayers.”

The healthcare fraud bust under President Donald Trump and his appointees marks a major step above efforts by the Justice Department under the Biden administration, which uncovered $2.75 billion in false claims last year, resulting in 193 defendants charged.

The announcement came as Senate Republicans advanced the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a sweeping tax and spending package that proposes major changes to Medicaid reimbursements. All GOP senators except Sens. Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Rand Paul (R-KY) voted to move the bill forward. Tillis, who announced Sunday he would not seek reelection, warned the legislation would make “devastating” changes to Medicaid.

As Washington fights over how to reform Medicaid, the DOJ's bust hinted at the scale of criminal abuse of the healthcare system.

“These criminals didn't just steal someone else's money — they stole from you,” said Matthew Galeotti, head of the DOJ's Criminal Division. “This is not healthcare. It is a staggering breach of trust.”

Among the major alleged schemes was a transnational criminal ring accused of submitting $10.6 billion in fraudulent Medicare claims using the stolen identities of over 1 million U.S. residents.

In Arizona, a United Arab Emirates-based billing company allegedly defrauded Medicaid of $650 million, targeting Native American and homeless patients for addiction treatment scams.

State attorneys general also played a significant role. In Indiana, Attorney General Todd Rokita, a Republican, announced charges in 13 cases, including hospice workers and nurses accused of stealing drugs from dying patients. “We have zero tolerance for those who abuse this lifeline for Hoosiers,” Rokita said.

Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz said a new “fraud war room” would deploy artificial intelligence tools and prepayment reviews to detect fraud before money is released.

“We're stopping stolen taxpayer money from leaving the door,” Oz said.

Officials said that the department's goal going forward is to be proactive, not reactive, in an effort to stymie perpetrators' attempts to steal taxpayer-funded healthcare dollars before they're in the hands of criminals.","{'href': 'https://www.washingtonexaminer.com', 'title': 'Washington Examiner'}","national"

And they need to look elsewhere for constitutional change.

The Supreme Court delivered a string of major losses for liberal Americans in recent weeks. Two in particular stand out: In United States v. Skrmetti, the Court's conservative majority upheld a state law outlawing minors' access to puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. In Mahmoud v. Taylor, the justices created a new constitutional entitlement for religious parents to shield their children from learning about LGBTQ people in public schools.

Defeats like these have become the norm since Donald Trump jolted the Court rightward. For many progressives, the narrative is straightforward: Ambitious, doctrinaire, Republican-appointed justices are systematically dismantling liberal precedents over the impassioned but impotent dissents of their Democratic-appointed colleagues.

This account accurately captures the speed, scope, and partisanship of the Court's conservative counterrevolution. Yet it obscures a difficult truth: Progressive lawyers paved the road to these losses. Rulings such as those in Skrmetti and Mahmoud are the predictable consequences of liberal litigation strategies that invite a hostile Court to codify an agenda that the Court's conservative majority was handpicked to establish.  The Supreme Court cannot act without cases. It cannot initiate litigation. To reshape doctrine in the ways the justices want, they depend on litigants to bring suits to them. Both of these cases represent unforced errors; liberal lawyers chose to fight for ideas the justices were explicitly appointed to oppose. Poorly chosen liberal challenges are a gift to a conservative majority eager to recast constitutional law.

Paul Rosenzweig: The Supreme Court's inconsistency is very revealing

Progressive lawyers need a strategic recalibration, something I argue in a forthcoming Cornell Law Review article. They need to stop reflexively turning to federal courts, and especially the Supreme Court. Avoiding high-risk, high-profile litigation in inhospitable forums does not mean abandoning constitutional advocacy. It means redirecting that advocacy toward the democratic arenas of constitutional politics, such as legislatures, ballot initiatives, grassroots organizing, and the broader public square. In these spaces, progressives can build popular support, blunt the impact of adverse rulings, and shape the constitutional culture that, over time, influences judicial doctrine itself.

The Skrmetti case began in April 2023, when the American Civil Liberties Union sued Tennessee to block the state from banning certain treatments of gender dysphoria for minors. (I'd worked at the ACLU as a legal fellow a year earlier but had no involvement in the case.) After an initial trial-court victory for the liberal plaintiffs, the state appealed the decision to the Sixth Circuit. That court overturned the lower court's decision and upheld the ban.

The ACLU could have accepted this regional setback. The Sixth Circuit's decisions bind just four states—Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Although the outcome was surely painful for the plaintiffs, the ruling did not overturn other lower-court decisions protecting transgender rights that had been decided in other states. Declining to appeal need not constitute an endorsement of the decision. Rather, it would have reflected a pragmatic assessment that the Court's conservative justices were more likely to amplify than alleviate harm.

Instead, the ACLU (later joined by the Biden administration) petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case. The Court's conservative majority obliged and accepted the case for full review in June 2024. The decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts earlier this month, which was joined by all of his fellow Republican appointees, is the unhappy result.  In concrete terms, the decision allows states with previously blocked bans to seek their restoration, and emboldens states without bans to enact them, assured of constitutional cover. Yet when the Supreme Court adjudicates, it does more than resolve a dispute between two parties. It shapes the trajectory of constitutional interpretation and political contestation. Its rulings influence not just courts and legislatures but also public discourse and perception. By affirming the result and much of the rationale of the Sixth Circuit—and condoning the open animus toward transgender people voiced by Tennessee lawmakers—the Court didn't merely uphold one type of law. It radiated anti-transgender sentiment in explicit constitutional doctrine and the wider constitutional culture that shapes politics, law, and public dialogue.

Legally, Skrmetti deprives transgender advocates of a key sex-discrimination argument and signals to lower courts that the highest court takes a skeptical view of transgender-rights claims made under equal-protection law. Politically, it encourages Republican officials to pursue even more restrictive laws targeting transgender people. Attorney General Pam Bondi and other Trump-administration figures praised the ruling and vowed to escalate their crackdown on transgender rights, including access to gender-affirming care treatments for minors in blue states.

Justice Amy Coney Barrett's Skrmetti concurrence—joined in full by Justice Clarence Thomas and substantively endorsed by Justice Samuel Alito—goes further in inviting discrimination against transgender people. Before oral argument, some progressives had hoped that Barrett would serve as a swing vote to strike down the law. Instead, she staked out a position even more extreme than the majority opinion, writing that transgender people do not qualify as a suspect or quasi-suspect class under the equal-protection clause.  Her reasoning, if embraced by lower courts, would uphold sweeping discriminatory policies targeting transgender adults—such as bans on receiving gender-affirming care and using public facilities—under the guise of “legitimate regulatory policy.” And it telegraphs to lawmakers agitating for more aggressive attacks on transgender people that the Court will not stand in their way.

Advocates should know that this is a risk they are taking. Supreme Court justices have little stopping them from addressing unraised issues and disturbing unrelated precedent. The Roberts Court has made something of a habit of doing so, with its conservative justices frequently reaching to decide questions not before them. In Skrmetti, instead of merely applying precedent on the appropriate standard for evaluating Tennessee's law and then remanding to the Sixth Circuit for further proceedings, the conservative majority decided the law's constitutionality outright—an aggressive and unnecessary move.  That this was totally avoidable underscores that liberal advocates would be wise to refrain from channeling long-shot cases to unsympathetic courts—not just the Supreme Court but many federal appellate courts as well, which are filled with ideologically vetted conservative judges from the previous Trump term. Even if liberals do occasionally win at appellate courts, those victories can prove Pyrrhic, setting up conservatives with a fast track to the Supreme Court.

Mahmoud v. Taylor offers a cautionary tale of initial liberal wins turning into bigger defeats. After adding books with LGBTQ characters and themes to elementary curricula, the public-school district in Montgomery County, Maryland, created a notice and opt-out system for parents who wanted to withdraw their kids from instruction with the materials. The district later removed the opt-out system following protests from LGBTQ families that found it stigmatizing and discriminatory.

Then a coalition of Muslim and Christian parents with young children objected to the removal. By all accounts, these parents were sincere in their religious convictions. They sought accommodations that neighboring school districts had given similarly situated parents; none wanted to ban the books entirely from the school. Many of the objecting parents were comfortable with their kids reading the books at more advanced ages. Yet the district refused to compromise, dismissing hundreds of parental complaints requesting a restoration of the opt-out. What could have been resolved through negotiation transformed into a culture-war flash point and a lawsuit.  From the outset of litigation, the school district should have seen the warning signs. The Becket Fund, a powerhouse religious-liberty organization that has won eight (and lost zero) Supreme Court cases in the past decade, represented the parents in their suit, and conservative media outlets regularly covered even routine procedural developments. That should have alerted the district that the stakes were far greater than local policy.  A strategic retreat—restoring the opt-out and pursuing legal maneuvers to moot the case, including after the Court granted certiorari—would have shown prudence, not capitulation. Instead, the district pressed on. Its temporary wins at the trial and appellate stages then teed up the Supreme Court reversal that has now reshaped constitutional doctrine nationwide. In ruling for the parents, the Roberts Court extended a nearly unbroken streak of favoring free-exercise claimants, largely conservative Christians.

Mahmoud imposes a rigid, nationwide rule that sharply limits schools' ability to balance inclusion with parental concerns. Discovering a new constitutional right for parents to opt out of teaching “subtle” themes that conflict with their religious beliefs, the decision strips locally elected school boards of the power to make nuanced curricular judgments and hands it to federal judges. It saddles schools with new administrative burdens, inhibits the development of pluralistic curricula, and invites ideological censorship masquerading as religious accommodation.  Ironically, a local effort to affirm LGBTQ dignity in a county of 1 million residents led the Supreme Court to inflict a blow to that dignity across a nation of 340 million. Much was lost in the crossfire. As Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in her dissent, Mahmoud threatens the “very essence” of American public education and democracy.

For advocates in the progressive legal world, deprioritizing litigation will require a theoretical shift, a move away from the court-centric constitutional vision that has defined progressive legal thought since the Warren and early Burger Courts and has been sustained by occasional liberal victories in the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts. It will necessitate recognizing that the Court is not the sole or even primary engine of constitutional interpretation.  The Court's pronouncements on constitutional law are important, of course. But other institutions and spaces—legislatures, referenda, classrooms, workplaces, media, even group chats and other parts of the public square—have a role to play in the articulation of constitutional ideas. De-emphasizing the courts as sources of legal interpretation and policy change can allow progressives to correctly conceptualize constitutional politics as a participatory, democratic project with institutional and noninstitutional dimensions, not a top-down one outsourced to nine people on the Supreme Court.  The public's views should matter a great deal. No Court, however reactionary, operates in a vacuum or with impunity. Justices are shaped by the same gravitational social and political forces as everyone else. As Justice Benjamin Cardozo observed in 1921, “The great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the judges by.”

Polling shows that most Americans, including four out of every five Republicans, support restrictions on gender-affirming care for minors. Even in liberal Maryland, two-thirds of voters oppose LGBTQ-focused curricula for young students. Asking a conservative court to override that sentiment—to go where many Democratic voters have yet to go—was never viable. Without public opinion on their side, liberal litigators had little leverage or hope of winning.  I saw this disconnect up close at the ACLU. My colleagues were smart and dedicated, carrying the immense emotional weight of fighting for the fundamental dignity of vulnerable people in a climate of growing prejudice and political attack. But many treated any doubts about transgender rights as simple bigotry. Although this approach foregrounded empathy for transgender people, it often failed to genuinely engage with the majority of Americans, who had questions about athletic competition and medical decisions for minors.

Leah Litman: The archaic sex-discrimination case the Supreme Court is reviving

Rather than speak directly to these concerns, liberal litigators sometimes scorned public opinion, confident in the righteousness of their views. As a recent New York Times Magazine feature revealed, the legal advocates behind Skrmetti operated from academic and activist theories of sex and gender that were out of the mainstream. While public support for transgender rights and the medical consensus on treatments for minors' gender dysphoria fractured, advocates such as the ACLU doubled down on rhetorical purity rather than persuasion. In one widely shared post, the ACLU declared, “Men who get their periods are men. Men who get pregnant and give birth are men.” Another post dismissed as a “MYTH” the near–universally held view that “sex is binary, apparent at birth.” This kind of messaging garners engagement in insular, algorithm-driven online spaces but does not create a cultural foundation that moves skeptical voters and conservative judges. A political and legal strategy anchored in Judith Butler is not going to convince Brett Kavanaugh.

This recalibration doesn't mean giving up on litigation altogether. But it does mean approaching it with greater realism, aiming for incremental change, not sweeping wins. It requires reading the judicial landscape honestly, studying conservative legal thinking carefully, recognizing when legal action may do more harm than good, and accepting some losses in order to preempt even bigger ones. For example, the Sixth Circuit's Skrmetti opinion, written by Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton, clearly foreshadowed where Roberts, Kavanaugh, and Barrett were likely to land, given Sutton's influence on contemporary conservative legal thought and the intellectual proximity of his approach and their own. Ditto for Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., a Trump appointee to the Fourth Circuit who dissented in Mahmoud.  There's a revealing paradox in contemporary liberal legal advocacy at the Supreme Court. Many progressives describe the current Court as dangerously rogue and reactionary. Yet their actions suggest a lingering faith in the Court's legitimacy and potentiality as an agent of progressive change. This dissonance surfaces when an ACLU lawyer who calls the Supreme Court a “vile institution” is the same person who brought Skrmetti to it. Ultimately, a Court that cannot be trusted to protect rights should not be empowered to undermine them.

The path forward lies in organizing, legislating, and persuading, not in supplicating before an antipathetic bench. If they take this new path, progressives may find that they can cultivate constitutional power in places the Court cannot reach.","{'href': 'https://www.theatlantic.com', 'title': 'The Atlantic'}","national"

Gen Z is embracing emotional distress — with a new name.

It was abundantly clear to everyone that Huda wasn't doing well.

Huda Mustafa, the breakout villain on Love Island USA's seventh season, spiraled after viewers voted to separate her from Jeremiah Brown, with whom she'd developed an intense connection early in the current season. Over several episodes, she eavesdropped on Jeremiah's conversations, interrogated the woman he was re-coupled with, and broke down repeatedly. Her despondent face became a viral meme. 

Viewers, and later Huda herself, had a simple and notably Gen Z explanation for what she was experiencing: The lovelorn reality star had officially “crashed out.” 

Justin Bieber received the same label recently, for his strange behavior on social media and a viral standoff with paparazzi. While some of his fanbase voiced more serious concerns over the state of his mental health, many tagged the singer's antics as telltale signs of a typical “crashout.” 

It's not just celebrities. Go on TikTok, and users are posting videos of themselves venting, sobbing, or throwing physical tantrums with some sort of caption claiming that they've “crashed out.” In other cases, they're describing “crashing out” in response to other people. 

The catchall phrase is shorthand for the unfiltered actions of a person who is angry, anxious, confused, stressed out, or experiencing mental health issues. It can describe a range of behavior, from emotional outbursts to altercations to withdrawals. There are a lot of ways that “crashing out” can look, but like obscenity, you know it when you see it.

The term has floated around on the internet for a while now; Know Your Meme credits its popularity to rapper NBA YoungBoy, who used the term in his 2017 song, “Stepped On.” Since the 2020s, the concept has been used both humorously and in earnest to discuss the fallout from issues as global as the state of the world, as personal as relationship or work stress, or as low stakes as struggling with a hairstyle. Practically any problem, big or small, can warrant a “crashout.”

One of the most striking things about the phrase is how general it is. Why is a generation raised on pop-psychology jargon, with more access to mental health resources and experience talking about their own needs, painting these episodes with such a broad brush? Is Gen Z abandoning traditional routes of managing their mental health, or has a burnout generation found a more radical way to cope?

It's no secret that Gen Z is particularly stressed out. According to a 2024 Harmony Healthcare IT study, nearly half of Gen Zers struggle with mental health issues, with 1 in 3 taking prescription medication for mental health. Anxiety and depression are the most common conditions. The Covid-19 pandemic has been seen as a cause for the Gen Z mental health crisis, while other studies point to social media as a huge factor. 

Meanwhile, research suggests that Gen Z might be growing more resistant to traditional therapy. A study published in BetterHelp's 2025 State of the Stigma Report found that 37 percent of participants born between 1997 and 2012 said that seeking counseling was “mentally weak.” This was a higher percentage than the 27 percent of millennials, Gen Xers, and baby boomers that were surveyed combined. 

If therapy's relatively unpopular, social media is booming, and it seems like many teenagers and young adults have turned to their favorite influencers and online advice to get through tough times. On TikTok, for example, “crashouts” are often encouraged as a necessary form of catharsis. Even if you aren't naturally experiencing these outbursts, users posit them as a quick and easy fix for stress and anger.

One user, @masonblakee, posted a video of himself looking relaxed in a car with the caption, “How it feels when you finally crash out on someone after keeping your mouth shut for a while.”

Another, @gazellechavez, made a video sharing the supposed benefits of occasionally “crashing out.”

“Once you hit rock bottom, there's only one way you can go — up,” she says.

Still, professionals are more skeptical of these viral directives, as they're being confronted with them at work. Rebecca Hug, a clinical counselor and core faculty in clinical mental health counseling at University of Phoenix, says she regularly encounters clients who've “absorbed the idea that emotional ‘crashing' is a valid coping strategy.” 

“This mindset discourages the development of essential skills like self-regulation, resilience, and perspective-taking,” Hug says. While she says these sorts of reactions are “developmentally appropriate for teenagers,” it's a more crucial problem for people in early adulthood. 

New York-based psychologist Sabrina Romanoff shares similar concerns about these viral “crashing outs,” saying that TikTok has become “a double-edged sword for mental health.”

“On one hand, it's a space where young people can find validation and connect with people who share similar experiences,” she says. “On the other hand, it's a platform with a high circulation of unqualified advice, often oversimplifying and promoting unhealthy ideas.” 

For instance, several videos frame the act of “crashing out” on other people as a joyful and even empowering experience. But at what point do these emotional eruptions become abusive or signal one's failure in communicating with others? 

Romanoff adds that there's a danger to the internet automatically labeling these sorts of behaviors as “crashouts” without acknowledging possible underlying causes. 

“When we see repeated posts about these breakdowns, it can inadvertently create a culture where these moments are expected or even glorified rather than seen as a signal that something deeper needs attention,” she says.

Prior to the “crashout” trend, Gen Z had already built a reputation for publicizing their emotional meltdowns online. TikTok and Instagram Stories have become increasingly popular sites for influencers and average users to cry and vent. Hug says viral “crashouts” reflect how “emotional dysregulation is increasingly externalized and even socially validated.” Rather than having these intimate moments in private with friends or family members, users can receive immediate support from strangers that they may not receive in real life. This public sharing seems, in part, symptomatic of a loneliness epidemic affecting Gen Z. According to a Pew Research Center study this year, the cohort experiences higher rates of loneliness than previous generations. 

However, vulnerability has also proven to be a recipe for virality and a strategy to build loyal audiences. Hug says the visibility of emotional struggles can “blur the line between authentic expression and performative vulnerability.” 

Hence, there's an obvious incentive for certain people to discuss and post their crashouts. Not everyone may come from a particularly dire or desperate place. After all, Hug says that many of these posters' concerns seem to reflect “normal developmental stress rather than clinical pathology.” 

Still, she says that it's important for young people to develop self-regulation skills and utilize mental health resources rather than normalizing these reactions under the guise of “crashing out.” Unfortunately, emotional maturity doesn't get as many likes. 

Correction, June 30, 2:30 pm ET: A previous version of this story incorrectly cited the report that published research about how Gen Z might be growing more resistant to traditional therapy. It was from BetterHelp's 2025 State of the Stigma Report.

Climate change is already twice as painful economically as the Great Depression, and it's only going to worsen.

Damage from climate change is even worse because estimates undercount the effects of extreme heat.

Photographer: Sam Wolfe/Bloomberg

If you had the power to prevent not just one Great Depression but two, you probably wouldn't hesitate to use it. But for some (not very mysterious) reason, that's pretty much what we do when we ignore an increasingly hot and violent climate.

Two of the biggest myths about climate change are that 1) it's a problem for future generations and 2) trying to alleviate it will hurt economic growth. In fact, climate change is not just a challenge already for those of us lucky enough to be alive today, it's also an economic catastrophe. Ignoring it will be far more costly than fighting it.

Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday that he's creating Meta Superintelligence Labs, which will be led by some of his company's most recent hires, including Scale AI ex-CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.

Zuckerberg said the new AI superintelligence unit, MSL, will house the company's various teams working on foundation models, like the open-source Llama software, products and Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) projects, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC.

Bloomberg first reported about the new unit.

Meta's co-founder and CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz as he faces fierce competition from rivals like OpenAI and Google. Earlier in June, the company said it would hire Wang, now Meta's chief AI officer, and some of his colleagues as part of a $14.3 billion investment into Scale AI.

Meta also hired Friedman and his business partner, Daniel Gross, who was CEO of Safe Superintelligence, the AI startup created by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, CNBC earlier reported. Meta had attempted to buy Safe Superintelligence, but was rebuffed by Sutskever.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a recent podcast that Meta was recruiting AI researchers from his company, offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million. 

Meta technology chief Andrew Bosworth told CNBC's ""Closing Bell Overtime"" in an interview on June 20, that OpenAI was countering Meta's offers. 

""The market is setting a rate here for a level of talent which is really incredible and kind of unprecedented in my 20-year career as a technology executive,"" Bosworth said. 

Here is Zuckerberg's full internal memo released on Monday:

As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight. I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way. Today I want to share some details about how we're organizing our AI efforts to build towards our vision: personal superintelligence for everyone.

We're going to call our overall organization Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This includes all of our foundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab focused on developing the next generation of our models.

Alexandr Wang has joined Meta to serve as our Chief AI Officer and lead MSL. Alex and I have worked together for several years, and I consider him to be the most impressive founder of his generation. He has a clear sense of the historic importance of superintelligence, and as co-founder and CEO he built ScaleAI into a fast-growing company involved in the development of almost all leading models across the industry.

Nat Friedman has also joined Meta to partner with Alex to lead MSL, heading our work on AI products and applied research. Nat will work with Connor to define his role going forward. He ran GitHub at Microsoft, and most recently has run one of the leading AI investment firms. Nat has served on our Meta Advisory Group for the last year, so he already has a good sense of our roadmap and what we need to do.

We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I'm excited to share as well:

I'm excited about the progress we have planned for Llama 4.1 and 4.2. These models power Meta AI, which is used by more than 1 billion monthly actives across our apps and an increasing number of agents across Meta that help improve our products and technology. We're committed to continuing to build out these models.

In parallel, we're going to start research on our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so. I've spent the past few months meeting top folks across Meta, other AI labs, and promising startups to put together the founding group for this small talent-dense effort. We're still forming this group and we'll ask several people across the AI org to join this lab as well.

Meta is uniquely positioned to deliver superintelligence to the world. We have a strong business that supports building out significantly more compute than smaller labs. We have deeper experience building and growing products that reach billions of people. We are pioneering and leading the AI glasses and wearables category that is growing very quickly. And our company structure allows us to move with vastly greater conviction and boldness. I'm optimistic that this new influx of talent and parallel approach to model development will set us up to deliver on the promise of personal superintelligence for everyone.

We have even more great people at all levels joining this effort in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. I'm excited to dive in and get to work.

The White House claimed Monday that Canada ""caved"" to President Donald Trump by hastily rescinding its digital services tax after the president threatened to shut down trade negotiations between the two major trading partners.

""It's very simple: Prime Minister [Mark] Carney and Canada caved to President Trump and the United States of America,"" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a briefing.

""It was a mistake for Canada to vow to implement that tax that would have our tech companies,"" Leavitt said.

Carney, she added, called Trump Sunday night to ""let the president know that he would be dropping that tax, which is a big victory for our tech companies and our American workers.""

Neither the office of the prime minister nor his Liberal Party immediately responded to CNBC's requests for comment.

Leavitt's remarks came hours after top Trump economic aide Kevin Hassett said the White House will likely ask more countries to drop their own digital services taxes as part of ongoing trade talks, following Canada's concession.

""My expectation is that the digital services taxes around the world will be taken off, and that that will be a key part of the ... ongoing trade negotiations that we have,"" Hassett, the director of Trump's National Economic Council, said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""

The remark from Leavitt and Hassett came one day after Canada walked back its DST in order to ""advance broader trade negotiations"" with the United States.

That reversal — just hours before the first collection under the new tax was due — came on the heels of Trump's surprise threat Friday to terminate all trade talks with Ottawa as long as the DST remained in place.

Canada said negotiations with the U.S. have resumed since it scrapped the tax. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney now aim to strike a trade deal by July 21, according to a statement Sunday from the Department of Finance in Ottawa.

""I'm very pleased to see that Canada is removing its DST, which means that we didn't have to put in this really complicated retaliation to the tax code,"" Hassett said Monday.

""But you could expect that countries that have digital sales taxes of the future are going to be facing the wrath of [U.S. Trade Representative] Jameson Greer"" over ""these unfair trade practices,"" Hassett said.

In a little over a week, the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports from a number of countries are set to restart.

Hassett said he believes the U.S. has ""frameworks"" for ""a whole number of deals"" that will be agreed to shortly after a major Trump-backed budget bill passes through Congress.

The Trump administration is eager for the GOP-controlled House and Senate to pass a final version of the massive tax-and-spending legislation and send it to the president's desk before Friday.

If that happens, Hassett predicted, there will be a ""marathon session"" in the Oval Office in which Trump and his aides will tick down a list of countries and make final calls on U.S. tariff rates for each.

It is unclear whether Trump will stick to the July 8 and July 9 tariff deadlines. ""We can do whatever we want,"" he said Friday when asked whether he would stick with one of those dates.

In this article

Home Depot said Monday that it is buying GMS, a building products distributor, for about $4.3 billion as the retailer moves to draw more sales from contractors and other home professionals.

Shares of Home Depot fell nearly 1% on Monday. GMS shares rose about 12% and touched a 52-week high. 

As part of the deal, the Home Depot-owned subsidiary SRS Distribution will purchase all outstanding shares of GMS for $110 per share, which adds up to about $4.3 billion and amounts to total enterprise value including net debt of about $5.5 billion, the company said.

Home Depot said it expects the acquisition to be completed by early 2026.

Home Depot's announcement also concludes a potential bidding war between the big-box retailer and billionaire Brad Jacobs. Jacobs' building-products distributor QXO had offered about $5 billion in cash to acquire GMS and said it would press forward with a hostile takeover if the company's management rejected the proposal.

As Home Depot chases growth, it's gone after a steadier and more lucrative piece of the home improvement business: electricians, roofers, home renovators and other professionals who tackle large projects year-round and need a lot of supplies. Home Depot said it's speeding along that strategy with the GMS deal.

Home Depot bought SRS Distribution — the subsidiary that's acquiring GMS — last year for $18.25 billion, in the largest acquisition in its history. Texas-based SRS sells supplies to professionals in the landscaping, roofing and pool businesses and it has bought up many other smaller suppliers as it's grown.

Home Depot's focus on selling to professionals is well timed. Sales from do-it-yourself customers have slowed as higher mortgage rates have decreased housing turnover and dampened homeowners' demand for larger projects because of higher borrowing costs.

The company said it expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the full fiscal year and comparable sales, which take out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and calendar differences, to rise about 1%.

Watch Daily: Monday - Friday, 3 PM ET

In this article

CANNES, France — Robinhood stock climbed 10% to an all-time high Monday after the company rolled out tokenized shares of OpenAI and SpaceX to users in Europe as part of a larger crypto rollout.

It is the company's first move to make private equity accessible via blockchain.

The announcement, which came Monday during the company's product showcase in Cannes, is part of a broader push to expand Robinhood's crypto footprint globally. The tokenized assets will be available exclusively through Robinhood's EU crypto app, where more than 200 tokenized stocks and ETFs are now tradable 24 hours a day, five days a week with no commission or spread.

To mark the launch, Robinhood is giving 5 euros worth of OpenAI and SpaceX tokens to every eligible user in the European Union who onboards to trade stock tokens by July 7. The company has allocated $1 million worth of OpenAI and $500,000 worth of SpaceX for the campaign.

OpenAI and SpaceX stand out since neither company is publicly listed and access to their equity has historically been limited to insiders and ultra-wealthy investors.

""We wanted to make sure we were giving access,"" said Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of crypto at Robinhood. ""What we discussed on stage was how to address the inequality between people who have historically had access to these kinds of companies and everyone else. That's the really exciting part: Now everyone will be able to get it.""

""The goal with tokenization,"" he added, ""is to let anyone participate in this economy.""



This marks the first time Robinhood has tokenized private companies — a milestone made possible, in part, by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment.

""There are no accredited investor rules here in the EU, so anyone who qualifies to trade stock tokens is able to access them,"" Kerbrat said.

Although the EU rollout is underway, Robinhood said U.S. users shouldn't expect access anytime soon.

Regulatory hurdles — particularly accredited investor restrictions — remain a major barrier to bringing tokenized private equity to the U.S. market. CEO Vlad Tenev has publicly called for changes, arguing that blockchain could unlock broader participation in private markets.

The tokenized shares are being distributed via Robinhood's custody wallet into user accounts, part of a broader infrastructure push that also includes the company's new layer 2 blockchain built on arbitrum, which were announced the same day.

And while American users can't yet access tokenized shares of private companies, they are gaining access to crypto staking.

Robinhood also launched staking for ethereum and solana in the U.S., a feature that was previously blocked by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move signals a renewed push to reintroduce yield-bearing crypto products to the domestic market.

As Senate Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump's sweeping budget reconciliation bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a last ditch initiative is underway in the halls of Congress to tack on an amendment to the legislation that would benefit crypto investors in potentially numerous ways.

The buzziest of the bunch appears to be a provision that would, at last, apply a so-called de minimis exemption to capital gains taxes on small amounts of crypto, which could provide a pathway for greater adoption of cryptocurrency for payments. 

At the moment, disposing of even small amounts of, say, Bitcoin to buy a burger, or a nominal amount of Ethereum to pay a gas fee on the network, requires users to calculate capital gains and losses on every transaction. Whether a change to these tax laws makes it to the final version of the Big Beautiful Bill, though, is still TBD.

The timing is down to the wire. As of Monday afternoon, legislators are currently debating several amendments to add to the bill. At the same time, Senate Republicans are meeting privately to determine whether to add all or part of a crypto tax provision to the bill that Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has been working on for well over a year, sources familiar with the matter told Decrypt.

“It wasn't clear it would be done in time for inclusion in the [Big Beautiful Bill],” one crypto policy leader familiar with the deliberations told Decrypt, speaking of Lummis' crypto tax provision. “It finally got done, like, yesterday.”

Now, in real time, crypto policy leaders and their allies in the Senate are racing to determine what elements of the provision could reasonably be added to the Big Beautiful Bill this afternoon. Legislators involved want to get a win for crypto if they can, but not risk adding more chaos to a legislative process that has already been mired with Republican defections and controversy.

“This is a Hail Mary,” the crypto policy leader said of the amendment. “If it gets slotted in, it gets slotted in today.” 

Rumors are currently flying around Washington, with crypto leaders guessing, mostly in the dark, what crypto provisions might make the cut. The decision will ultimately come down to Lummis, Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), sources said.

A staffer in Lummis' office declined to elaborate to Decrypt about the current contents of the crypto amendment, but referred to an X post Lummis put out on the subject Monday afternoon. 

“I am working on an OBBB amendment to ensure Americans can use digital assets without fear of tax violations,” Lummis said. “More to come soon!”

A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question from Decrypt about the president's support for the quickly unfolding initiative.

Crypto policy leaders are most confident the amendment will include two elements unlikely to rock the boat in the Senate: a clarification on tax timing for crypto staking and mining rewards, and a mark-to-market accounting provision for companies that hold crypto on their balance sheets.

The staking measure would explicitly clarify that Americans who earn crypto rewards via staking or mining will only be taxed on those rewards once they are sold. In the last few years, legal disputes have arisen over whether staking rewards should be considered income that must be taxed at the moment of creation, regardless of whether the funds are sold or not. 

The mark-to-market accounting provision would allow companies greater flexibility in reporting increases in value of stockpiled crypto, even when those gains are unrealized. In recent months, publicly traded companies have flocked to buy up cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as a means of passively boosting their balance sheets. 

A third provision that industry leaders think could possibly make the cut today, and get taken up for a vote as an amendment to the Big Beautiful Bill, is a de minimis tax exemption for crypto assets. Such an exemption would allow American crypto users to not report smaller crypto transactions as taxable for capital gains purposes. For example, if you were to buy a pizza with Bitcoin, the transaction would not be taxed the same way as if you sold off a large quantity of the cryptocurrency for a profit. 

It's unclear what threshold would be used if the de minimis exemption was added to the Big Beautiful Bill. It was originally $600, then was slashed to $200, and was recently hovering around $300, one crypto policy expert said. 

“There have been so many different versions of this text,” they said. “It changes every week or so.”

While crypto industry leaders Decrypt spoke to Monday had slightly differing thoughts on the respective odds of different provisions making it into the Big Beautiful Bill, they all agreed in one regard: it's either happening today, or it's not happening at all.

 Bitcoin continues to face sellers at $109,000 even as most traders anticipate all-time highs and select altcoins rally at the start of the week. 

Key points:

Bitcoin is facing selling near $109,000, but the shallow pullback suggests the uptrend may resume.

BNB and HYPE are showing strength, having broken above their immediate resistance levels.

Bitcoin (BTC) has started the week on a soft note, with the bears trying to pull the price below the $107,000 level. Bitcoin remains on track for a positive monthly close in June as long as it stays above $104,600. If that happens, it will only be the second occasion since 2020 that Bitcoin has closed June in the green, per CoinGlass data.

Bitcoin's failure to break out of the all-time high at $111,980 has not deterred investors from buying more. CoinShares data shows $2.2 billion in inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded products last week.

In addition to steady ETF inflows, Bitcoin treasury companies continued their purchases. Michael Saylor's Strategy revealed the acquisition of 4,980 Bitcoin at an average price of $106,801, its 11th successive week of Bitcoin purchases. Similarly, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said in a post on X that the firm bought 1,005 Bitcoin at an average price of $107,601.

Could Bitcoin stay above $106,000, or will bears pull the price below the level? How are altcoins likely to behave? Let's analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.

The S&P 500 Index bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average (6,029) on June 23, indicating a positive sentiment.

The bulls continued to buy at higher levels, pushing the price above the all-time high of 6,147 on Friday. If the price maintains above 6,147, the index could rally toward 6,500.

Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below 6,147, trapping the aggressive bulls. The index may then slide to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off the 20-day EMA enhances the prospects of the continuation of the uptrend. 

Conversely, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests profit-booking by the bulls. That may pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average (5,827).

The US Dollar Index (DXY) broke and closed below the 97.92 support on Wednesday, indicating that the bears have overpowered the bulls.

Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is near the oversold territory, indicating that bears are in control. The bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to push the price back above the breakdown level of 97.92. If they manage to do that, the index could rally to the 50-day SMA (99.28).

Alternatively, if the price turns down from 97.92, it suggests that the bears have flipped the level into resistance. That could resume the downtrend, pulling the price toward the 95 level.

Bitcoin is facing selling at the downtrend line, but a positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to skid below the moving averages.

That suggests the bulls are not hurrying to book profits as they anticipate another leg higher. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory indicate the path of least resistance is to the upside.

If the price breaks above the downtrend line, the BTC/USDT pair could soar to the neckline of the inverted head-and-shoulders pattern. This is a vital level for the bears to defend because a break above it signals the resumption of the uptrend.

The first sign of weakness will be a break below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair risks falling to $104,500 and then to the $100,000 support.

Ether's (ETH) recovery is facing selling near the 50-day SMA ($2,534), indicating that the bears are active at higher levels.

Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, signaling a possible range-bound action in the near term. If the price skids below $2,376, the ETH/USDT pair could fall to $2,323. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $2,323 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $2,111. 

On the upside, a break above the 50-day SMA opens the doors for a rally to $2,738 and then to $2,879. The next trending move may begin on a break above $2,879 or below $2,111.

XRP (XRP) has been stuck inside the $2 to $2.65 range for the past several days, indicating buying near the support and selling close to the resistance.

The bulls are trying to push the price above the 50-day SMA ($2.25). If they do that, the XRP/USDT pair could attempt a rally to the top of the range at $2.65. Sellers will try to keep the price inside the range by fiercely defending the $2.65 level.

If the price turns down from the current level, it suggests that the bears are selling on every minor rally. Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the $2 support. If they can pull it off, the pair may fall to $1.61.

BNB (BNB) broke above the resistance line of the descending channel pattern on Sunday, suggesting that the correction may be over.

There is minor resistance at the 50-day SMA ($654), but if buyers do not allow the price to dip back into the channel, the BNB/USDT pair could surge to $675 and subsequently to $698. 

This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below $636. That suggests the markets have rejected the break above the channel. The pair may then decline to $625.

Solana (SOL) turned up from the $140 support on Friday and rose above the 20-day EMA ($148) on Saturday.

Buyers are trying to extend the relief rally above the 50-day SMA ($158). If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to the overhead resistance of $185. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the $185 level because a break above it clears the path for a rally to $220.

The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if they sink the price below the $!40 support. The pair may then descend to $126 and, after that, to $110.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has recovered to the 20-day EMA ($0.17), which is the first obstacle to watch out for. 

If the price turns down sharply from the 20-day EMA, the DOGE/USDT pair risks a break below the $0.14 support. If that happens, the selling could accelerate, and the pair may tumble to $0.10.

On the contrary, a break and close above the 20-day EMA suggests the pair may swing between $0.14 and $0.21 for some time. Buyers will gain strength after they propel the pair above the $0.21 overhead resistance.

Cardano (ADA) has risen close to the 20-day EMA ($0.59), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.

If the price turns down and breaks below $0.54, the ADA/USDT pair could tumble to the crucial support at $0.50. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.50 level with all their might because a break below it will complete a descending triangle pattern. That may start a downward move to $0.40.

On the upside, if buyers push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach the 50-day SMA ($0.67). A trend change will be signaled after buyers drive the pair above the downtrend line.

Hyperliquid (HYPE) broke above the $39.12 resistance on Sunday, indicating that the bulls are back in the game.

The HYPE/USDT pair could climb to $42.50 and then to $45.80. Sellers are expected to fiercely defend the $45.80 level, but if the bulls prevail, the pair could skyrocket to the psychological level of $50.

The first support on the downside is the 20-day EMA ($37.55) and then the 50-day SMA ($34.76). Sellers will have to pull the price below the 50-day SMA to weaken the bulls. The pair may then slump to $30.69.

Shares of publicly traded Bitcoin miner BitMine Immersion Technologies jumped more than 400% on Monday following word that the firm raised $250 million via private placement to build an Ethereum treasury. 

In addition to the raise—which had participation from notable crypto firms like Founders Fund, Pantera, Galaxy Digital, and Kraken—BitMine added Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee as Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

""This transaction includes the highest quality investors across TradFi and crypto venture capital, properly reflecting the rapid and continued convergence of traditional financial services and crypto,” said Lee in a statement.

The private placement includes the sale of more than 55 million shares of BMNR at a price of $4.50 per share, with net proceeds being used to create the Ethereum treasury.

Why is BitMiner embracing Ethereum? The firm's announcement highlights “protocol-level activities” on the Ethereum network, with specific mention of DeFi, staking, and stablecoins as differentiating features. 

“Stablecoins have proven to be the 'ChatGPT' of crypto, leading to rapid adoption by consumers, merchants and financial services providers,” said Lee, adding that Ethereum is home to most stablecoin payments.

“One of the key performance metrics for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share. This can be achieved by a combination of reinvestment of the company's cash flows, capital markets activities, and by the change in value of ETH.”

BitMiner joins SharpLink Gaming as publicly traded vehicles that have opted for Ethereum treasuries, breaking from the popular trend of building Bitcoin treasuries. Since developing its treasury strategy, SharpLink has added more than 188,000 ETH worth more than $460 million at today's prices.

Shares of BitMiner closed at $4.26 on Friday, but have jumped 447% to $23.35 as of Monday morning.

Oops, something went wrong

The online brokerage Robinhood is doubling down on its crypto ambitions. On Monday, the company announced that it was letting customers in the European Union trade U.S. stocks and ETFs on a blockchain. Dubbed Robinhood Stock Tokens, the assets—basically shares of popular companies in a crypto wrapper—will have zero commission fees, and holders will receive dividend payments within the brokerage's app.

Customers will have access to stock tokens representing more than 200 different companies and be able to trade them 24 hours a day, five days a week. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood chairman and CEO, said during an event on Monday those tokens even include privately traded companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. The blockchain-based stocks will initially be issued on Arbitrum, a so-called layer 2 blockchain built on top of Ethereum.

Robinhood plans to eventually move the tokenized stocks over to its own layer 2 chain that uses Arbitrum's software. Layer 2 chains are built atop primary blockchains like Ethereum, and are typically faster and more efficient to use.

The user experience is designed to be as easy for non-crypto traders as possible, said Steven Goldfeder, cofounder and CEO of Offchain Labs, a key Arbitrum developer. “For many European users that don't want to engage with crypto for whatever reason, they don't even have to know or care that it is crypto underneath,” he added.

Robinhood didn't specify when it would launch its new blockchain, but it said the new chain plans to support trading 24 hours a day, seven days a week. “Our latest offerings lay the groundwork for crypto to become the backbone of the global financial system,” Tenev said in a statement.

The company's stock jumped 4% to a high of $91 after Robinhood publicized the announcement late Monday morning.

Robinhood's tokenized stock offering and planned blockchain comes as part of a broader push by the firm to expand its crypto products offering under a newly friendly regulatory regime in Washington, D.C.

After President Donald Trump, who's called himself a “pro-crypto president,” won reelection in November, Robinhood reinstated many of the cryptocurrencies, including Solana and XRP, that it had delisted from its platform. It took down the digital assets from its app after the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in 2023 lawsuits the tokens were unregistered securities.

Once Trump assumed office in January, his administration issued a series of pro-crypto executive orders. The SEC also reconfigured its crypto enforcement arm as well as dropped a series of high-profile lawsuits and investigations against crypto companies, including a probe into Robinhood's crypto arm.

In May, Robinhood made inroads into Canada when it acquired the Toronto-based WonderFi for nearly $180 million. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of this year. And, in June, the publicly traded company based in Menlo Park, Calif., closed its $200 million acquisition of the crypto exchange Bitstamp after a year of regulatory review.

As part of Monday's announcement, Robinhood also said it was letting its European users trade crypto perpetual futures, a type of crypto derivative that lets traders bet on the future price of a cryptocurrency.

And the online trading app said it will let U.S. customers stake cryptocurrencies—when crypto holders put their digital assets in escrow to support the security of a blockchain. Users will first be able to stake Ethereum and Solana. Robinhood did not say which other tokens it planned to allow users to stake.

Crypto legal firm Burwick Law wants a pub landlord turned Dubai property developer served with an NFT so it can officially start a lawsuit accusing him of stealing $440 million through a crypto-based Ponzi scheme. 

Peter McInnes, known as “Paddy,” is one of seven defendants facing a lawsuit filed by Burwick Law last December. 

Earlier this month, the firm requested to serve six of these hard-to-reach defendants via an NFT. According to The Times, McInnes has been in Dubai promoting his new venture, selling Banksy art. 

The law firm found a “possible match” that suggests McInnes is also the director of a UK-based firm called “Waste Consul LTD,” but concluded it would be pointless to serve his firm's UK address since he's in Dubai.

Burwick deemed airdropping an NFT directing the viewer to their complaint appropriate, “considering that the Ponzi scheme alleged in the complaint depended on promotions on social media and the sale of NFTs.”

One Florida judge in 2023 permitted an NFT-based serving that targeted the hacker behind a nearly-$1 million tether (USDT) theft.  

Burwick Law's lawsuit alleges that over $450 million worth of investor funds were taken through two separate schemes over the course of a year.

First was TradeAI, a firm that promised investors substantial returns through high-yield crypto pools. 

The scheme collapsed, leaving investors unable to withdraw their funds. The firm blamed it on corporate negligence and other infrastructure lapses before it rebranded to Stakx, and solicited even more investments from the same alleged victims. 

McInnes founded UA3, the firm that would supposedly help TradeAI's recovery efforts. The Times reports that in one instance, before investors would supposedly be paid back, McInnes filmed himself recovering from a heart attack in the bed of an eight-bedroom mansion in San José, Costa Rica.

McInnes often bragged about his Banksy collection, and while running his schemes, had his own Stakx “Paddy syndicate” investment that was supposedly backed with the artist's work and $20 million worth of supercars.

McInnes is also linked to a high-profile $247 million property development scheme in Liverpool that was promoted by the UK chancellor at the time. This project eventually filed for insolvency, and McInnes was levied with money laundering accusations, which he described as “misleading and untrue.”

McInnes' representative claims he has proof of ownership for the Banksy art. They also claim he has no knowledge of the legal proceedings, has no involvement with TradeAI or UA3, and that he had no financial benefit through the Stakx scheme. 

It's worth noting that Burwick Law's case doesn't allege fraud in this case, and specifically focuses on unregistered securities law, just as it does in its case against memecoin platform Pump Fun.

Seoul, Korea, July 8, 2023: Kwangjang Market is over 100 years old and a key Korean spot for local traditional cuisine, drawing tourists to its delicious offerings.

After three months of testing, South Korea's central bank has postponed further development of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), as both the government and local banks increase their support for stablecoins.

The Bank of Korea has suspended the second round of CBDC trials, originally scheduled for later this year. Meanwhile, eight South Korean banks are collaborating on a stablecoin backed by the Korean won, which they hope to launch by next year.

This shift may signal a broader trend among central banks globally, moving away from CBDCs in favor of stablecoins. A senior official at one of the participating banks told South Korea's Yonhap News Agency that the coexistence of CBDCs and stablecoins remains uncertain.

There are signs that the CBDC tests soured the banks on its potential. One senior banking official said that seven participating banks became unhappy with the cost of the second phase of the CBDC trials. Half of the banks involved in the stablecoin project also took part in the CBDC trials.

The first stage of the CBDC tests involved 100,000 participants testing payments using the central bank-issued currency, which ran from April 1 through June 30. During this period, up to 100,000 citizens ages 19 or older, and holding an account at a participating bank, could convert their deposits into the CBDC for use at stores like 7-Eleven. The second phase would have expanded the number of merchants involved.

Even when the program was introduced, some worried that CBDCs could grant governments too much insight into their citizens' transaction histories. They instead advocated for stablecoins as a better solution, combining the stability of fiat currencies with the efficiency of cryptocurrencies.

Dissatisfaction with the CBDC testing isn't the only reason for the shift in priorities. The newly inaugurated South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is a strong supporter of crypto. During his campaign, he promised to support a won-based stablecoin market. His Democratic party has already submitted a bill that would allow qualifying companies, including nonbanks, to issue stablecoins.

“We don't know whether the issuing entity of stablecoins will be banks, big tech, or fintechs,” a Korean bank official told Yonhap. “We have no choice but to prepare for both situations before they become legislative.”

The Bank of Korea has put its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot on hold, as political and market support grows for private-sector stablecoins pegged to the Korean won.

The move, first reported by Singapore's Business Times, comes after months of preparation with local banks to test the digital version of the won. Seven banks joined the CBDC pilot's first phase, which ran from April to June and involved 100,000 users making test payments at participating merchants, including 7-Eleven. The second round, which was set to begin later this year and expand to remittances and more merchants, has now been postponed.

Officials from several participating banks told local media the project was proving costly and lacked a clear path to real-world use. One source described the pilot as “on the verge of collapse,” citing frustration over budget concerns and the absence of a commercialization plan from the central bank.

The delay coincides with a broader shift in South Korea's digital asset policy under newly elected President Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on legalizing and promoting won-based stablecoins. His ruling Democratic Party submitted a bill this month that would allow companies with at least 500 million KRW (around $370,000) in equity to issue their own stablecoins. That proposal has added new momentum to private-sector efforts, with eight banks now planning to launch a won-pegged stablecoin by 2026.

According to Yonhap News and The Chosun Daily, the Bank of Korea is waiting to see how this legislation plays out before moving forward with further CBDC tests. A central bank official told local reporters that they are reassessing how a CBDC would fit alongside private tokens.

Banks seem to prefer the stablecoin route, which could offer clearer monetization opportunities. Half of the banks involved in the CBDC pilot — including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, and NongHyup — are also involved in the new stablecoin push.

Retail investors are also betting on crypto's continued growth. A recent survey by Hana Financial found that 27% of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 already hold digital assets, and 70% of them plan to increase their exposure over the next year. While younger investors cited high returns as their main motivation, older users leaned toward using crypto as part of retirement planning.

Interest in stablecoins isn't staying within Korean borders either. Following its IPO, U.S.-based Circle — the company behind USDC — became the most purchased overseas stock by Korean investors, who have collectively funneled $443 million into it. Locally, KakaoPay's stock has surged 134% in the past month on optimism over friendly crypto policy.

Signs of green shoots have emerged in the shiba inu SHIB$0.0₄1156 market, with whale accumulation and an inside week candle suggesting a price recovery ahead.

SHIB's price has dropped nearly 27% to $0.00001160 since mid-May, hitting a 16-month low of $0.00001005 at one point, according to data source TradingView.

The decline, however, prompted whales – investors with ample capital supply and ability to move markets – to go bargain hunting. These entities recently purchased 10.4 trillion SHIB tokens worth approximately $110 million, according to CoinDesk's AI insights.

Meanwhile, prices bounced 11% in the seven days to June 29, forming an ""insider week"" candle, signaling a pause in the downtrend.

The pattern occurs when the trading range (high- low) of a weekly candle is entirely contained within the range of the preceding weekly candle. It's a sign of indecision, with both buyers and sellers unwilling to lead the price action.

The occurrence of the said candlestick pattern after a prolonged downtrend, as in SHIB's case, is said to represent seller exhaustion and a potential for an upward price swing.

Serenading Cells with Audible Sound Alters Gene Activity

Audible sound can affect gene activity in mouse cells, boosting the attachment of muscle precursors to surrounding tissue and decreasing fat accumulation

By Simon Makin edited by Sarah Lewin Frasier

The cells in your ears aren't the only ones listening: recent research suggests that crucial cells throughout the body may respond to audible sound. Experiments described in Communications Biology revealed more than 100 genes whose activity changed in response to these acoustic waves, pointing to possible medical applications.

Extensive earlier research has shown that ultrasound—sound at frequencies higher than humans can hear—can affect biology in numerous ways; the new study expands this concept to audible sounds that require no special equipment to produce. Kyoto University biologist Masahiro Kumeta and his colleagues bathed cultured mouse myoblast cells (precursors to muscle tissue) in sound, directly transmitting a low frequency (440 hertz, the A above middle C), a high frequency (14 kilohertz, approaching the top of the perceptible range for humans), or white noise (which contains all audible frequencies) to the culture dishes for either two or 24 hours.

The team analyzed the effect these sound waves had on the mouse cells through RNA sequencing, which measures gene activity. The scientists found that activity in 42 genes changed after two hours, and 145 responded after 24 hours. Most showed increased activity, but some were suppressed. “It's a very extensive, thorough study,” says Lidan You, an engineer at Queen's University in Ontario, who studies how bone cells translate mechanical stimuli into biological signals.

Many of the affected genes have roles in key processes such as cell adhesion and migration, which are known to respond to mechanical forces. The researchers found that sound expanded the size of the sites where cells attached to surrounding tissues, most likely by activating an enzyme called focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which senses mechanical forces and helps to guide tissue development. Sound waves seem to deform molecules in a way that provides easier access for a chemical switch that activates FAK, which in turn influences a chain of other genes' activity.

The team also found a strong reaction in fat-cell precursors called preadipocytes: sound suppressed their differentiation into mature fat cells, thereby reducing fat accumulation by 13 to 15 percent.

Audible sound is noninvasive and probably safer than drugs, Kumeta says. Although it can't be tightly focused like ultrasound, it is easy to produce and could be useful for bathing large regions of the body in sonic waves. Kumeta and his colleagues have already begun studying such interventions to suppress the development of fat tissue in living mice—and humans could be next, he says: “If it works well in mice I think this could be achieved in five or 10 years.” Other potential applications include enhancing regenerative medicine and combating cancer growth. “The next step [could be] using not only human cells but human organoids that model diseases,” You says, “then moving to clinical studies.”

 That's not all they found. Highway construction resulted in discoveries from multiple eras of history, including the Roman empire and the Iron Age.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

Throughout its long existence, Norfolk has become a mosaic of British history. Many rulers, including Celtic Queens, Roman Empires, Vikings, and Saxons, have shaped the county into a rich blend of heritage, and our knowledge surrounding the area is constantly growing with new discoveries. Archeologists just made another one—and it was totally by accident. While doing construction on the A47, a major highway in England, the team discovered remains from a medieval village. 

The team from National Highways, the company tasked with renovating the A47 and other major roadways in England, told Popular Mechanics about the exciting finds in an email. 

“Our works are primarily about improving safety on the roads,” National Highways' A47 project leader Chris Griffin said in the email, “but they also present a great opportunity, through the archaeology, to find out more about the wonderfully rich cultural heritage in Norfolk.”

Excavations took place between the villages of North Tuddenham and Easton. There, archaeologists from Headland Archeology used heavy equipment and hand tools to uncover artifacts such as both battle and hunting spearheads, pottery, metal work, stone carvings, decorative buckles, and animal remains. By the end of the excavation, the team used more than 600 sample buckets and recovered over 65 pounds (30 kilograms) of material. 

Norfolk was once a prosperous civilization during medieval times. People were farming, technology was advancing, and the population was growing quickly. But it wasn't all smooth sailing—some of the finds, including a bone flute, revealed a deeply traumatic part of Norfolk's history. 

“Unfortunately, [Norfolk] coincided with a climate change event called the ‘medieval warm period' where it started to get warmer and wetter and those crops started to fail which exposed the population to famine and disease,” Kate Bane, Project Manager at Headland Archaeology, explained. “Then came the Black Death which wiped out 60% of the population. So, these villages, which would have been recognisable all the way through the landscape like little hamlets, disappeared as people fled to urban settlements, leaving them behind.”

Other work along the A47 has revealed just how rich the region's history is—archaeologists also made notable finds from the Roman period, Iron Age, Saxon period, and even prehistoric times. The discoveries from the North Tuddenham-Easton section of the A47 were presented at the Norfolk Show on June 25 and 26. There, attendees were able to view the artifacts and meet the archeological team.

Get a great deal on a generator now, so you're ready when you need one.

Gear-obsessed editors choose every product we review. We may earn commission if you buy from a link. Why Trust Us?

It's hard to beat Amazon Prime Day for good deals on tech, and that includes the ever-growing market for portable generators, power stations, solar panels, and even whole-home standby systems. The sale runs from Tuesday, July 8th through July 11th this year so we're still more than a week away, but we've already spotted early discounts as high as 50 percent off. Whether you're looking for a bit of backup power to top off a few phones and laptops, or need to keep your essential appliances on during an emergency, this is a good time to shop.

Picking  the right generator will come down to when and where you need it. You may need a small electric power station for camping or a cross-country road trip. Or, you might be an avid DIYer who needs to power a variety of tools on a worksite with a more powerful gas generator. Others may be in the market for a whole-home option to power their homes during outages caused by storms or excessive heat.

Whatever the need, you'll find a good variety of deals this Prime Day, sometimes for several hundred dollars off the list price. It's important to buy your generator before you need it, so this is a good time to invest if getting a generator has been on your agenda. They tend to fly off the shelves during major emergencies and prices will surge. It's better to get prepared now.

The good news is that this year's Prime Day deals are starting early. There are early access deals from Bluetti, EcoFlow, Anker, and Jackery available right now. For the most part, you have to be a Prime member if you want to access Prime Day deals, but you don't have to commit. Just sign up for a free 30-day trial and cancel it later. We also found that some generator brands have opened up their sale prices to anyone, so you may be able to skip the membership altogether. (Though you won't get the faster free shipping).

When shopping for power stations or generators, we often advise that you look for an option with more ports and a higher capacity than what you need. For example, if you see a deal on a power station that offers AC outlets for plugging in small appliances, and you don't think you need that, go for it anyway. You never know when it will come in handy, if not become a necessity, in the future.

Portable power stations are ideal for short power outages or for taking on camping trips. Unlike fuel-based generators, these run on lithium-ion or lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries that can be pre-charged from an outlet. That means you can use them indoors and free yourself from carbon emissions. Many also have inputs that let you charge them with solar panels, so you can truly go green.

This is already one of our favorite power stations: We named it ""best overall"" in our guide to the best solar generators. But like any power station, it's not limited to solar. You can pre-charge it from an outlet and store up to 1,070 watt-hours, enough to charge plenty of devices or power small appliances.

If you just need a power station to charge your phone or Bluetooth speaker, power a lamp, or inflate an air mattress, this Anker  power station will do the trick. Plus, it's on sale for the lowest price of the year.

When we tested the Elite 200 V2, we were impressed by the fact that it could store so much energy (2,073.6 watt-hours) in such a compact and comparatively light power station. And it's not shy on outputs with four AC outlets, two USB-C, two USB-A, and one DC.

It's an older model, but the EcoFlow Delta Pro is still one of the best extra-large power stations. In our review, we found that it was able to power a full-size, 25-cubic-foot refrigerator for a remarkable 51 hours and 24 minutes, making it handy for emergencies.

If you only need your power station to keep your digital devices alive in the great outdoors, this tiny portable Anker model is perfect. It charges you up and functions as a lamp, to boot. Plus, you can charge it with an optional portable solar panel if you have one.

Remember, folks: You need portable power station and a set of portable solar panels to set up a solar generator. The panels themselves can't store electricity; they can only convert it from sunlight. The power station holds the electricity, and gives you outputs to plug in your devices. If charging with solar is your goal: These solar generator bundles give you the complete package, and there are plenty on sale for Prime Day.

You get a lot for your money with this bundle— a 2,042-watt-hour capacity power station and a 400-watt total solar panel array. Plus, according to our research, at 44 percent off, this is as cheap as it's ever been.

If you just need a small portable power station for off-grid getaways, this bundle features outputs for 110V AC, USB, and 12-volt. When it's time to recharge, the solar panel can replenish the station in about 5.5 hours in sunny conditions.

We've been fans of the EcoFlow Delta series for a long time. While this is technically a slightly older model, it's a fantastic deal: You're getting a large, 1,024-watt-hour power station and a 220-watt portable solar panel for less than $1,000.

Some outdoor trips and camping adventures demand more charging power than others. This station offers four 120-volt/20-amp outlets so you could run a variety of small appliances, even a mini fridge.

Jackery power stations and panels show up in our guides often, and for good reason. They have one of the most versatile lineups of any portable power brand. The 3,024-watt-hour Jackery Solar Generator 3000 Pro includes a 400-watt solar panel array and dips to an all-time low price, matching Black Friday 2024.

With an output that supports up to 50 amps, you can't go wrong plugging this 4,096-watt-hour station into your RV or a home backup connection. It ships with a 400-watt panel array, but can support up to 2,600 watts.

It's hard to beat the reliability of a fuel-based portable generator when the power goes out. If you have enough gas or propane stockpiled, you can run it for days without interruption—something you can't do with a battery-based backup. If you plan to run sensitive devices like TVs and computers off your generator, make sure you look for an inverter generator, which delivers more stable power. (They're also quieter and more fuel-efficient.) 

This inverter generator has been our best overall pick in our guide to portable generators for a long time. And we still love it for its compact form factor and quiet operation. 

In our hands-on test of this generator, we found it to be a compact generator that was able to easily run a 15-amp table saw and a 10-amp portable air conditioner at the same time. And its durable construction is tough enough for the rigors of a jobsite.

With a 9,500-watt running wattage and an extra 2,500 watts of starting wattage, the XP12000EH is capable of running critical circuits in a modest-sized home during a power outage, at a comparably low price.

We've liked what we've seen from other Champion generators, so we were happy to see this inverter-equipped model on sale. It can run for up to 14 hours on just 2.3 gallons of gas and has a carbon monoxide auto shutoff system.

This is a new and slightly larger version of our low-volume pick for RV and camping generators. We liked that model for its quiet operation (essential for crowded campgrounds) and substantial power output. This one gives you 5,000 watts, up from 4,500, so you can run everything a little longer.

Homes plagued by constant power outages from severe weather may need long-term power solutions for demanding household appliances and utilities, such as well pumps, refrigerators, and water heaters. Luckily there are large, high-capacity portable generator that can meet that kind of demand. You can connect them directly to your home's electrical system so they can take over when the lights go out. 

The Delta Pro 3 is gigantic power station. It has a massive capacity—4,069-watt-hours—and can output 120-volt and 240-volt AC power. That's give you the means to keep serious power-hungry appliances like your central air conditioning system or well water pump up and running through a blackout.

In our review, we praised the Solix F2000's design, which includes telescoping handle and wheels so you can move it around to different parts of your house when you need it. And it's powerful enough to keep a space heater or refrigerator running for hours.

This is a next-level system that one of our test editors used to install a home backup system of his own. It can work in tandem with an EcoFlow Smart Home Panel 2 (also on sale for Prime Day) and connects to additional batteries so you can raise its power capacity to even greater heights.

This home-backup-capable solar system can provide enough power (5,040 watt-hours) to back up several critical circuits in your home, and comes with large, 500-watt foldable solar panel array that will recharge it in 12 to 14 hours.

You can put out up to 9,500 running watts of power (12,500 peak watts) from this generator, and it offers output up to 50 amps, connected directly to devices or using a transfer switch installed in your home. Plus it's duel-fuel, so you can fill it up with gas or propane.

A permanent home standby generator, like this one from Generac, is the best way to set up a complete home backup, so everything just works when the power goes out. Generac has been our go-to brand for standby generators for years. This model can output up to 10 kilowatts (10,000 watts) of power, and runs on either propane or natural gas.

You'll definitely need to hire a professional to install it, but picking it up now will save you a few hundred bucks.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:sciencedaily.com","Scientists just found a sugar switch that protects your brain from Alzheimer's","https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250630073442.htm","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 14:05:56 GMT","

A new study from scientists at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging has revealed a surprising player in the battle against Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia: brain sugar metabolism. Published in Nature Metabolism, the research uncovers how breaking down glycogen -- a stored form of glucose -- in neurons may protect the brain from toxic protein buildup and degeneration.

Glycogen is typically thought of as a reserve energy source stored in the liver and muscles. While small amounts also exist in the brain, particularly in support cells called astrocytes, its role in neurons has long been dismissed as negligible. ""This new study challenges that view, and it does so with striking implications,"" says Professor Pankaj Kapahi, PhD, senior scientist on the study. ""Stored glycogen doesn't just sit there in the brain; it is involved in pathology.""

The research team, led by postdoc Sudipta Bar, PhD, discovered that in both fly and human models of tauopathy (a group of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's), neurons accumulate excessive glycogen. More importantly, this buildup appears to contribute to disease progression. Bar says tau, the infamous protein that clumps into tangles in Alzheimer's patients, appears to physically bind to glycogen, trapping it and preventing its breakdown.

When glycogen can't be broken down, the neurons lose an essential mechanism for managing oxidative stress, a key feature in aging and neurodegeneration. By restoring the activity of an enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase (GlyP) -- which kicks off the process of glycogen breakdown -- the researchers found they could reduce tau-related damage in fruit flies and human stem cell-derived neurons.

Rather than using glycogen as a fuel for energy production, these enzyme-supported neurons rerouted the sugar molecules into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) -- a critical route for generating NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and Glutathione, molecules that protect against oxidative stress. ""By increasing GlyP activity, the brain cells could better detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing damage and even extending the lifespan of tauopathy model flies,"" said Bar.

Even more promising, the team demonstrated that dietary restriction (DR) -- a well-known intervention to extend lifespan -- naturally enhanced GlyP activity and improved tau-related outcomes in flies. They further mimicked these effects pharmacologically using a molecule called 8-Br-cAMP, showing that the benefits of DR might be reproduced through drug-based activation of this sugar-clearing system. ""This work could explain why GLP-1 drugs, now widely used for weight loss, show promise against dementia, potentially by mimicking dietary restriction,"" said Kapahi.

Researchers also confirmed similar glycogen accumulation and protective effects of GlyP in human neurons derived from patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), strengthening the potential for translational therapies. Kapahi says the study emphasizes the power of the fly as a model system in uncovering how metabolic dysregulation impacts neurodegeneration. ""Work in this simple animal allowed us to move into human neurons in a much more targeted way,"" he said.

Kapahi also acknowledges the Buck's highly collaborative atmosphere as a major factor in the work. His lab, with expertise in fly aging and neurodegeneration, took advantage of proteomics expertise in the Schilling lab and the Seyfried lab (at Emory University) as well as the Ellerby lab which has expertise in human iPSCs and neurodegeneration.

Kapahi says this study not only highlights glycogen metabolism as an unexpected hero in the brain but also opens up a new direction in the search for treatments against Alzheimer's and related diseases. ""By discovering how neurons manage sugar, we may have unearthed a novel therapeutic strategy: one that targets the cell's inner chemistry to fight age-related decline,"" he says. ""As we continue to age as a society, findings like these offer hope that better understanding -- and perhaps rebalancing -- our brain's hidden sugar code could unlock powerful tools for combating dementia.""

Inflammaging, an age-associated increase in chronic inflammation, is considered a hallmark of aging. However, there is no consensus approach to measuring inflammaging based on circulating cytokines. Here we assessed whether an inflammaging axis detected in the Italian InCHIANTI dataset comprising 19 cytokines could be generalized to a different industrialized population (Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study) or to two indigenous, nonindustrialized populations: the Tsimane from the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli from Peninsular Malaysia. We assessed cytokine axis structure similarity and whether the inflammaging axis replicating the InCHIANTI result increased with age or was associated with health outcomes. The Singapore Longitudinal Aging Study was similar to InCHIANTI except for IL-6 and IL-1RA. The Tsimane and Orang Asli showed markedly different axis structures with little to no association with age and no association with age-related diseases. Inflammaging, as measured in this manner in these cohorts, thus appears to be largely a byproduct of industrialized lifestyles, with major variation across environments and populations.

Biplots show the associations of cytokines with the first two axes run in different datasets and with different sets of cytokines. The colors of each arrow are reproduced from panel A across panels to facilitate comparison, with red indicating strong association with the first factor in panel A, purple with the second factor, and black with the origin (no association). A color pattern similar to panel A thus indicates a similar axis structure. The first column (panels A, B, E, and H) shows analyses run in InCHIANTI, but with subsets of cytokines that overlap with those available, respectively, in the full InCHIANTI set (A), SLAS (B), THLHP (E), and OA HeLP (H). The second column (panels C, F, and I) shows the axis structure of the same cytokines as in column 1 (panels B, E, and H, respectively), except run in the target datasets, not InCHIANTI. The third column (panels D, G, and J) replicates the analysis in the second column but adding in the cytokines not measured in InCHIANTI (light grey).

A. Violin plots of the distributions of the inflammaging factors scores calculated in each respective population, based on the factor loadings derived from InCHIANTI (see Methods). Note that it is not clear whether these scores are directly comparable given the different assays used for each dataset; nonetheless, high scores in THLHP is consistent with previous reporting of high levels of inflammatory and immune markers in the Tsimane. Number of biological replicates: InCHIANTI (1041), SLAS (941), THLHP (536), OA HeLP (358). The white circle is the median and the surrounding rectangle indicates the 25th-75th percentile or interquartile range (IQR). Vertical black lines (whiskers) show 1.5*IQR, and the plots extend to the maxima/minima of the smoothed kernel density estimate of the data distribution. B. Pairwise correlations among the scores of the inflammaging axis in InCHIANTI when derived from different sets of cytokines: the original set of 19, the 16 that overlap with SLAS, the eight that overlap with THLHP, and the eight that overlap with OA HeLP. All are significant at p < 0.0001.

Biplots show the associations of cytokines with the first two factors run in different datasets and by sex with the full set of cytokines available in that dataset. The colors of each arrow are reproduced from Fig. 2a across panels to facilitate comparison, with red indicating strong association with the first factor in Fig. 2a, purple with the second factor, and black with the origin (no association). Similar color patterns between female subjects (A, C, E, and G) and male subjects (B, D, F, and H) thus indicates a similar axis structure. Note that the structure is nearly identical for InCHIANTI (A, B) and SLAS (C, D), quite similar for THLHP (E, F), and somewhat more distinct for OA HeLP (G, H), where the sample size is smaller and structure is estimated with greater error.

Mark Zuckerberg notified Meta staff today to introduce them to the new superintelligence team. The memo, which WIRED obtained, lists names and bios for the recently hired employees, many of whom came from rival AI firms like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

Over the past few months, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been on a recruiting frenzy to poach some of the most sought-after talent in AI. The social media giant has invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and hired Alexandr Wang, its CEO, to run Meta's Superintelligence Labs. News of the memo was first reported by Bloomberg.

“We're going to call our overall organization Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This includes all of our foundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab focused on developing the next generation of our models,” Zuckerberg wrote in the memo on Monday. Meta declined to comment.

Zuckerberg introduced Wang, who will be the company's “chief AI officer” and leader of MSL, as well as former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Friedman will colead the new lab with Wang, with a focus on AI products and applied research.

Here's the list of all the new hires as seen in Zuckerberg's memo. It notably doesn't include the employees who joined from OpenAI's Zurich office.

Zoë Schiffer is joined by WIRED's Vittoria Elliott to discuss her conversation with Sahil Lavingia. Lavingia worked at Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency, within the Department of Veteran Affairs, until he was fired for speaking out about his experience. Lavingia said his time at the VA was marked by a lack of transparency from DOGE leadership, and chaotic day-to-day operations—the ramifications of which are still being felt today. Just this week, senators called for a federal investigation into the Trump administration's killing of hundreds of contracts for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

I'm WIRED's director of Business and Industry, Zoë Schiffer. Today, on the show, an in-depth interview with a former DOGE staffer. Our colleague, Vittoria Elliott, sat down with Sahil Lavingia, who used to work as part of Elon Musk's so-called Department of Government Efficiency before he was fired for speaking out about his experience. Lavingia shared how his tenure at the Department of Veterans Affairs was marked by a lack of transparency from DOGE leadership and chaotic day-to-day operations. His statements come at a time when DOGE is in a moment of transition, but the DOGE ideology and DOGE projects have become fused with the larger Trump administration. Vittoria Elliott, senior writer at WIRED, is here to tell us more. Welcome to the show, Vittoria.

Vittoria Elliott: Thanks so much for having me, Zoë.

Zoë Schiffer: Vittoria, let's start by telling listeners who Sahil is. We know he's a former DOGE staffer, but who is he outside of the organization and how exactly did he end up joining the DOGE ranks at the VA?

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah, so Sahil is the founder of a startup called Gumroad, and you can sort of think of it like a sort of fusion of Etsy and Patreon. It's a place for digital creatives to sell their work and he has been working on that for the better part of a decade. He's a pretty experienced startup founder, and Gumroad sort of has this loyal usership but has not achieved the scale of something like Instagram. But he has always had a sort of interest in politics and in using technology in government. He is what I would sort of describe as a true believer in the stated mission of DOGE, which is to make government more efficient and more transparent and work better for people, the sort of work better for the users, which are the American citizens. And to that end, he actually applied for the US digital service years before the Trump administration, back when it was sort of what it was under the Obama administration, which was this small internal tech consulting team that could be deployed at different government agencies to make certain services better. Peak example, the deployment of healthcare.gov. When that failed, USDS sort of became this way for the government to roll out better digital services, and Sahil was really inspired by that. So Steve Davis, Elon Musk right-hand man, the president of the Boring Company, and someone who's been part of a bunch of Musk's projects, was the person who interviewed him and told him that the vision for DOGE was to in-source technology expertise into the governments. Instead of outsourcing to a bunch of technology contractors, that the goal of DOGE was to in-source technological expertise into the government and deploy software that would make government services easier and better for people. That's what Sahil says he thought the vision of DOGE was, and he was really bought into that.

Zoë Schiffer: OK. Well, that makes a lot of sense on a few levels. I mean, this is how Elon Musk likes to run his companies, as you and I both know, with vertical integration. It's part of what has made Tesla and SpaceX, in particular, really successful is he owns a large portion of the supply chain. He's not relying on other companies to build kind of core component parts like other manufacturers often are. And so, like you're saying, Sahil comes in as almost an idealist, and the mandate of DOGE is to root out fraud, waste, and inefficiency. But one thing that really struck me was that he didn't actually find a ton of inefficiency at the Department of Veterans Affairs where he was stationed and that some of the measures that DOGE was implementing, not just at the VA but at a bunch of agencies, like asking employees to send an email listing five things that they'd accomplished in the week, were actually creating a fair amount of inefficiency.

Vittoria Elliott: Yeah. And I think the VA is also so particular, right, because the VA is one of the biggest government agencies, and it is known amongst the federal government to be one of the more technologically forward ones because if you think about it, veterans come back from wars with a lot of disabilities. So there's a lot of contractors and in-house technology experts at the VA that spend a lot of time thinking about how to make services the most efficient and accessible they can possibly be for people with a varying range of access and abilities. And so I think, very much in particular, the VA is a very tech-forward organization with a lot of really smart people working on stuff. And I think Sahil really saw that. And he said one of the first things that he was working on when he came into the VA was not necessarily deploying software but looking at contracts to cut. And he told me that if he had known that sort of his primary focus was not going to be building tools and shipping code but just kind of figuring out who to fire and what to cut that he might not have taken the job.

Zoë Schiffer: Well, I don't want to give away too much of your really, really amazing interview with Sahil. So I guess my final question is just, what is the thing that stood out to you most from this conversation, from his experience at DOGE and what DOGE was like, how it runs?

Vittoria Elliott: I think what really struck me for an organization really obsessed with efficiency and transparency, that there seemed to be very little of that internally. He really described an organizational structure where he was not collaborating with other DOGE teams, sharing learnings, even really knowing what other people were working on. There was very little clarity around who to go to with questions or feedback. And so, even internally, there was sort of this lack of transparency. Externally as well. I think one thing I definitely noticed about Sahil is that he is someone who has really strong principles about certain things, and transparency is one of them. He really believes that if you open source your code or you ask for feedback honestly, that that will make you better. And so he didn't see a problem talking to me or talking to other press because he sees that as fundamental to things improving, and he didn't really understand why DOGE wasn't interested in that in the same way that he was. So I think that's one thing. And then the sort of efficiency that DOGE has really externally said the government lacks, it seems like there's actually quite a lot of inefficiency in how stuff was managed. The fact that a lot of people there, because they didn't have government experience, were kind of remaking the wheel in a lot of ways. There wasn't a lot of, as he described them, easy wins because people were actually doing their job within the limits of the rules in which they have to do them for the federal government.

Zoë Schiffer: I think that's a good place to stop. When we're back, we'll hear Vittoria's sit-down interview with former DOGE staffer, Sahil Lavingia. Stay with us.

Vittoria Elliott: I guess let's start from the very beginning. What drew you to DOGE, and were you previously interested in government work before DOGE?

Sahil Lavingia: I think what interested me to DOGE was this idea that software engineers would have a prioritized place in the federal government. And I think the idea that, as someone who writes code, you could actually ship code for the federal government. This thing that felt like this black box that you didn't really have access to just felt really cool. I think many people would want to do it for the impact, but it just feels like this untouchable thing. And I actually applied to USDS, like the original DOGE, in 2016 I think, 2016 or '17, never heard back. Part of the government black box. And then, eventually, I got... someone had mentioned that they had met someone socially in New York that was working at DOGE. This was late December time period I think, and I was like, ""Oh, could you intro me? I would love to talk to them."" So I've always been interested in just the ability for software to make the world better, and a huge chunk of the world is the government, like public services, things like that.

Vittoria Elliott: So you said it was kind of opaque about how to get in, but you did talk to people. You had sort of like prescreening interviews, but when we initially talked to you, you mentioned it was kind of disorganized and unclear what was going on. So can you tell me a little bit about what that was, like and what the steps were in that process and the kind of information you were given?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah, it was pretty vague. I mean, they really... everything felt like it was on this need-to-know basis like you were joining the military and there was a lot of sort of enemy actors out there that you didn't want to give them any information. I got connected to that one person. All communications went through Signal. We were intro'd in sort of a three-person group chat. That was kind of like the default way DOGE kind of operated was these three-people group chats because you'd have the person intro'ing the two people who wanted to talk, and that was almost the entirety of DOGE was this network of three-person group chats. The more formal conversation with this guy, Baris Akis, who's... I guess, again, no one has titles officially, but in my mind, he was kind of a recruiter. And so, he called me, and we talked, and his questions mostly were around the operational, the logistical. Like, ""Can you actually move to DC? Are you serious? How soon can you move here?"" Well, I didn't know my title, the role, what the work was going to look like, my salary, if I had one. I assumed it was going to be a volunteer gig, basically. I wasn't in it for the comp, you know, the equity. And then he connected me to this guy Steven Davis, who was kind of the acting sort of head of DOGE. I asked him, ""Hey, what is DOGE? I can sort of guess at the gestalt of DOGE at this point, but what... could you give me any sort of hints?"" And he said, ""Do you know any winning technology companies that outsource their software?"" The answer is no. ""Well, we want to insource the federal government software."" I don't think honestly, at that point, the concept of reducing the debt by a trillion dollars, at least to me had come up. It was about insourcing the federal government software. If you look at how much money the federal government does spend on third-party contractors who deliver IT is a significant amount. But that's what really I was like, ""Oh, this is actually what I want. I wanted to ship software for the federal government, and this seems very aligned with DOGE and the pre-inauguration days. A lot of people have asked me since, ""Did you know it was going to be weird or how political or ideological or..."" A friend of mine was like cruel. He used the word cruel, and I was like, ""I don't really want to join a cruel organization. I don't think anyone does, but I just felt like if they're really about shipping software and the USDS original mission with Healthcare.gov and all that, I'm totally in. I think that would be awesome.""

Vittoria Elliott: Can you tell me about your interactions with the other DOGE people? Did you make friends? Did you make colleagues?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah.

Vittoria Elliott: ... at least? Do you know... What was your relationship with the other DOGE people, and what were your impressions of them?

Sahil Lavingia: It was pretty friendly. I mean, it was kind of joining a little troop. We were working together 12 hours a day, and we laugh and joke and you had to because a lot of the work itself was pretty boring, to be honest. Reviewing contracts and sitting in on government meetings can be quite boring and frustrating sometimes. Not writing code, for example, can be annoying if you're a software engineer. So yeah, I feel like we were pretty friendly. Unfortunately, when I left, basically all communications ceased. I tried to talk to them. They're just like... I don't know if they were told or if they're just the default implicit promise of if you're working at DOGE, you don't talk to anybody who, once they've left, they've kind of left the church. I was sort of excommunicated like, ""Don't talk to this person."" Surprisingly little, honestly, communication with the other non-VA DOGE people because they are so worried about maybe information leakage or something like that. They kind of don't... You think you're joining the group, but you're really joining a subgroup of a subgroup of the group. And then, every once in a while, we'd have what Steve called an E-meeting, quote, unquote, which was kind of like a meeting with Elon, and we'd all kind of meet, and it would be this sort of candid Q&A. That was not very goal-oriented. It wasn't like, ""OK, let's work."" It was kind of like a nonwork meeting.

Vittoria Elliott: Can you talk a little more about who was there and what your impressions of them were? It sounds... I remember, when we talked, you really expressed being sort of a true believer in the sort of mission of USDS/the new mission of DOGE, which it was or the mission of DOGE as transmuted through USDS, which is making things more efficient, using technology for these reasons, but ultimately kind of a believer in government in a way.

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah, totally. I think the meaning overall was more quiet than I was expecting. I was seeking feedback from other people, and I guess the non-feedback I got was it just showed that people joined DOGE for a bunch of different reasons, and I think my reasons for joining DOGE were not aligned as much as I was expecting with the general thrust of the organization and of the other folks who were there. Some people were just really pro-Trump, just really wanted to help Trump do what he wanted to do, whatever that meant. Some people were really fiscally conservative, like libertarian types where they really felt like they wanted to just... any opportunity to cut the size of the federal government didn't really matter exactly what it was a good thing. And I think that's generally sort of Elon's probably thrust. Elon is not as much as I was expecting a software sort of activist. So I still don't really know because I think if Steve had told me in that call, ""Our goal is to use software to cut this out to the federal government as much as possible"" then I wouldn't have joined. I joined because it was like, ""We're going to be the software engineering firm for the US government."" So maybe there was just a loss in translation thing, or maybe they needed to say what they needed to say so that they could hire people like me. I don't know. But yeah, I think what I got out of that meeting, most people were nontechnical there. Most people were not software engineers. Most people there were there, and if you're not, I assume you're not that interested in using software to make the government more efficient necessarily. So yeah, I think I was a little bit naively optimistic about how aligned DOGE would be with my stance and with the core sort of original USDS. It wasn't necessarily that people were unopposed, but they were like, ""This is not the highest priority thing."" I messaged someone at GSA who's sort of in charge of that, and I said, ""Hey, I would love to work on this project. I could migrate this whole thing to tailwind, and it would be so much easier for people to work on."" And it was just like, how does this correlate to... who's going to do the work? Basically, it was always the first question. I would always say, ""Well, I will do it. I'm happy to do the work."" But it wasn't clear if you wanted to suggest anything to Steven or Elon how you were to do that. I made some suggestions in that meeting, even though the suggestions seemed to be well received, they were not really implemented. One was implemented, but most were not, and I got negative feedback from someone saying, ""Hey, you shouldn't use that meeting for that purpose. That's not what this meeting is for. You kind of hijacked the meeting to talk about your own personal agenda."" But really I thought my personal agenda was to make DOGE more successful. So I didn't think it was misaligned there in that way. But yeah, I think I learned over time that basically you're hired to do a certain thing and not to question whether you should be doing that thing or not.

Vittoria Elliott: It seems like, for you, a fundamental value is really around transparency.

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah.

Vittoria Elliott: Is that why you've been talking to me and everyone else? And did you feel misaligned with DOGE, given that transparency is so important to you?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah, I mean, one of the... in that all hands, I said Elon asked for some feedback. It was just right after they had done the Fox... the first Fox interview. It was the first public thing that DOGE had done, and he's like, ""Hey, we should... what do you guys think? Should we do more of this? It feels like people liked it."" And I was like... I suggested that we should livestream that meeting. I just said, ""Why don't we livestream these meetings? I think that would be cool, and a lot of people are curious about what's happening, and it would be useful to the world and good for us,"" and etc., etc. And he was like, ""Sounds great. We'll do it next week."" And he computed it. He was like, ""This is how we'll do it. We'll do it here. There's this risk."" He really sort of spent some time thinking about how to actually make it happen, and then it just never happened, and I don't know why it didn't happen. But just, generally, I find that, yeah, I think I was aligned with the marketing of it, which is like, we're going to be the most transparent organization in government, maximally transparent, etc., etc., and it just never manifested. It just never was a priority. I think, for me, transparency is a real priority of actually the way you make things more efficient is by being transparent because then you can see, and other people can see and suggest how to do a better job, right. In hindsight, I was pretty misaligned with DOGE in that way where, if you're running a maximally transparent organization, you should allow your employees to talk to the press. You should allow anyone to talk about anything, the good, the bad, what they struggled with, what they learned, and also allow for internal discord, right. Actually, allow for people to say, ""Hey, this thing that DOGE is doing I think maybe we should not do.""

Vittoria Elliott: Can you tell me who you got the impression was sort of in charge of DOGE or the sort of nerve center? Who were the handful of people that you felt like knew what was going on across these different teams?

Sahil Lavingia: It felt like basically just Steven Davis. It really felt like Elon was at the head of the table. Next to him was Steven Davis. The way I think about it is, Elon is kind of like the chairman of the board. Steven Davis is the CEO. Baris Akis was this sort of COO chief of staff, and everyone else was kind of like a direct report of Steven Davis.

Vittoria Elliott: And you mentioned that everything's over Signal. Obviously, there's rules around maintaining records around government work if you're a government worker. Did anyone ever talk to you about, ""Hey, you have to archive these messages. Hey, you have to save these emails. Hey, you can't delete that."" Did anyone discuss your... any legal obligations around that with you for your work at DOGE?

Sahil Lavingia: No. No. There was never any DOGE or onboarding, right. So, no communication around talking to press, not talking to press, taking photos, not taking photos, disclosing anything you've done with anybody. And yeah, nothing about archiving, maintaining records. It was just done on Signal, and it was never communicated like, ""This is why we use Signal, for example."" It was just like, ""Steven is going to call you on Signal,"" and that's about it.

Vittoria Elliott: And a lot of the DOGE engineers have been assigned to multiple agencies. Were you ever assigned to another agency outside of VA, and did you have a sense of why there were so many DOGE engineers across multiple agencies simultaneously?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah, I was not. I was assigned to VA, and I never got detailed, I guess, is the term detailed to any other agencies. My feeling is that there were just way fewer engineers at DOGE than people would think. There were 10 or less. And so I think they were just insanely limited in how many people they could actually... If they had 500 engineers, they wouldn't have to do that, but I think they just had so few, and specifically so few that they trusted, right. I think there probably was this maybe schism and sort of the sense that if you joined post-inauguration, you were seen as more of an external contributor volunteer. And if you joined pre-inauguration, you were taken a bit more seriously, is my guess, and just had more time to build trust with Steve and Elon, etc. So I think they just only trusted a very small contingent of people, so they just needed the same group of people to just run around a lot and go from agency to agency.

Vittoria Elliott: Got it. Given that you were touching possibly really sensitive data, was there any controls that were put into place? Did anyone sit you down and say, ""You're going to touch a bunch of sensitive stuff. You are or not allowed to do this."" Did you get a sense that there was any sort of, I guess, conversation at DOGE about how to handle this data, how to make sure it's protected safely, how ensuring that people might go back to the private sector, that it's not used for their own benefit?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah. There was nothing DOGE-specific around that, but there were. I think it depends on the agency, and the agencies all have their own protocols that they follow. And in our case at VA, there was some data that they said, ""If you want access to this, you have to go through this two-hour sort of course online where you go through a bunch of tests and have to say that you're able to... you understand the risks."" But in terms of the HR data, I was able to get access to all the HR data, all the contracts with no... I didn't have to sign anything or say anything that I agreed to not share it with the public or do anything like that. It is kind of implied. I was surprised, though. I mean, I was... I asked them one time. I was like, ""I like how many people have access to the HR data?"" And they're like, ""Basically everyone in HR."" I'm like, ""You know this data has everyone's social security numbers in it. There's like 473,000 social security numbers."" And they're like, ""Yeah, thousands of people have access to that."" I was like, ""That's kind of weird."" And I do think the government could improve on these controls and making them better. There was one time where I got access to this thing called CDW, where... which is I think stands for the Corporate Data Warehouse, which effectively all the data in VA was in CDW at one point and they revoked my access a few hours later when they realized that someone had given me access to this and they were basically like, ""Dude, why did you give him access to this?"" And they were like, ""Well, he's senior advisor to the chief of staff. That's... And our protocol is to give you access to all the data when you asked for it."" I think there was this feeling in the beginning that DOGE had a lot more power than people thought, and so everyone was just kind of doing what we asked them to do and unnecessarily that I'd be like, ""No. By the way, follow your own process. I'm not asking you to do anything different.""

Vittoria Elliott: There have been members of Congress and some reporting that there have been possible instances of data exfiltration with DOGE, and I'm wondering if that's anything that you were ever aware of or if there was any concern expressed about that?

Sahil Lavingia: Not in my experience. Yeah, I mean, I've read some articles about it. Someone maybe doing... interagency sending from one... data from one government laptop to another government laptop. I haven't heard of any data leaking or going to the public or state actors getting the data. And in my case, yeah, I don't think any of that happened. I was pretty good about... I would actually leave my VA laptop within the VA headquarters. I wouldn't even take it back to the hotel because not much you could do anyways. And yeah, so it wasn't a huge issue. I think the core issue I'd be worried about, it's just employees who are just not careful with... Just the average employee gets a lot more data than I was expecting pretty easily.

Vittoria Elliott: Was there anything about DOGE that made you uncomfortable? Either something you were asked to be doing or anything you saw happening? Because again, you sort of spoke about this sense of maybe misalignment, so I'm curious if there was ever points where you felt uncomfortable with what was happening.

Sahil Lavingia: I'd say the only thing was they'd say, ""Hey, we're trying to conduct this riff."" And I was like, ""What do you mean?"" And they're like, ""Oh, just put together, here's a Google Sheet, a sheet, an Excel file of all the subdepartments and how many people work in each one and the job codes. And let's help the VA actually do it, not just give them the org charts, but actually give them the number of people to riff at every layer."" And I basically was just like, ""I don't know how useful that is, right."" How useful is it to be like, ""Hey, you have 4,000 software engineers or IT specialists as they're called, and you should have 2000?"" I can do that. I guess I can change some numbers around in Excel, but who's... what is the utility of this product? Who cares? Or when Trump signed some EOs that said All the memos, you have to review and get rid of anything antisemitic or things like this. A bunch of lawyers came to me because they heard I was there, and were like, ""Hey, can you help us?"" So I wrote a little script I published on GitHub so people could see, but it was basically just loops through all the memos similar to the contracts and just checks if they're non-compliant with Trump's EO. And I asked them like, ""What if I just said, no, I just don't want to help you."" And they're like, ""Well, you don't have to help us. We'll just do it manually."" And I'm like, ""You know there's like 500,000 memos though. How would you do that manually?"" And they'd say, ""We'd sit in a room for weeks and just review every single memo."" And I felt uncomfortable broadly with that idea that we're just creating work for no reason. It's just a lot of these things have zero value, knowing that basically nobody was reading the five bullet points that people were sending every week.

Vittoria Elliott: How do you know no one was reading them?

Sahil Lavingia: Well, because apparently the DOGE people were supposed to be paying attention to that kind of stuff, and we weren't. They were like, ""Are you reading them?"" I'm like, ""No."" And they're like, ""OK."" I was like, ""Well, were we supposed to be reading them? We don't even have them. How would I read them?""

Vittoria Elliott: I remember in our first conversation you talked about trying to cancel contracts, and you had mentioned that there was a Palantir contract that you had wanted to cancel at the VA. Did you ever manage to get that through?

Sahil Lavingia: No. No, I don't think so. Yeah, I felt like, ironically... Now I realize that this idea of insourcing the government software and becoming the government software engineering firm, it seems more likely that Palantir is going to become the government's software engineering firm. That effectively the way things are going, if they continue to go in the direction that they're going in, that actually all these contracts basically would just go to Palantir over time, and they'll have Palantir do it because the government's not willing to hire software engineers. And Palantir is... honestly, their software is pretty good, relatively good. We're using at VA. It's just really expensive. We're paying tens of millions of dollars a year for software that I could build in weeks by myself. It just a lot of margin in. I mean, you could look at Palantir's margin is probably pretty good, is my guess.

Vittoria Elliott: Can you talk to me a little more about what you saw at the VA, and did you feel like it aligned with Musk's and DOGE's assertion that the federal government is inefficient?

Sahil Lavingia: The VA specifically is not that inefficient. Just numerically quantifiably, the VA is giving out hundreds of billions of dollars in disability payments and healthcare and is staffed. It's about $50 billion a year in wages, so it's about one-seventh of the money goes to the employees. And that includes, by the way, every nurse, too, right. You can't really provide healthcare without nurses, right. So, at the end of the day, VA specifically has a big budget because it provides a lot of services to Americans. And inefficiency, if you define it as the percentage of discretionary spend versus sort of the entitlement spend, is just relatively small. And the only way you can really reduce the size of VA is by cutting entitlement by actually just reducing benefits. And that was never discussed. It was never discussed. At any level, I never heard a conversation around, ""We need to reduce entitlements. That's the only way we're going to get to $1 trillion."" It was like, ""No, we're going to do this by purely using software and cutting contracts,"" which just felt like not really exactly true or possible in any real way.

Vittoria Elliott: Do you think that many of the problems that DOGE's leadership was purportedly out to solve was the result of not really understanding how government works?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah, I think that's a fair point. I mean, I think that at the end of the day, there's a level of rigor. No one really said, ""What if we're wrong?"" It's like we have this unique opportunity to participate in this technological pseudo-coup of the federal government, and this is such a unique time and place, and Elon's here, and this is crazy. No one wants to do the research and learn like, ""Oh, by the way, it's not possible."" And I think there wasn't really a ton of interest in understanding the federal government, the agencies because I think that that would just kind of make things less fun. And I think a lot of it was, as Elon says, the most entertaining outcome is the most likely. I don't think he was necessarily optimizing for the most efficient outcome as much as he was optimizing for the most entertaining outcome.

Vittoria Elliott: I wanted to talk a little bit about the end of your time at DOGE. You obviously have told me and said in your blog that you were fired.

Sahil Lavingia: Mm-hmm.

Vittoria Elliott: Can you tell me what happened?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah, so this writer wrote an article about Gumroad, and he had mentioned... he had sort of had this conspiracy that I had open-sourced Gumroad such that it would make it easier for me to work at DOGE and work for the government because then I could still work on Gumroad stuff without having worked there. Something like that, I think, was his posture. And even though I didn't agree with him, similar to my experience with WIRED, I appreciate his work and his attempt. And so I talked to him about Gumroad and about DOGE, and he wrote an article. He ended up publishing it in Fast Company, and Baris actually texted me about it, and he said, ""Hey, did you run this by anyone at DOGE?"" And I said, ""Nope, sorry. By the way, I didn't... it wasn't meant to be in Fast Company. It's not like I was going out and talking to the press. It was actually his personal blog, and he had a good deal. He sold it, and he made some money. It is what it is."" And I never actually heard back. Actually, that was the last message. It's a day later my [inaudible] access got revoked, and I just stopped getting any VA information, DOGE information, everything just kind of feel like... Basically, I just got ghosted. Basically is what happened was I said the wrong thing, and I just got ghosted for life. And since then, no one has... no one from DOGE has contacted me. The only people who've talked to me about DOGE are people who have left DOGE at this point or plan to join and are curious about my experience.

Vittoria Elliott: And do you know a lot of people who have left DOGE?

Sahil Lavingia: Yeah, quite a few now. Almost all my friends, all my social friends who've joined DOGE, have now left. The only people there are kind of the people I didn't know before I joined all the kind of autistic software engineer-type people.

Vittoria Elliott: Why do you call them autistic software engineer-type people?

Sahil Lavingia: I mean, I don't know if they're autistic or not. It kind of just was a meme, I guess, in the early days of DOGE where someone broke the story of these four or five.

Vittoria Elliott: It was me.

Sahil Lavingia: Was it you? Really? Wow, cool. Well, it was just this meme on Twitter that sort of the face of DOGE became these sort of very young, what looked like this sort of archetypal Silicon Valley software engineers who just worked all the time, slept where they worked, this kind of the very startupy vibe, wore hoodies, that sort of thing, call it dropouts, focused on the work, not very engaging on a personal level, was hard to converse with this kind of 19-year-old Silicon Valley engineer that is more focused on shipping code than basically anything else.

Vittoria Elliott: Were most of the engineers young?

Sahil Lavingia: Yes. There were only... There's only one other engineer I met who was over the age of 30, a woman actually. So it was me, her. We were kind of like the boomers or something. And then it seemed like every other engineer was really young, between the ages of 19 and 25 sort of, which I think makes sense. At the end of the day, you're moving to DC, you're saying no to getting paid lots of money. And so it ends up sort of filtering out, unfortunately, filtering out a lot of really great software engineers. The best software engineers I've ever met, never... they all considered working for DOGE. I've talked to some of the best software engineers literally in the world, and they're all, ""I considered it, but I couldn't move to DC or I couldn't work full time.""

Vittoria Elliott: I mean, sort of in that vein, it sounds like that's a mistake you felt DOGE made in terms of eliminating maybe really great talent. Were there other... Are there any other mistakes that you feel like DOGE made?

Sahil Lavingia: I think the biggest mistake that DOGE made was just not admitting when it made mistakes. And it felt like DOGE had sort of picked a side and was not willing to sort of give anything to the other side if they pointed out a mistake. And I think I wish DOGE did a better job of informing the team and the public, ""What have we tried, what worked, what didn't work."" I think, generally, I think speaking, it lacked a feedback loop. It sort of said, ""We're going to work on these projects no matter what. We're going to save a trillion dollars by cutting contracts and reducing the force no matter what."" And I think that's not how you succeed. So yeah, I think lots of things DOGE could have done better.

Vittoria Elliott: How would you rate DOGE's success in the government so far?

Sahil Lavingia: I mean, relative to what Elon, I think, I don't know if he promised it, but this idea that we could save trillions of dollars just on a numerical basis. I think DOGE will save best-case low hundreds of billions of dollars. So even best case, it's sort of like 10 or 20 percent, which is like an F grade in high school. But I think in terms of if you measure it from the average impact a single person had, it can be quite positive. Like I was able to save the VA, let's say, $10 million a year. That's pretty good for 55 days, like $10 million a year in savings. Hopefully, more than that over time as my code continues to do its thing. So I think, as an individual, I was able to be very impactful. DOGE as an entity, I think, was not as successful as they wanted to be, and it was successful in the way that Trump wanted it to be successful, which is I think it was able to absorb a lot of the heat. And Trump is amazing at being the current thing and taking up all the headlines. And I think DOGE was very successful in helping him stay of mind and let his team do whatever they wanted to do, like cut USAID, etc., without them taking the heat for it and letting DOGE and Elon take the heat.

Vittoria Elliott: Well, thank you so much for your time.

Sahil Lavingia: You're welcome.

Zoë Schiffer: Thank you so much for that conversation, Tori. Just one last question before we go. Where do you think DOGE goes from here?

Vittoria Elliott: I think what we're really seeing in this moment of real tumult and transition is this. One of the things that Sahil says is that Trump really benefited from the visibility of DOGE and Musk and the fact that it kind of seemed to run in a parallel track from the administration, right. And so that meant that the unpopular things that DOGE was doing kind of were getting pinned on Musk and not the administration as a whole. But the reality is that cutting down the number of federal workers, cutting down the number of federal contracts, combining data sets to enforce the immigration agenda, that's all stuff that the Trump administration kind of wants to be doing with or without Musk. And I think the future of DOGE is that those projects, which really line up a lot with some of the stuff in Project 2025, are going to continue and are going to be supported by the administration. It's just that without someone like Musk really being very public about it, without the shock and awe of these young guys being brought in to execute on these ideas that it likely will continue, but it's just kind of going to be the government now.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced on Monday that it had taken several enforcement actions against North Korea's money-making operations, which rely on undercover remote IT workers inside American tech companies to raise funds for the regime's nuclear weapons program, as well as to steal data and cryptocurrency.  

As part of the DOJ's multi-state effort, the government announced the arrest and indictment of U.S. national Zhenxing “Danny” Wang, who allegedly ran a years-long fraud scheme from New Jersey to sneak remote North Korean IT workers inside U.S. tech companies. According to the indictment, the scheme generated more than $5 million in revenue for the North Korean regime.

Wang is accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft. 

The feds also indicted eight more people who participated in the scheme: six Chinese nationals and two Taiwanese citizens, who are accused of conspiring to commit wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft, hacking, and to violate sanctions. 

“Thousands of North Korean cyber operatives have been trained and deployed by the regime to blend into the global digital workforce and systematically target U.S. companies,” Leah B. Foley, U.S. Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, was quoted as saying. 

From 2021 until 2024, the co-conspirators allegedly impersonated more than 80 U.S. individuals to get remote jobs at more than 100 American companies, causing $3 million in damages due to legal fees, data breach remediation efforts, and more. 

The group is said to have run laptop farms inside the United States, which the North Korean IT workers could essentially use as proxies to hide their provenance, according to the DOJ. At times, they used hardware devices known as keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) switches, which allow one person to control multiple computers from a single keyboard and mouse. The group allegedly also ran shell companies inside the U.S. to make it seem like the North Korean IT workers were affiliated with legitimate local companies, and to receive money that would then be transferred abroad, the DOJ said. 

The fraudulent scheme allegedly also involved the North Korean workers stealing sensitive data, such as source code, from the companies they were working for, such as from an unnamed California-based defense contractor “that develops artificial intelligence-powered equipment and technologies.”

The DOJ said the FBI carried out searches earlier in June on 21 locations across 14 states, which were allegedly hosting laptop farms used by the North Korean scheme. The FBI seized 137 laptops as a result of the raids.

The feds also said they seized at least 21 web domains, 29 financial accounts used to launder tens of thousands of dollars, and more than 70 laptops and remote access devices, including KVMs.

Five North Korean nationals were indicted for wire fraud and money laundering after they stole more than $900,000 in crypto from two unnamed companies, thanks to their use of fake or stolen identities, the DOJ said.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is restructuring the company's AI efforts to center around building  AI “superintelligence.” 

Going forward, all teams working on AI at Meta will fall under a new group called Meta Superintelligence Labs, according to Bloomberg, which viewed an internal memo sent Monday. 

Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data labeling startup Scale AI, will lead the group as chief AI officer. He'll partner with former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who will oversee Meta's AI products and applied research, per Bloomberg.

Zuckerberg has been working hard to get ahead of the artificial general intelligence (AGI) race, mainly by acquiring AI companies and employees from top AI firms. Earlier this month, Meta invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI, bringing on Wang in the process.

In addition, Zuckerberg has also been able to lure 11 new AI researchers from competitors, according to the report, including some previously unreported hires such as Google DeepMind principal researcher Pei Sun and Anthropic engineer Joel Pobar.

Tailor, a San Francisco- and Tokyo-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform, has raised $22 million in a Series A funding round. Investors include ANRI, JIC Venture Growth Investments (JIC VGI), New Enterprise Associates (NEA), Spiral Capital, and Y Combinator.

ERP systems typically come with a single interface that includes all the necessary functions, but this can be inflexible and restrict customization options. In contrast, a “headless” ERP system separates the front end (user interface) from the back end (ERP core), co-founder and CEO of Tailor, Yo Shibata, told TechCrunch. The back end manages key functions of the ERP system, like inventory management and accounting, allowing for independent selection or development of the front end.

This setup lets Tailor's system, Omakase, allow AI agents to securely access its ERP system via API to automate tasks such as summarizing customer histories or triggering workflows, he added.

The industry has many competitors, including giant legacy companies such as SAP and Oracle, as well as vertical SaaS tools like Crater and Stitch. Shibata believes Tailor's position as a “headless,” highly customizable option will give it a competitive advantage.

“As coding becomes increasingly commoditized and AI agents handle more of the operational load — already around 50% and growing toward 90% — businesses want systems that can be composed, not hardcoded,” Shibata said. “We believe the future of ERP is modular, programmable, and built for a world where humans and machines collaborate seamlessly.”

Tailor's product, available in the U.S. and Japan, originally targeted retail and e-commerce customers as these industries face specific challenges arising from dynamic supply chains, market expansion, and uncertain geopolitical factors, Shibata told TechCrunch. Omakase automates workflows and manages businesses' operations like inventory, fulfillment, finance, purchasing, and omnichannel management.

But the company is now receiving a high volume of inquiries from other sectors like B2B and expanding its services to non-e-commerce or retail companies as well, Shibata said.

“B2B operations are far more complex than B2C businesses, as they involve not only selling inventories but also managing future orders, advanced orders, and more,” Shibata said. “[They] might want to personalize some of their product lineups, which will then add more complexity to the operational side.”

Shibata, a former McKinsey consultant and serial entrepreneur, and Misato Takahashi, CTO, founded Tailor in 2021. The startup has grown to approximately 50 employees in Japan, the U.S., and several other countries as of today, up from just 10 in 2022.

As for its long-term plan, the CEO said, “Rather than offering a rigid, all-in-one suite, we provide a modular, API-first platform that companies can assemble and adapt to fit their exact needs, similar to how Shopify supports both prebuilt storefronts and headless commerce. Some customers use it out of the box as a full-stack ERP, while others treat it as a back end and build tools or interfaces on top. Our goal isn't to force a one-size-fits-all model — it's to give teams the flexibility to scale and customize ERP around their own workflows and tools.”

The 4-year-old startup plans to allocate the proceeds across three key priorities: U.S. expansion, product development, and Japan operations.

“We're accelerating U.S. expansion by building a dedicated go-to-market team and deepening our presence among mid-sized and enterprise customers,” Shibata told TechCrunch. “Second, we're investing heavily in product development — particularly in extending our ERP modules and AI capabilities. Third, we'll continue scaling our Japan operations, where we already have strong market traction, by expanding our delivery and customer success teams to support growth.”

My view is that university classes should be taught in such a way that students can use AI as much or as little as they desire in order to learn the material. Evaluation should primarily be done in the classroom without access to AI. 90% of the grade in my undergraduate course comes from in-person exams. I don't care how they learned the material. This can be a problem for composition classes, for instance, but the problem existed long before the chatbots.> AI is actually a giant material infrastructure with huge demands for energy, water and concrete, while the supply chain for specialised computer chips is entangled with geopolitical conflict. It also means that the AI industry will beg, borrow and steal, or basically just steal, all the text, images and audio that it can get its spidery hands on.Sure. We don't know yet how the economics will play out. We don't know the actual cost of LLM and other AI services, we only know what companies are currently charging for them, but they're competing for mindshare so the prices are most definitely being held low. To a large extent, the whole thing has demonstrated what can be done in the short-term in the absence of copyright restrictions, and now we have to see the long-term effects of the removal of copyright restrictions.I agree with many of the points in the article but don't understand how that turns into a recommendation to ""resist"".

One of my favourite uses of LLM is the reverse-dictionary, for example:Give me one Saxon and one Romance word meaning ""to write"".Saxon (Germanic origin): scratch — Old English scrætan, linked to marking or incising.Romance (Latin origin): inscribe — from Latin inscribere, ""to write on/in.""Genius!

Give me one Saxon and one Romance word meaning ""to write"".Saxon (Germanic origin): scratch — Old English scrætan, linked to marking or incising.Romance (Latin origin): inscribe — from Latin inscribere, ""to write on/in.""Genius!

This isn't all that new, given that's a play on a Jobs quote about computers.

And LLM doesn't completely remove the ""burden"" of reading the dictionary to make sure the meaning is indeed fitting, but shortcuts the discovery by a lot. Also helps to learn new words, lol. I see it as a supercharged thesaurus.IMHO this applies to all general research, one needs to be an utter monkey to copy LLM generated references without checking them first, so if anything, it trains critical thinking for free.

Tangent:
I've never thought exams should be anything but in-person, but I've also never thought they should be so heavily weighted towards like one or two lucky days, not that that's necessarily what you're suggesting. I recall failing my data structures and algos mid-term that largely consisted of writing syntactically correct java by hand mostly because exams don't really provoke a sense of panic in me, the 3 hours in the evening that the course was didn't turn out to be prime productivity time, so I just kind of got bored and zoned out since I knew it just didn't really matter outside the scope of grades. I think I ended up with a C or something after getting a second shot at the final.I'd later learn I have ADHD, but there were numerous courses where my profs told me they were straight up disappointed I failed so hard, since I evidently stood out as the most engaged in the classroom, handling the course material and assignments just fine, and being a revisitor to the classroom after being a paid developer for years, then in my late twenties. I have no idea how Doctors that clearly have a similar type of attention do it through med school, maybe it's just sufficiently more difficult, enough to stay engaged.There's nothing I can do to provoke a sufficient stress response in an exam environment, and I've basically let it be a thing of the past that comes down to a dice roll whether it's engaging enough, or I get a good sleep the night before, or any number of other uncontrollable variables work out in my favor. Ironically, a persuasive essay in a history class turned out to be perfect.In some sense it does scare me a bit, this prospect of more heavily weighted analog exams, but I don't really see much of a way around it, as long as we continue accepting that the concept of grades and academic performance is a sufficient measure of something worth measuring, rather than the somewhat arbitrary filtering mechanism it became. If my career in software fails, I might have to re-enter into a system that's even more stacked against me than it was, unless it's a hands-on trade presumably.

Yeah. I took some of those classes (they were more common back then) and didn't feel they were a great measure of how much I knew. I give four exams. The students will have seen related questions on the homework and in the lecture prior to taking the exams. Anyone that's been actually learning the material will find the exams easy and those that use AI, get the answers from someone else, or whatever method to get the homework points, will be lost on the exam. At least that's my goal. Teaching is definitely an imperfect art.

I grant that I have no evidence for this claim but: I don't see how it's reasonable to teach a subject with access to such a powerful tool and then to remove that tool to assess what the student has learned. My primary uses for LLM, limited as they may be, are explicitly about things I do not care to know, and I find it difficult to hold in my head how ChatGPT is going to help me learn anything in such a way where my understanding of it and use of that knowledge is not hinging directly on continuing to have access to it. And, more broadly, there's reason to suspect that the student will have access to it after that class ends, so it runs up against that old axiom of school meaning to prepare you for working life.My math classes never interested me, I did the work on calculators whenever possible, and sure I have decent mental math skills, but I still pull out a calculator (app) for everything because... my meat brain just isn't as good at this task as this silicon one, and not only does every smartphone in existence have one, if you really don't want a touchscreen version, they can be had at any retailer in America for like $5-10.

AI can be used in ways that lead to deeper understanding. If a student wants AI to give them practice problems, or essay feedback, or a different explanation of something that they struggle with, all of those methods of learning should translate to actual knowledge that can be the foundation of future learning or work and can be evaluated without access to AI.That actual knowledge is really important. Literacy and numeracy are not the same thing as mental arithmetic. Someone who can't read literature in their field (whether that's a Nature paper or a business proposal or a marketing tweet) shouldn't rely on AI to think for them, and certainly universities shouldn't be encouraging that and endorsing it through a degree.I think the most important thing about that kind of deeper knowledge is that it's ""frictional"", as the original essay says. The highest-rated professors aren't necessarily the ones I've learned the most from, because deep learning is hard and exhausting. Students, by definition, don't know what's important and what isn't. If someone has done that intellectual labor and then finds AI works well enough, great. But that's a far cry from being reliant on AI output and incapable of understanding its limitations.

I think the author presents a one dimensional view of AI bad and fails to see the bigger picture, which is ironic considering all the fine words he uses.I agree that AI tools can potentially weaken some of our lower level cognitive functions, but on the flip side the AI tools also enable us to operate on higher levels of ability, planning, conceptualization and execution.This is undoubtedly a point of inflexion for Universities: they should be working out how they can achieve a new deal for students and society that is far more nuanced and constructive than mere 'resistance' against AI.

The real problem for universities is this: much of what classical academia claims is important is not all that hard for a LLM. Writing ""compare and contrast"" student papers, research which consists of digging through existing texts and summarizing, and writing in a formal style are all things LLMs do. Probably better than most undergraduates.This shakes the philosophical foundations of academia. What are universities for now? Job training? Sorting the winners from the losers? Something else?

>The hegemonic narrative calls for universities to embrace these tools as a way to revitalise pedagogy, and because students will need AI skills in the world of work. A major flaw with this story is that the tools don't actually work, or at least not as claimed.>AI summarisation doesn't summarise; it simulates a summary based on the learned parameters of its model. AI research tools don't research; they shove a lot of searched-up docs into the chatbot context in the hope that will trigger relevancy. For their part, so-called reasoning models ramp up inference costs while confabulating a chain of thought to cover up their glaring limitations.If AI tools do not actually work, how are students able to cheat with them? It seems like that would be a problem that would solve itself - a student would attempt to use AI to cheat, it would fail to complete the assignment, and the student would get a bad grade.

R was a thing, Python was beginning to get popular in the domain, you potentially had all sorts of tech to help with stats.Introduction to stats, no technology was allowed.  Every single problem was done by hand.  Every single quiz and test, no calculators, no multiple choice, just problems to work through by hand.  If you cheated on assignments, you'd obviously fail tests (which were >50% of the course).  Problem solved.  We had to learn without aids.  Second stats course, everything was allowed.  Did all my assignments with R.  The point was simply learning.  First theory, then how it's done on the real world.University absolutely should teach all the theories, concepts and history before AI.  And then it should also teach how to use AI, since it's a thing in the real world.People just need to stop thinking about university as all about grades and check marks, and learn to learn.

We went down the rabbit hole of writing a compiler for this as part of a project I used to work on (Apache Clownfish[1], a subproject of the retired Apache Lucy project).  We started off parsing .h files, but eventually it made sense to create our own small header language (.cfh ""Clownfish Header"" files).Here's some generated code for invoking the CharBuf version of the ""Clone"" method defined in parent class ""Obj"":    typedef cfish_CharBuf*
    (*CFISH_CharBuf_Clone_t)(cfish_CharBuf* self);

The trick#0 you mention is how I made an entire C dialect. Here is a generic binary heap, for example https://github.com/gritzko/librdx/blob/master/abc/HEAPx.h The syntax is a bit heavyweight, but a huge huge advantage is: you get regular C structs in the end, very plain, very predictable, very optimizable. Compiler would eat them like donuts.In the other cases, it is void* and runtime memory sizing and you have to define macros anyway.

There are workarounds for at least two of the problems the author mentions. Naming can be changed from Bar_func(args…) to func(Bar)(args…) with a function name macro that just does name mangling. You can avoid some of the binary bloat by using weak symbols, letting the linker deduplicate functions shared between translation units at link time.There are other problems for generic containers of pointer types however, you can work around them by using a typedef or a type alias.Intrusive data structures are more convenient in C still, but working with them in a debugger is a pain.

There is little benefit in monomorphizing the implementation of a data structure like a linked list where its behavior doesn't depend on the contents of the data it contains (compared to, say, a max heap)

You wake up, alone, on a ship in the middle of space. Where are you? What are you doing there? Are you forgetting something important? Something like, maybe, the fate of the world is in your hands? That's the situation Ryan Gosling finds himself in in Project Hail Mary, the new film from directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, and the first trailer is here.

Set for release March 20, 2026, Project Hail Mary is based on a book by The Martian author, Andy Weir. It's about a professor on a space mission who wakes up with temporary amnesia. Slowly he remembers that he's on a mission that, if unsuccessful, would mean the end of the world as we know it. So he doesn't feel fine. Check out the trailer.

There's so much awesome to go around here, but the first is that Project Hail Mary is the long-awaited return to the director's chair for Lord and Miller. It's been almost 10 years since the team behind 21 Jump Street, The Lego Movie, and Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs directed a feature film, though not for lack of trying, and we've missed them. They've been circling Weir's works for a while, so we have every confidence that they know how to tackle this complex story.

And it is complex. The trailer begins to touch on it, but Project Hail Mary has much, much more going on than meets the eye. For one thing, it's a super nerdy science story a la The Martian about someone trying to survive on brainpower in space. But it goes beyond that too, especially when Gosling's character encounters another ship.

If you want to know more about the story, we reviewed the book back in 2021 and dive more into it there. But, hopefully, this trailer gets you interested enough that you are just circling March 20, 2026, on your calendar to see what Ryan Gosling and the crew have in store with Project Hail Mary.

Anker, one of the leading power bank manufacturers in the world, has issued yet another global recall for five more external chargers this month after discovering a fault that could lead to overheating and melting, presenting a potential fire risk. This is starting to sound like déjà vu. Just this month, Anker recalled 1.15 million units of a separate power bank due to an issue that could potentially set the battery alight.

The company detected these issues after implementing new “enhanced quality assurance protocols” for its past and current products. Anker described the issue as stemming from “a single vendor” for the power cells of some of its products, but didn't reveal the vendor's name or what kind of new testing helped it discover the fault.

Anker has so many power banks under its ever-widening product umbrella you wouldn't be remiss if you looked at the included images and thought one of those was yours. The actual model numbers, including the one from the earlier June 13 recall, include:

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) previously noted the Model A1263 had resulted in 19 reported incidents resulting in two minor burn injuries. If you think you may be one of those with an affected unit, you need to go to Anker's recall page and submit a claim. You need to verify the serial number of your device and provide a picture of the power bank if it's available. Users will either receive a replacement external battery or a gift card equal to the cost of the unit. We don't have a good idea when most of those models were sold, but the company previously said it promoted its PowerCore 10000 between 2016 and 2022.

At this rate, it won't be long until Anker recalls become an annual event. Last October, the company clawed back several Anker 334 MagGo Battery (PowerCore 10K) models due to similar issues with overheating and fire risk. The CPSC noted the total number of units recalled in that case was closer to 2,100, though there were a reported 28 incidents of the banks overheating, catching on fire, or “exploding,” resulting in two injuries where users received burns on their hands. This new, global recall could impact a much wider range of owners. The CPSC has not yet revealed how many units in total are being recalled.

Last December, Anker recalled close to 69,000 of two of its SoundCore and PowerConf Bluetooth speakers over similar overheating issues. Anker makes some of our favorite external chargers, but this rash of recalls makes it much more difficult to recommend. You're better off staying away from the company's older power bank models that could sport the deficient parts causing overheating, or else you may need to invest in a firefighter's uniform next time you want to charge your phone on the go.

Donald Trump has reason to celebrate. In a stunningly rapid reversal, Ottawa has caved to his demands and rescinded a controversial tax aimed at American tech giants, ending a standoff that began on Friday.

“Canada would rescind the Digital Services Tax (DST) in anticipation of a mutually beneficial comprehensive trade arrangement with the United States,” Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne announced in a statement Sunday evening.

Following the announcement, Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump “have agreed that the parties will resume negotiations with a view towards agreeing on a deal by July 21, 2025.”

This marks a stunning and swift victory for Trump, who shocked markets on Friday with a post on his Truth Social platform. He declared that due to Canada's decision to impose the Digital Services Tax on American tech companies, “we are terminating ALL discussions on trade with Canada, effective immediately.”

For Trump, this capitulation provides a much needed political win at a critical moment. His presidency has been defined by an aggressive “America First” trade policy, launching high-stakes trade wars with tariffs on goods from China and Europe. This confrontational style is now coming to a head, as a July 9 deadline approaches for nations around the world to finalize new trade deals with the U.S. or face a new wave of steep, “reciprocal” tariffs. Forcing a key ally like Canada to fold so quickly and publicly sends a powerful message to other negotiating partners.

The victory also helps Trump project strength on the home front after a bruising political showdown. His signature legislative priority, the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” has faced intense criticism, even from former allies like Elon Musk, over its massive spending and deep cuts to popular programs. Having been forced to navigate a fractured Republican party to get the bill through Congress, securing a clear-cut win against a foreign government over an unpopular tech tax provides the administration with valuable positive momentum.

The confrontation centered on Canada's Digital Services Tax. The measure imposes a 3% tax on the Canadian revenue of large digital companies, like Amazon, Google, and Meta. The tax has been in effect since last year, but the first payments are due this Monday, June 30.

“The June 30, 2025 collection will be halted,” Champagne said in his statement.

The tax has been a major point of contention. While Canada is not the only country to implement such a measure, joining nations like France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, the U.S. government views these taxes as unfairly targeting American firms. In recent weeks, a coalition of Canadian and American business groups, along with U.S. tech industry organizations and American elected officials, had signed letters calling on the Canadian government to repeal or suspend the tax.

Prime Minister Mark Carney sought to frame the decision as a step toward a broader, more beneficial agreement. “In our negotiations on a new economic and security relationship between Canada and the United States, Canada's new government will always be guided by the overall contribution of any possible agreement to the best interests of Canadian workers and businesses,” Carney said.

Maintaining 32-bit support will allow Steam to keep functioning on popular Linux distribution


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


The developers behind the Fedora Linux distribution have officially withdrawn their proposal to drop 32-bit support from the OS after severe backlash from the community. Discovered by GamingOnLinux, Fabio Valentini, a member of the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee, clarified in a discussion thread that 32-bit removal from Fedora 44 was ""just the earliest 'reasonable' target"" and wasn't a plan he fully expected to go through.

The programmer was disappointed by the sheer number of commenters responding harshly to the change, saying, ""I was expecting a lot of feedback on this one, but not hundreds of people shouting 'DON'T DO THIS, WHY DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR USERS, I WILL SWITCH DISTROS IMMEDIATELY levels of feedback.""

The backlash stemmed from reports that the change could potentially undermine support for gaming service Steam. The developer said the proposal to eliminate 32-bit support was ""...not some conspiracy to break the 'gaming use case'."" Valentini clarified that the proposal aimed to address specific technical issues that package maintainers and release engineers encounter with Fedora.

""I am disappointed in some of the reactions this !! proposal !! has received, with some people apparently reading it in the most uncharitable way,"" the developer said.



The programmer still believes in the proposal, noting that keeping 32-bit support around won't make the problems the proposal attempted to eliminate go away. 32-bit support is rapidly declining in the industry, and moving Fedora to 64-bit exclusively will give Fedora maintainers and developers more breathing room to work on more important things in the operating system. ""Dealing with widely used software falling out from under our feet won't be fun,"" Valetini said in regards to keeping 32-bit support around for now.

No timeline was provided for when the proposal might be reconsidered. But, given that 32-bit support is being dropped by many software developers in the industry—even Windows 11 no longer ships with a 32-bit version—there's little doubt that Fedora will eventually drop 32-bit support, regardless of the circumstances.

Fedora made headlines last week when the distribution's maintainers announced the proposal to remove 32-bit packages from the upcoming version, Fedora 44. The news startled gamers, as the change had the potential to impact support for Steam, which still relies on 32-bit code, potentially hurting the PC gaming user base running on Fedora. Worse still, the change would also allegedly force SteamOS clone Bazzite to shut down entirely for the same reasons. For now, those users and projects get a reprieve.

DOSBox was cast aside. Bochs did better. But the journey was long and the rewards small.


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


Jace from self-confessed “silly tech” YouTube channel MetraByte has shared a video documenting their attempts to get Windows 95 and Doom up and running on the Sony PlayStation 2. In brief, Windows 95 eventually yielded to attempts to get it to boot, and it was possible to fiddle around in the standard apps, but there was no way Jace could get Doom to launch.

Both these platforms are very long in the tooth in 2025, of course. Windows 95 arrived in 1995, and the PS2 debuted in the year 2000. With its half-decade tech-age advantage, you might expect the PS2 to sail through the Windows 95 and Doom challenge. Indeed, it might have, but the hacky nature of getting x86 code to run on Sony's MIPS machine, plus the well-known foibles of Windows 95, built on DOS, meant there were lots of hurdles.

So, how did Jace do/not do it? It is quite a long story, but Jace condensed tens of hours of coaxing the PS2 to run Windows 95 into less than half an hour (video embedded above).

All Jace's testing took place using a modded PlayStation 2, a game controller with a QWERTY keypad, plus a USB stick and a hard drive inserted into the fat PS2 for storage and data transfer. In parts of the video you can see Jace use a specially prepared USB stick or HDD which packed in the following contents:

Jace's initial time-consuming effort to use DOSBox to achieve their Windows 95 and Doom goals stalled, and after at least “47 attempts” to persuade the vintage OS to boot to desktop, our mad scientist decided to switch to another emulator called Bochs. The former is designed primarily for enjoying simple games, where the latter is billed as an accurate (and slower) general-purpose x86 emulator.

If you watch the full video, you will almost feel Jace's pain. Such is the slow and frustrating process of getting an x86 OS onto this MIPS console. Nearly every process took an ungodly amount of time, hampered by limited and slow I/O on the PS2, the emulation layer, and these early editions of Windows sitting precariously upon DOS.

Using Bochs wasn't plain sailing, either. Jace had to deal with a wide range of system hurdles, complaints about read errors, write errors, boot order, drive letter and mounting configurations, missing files, drivers, and more. However, they eventually saw the Windows 95 setup screen appear on their PS2 screen.

In total, it took about “14 hours” to complete the Windows 95 install by Jace's reckoning. Eventually, at the desktop, they managed to run Paint, but it wasn't much fun without a mouse installed. Subsequent attempts to get Doom95 up and running were, not surprisingly, fruitless. Still, we enjoyed the journey.

DISCLOSURES |  June 30, 2025  

The FDA has approved the interferon gamma-blocking antibody emapalumab-lzsg (Gamifant) for the treatment of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) in known or suspected Still disease.

This is the first FDA-approved treatment for MAS in the United States. The indication is specifically for adult and pediatric (newborn and older) patients with MAS in Still disease with an inadequate response or intolerance to glucocorticoids, or with recurrent MAS.

Emapalumab-lzsg was first approved in 2018 for adult and pediatric patients with primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) with refractory, recurrent, or progressive disease or intolerance with conventional HLH therapy.

""With our expertise in primary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, we understand the urgency of managing MAS quickly to improve patient outcomes,"" said Guido Oelkers, PhD, the CEO of the drug's manufacturer, Sobi, in a press release. ""Gamifant is already an established therapy making a meaningful difference for patients with primary HLH, and with this approval, we are excited about the opportunity to positively impact patients affected by MAS in Still's disease.”

The approval for this indication was supported by pooled data from a phase 2 and a phase 3 clinical trial: More than half (54%) of participants had a complete response at week 8, and 82% achieved clinical MAS remission at week 8. 

""With Gamifant now as the first FDA-approved treatment for MAS, we have a new therapeutic option that helps control hyperinflammation and reduce our reliance on high-dose glucocorticoids,” added Alexei Grom, MD, professor of pediatrics and research director in the Division of Rheumatology at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Ohio, in a press statement. 

Emapalumab-lzsg is administered via intravenous infusion and is available in 5-mg/mL and 25-mg/mL solutions in a single-dose vial. For this new indication, the most common side effects are viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus infection or reactivation, or rash.

Patients on emapalumab-lzsg should not receive live or live attenuated vaccines. Healthcare providers should consider prophylactic treatment for herpes zoster, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and fungal infections.

Models using driving and health data to predict 1-year crash risk after the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator showed poor discrimination between individuals who crashed motor vehicles and those who did not. However, such models with good calibration may help guide discussions about crash risk between clinicians and patients. 

Clinical guidelines recommend temporarily ceasing driving after the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator; however, these restrictions can result in social isolation or loss of income. Empirical data to inform such driving restrictions are limited. 

""Clinicians already use clinical intuition and common sense to identify patients at higher risk of SCI [sudden cardiac incapacitation] , reserving their most strident advice to avoid driving for the individuals they consider to be at highest risk,"" the researchers noted.

""Using baseline health and driving data to formally predict post-implantation crash risk and personalize driving restrictions is a strategy that has the potential to strengthen this clinical practice, but our findings suggest this approach is not yet ready to deploy in clinical practice,"" they added.

This study was led by John A. Staples of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was published online on June 24, 2025, in Heart.

This study lacked a direct measure of road exposure, which may have affected the model performance. Data regarding several parameters, including the indication for implantation, were missing at several occasions. The researchers were unable to identify the crashes specifically caused by sudden cardiac incapacitation.

This study received a grant from the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.

The high-dose influenza vaccine demonstrated superior immunogenicity over the standard-dose vaccine in immunocompromised patients, with increased seroconversion rates for H1N1, H3N2, and B strains, while showing similar safety profiles.

""Our data suggest that HD [high-dose] influenza vaccine could be recommended for immunocompromised patients. Future clinical trials including larger sample sizes and analysing clinical effectiveness will be of great interest to provide recommendations for specific immunocompromised populations,"" the authors wrote.

This study was led by Mario Rivera-Izquierdo, School of Medicine, University of Granada, Granada, Spain. It was published online on June 22, 2025, in the Journal of Infection.

This study was limited by the absence of data from some original studies and by the annual change in high-dose vaccine formulations, which may have limited the applicability of the findings to other seasons. The immunocompromised populations included were very specific. Moreover, most studies did not assess the clinical effectiveness of the high-dose vaccine.

This study was supported by the Instituto de Investigación Biomédica de Lleida Fundación Dr Pifarré (IRBLleida). The authors reported having no conflicts of interest.

DISCLOSURES |  June 30, 2025  

Current diagnostic criteria for eating disorders fail to capture a broad range of weight-loss behaviors characteristic of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder that are not captured by current diagnostic criteria, new research suggested.

On the basis of interviews with nearly 1700 patients, investigators identified a wide variety of patient behaviors that are not included in current diagnostic criteria. These range from chewing gum to reduce food intake to more extreme symptoms such as consuming cotton balls to distend the stomach without ingesting calories.

Investigators believe the results highlight the limitations of existing assessment tools and the importance of listening to patients and initiating open discussion about weight-loss behaviors.

“We're proposing an updated eating disorder assessment tool that has a longer, more varied list of behaviors so that there's more flexibility and a more comfortable setting for patients to share their experiences,” lead author Saakshi Kakar, PhD student and lead research assistant, National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, and Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, England, told Medscape Medical News.

The findings were published online on June 17 in the International Journal of Eating Disorders.

Standard eating disorder assessment tools, which include the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and the Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory, may capture restriction-based behaviors such as calorie counting, methods to elicit a diuretic or laxative effect, as well as medical interventions such as bariatric surgery. However, these tools often fail to capture the full range of weight-loss tactics used by individuals with eating disorders, said Kakar.

While clinical interviews that employ tools such as the Eating Disorder Examination offer greater flexibility in assessing key behaviors, they are resource intensive and may not provide an environment conducive to revealing sensitive information, she added.

The goal of the study was to identify and categorize the diverse range of weight-loss behaviors that extend beyond traditional diagnostic criteria and highlight the variability in symptom presentation.

The analysis included 1675 mostly female participants, with an average age of 31.7 years, from two ongoing UK studies: the GLAD study and the EDGI UK study.

All participants had an eating disorder that was either self-reported or identified by researchers using algorithms based on responses to the Eating Disorders 100,000 eating disorder questionnaire.

Using this tool, individuals are asked to expand on weight-loss methods and compensatory behaviors they use to control their body shape or weight. Questions are open-ended and are answered in private, which encourages disclosure of sometimes stigmatized behaviors people may hesitate to share in clinical settings.

In all, 27% of participants had the binge eating/purging subtype of anorexia nervosa, and 13.8% had the restricting subtype of anorexia nervosa. In addition, 53.9% had bulimia nervosa and 4.8% had a binge eating disorder.

The most frequently cited behaviors included structured weight-loss diets such as Atkins (endorsed by 17.7%), calorie counting (12.1%), and restrictive eating (11.1%). However, some participants used less common behaviors such as compression garments (4.2%) and bariatric surgery (4.2%).

From the data, researchers identified four behavior types. These included:

Certain behaviors could be categorized under multiple themes, investigators noted. Smoking, for example, may be considered both a restriction-based approach and a medical intervention, depending on the individual's intent and context.

Kakar noted that, to her knowledge, no previous studies have systematically categorized weight-loss behaviors in this way, making it “a novel contribution to the literature.”

She added that most of the behaviors her team identified are not explicitly included in the current diagnostic criteria.

“While some of these behaviors may be familiar to experienced clinicians, they are not formally recognized in diagnostic manuals — suggesting a significant gap between clinical practice and diagnostic guidance,” said Kakar.

A key finding was that 81 participants with binge eating disorder engaged in weight-loss and compensatory behaviors typically linked to bulimia nervosa.

Kakar noted DSM-5 criteria for binge eating disorder stipulate that binge eating should not be accompanied by recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors.

“This exemplifies the fact that people are possibly missed or misdiagnosed, which means adequate treatment may not be offered,” she said.

Kakar suggested that on the basis of the study's findings, it may be time to update eating disorder criteria in the DSM-5, although she recognizes this would require further research.

In a secondary analysis, researchers isolated responses from participants with different eating disorders. The most frequently reported weight-loss behaviors and resulting themes did not differ among eating disorders.

In addition, an analysis examining the results according to gender showed weight-loss behaviors endorsed by men closely mirrored the broader sample.

The findings underscored the importance of considering all possibilities when assessing for an eating disorder, Kakar said.

Kakar emphasized the importance of moving beyond brief, proscriptive checklists in clinical assessments. Instead, she said physicians should engage in open-ended conversations with patients about the strategies they use to lose weight or control body shape, noting that this approach can reveal behaviors that might be overlooked by standard screening tools.

Kakar also plans to work with clinicians and individuals with eating disorders to create a more robust list of weight-loss behaviors that can be used by clinicians as well as in research settings.

A limitation of the study was that researchers didn't assess whether the identified behaviors are associated with clinically significant distress or impairment. In addition, the study sample was mostly White, women, heterosexual, and highly educated.

Commenting on the findings for Medscape Medical News, Genevieve Nowicki, a counseling psychology PhD candidate at Northeastern University, Boston, who has studied eating and body image issues for the past 8 years, said the study provides additional evidence of the evolving nature of eating disorder behaviors.

Nevertheless, she added, it might be helpful to “zoom out” and consider the broader picture including context, motivation, and frequency of a weight-loss behavior. This approach may be less daunting for providers than trying to keep up with an ever-expanding list of behaviors, she said.

“There are potentially an infinite number of things that people with, and without, eating disorders can do to modify weight, shape, or appearance,” Nowicki said.

Nowicki noted that while it's important for clinicians to recognize specific weight-loss behaviors, it can be more effective — and less overwhelming — to take a broader view. Considering the context, motivation, and frequency of these behaviors may provide deeper clinical insight.

She believes current DSM-5 eating disorder criteria are “intentionally broad” in order to include all potential compensatory or purging behaviors. Self-report tools alone can't be expected to capture the full spectrum of eating disorder behaviors, said Nowicki.

The study received funding from the NIHR Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust and King's College London. Kakar and Nowicki had no relevant conflicts of interest.

New research from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and La Jolla Institute for Immunology, published today in Nature Microbiology, reveals an opportunity for developing a therapy against cytomegalovirus (CMV), the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the United States.

Researchers discovered a previously unappreciated mechanism by which CMV, a herpes virus that infects the majority of the world's adult population, enters cells that line the blood vessels and contributes to vascular disease. In addition to using molecular machinery that is shared by all herpes viruses, CMV employs another molecular ""key"" that allows the virus to sneak through a side door and evade the body's natural immune defenses.

The finding might explain why efforts to develop prophylactic treatments against CMV have, so far, been unsuccessful. This research also highlights a new potential avenue for the development of future antiviral drugs and suggests that other viruses of the herpes family, such as Epstein-Barr and chickenpox, could use similar molecular structures to spread from one infected cell to the next while avoiding immune detection.

If we don't know what weapons the enemy is using, it is hard to protect against it. We found a missing puzzle piece that represents one possible reason why immunization efforts against CMV have been unsuccessful.""

Jeremy Kamil, Ph.D., senior author, associate professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Pitt

In the United States, approximately one in every 200 babies is born with congenital CMV infection. Of the babies infected, one in five will have birth defects, such as hearing loss, or go on to have long-term health challenges. For most adults, CMV infections are asymptomatic. But a CMV infection during pregnancy presents significant health risks to the unborn child and could be deadly for people who are immunosuppressed, including organ transplant recipients.

Because of the large size of its genome and its complicated molecular machinery, CMV long evaded attempts to develop prophylactic treatments. Similar to other herpes viruses, CMV relies on a protein called gH to enter cells of the vessel lining. But unlike other herpes viruses, which use a protein partner called gL to facilitate infection, the new study found that CMV replaces gL with another partner called UL116 and recruits a protein called UL141. The resulting complex of gH-UL116-UL141, called GATE by the authors, then becomes an alternative tool for breaking into cells lining the blood vessels and causing internal damage while simultaneously preventing the body's own immune system from recognizing the signs of infection.

The newly discovered GATE could become a potential vaccine target for CMV and other herpes viruses.

""Previous attempts to generate a CMV vaccine have failed, but that was before we identified the GATE complex. We hope that new strategies targeting GATE will improve our chances to combat CMV infection, and also perhaps cleanse our bodies of this lifelong infection,"" said Chris Benedict, Ph.D., associate professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and co-senior author of the study with Kamil and LJI professor, president & CEO Erica Ollmann Saphire, Ph.D., MBA. ""If we can develop antiviral drugs or vaccines that inhibit CMV entry, this will allow us to combat the many diseases this virus causes in developing babies and immune-compromised people.""

Even small drops in national income can significantly increase the risk of various forms of childhood malnutrition- not only undernutrition but also overweight and obesity, shows a study led by the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal), an institution supported by ""la Caixa"" Foundation. The study, published in Lancet Global Health, identifies pregnancy and the first 1,000 days of life as especially vulnerable periods where targeted interventions can make a big difference.

One in four children worldwide lives in severe food poverty. And many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) now face an increasing double burden of malnutrition, characterised by the coexistence of undernutrition alongside overweight or obesity.

Given the multiple crises the world is currently facing, we need to better understand how economic shocks and poverty influence malnutrition in children, in order to better design interventions and prevention strategies."" 

Davide Rasella, ICREA researcher at ISGlobal and coordinator of the study

The authors analyzed data from over 1.6 million children across 68 LMICs to understand how early exposure to economic downturns affects nutrition. They combined 230 national household surveys with economic data from the World Inequality Database. This allowed them to track each child from birth to the first 1,000 days of life, and to identify economic downturns across different income groups within each country. 

""Our analysis is the first to account for economic heterogeneity within each country and look at critical time windows and different forms of malnutrition, including overweight and obesity,"" says Natanael Silva, predoctoral researcher at ISGlobal and first author of the study.

The researchers used the child's height, weight and age to identify different forms of malnutrition, sometimes combined in the same child: stunting (too short for their age), wasting (too thin for their height), overweight and obesity. 

The analysis revealed the following patterns: 

A fall in income during the year a child was born raised the risk of stunting, especially when the economic drop was severe. Income shocks at birth were also associated with an increased risk of both wasting and stunting in the same child, suggesting that economic instability during pregnancy can have profound effects on early life.

Income shocks in the year of the interview were mainly associated with child wasting, defined as a rapid loss of weight, reflecting short-term changes in diet quality or quantity, as well as illnesses.

Children who experienced an economic shock during their first 1,000 days of life (a critical period for growth) had a much higher risk of becoming both stunted and overweight - a 30% increase in risk. Even mild economic downturns were linked to increased risks of this double burden of malnutrition. 

Finally, the effects varied by income level: income shocks generally had a greater adverse impact on undernutrition among the poorest, while wealthier households also saw an increase in obesity and overweight. 

""Our findings show that income shocks can significantly increase the risk of various forms of childhood malnutrition, and help identify critical windows for action,"" says Rasella. The authors urge policymakers to develop targeted interventions to safeguard maternal and child nutrition, especially during times of economic hardship.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:news-medical.net","New tool reveals hidden water patterns in protein structures","https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250630/New-tool-reveals-hidden-water-patterns-in-protein-structures.aspx","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:48:00 GMT","

Every protein in the body is encased in a water shell that directs protein structure, provides vital stability and steers function. Because of this, water molecules represent a powerful but largely underappreciated foothold in drug binding studies. Yet structural data about these water networks, usually collected at freezing temperatures, often carry temperature-based structural artifacts. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital scientists have unveiled a new computational tool called ColdBrew to address this problem. The tool leverages data on extensive protein water networks to predict the likelihood of water molecule positions within experimental protein structures, potentially aiding drug discovery efforts. ColdBrewwas published today in Nature Methods.

Proteins have evolved to fold precisely according to the repulsion and attraction of their amino acid building blocks to water. Water is also key to their activity since it helps guide other molecules, including drug molecules, to bind effectively. Drug discovery efforts based on protein structures use techniques such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, but these techniques use freezing, or ""cryogenic"" temperatures, which can distort how water molecules appear. Marcus Fischer, PhD, St. Jude Department of Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, recognized this as a missed opportunity. 

Water molecules in protein structures have so many degrees of freedom that drug discoverers typically throw them out. They're kind of inconvenient.""

Marcus Fischer, PhD, St. Jude Department of Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, corresponding author on the study

To put this lost information to work, Fischer and first author Justin Seffernick, PhD, St. Jude Department of Chemical Biology & Therapeutics, developed ColdBrew. ""Our goal was to make a tool that's easy to use and understand,"" said Seffernick. ""For each water molecule, our method can tell us how likely water is to be present at higher temperatures. We also found that this same metric can give us clues about how ligands bind to proteins.""

This is particularly important to drug discovery. ""When ligands bind to proteins, they kick out water from binding sites, so we need to pay attention to them in ligand design,"" said Fischer. ""Encouragingly, we've seen in our data that our predictions were best within these binding sites and around ligands."" 

Considering that cryogenic structure-solving techniques can artificially increase the number of water molecules present in a structure, a tool such as ColdBrew can assure researchers that seeing is believing. To this end, Fischer and Seffernick have amassed and made publicly available a comprehensive library based on ColdBrew calculations. 

""To enable the wide use of ColdBrew, we performed calculations on every structure that fit our criteria in the entire Protein Data Bank.

Women's Soccer

On a steamy Sunday afternoon in Cincinnati's TQL Stadium, the U.S. women's national team took the field for the 765th time and delivered another emphatic victory, 4-0 against Ireland.

Like their Thursday meeting with Ireland in Commerce City, Colorado, Sunday's match featured four different goal scorers in Lynn Biyendolo (who wore the captain's armband to start the match), Izzy Rodriguez, Yazmeen Ryan and Alyssa Thompson.

Sunday's victory was a special one as it marked the program's 600th win. It also continued a recent trend of increased offense. Since February, the team has netted 15 goals across eight friendlies. In the June window alone, the team cruised past Jamaica 4-0 and defeated China 3-0 before the pair of 4-0 wins against Ireland.

In the 11th minute Sunday, forward Emma Sears delivered a perfect cross to Biyendolo, who opened the scoring tally with a clean volley to the back of the net. Just before halftime, Kansas City Current defender Rodriguez, who earned her first cap and first start, pounced on a rebounded ball in the box and hammered home a half volley to double the U.S. lead.

Ryan also netted her first international goal in the 66th minute when she received a pass from Olivia Moultrie and snuck the ball past a crowded penalty area. And Thompson, who scored against Ireland in their Thursday night meeting, needed just six minutes after subbing on near the end of the match to find the back of the net again.

40 years of setting the standard.40 years of raising the bar.

That is the U.S. Way. pic.twitter.com/Y7gXl9fRtH

— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) June 29, 2025



“Everybody's meant to be here. If you were not meant to be here, you wouldn't be here,” Biyendolo told TNT's analysts postgame. “But take a deep breath and just play hard. One thing that is non-negotiable in this team is just effort. So when things are going right, just put in the effort. … Take a deep breath and let's just play and play with joy.”

Biyendolo's words echoed the ethos coach Emma Hayes is installing leading up to the 2027 World Cup.

Hayes is still molding the team in her image and is not afraid to give new faces a chance. She rolled out a completely different starting XI from Thursday's game. It was the second time in her short tenure with the team that she made wholesale changes between games, something that hadn't happened in nearly a quarter-century before her arrival. The last time the USWNT rotated all 11 players between matches was 2001, according to the U.S. Soccer data. It's now happened twice just this year.

It's a bold approach, and one that speaks to Hayes' long-term vision.

Hayes handed first senior caps to two new faces: midfielder Sam Meza and left back Rodriguez. Meza and Rodriguez become the 281st and 282nd players to represent the USWNT, and notably, the 13th and 14th players of Hispanic descent to do so, a meaningful footnote in a squad long criticized for its lack of Latino representation.

“I feel like everybody is not just trusting the process, but they're carrying out all the things we asked them to do,” Hayes said after the game in Cincinnati. “I thought Sam Meza was outstanding in the pivot position. I thought Izzy grew into the game, showed her quality deliveries.”

She called defender Jordan Bugg, who just turned 18 and started this match, “a super football player.”

Also we promise we didn't forget Alyssa Thompson's goal in the 86th minute!!#USWNT x @VW pic.twitter.com/GaQ9OmyKRH

— U.S. Women's National Soccer Team (@USWNT) June 29, 2025



Of the rotation, Hayes acknowledged that it's “not easy to go and change a team to 11 and perform and raise a bar, but the players did that, and I'm extremely proud of them.”

For this busy week, Hayes gave her Euro players a break, except for Naomi Girma, who plays for Chelsea, the only European-based player on the roster. Her intentions to rest players accordingly extended to the pool of camp players as well, especially those easing their way back from injuries. Girma was subbed off during the second half of Thursday's match and didn't play at all on Sunday, while midfielder Rose Lavelle, a Cincinnati native who recently returned to the USWNT after recovering from an ankle injury, was not subbed on until the 85th minute in her hometown game.

“Emma put me in as a cameo at the end, it was always the plan,” Lavelle said. “It is always great to be back home … We have one more game, but it was a fun camp.”

Sunday's game was the USWNT's second of three that will take place within the span of a week. Next, the team heads to Washington, D.C. where it will face Canada on Wednesday at Audi Field.

UCLA Bruins star Lauren Betts makes almost anyone look small next to her. The All-American center took at trip to Cincinnati, Ohio, to watch the U.S. Women's National Team take on the Republic of Ireland and posed with one player who had to jump for the photo.

The 6-foot-7 Betts was a force for the Bruins, leading them to the team's first-ever Final Four appearance. She averaged 20.2 points, 9.5 rebounds per game and was awarded the Naismith award as the Defensive Player of the Year.

She's been working hard to recruit her 6-foot-4 sister to the team, rocking some amazing fits like her cutoff jean shorts and blazer combo and her casual Los Angeles Dodgers look.

As she continues to enjoy her offseason, she went to support another women's team in the USWNT on Sunday where they presented her with a no. 51 Betts jersey and she posed with 5-foot-4 Rose Lavelle, who had to jump to try and be as tall as Betts for the photo.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=men's+us+soccer","USMNT defeats Costa Rica in Gold Cup: Matt Freese, Damion Downs are PK shootout heroes","https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/tourneys/2025/06/29/usmnt-costa-rica-how-to-watch-gold-cup/84376471007/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 01:41:15 GMT","

The U.S. men's national team defeated Costa Rica in a thrilling Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal that went to a penalty shootout at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday, June 29.

The USMNT prevailed in the shootout, 4-3, after the two teams were knotted up a 2-2 after 90 minutes (there is no extra time in the Gold Cup until the final). The penalty shootout went to a sudden-death sixth round. After U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese stopped Andy Rojas' attempt, Damion Downs — a 20-year-old making just his second USMNT appearance — put his attempt past Costa Rica's legendary shot-stopper Keylor Navas for the victory. Freese made three saves in the penalty shootout, and nearly made saves on two other attempts.

In regulation, the game was a back-and-forth tussle. Costa Rica opened the scoring early on a penalty kick. Diego Luna answered later in the first half with his first USMNT goal. Early in the second half, Max Arfsten scored his first USMNT goal before Costa Rica answered in the 71st minute with an equalizer that eventually forced the game to go to a penalty shootout.

Tyler Adams, Malik Tillman (who had a penalty shot miss in the first half half of the game), Alex Freeman and Downs each made their penalty shootout kicks to give the U.S. the win.

The U.S. will face Guatemala — a surprise winner over Canada in another penalty shootout — in the Gold Cup semifinals on Wednesday, July 2 in St. Louis (7 p.m. ET on FS1). Mexico takes on Honduras — which upset Panama — in the other semifinal.

USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights from Sunday's USMNT-Costa Rica quarterfinal at the Gold Cup. Scroll below for the recap:

The Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal ended regulation tied at 2-2, and the game immediately goes to a penalty shootout (no extra time until the final). As the USMNT's Matt Freese faces the pressure of his first national team knockout penalty shootout, the veteran Keylor Navas gives Costa Rica a goalkeeping advantage.

After a high-flying start to the second half, the U.S. has gotten a bit sloppy in possession. Costa Rica finally made the USMNT pay for letting its opponent hang around.

U.S. goal keeper Matt Freese made a save on Carlos Mora's attempt, but the rebound returned to Mora who dished it to Alonso Martinez, who knotted up the score at 2-2 in the 71st minute.

Now, Costa Rica has snagged the momentum in this spirited Gold Cup quarterfinal. With Keylor Navas between the pipes for Costa Rica, the last thing the U.S. wants if for this one to go to a penalty shootout. There will be no extra time if the game is tied after regulation.

It didn't take long for the U.S. to take the lead in the second half.

Some delicious soccer-football play from the squad eventually led to the ball at the feet of a wide-open Arfsten in the box. Arfsten slid the shot past Keylor Navas and the U.S. took a 2-1 lead right after intermission.

Arfsten has rebounded nicely from his foul that led to a penalty, assisting on Diego Luna's equalizer and now scoring to put the USMNT into the lead.

Despite giving up the opening goal via penalty kick, the USMNT has been the more dangerous of the two squads throughout the first half.

That pressure finally paid off in the 43rd minute when Diego Luna got his shot past Costa Rica's legendary goalkeeper Keylor Navas.

Luna — nicknamed the ""Moon Man"" — adeptly collected Max Arfsten's pass inside the 18-yard box and banged his shot past a diving Navas and into the back of the net. For Arfsten, it has to feel good to contribute to the goal after his foul resulted in Costa Rica's first score on a penalty kick.

The USMNT wasted a golden opportunity in the 37th minute to tie up the score, but Malik Tillman pushed his penalty shot off the left post.

A kerfuffle followed the play as emotions are running high at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. Costa Rica's Kenneth Vargas and U.S. defender Chris Richards were issued yellow cards for their involvement in the pushing and shoving.

The penalty shot was awarded after Tillman was clipped inside the 18-yard box by Juan Pablo Vargas and the play eventually went to VAR. A yellow card was issued to Juan Pablo Vargas for his foul on Tillman.

Getting a goal past Costa Rica's 38-year-old goalkeeper Keylor Navas — arguably still the best 'keeper in Concacaf — will be a challenge for the USMNT.

In the 18th minute, Diego Luna attempted an acrobatic shot, but it didn't challenge Navas as the ball sailed over the crossbar.

A reckless challenge by USMNT defender Max Arfsten inside the 18-yard box on Kenneth Vargas resulted in a penalty shot goal by Costa Rica's Francisco Calvo in the 12th minute.

U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese nearly stopped the shot, but Calvo was able to get the shot through inside of the post.

This is the first time that the U.S. has trailed in this year's Gold Cup tournament. Let's see how this largely inexperienced squad responds to early adversity in this quarterfinal match.

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal between the USMNT and Costa Rica is set to kick off at 7 p.m. ET, with the teams meeting at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis.

USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino has gone more or less back to the group that navigated the first two Group D games comfortably, with one interesting wrinkle: Luca de la Torre and Sebastian Berhalter have been joined by Tyler Adams, hinting at a wide role for Malik Tillman.

We'll see how it plays out, but right now it looks like a more combative, defensively sound 11 for the USMNT.

Whatever is wrong with the U.S. men's national soccer team, and pull up a chair because there's lots to discuss, diversity isn't it.

That's not just an aspirational statement. There are studies to prove it. In fact, researchers who've looked at both club and national teams across the world recently found diversity actually made squads better. — Nancy Armour

Alex Freeman, a 20-year-old defender who plays professionally for Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer, is the son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman.

Antonio Freeman spent eight of his nine NFL seasons with the Green Bay Packers, helping the team win Super Bowl XXXI. In that victory, Freeman had an 81-yard touchdown reception.

Alex Freeman, who was born in Baltimore, Maryland, signed a homegrown deal with Orlando City in 2022. He made his debut with the team on April 29, 2023 during a win over the LA Galaxy. Alex Freeman made his USMNT debut as a starter in the team's 2-1 defeat against Turkey on June 7.

The Gold Cup is a biennial tournament for national teams in the North and Central American and Caribbean region associated with Concacaf. Mexico (nine times), the U.S. (seven times) and Canada (one time) are the only nations to have won the Gold Cup. Mexico won the last Gold Cup competition in 2023.

Inter Milan are lucky to have a wonderful pair of forwards in Lautaro Martinez and Marcus Thuram. 

However, against this Fluminense back five, they have been completely lost and Inter have lacked any creativity to get them into the game.

Chelsea are just three games away from winning the Club World Cup and adding more silverware to their impressive first under Enzo Maresca.

The Blues have already been crowned Conference League champions alongside returning to the Champions League for the 2025/26 campaign, however have not been able to rest yet.

Maresca has admitted he has needed to rotate his players in the United States, with extreme weather conditions playing a part in the tournament.

Chelsea's 4-1 win over Benfica in the Round of 16 was overshadowed by a two-hour delay to proceedings due to thunder and lightning. Cole Palmer was bemused at the situation, just like many other players were.

When they came back they were forced to go through extra time, where goals from Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall put the game beyond doubt.

The Portuguese star stayed composed to fire home his third goal of the competition on the counter attack, and has made himself one of the first names on the teamsheet out in the States.

His performances seemed to catch the eye of Bruno Lage before the Blues faced the Portuguese side. The Benfica manager described Neto as one of the best in the world before their meeting.

His displays at the Club World Cup have left it hard to disagree with him. In fact, according to WhoScored, Neto has been the best performing player in the competition so far.

He will be looking to keep his excellent goalscoring record up when the Blues take on Palmeiras in the early hours of Saturday morning.

One of their opponents at the weekend, Estevao Willian, is set to join the Blues at the conclusion of the tournament, and provide competition for the wingers in the squad.

As well as that, Chelsea are expected to announce the additions of Jamie Gittens and Joao Pedro in the coming days, with Pedro to join the players at the Club World Cup.

Both are going to be expecting minutes when they arrive at Stamford Bridge, putting pressure on those already at the club to perform.

However, Neto's performances are showing to Maresca that he should be one of the shoo-ins for a role, as the Italian faces a nice headache next season.","{'href': 'https://www.thechelseachronicle.com', 'title': 'The Chelsea Chronicle'}","soccer"

Last 16: Flamengo 2-4 Bayern Munich

Gerson 33, Jorginho 55pen; Pulgar 6og, Kane 9 73, Goretzka 41

A World Cup is a better place for the Brazilians, but this one has lost two in 24 hours. The day after Botafogo fell to Palmerias, Flamengo departed too, cut down by Harry Kane.

That sea of red and black will be missed and their team will too: the side who beat Chelsea showed that was not by chance, as they made a game of this one, scoring twice at the Hard Rock Stadium, their fans banging drums and their coach declaring his pride at how they had played. But it was Bayern Munich who progressed.

“It is about moments and we took our moments very well,” the England captain said. “We stayed calm, and scored our goals at the right time.” He scored two of them, finally securing a victory when he scored his second with quarter of an hour left, a goal which, in his own words, “eased the last 10 minutes” of an afternoon that had been far from easy. His brace, a Leon Goretzka strike and an Erick Pulgar own goal saw it finish 4-2, setting up a meeting with Paris Saint-Germain in the last eight.

For Flamengo there was a noisy farewell and as they wound their way down the ramps at the end, songs echoed off the stands. Filipe Luís, the coach, said that they they had in the end been beaten by a “superior team”, a “real colossus” but that they had played their way. Their way was good too, good enough that they may feel that justice was not entirely done and reflect on the part they played in their own downfall, even if Luís insisted that the errors that proved decisive in the end were forced by an opponent that is “absolutely elite”. They racked up more shots than Bayern, yet also slipped 2-0 and 3-1 down in the first half and, ultimately left too much to do. When Kane added the fourth, it was done.

The first of Bayern's four came after just six minutes and two more followed before the break, aided by an apparent nervousness about their opponents when pressure was applied and a willingness to take risks playing out. Agustín Rossi had already been forced to backpedal to reach an inswinging corner, seen a clearance hit Pulgar to set up a Joshua Kimmich shot, and gratefully watched a punch away hit a black balloon rather than setting up another dangerous delivery when they conceded an own goal opener. Jumping by Goretzka, the hint of a hand in his back, Gonzalo Plata succeeded only in deflecting the ball off the top of his head and into the net.

Flamengo responded fast, Plata escaping up the right where they advanced often and delivering a cross from which Giorgian de Arrascaeta's header flew just past the post. There was an aggressiveness and determination to Flamengo that went with the noise their supporters brought and underlined that this would be a proper game. It was, too, even if Bayern were soon two up when Kane took advantage of Dayot Upamecano's steal, turned and hit a 25-yard shot that flew in off the post, a deflection taking it away from Rossi.

There had been fortune in that and Flamengo certainly would have been entitled to feel unlucky to trail by two then and even more so a moment later when Manuel Neuer made an extraordinary save from Luiz Araújo, flashing out a strong right hand that had he and Kimmich celebrating. Next Leo Pereira struck wide. And not long after that, Araújo superbly controlled somewhere up near his neck, spun and volleyed wide. When Gerson belted a shot first time screeching right through Neuer's hands to make it 2-1 on half an hour, Flamengo had deserved it.

The problem for Luis's side were those moments Kane mentioned. Within five minutes, Bayern had scored again, although another poor clearance set it up. It came to Goretzka, lurking outside the area. He controlled on his chest, took one touch and then, despite the distance, opened up his body to disguise the direction of the shot and calmly yet firmly side-footed into the corner.

Flamengo kept coming, and got back in it early in the second half when Michael Olise blocked a cross with his arm to concede. A hop, a pause, and without a look Jorginho sent Neuer the wrong way, side-footing his penalty into the corner. Soon Bruno Henrique escaped behind the Bayern defence, but couldn't guide his shot on target. The Brazilians behind the goal sensed an opportunity – “the fans are a big part of it,” Kane said after – and roared their team on but then came another of those moments, another error ruthlessly exposed.

Dribbling out from deep, Araújo just about escaped the first challenge but couldn't escape the second. Konrad Laimer won the ball, Kimmich gave it to Kane and that was only going to end one way, the finish so clean, the job done his way.","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Filipe Luis had staked his hopes on the right mix of European thought and Brazilian heart.

Speaking in his pre-match press conference at Hard Rock Stadium, Flamengo's bright young coach revealed he had used Bayern Munich as a tactical reference for his own style of play and even admitted he had copied one or two things, particularly in the realm of pressing. But he also spoke about the fierce competitiveness of Brazilian players, how the extreme pressure they are routinely subjected to from fans and media in their homeland could be weaponised.

“I have no doubt that the strength, the mentality that Brazilian players have formed during all these years means we can equalise this difference in quality with extreme competitiveness,” he insisted. “Because for Europeans, winning this championship won't change their lives, but for South Americans, it would certainly change our lives if we won this championship.”

Filipe Luis was not entirely proven wrong by the events of Sunday's feisty FIFA Club World Cup last-16 game in Miami. The 39-year-old's smart and sophisticated Flamengo team went toe-to-toe with Bayern, kept the ball from them for long stretches and made them deeply uncomfortable with the fluidity of their attacking movement. They also chased loose balls and flew into tackles with a ferocity that delighted the thousands who turned up at the Hard Rock to sing and cheer in red and black.

The problem was that none of it particularly mattered against a Bayern team loaded with individual talent, and this motivated to bring it to bear on the pitch.

Flamengo are unequivocally good. They are reigning Brazilian champions, are very well coached, and were almost certainly the best non-European team at this tournament. They are also, unsurprisingly, no match for an elite European side. Bayern could not meet their South American opponents' athletic intensity in every minute of the stifling Miami heat, but they picked their spots to move through the gears, force opposition errors and punish them ruthlessly.

All four of their goals sprang from winning the ball deep in the Flamengo half. The first two also benefited from slices of fortune that make an upset impossible when they favour the favourite: a Joshua Kimmich corner glancing off the head of Erick Pulgar and into his own net, followed by a Harry Kane shot that glanced off the shin of Leo Ortiz, then off the post.

Bayern's third and fourth goals underlined their overwhelming individual quality.

Leon Goretzka intercepted a feeble Pulgar clearance about 25 yards from goal and rather than close out to him, three Flamengo players decided to block off the corner of the net to the left of goalkeeper Agustin Rossi. He calmly ran onto the ball and whipped a looping shot into the opposite corner.

In the second half, Kane scored from the type of chance he has converted hundreds of times in his career: a ball into his feet in the box, one touch to bring it into his stride and another to place a firm low shot well beyond Rossi's left hand. It was Bayern's fourth shot on target of the match, and their fourth goal.

Flamengo never gave up and there was a 19-minute stint in the second half, between Jorginho's trademark penalty and Kane's clinical finish, when a shock began to feel possible. But in the end, the fierce Brazilian competitiveness Filipe Luis had invoked only served to help make a broader statement about where the knockout rounds of this Club World Cup are heading.

After a vibrant group stage in which South American teams lost just three of 18 matches and seven non-European sides made it to the round of 16, football's natural (and by that we of course mean largely financial) order began to restore itself on the tournament's third weekend in the United States.

Bayern move on to the quarter-finals to face European champions Paris Saint-Germain, who earlier on Sunday destroyed Inter Miami so quickly, comprehensively and mercilessly that well before the end, it had become less than ridiculous to feel sympathy for the plight of Lionel Messi. Chelsea's absurd weather-delayed defeat of Benfica in Charlotte on Saturday may have been an all-European affair, but it still adhered almost perfectly to UEFA's club rankings.

Palmeiras are the only non-European team already through to the last eight, where Estevao and his current team-mates will face his future Chelsea ones as clear underdogs. Of the four round-of-16 ties still to be played, Inter, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund will all be heavily favoured to advance.

Within the space of one weekend, the Club World Cup, which appeared to have no obvious script, has suddenly positioned itself to follow the most predictable one of all, assuming the form that most always assumed it would eventually take: that of a summer Champions League, played out in higher temperatures and emptier stadiums with stranger kick-off times and a smaller, but still entirely familiar, European cast.

It cannot be overlooked that the dominance of Europe's elite clubs is built in no small part on their ability to attract and to retain the best talent from the rest of the world. “The best player in the world was at Flamengo and is not here (now),” Filipe Luis said on Saturday, referring to Real Madrid superstar Vinicius Junior.

“He went to Europe to play with the best teams in the world, with a higher salary, with better prestige, to play in better competitions.”

There is hope that revenue from Club World Cup participation can help clubs like Flamengo keep their best players for a little longer, though many of the European clubs taking them away are also getting richer in the United States this summer. More likely is that this new competition, which some hoped might disrupt football's established order, simply ends up reinforcing it.

World Cup

Football's global players union has urged FIFA to abandon plans for midday and afternoon kick-offs to avoid the heat in three “extremely high risk” venues at next summer's World Cup.

A report by FIFPRO, which represents more than 70,000 professional players worldwide, identified Kansas City and Miami, along with Monterrey in Mexico, as cities that carried “extremely high risk” of heat-stress injury if World Cup matches are played in the afternoon.

Atlanta, Dallas and Houston were also identified in that category due to high temperatures and humidity, but FIFPRO expects retractable roofs and climate-control technology to be used there to reduce the risk to players and spectators.

Another five World Cup host cities were cited as “very high risk” (Boston, Philadelphia and Guadalajara) or “high risk” (Los Angeles and New York/New Jersey). Only San Francisco and Vancouver were classed as “low risk”.

Weather conditions have disrupted this summer's Club World Cup in the U.S., with FIFPRO saying that the matches between Chelsea and Esperance de Tunis, and Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid, should not have been allowed to kick off in such extreme heat in Los Angeles at midday local time.

FIFPRO has made representations to FIFA about kick-off times, but the union's leadership fears “commercial interests” — driven by a pressure to satisfy a huge global TV audience, particularly in Europe and Asia — will hold sway in some cases.

Professor Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPRO's medical director, told reporters on a Zoom call on Monday: “From our research, a couple of cities and some matches on the ongoing Club World Cup can be labelled as having a higher risk for heat-related illness, or, in the worst case, extreme high risk for heat related illness.

“There are certain areas in a country that will be more at risk. So think about match destinations such as Orlando or Miami, for example, where you can see over a period of years that there's a higher risk attached to these venues and destinations.

“The question is, if we look at match scheduling and match planning ahead of the tournament, if we actually need midday kick-off times in these locations or in these high-risk areas — if we should probably move towards late kick-off times as a preferences for these venues.”

FIFPRO general secretary Alex Phillips said some of its recommendations for the Club World Cup had been taken on board by FIFA, but others — including around kick-off times — had been rejected.

FIFA is due to settle on its match schedule for the World Cup after the draw for the finals is made in December. There will be further conversations with FIFPRO over the months ahead, but the union says its powers are limited.

“I think based on this experience (of the Club World Cup), it (FIFA) is likely to be more flexible, but we have absolutely no power to force them to,” Philips said.

“We can only use informal pressure and good argumentation. We don't really have any coercive right.

“FIFA have actually modified how they've been dealing with heat during the (Club World Cup) matches, based on the FIFPRO outfit. Obviously it would have been if that had happened in advance, but it's better than they have adapted and they've put in place various different mitigation measures. There's additional water around the pitch, towels and so on.”

Dr Gouttebarge said one proposal being trialled is the extension of the half-time break — from 15 to 20 minutes — to help players hydrate and cool down. He also proposed shorter but more frequent in-game cooling breaks, suggesting that the three-minute break used at the Club World Cup (generally at 30 and 75 minutes) are less beneficial.

Union says 20-minute pause could be ‘significant'

Temperatures at tournament have exceeded 40C

Half-time breaks should be extended to 20 minutes in extreme heat, the global players' union has said. Fifpro is calling for extra measures to protect footballers after what it describes as the “wake-up call” of the Club World Cup, which has been plagued by extreme temperatures over the past two weeks.

Fifa protocols allow for a cooling break lasting for three minutes in each half if temperature thresholds are exceeded. According to Fifpro's medical director, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, an extended half-time break would provide a necessary additional tool in helping to keep players' core temperatures within their normal range.

“A cooling break generally lasts three minutes and they are designed to decrease the [player's] temperature through the use of ice,” he said. “But we are lacking the evidence in terms of what is the optimal duration for a cooling break. A half-time of 15 minutes might not be enough to decrease the core temperature. So a lot of research is being done into alternative mitigation strategies and it could be that a half-time of 20 minutes is significant. It has been shown [to work] in the laboratory. Together with the national [players'] union in Portugal, we are going to test this kind of mitigation strategy in August.”

Complaints from players and coaches at the Club World Cup over temperatures in the US that have breached 40C have been a theme of the tournament. Fifpro's general secretary, Alex Phillips, said the organisation had been engaging with Fifa over the issue during the past fortnight and that progress had been made.

“We are partially happy because Fifa have been quite responsive once the tournament was under way,” Phillips said. “So they have actually modified how they have been dealing with heat during the matches based on Fifpro's input.

“Obviously, it would have been better if that had happened in advance, but it's better that they have adapted and they've put in place various different mitigation measures. There's additional water around the pitch, towels and so on, and the threshold for the cooling breaks has come down. So there has been a positive reaction from Fifa, which is good.

“But going forward, it's not just Fifa. It's any competition organiser staging tournaments in this kind of heat. Their protocols [need to] reflect more of the good practice in Australia, US and other countries that deal with this week after week in their national leagues.”

In the US, for example, they do not stage MLS games at midday in Florida and in Australia there are thresholds for the delay or postponement of matches.

Philips also warned that European football would have to get used to hot weather dictating that international tournaments are played in the winter. “I think the evolution we've seen in recent years is basically the football is played 12 months of the year,” he said. “So winter, summer, European winter, we're going 12 months a year, unfortunately.”

Alexander Bielefeld, Fifpro's director of policy and strategic relations, said: “I think the scheduling discussion is an important one for the years to come. And it might not just relate to, let's say, off-season breaks of the players but also to other issues that relate to player welfare or safe attendance by spectators, or the performance on the pitch.”","{'href': 'https://www.theguardian.com', 'title': 'The Guardian'}","soccer"

Monday's match between Inter Milan and Fluminense in the Round of 16 at the FIFA Club World Cup may not be the best advertisement for soccer.

Neither side plays a fascinating brand of football, preferring to win matches through tough defense and physical play.

There's still star power in this match, particularly on Inter's side, but it would be a bit of a surprise to see this one develop into a see-saw match.

That suits Fluminense just fine, as the Brazilians played two nil-nil draws in the group stage, with the other result being a 4-2 victory over South Korean outfit Ulsan FC. 

Like they did against Borussia Dortmund, you can expect Fluminense to do everything in their power to take the sting out of this match, knowing that they're unlikely to outplay Inter in a high-event contest. 



Inter is perfectly fine with playing in the mud, but they'll try to crack this match open, but that won't be an easy task against this defense and in the heat at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte. 

Inter's offensive output in this tournament – five goals and 7.2 expected goals (xG) – is among the best in the field, but they're taking on a defense that has allowed the second-fewest xG through the group stage. 

It will be tough sledding for either offense to break through, which allows us to build a same-game parlay correlated to this being a snoozer.

France international Dembele was once a team-mate of fellow World Cup winner Messi at Barcelona. They spent four years together in Catalonia, prior to the Argentine icon making his own move to PSG in 2021.

They have now been reunited at the Club World Cup. Champions League winners PSG faced MLS Cup hopefuls Inter Miami at the last-16 stage of that competition, and the European heavyweights from the French capital ran out 4-0 winners in Atlanta.

Messi swapped shirts with former team-mate Achraf Hakimi at the final whistle, but also handed a jersey, his shorts and boots to Dembele after linking up with another familiar face behind the scenes.

Messi was all smiles despite suffering a one-sided defeat to PSG, with Dembele saying in a social media message to the South American GOAT: “Good to see you again @leomessi, the greatest of all time. I hope you continue to make history with the @intermiamicf like in this World Club.”

Messi, who is no stranger to shirt swaps, will be turning his attention back to MLS action as Dembele - who is considered to be a leading contender for the 2025 Ballon d'Or - prepares to face Harry Kane and Bayern Munich in the Club World Cup quarter-finals.","{'href': 'https://www.goal.com', 'title': 'Goal.com'}","soccer"

The Argentine's current deal expires at the end of 2025 and he has reportedly put fresh contract talks on hold.

Bayern Munich made their way into the next round of the FIFA Club World Cup following a thrilling 4-2 victory over Flamengo. The Bundesliga side will face a tougher test, though, in the quarter-final as they set to meet the reigning Champions League winner, Paris Saint-Germain.

The Bundesliga outfit was facing a tricky last-16 battle as Flamengo had won their group, beating Chelsea in the process. However, Bayern managed to showcase their quality from the start and went 2-0 up in less than 10 minutes.

An own goal from Erick Pulgar and Harry Kane's strike put the Bavarians in the driving seat early on, before Flamengo pulled one back through Gerson. Bayern regained their two-goal advantage just before the half-time break with a goal from Leon Goretzka, giving them a comfortable lead going into the second period.

The Brazilian side did not give up easily as they kept pushing hard and managed to make it 3-2 thanks to Jorginho's spot kick on 55 minutes. However, Bayern eventually sealed their victory with another goal from Kane, who netted home on 73 minutes.

In the next round, Bayern will be facing PSG, who earned a comfortable 4-0 victory over Lionel Messi's MLS outfit. The Ligue 1 giant immediately put their opponent under pressure and opened the scoring after just six minutes through João Neves.

After a series of missed chances, Luis Enrique's men finally doubled their lead, once again from Neves' goal. The newly crowned UCL winner made it 3-0 from Tomas Aviles' own goal, before Achraf Hakimi sealed their victory in stoppage time.

PSG lowered their intensity in the second half, but it was more than enough to maintain their 4-0 victory. The French side will be gearing up for a tougher battle in the quarter-final against Vincent Kompany's Bayern Munich.

Benjamin Bonzi wasted little time in notching the first major upset at Wimbledon, where he stunned ninth seed Daniil Medvedev 7-6(2), 3-6, 7-6(3), 6-2 on Monday.

The former Nitto ATP Finals champion, Medvedev, is currently 16th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. His opening-round defeat to Bonzi at Wimbledon comes after a second-round defeat to #NextGenATP Learner Tien at the Australian Open and a first-round loss to Cameron Norrie at Roland Garros last month.

Competing on the hottest opening day ever recorded at the grass-court major, according to the Met Office, the World No. 64 Bonzi's precision and patience from the back of the court proved too much for Medvedev during their first-round clash. He also overpowered Medvedev with a relentless barrage of serving.

 “This is special for me today,” said Bonzi in his on-court interview. “This is my first Top 10 win at a Slam. Obviously, it is always special at this tournament. The atmosphere, all the courts and the grass, everything really. I love this place, so it's very special and Daniil is a great player. He has reached two semi-finals. I knew it was a tough match, but sometimes it is better to play this kind of player in the first round. Anything can happen, so I'm very happy with the win.”

With his three-hour, seven-minute victory, Bonzi is into the second round at Wimbledon for the third time in his career. It marks the first time in seven SW19 appearances that Medvedev has failed to advance past the first round.

Bonzi struck cleanly from the baseline and found great success behind his own serve, which proved clinical in the first and third set tie-breaks. After improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Medvedev and earning the second Top 10 win of his career, the Frenchman will next face Jordan Thompson.



 Nicolas Jarry also notched forged a Top 10 upset on Monday, although the Chilean took the long way around to overcome eighth seed Holger Rune. Having come through qualifying to earn his main-draw spot at SW19, Jarry rallied to a 4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 triumph on No. 3 Court. It was his first main-draw win at a major since he reached the third round at the 2023 US Open. 

 “I'm very happy for today,” said Jarry, who was 0-5 in five-set matches prior to his victory against Rune. “It was a tough start to the match, but at the end I was able to play the game I played since the beginning of qualifying. I'm happy to gain that, to overcome all the bad thoughts in my head, and all the demons. It was a difficult challenge, so I'm so happy to be here.” 

 Jarry's second-round opponent will be Learner Tien, who prevailed 7-6(5), 6-3, 6-2 against his fellow #NextGenATP American Nishesh Basavareddy. Jarry defeated Tien in the pair's only previous competitive meeting, a qualifying match in Halle earlier this month.

 Joao Fonseca continued his habit of making an immediate impact at the majors with a classy debut showing Monday at Wimbledon. 

 The #NextGenATP Brazilian raced past home favourite Jacob Fearnley 6-4, 6-1, 7-6(5) to become the first 18-year-old to reach the second round at the grass major since Carlos Alcaraz in 2021. Competing in the sort of stifling heat he would be used to at home in Rio de Janeiro, Fonseca produced a powerful display throughout and kept his cool in his only real moment of peril, when set point down at 5-6, 30/40 in the third set. 

 “At the beginning of the match both of us were very nervous, just making our serves and there were no rallies,” reflected Fonseca, when asked about his first impressions of stepping out to compete on the All England Club's Court 1. “It's just a beautiful court. It's unbelievable, it's a dream. I'm just very happy to have had this opportunity.” 

 “I've been working a lot and believing I can play good tennis. I think the key is [to] work, believe, and dream.” 

Wise words from the young star 🌟@Wimbledon | #Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/JGZzRVK4hp

 Prior to January's Australian Open, Fonseca had not played a main-draw match at a Grand Slam tournament. Yet the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion stunned then-Top 10 star Andrey Rublev in Melbourne to announce himself on the world stage. After lifting his maiden ATP Tour title in February in Buenos Aires, the Brazilian then reached the third round of a major for the first time at Roland Garros. 

 Even with those recent standout performances in mind, the way Fonseca dismantled Fearnley at Wimbledon was impressive. Although he played qualifying for the event last year, the teenager had contested only four tour-level matches on grass prior to Monday's clash. He nonetheless had no trouble bringing his clean-hitting game to his least-familiar surface against Fearnley. 

 Joao Fonseca, It All Adds Up: 





 Fonseca produced red-hot streaks to claim each of the first and third sets. He won nine straight points from 4-4, 0/40 to win the opener, before reeling off five straight points from 2/5 in the third-set tie-break to complete his win. 
 The Brazilian's serve was the foundation of his two-hour, one-minute victory. He won 84 per cent (54/64) of points behind his first delivery, while his 31 winners included 11 aces. 
 With his victory, Fonseca rose three spots to No. 51 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. He now leads Fearnley 2-0 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having also prevailed in their first-round clash in Indian Wells in  March. 
 “It means a lot. It's super special for me,” said Fonseca in his on-court interview. “It's my favourite Grand Slam since my childhood. I've been watching all the matches, so it's just a pleasure being here. I'm sorry for winning against a British guy, but thanks a lot for the support here. Thanks for respecting the tennis today. Jacob is a great friend, a great player and I'm looking forward to my next meetings against him.”

Tommy Paul's road to Wimbledon has been anything but smooth. The American suffered an abdominal injury during his run to the Roland Garros quarter-finals, forcing him to miss the ATP 500 event at The Queen's Club, where he was the defending champion.

“When I got home, we were kind of struggling to figure out if it was ab, adductors, kind of everything was hurting in that area,” Paul said to a small media huddle on Saturday in London. “I jumped onto the court after three, four days. And it clearly wasn't ready. So we ended up taking another 10 days off.

""We then practised a little bit and kind of figured out what the problem was and I was able to get six days rest before coming over here, making the decision to sign up for Eastbourne and playing Wimbledon.  Obviously, it is not the ideal prep that you want for a Slam.

“It sucked missing Queen's Club. I love that tournament,” Paul later added. “This is the first year I haven't really prepped for grass too much.”



Paul finally arrived on UK soil a little more than a week ago but couldn't find his winning groove in Eastbourne, falling to British wildcard Daniel Evans in his first grass-court match of the season. Still, the American found positives amid the setback.

“Physically, [I feel] a lot better,” Paul said. “Obviously, not perfect. I don't think anyone is ever really perfect in the Slams. But it was nice to be home for a little bit and reset. I got a match in last week and I was actually kind of happy with how I played. I could've moved better. But overall, with Evans, I thought the quality of the match was pretty good. So, that's all I really wanted to come into Wimbledon. I didn't really exhaust myself the week before. Now we're here at Wimbledon, and there is no better place in the world to be. So, I am excited to get started.”

Despite growing up in the United States, where grass-court tennis is a rarity, Paul has quietly built a strong resume on the surface. In 2023, he reached the final in Eastbourne, then backed it up last year with a title at Queen's Club and a quarter-final showing at Wimbledon, his best result at the All England Club.
He is not alone in the American charge on the surface. Taylor Fritz lifted his fifth grass-court trophy in Eastbourne just days ago, while Ben Shelton reached the semi-finals in Stuttgart earlier this month.
“Mostly Americans grew up on hard courts, and we are still more exposed to clay court tennis than grass. The Brits and Australians are really the only countries that grew up playing tournaments on grass. For us, we don't really see it. I just think we don't have as much time on the surface compared to Brits or Australians,"" Paul said when asked about his thoughts on grass. ""But I think it is such a special surface. Everything is so different about the way you move, the way the ball goes through the court. The balls are different. Everything is different. I think it takes experience on the surface.”
Like many of the top seeds at Wimbledon, Paul is settled into a rented house in southwest London with his team. The setup is quiet and familiar: home-cooked meals, streaming shows, and, when matches begin, plenty of Wimbledon viewing.
Paul is hoping his routine can help aide him on court, with the American determined to find his A-game despite recent setbacks.
“I want to win. I don't like losing in any situation. I am a competitive guy. I want to win and I am not coming into the tournament like, ‘I'm going to play Wimbledon, if I lose it's okay.' I am going to give it my best, and I feel like I have prepared as well as I can in this situation,” Paul said. “I am excited to see how it all goes and from there get ready for the US Open Series. It is not like I am showing up just to show up.”
Paul's Wimbledon campaign kicks off Tuesday when he faces British wild card Johannus Monday. Further down the track, a blockbuster fourth-round showdown looms with World No. 1 Jannik Sinner. Paul was not willing to look too far ahead when asked about his draw but left the Wimbledon media centre with a simple message.
“There is no better place in the world to be.”

Fabio Fognini produced such a memorable performance Monday at Wimbledon against Carlos Alcaraz, the 38-year-old is considering making it his last match.

The nine-time ATP Tour singles champion had already made clear this would be his final season and therefore his last appearance at Wimbledon. But after pushing the second seed to five gripping sets on Centre Court, he is thinking about leaving the sport on a high.

“I think this probably [the] best way to say [goodbye] to Wimbledon, and maybe for the tennis. That's what I'm thinking now,” Fognini said. “I am happy for sure. I have a lot of emotion coming to my mind. Yes, was super amazing atmosphere over there. I enjoyed [it] a lot.”

Fognini is a player who always wears his heart on his sleeve. The former No. 9 player in the PIF ATP Rankings is never afraid of showing the world how he feels on the court. But the Italian pulled back the curtain further than normal when explaining how much the moment meant to him.

“I have to be honest, I cried in the locker room. I cried,” Fognini said. “I didn't expect [to] play five sets against him. I have to be honest. The way I was coming here, I [had] no expectation because since I started the year this year, after the injury, I was playing really bad. I didn't win so many matches…

“I said before, there is no better way to play in this court with a great champion that I have a lot of respect with him and for his team, because I know them very, very well.”

Alcaraz has now won a personal-best 19 consecutive matches, but for much of his clash with Fognini, the Spaniard was left scrambling for answers. Fognini, who once stunned Rafael Nadal in five sets at the US Open, was not far from ousting Alcaraz at SW19.

“To finish here, I can't ask a better way. Now, of course, there is something that is salty in my mouth because I had my chance, if we [are] speaking about tennis,” Fognini said. “In the beginning of [the] fifth set, still there. But okay, he's a champion, he won two times here. At the moment I think he's probably the best player in the world. He played against Jannik one month ago [an] amazing final, so all the respect for him.”



It was even more meaningful for Fognini considering he entered the match on a 10-match tour-level losing streak. It was not only proof for himself, but for the world, that on his day the Italian could test anyone on the circuit.

“I was looking good, I think. [It] was great. I mean, if we make an analysis of the match, I think I lost the first set, and I didn't deserve to lose the first set. Then I was [a] break down, and I won the second,” Fognini said. “He won the third. But I was up again 2-1 with [a] break. This is probably, if we can say, the worst game when I was up with my serve. Then I won very good the fourth one.

“Yes, the beginning of the fifth set was completely s***. I didn't deserve I think being 4-Love in the fifth set like that because I was 40/15 in the second game, I lost that game. I was 15/40, and I lost the game. I was 40/15 again and I lost the game. I didn't deserve to be 4-Love down, at least 2-2. But I played with Carlos, I didn't play with my friend or with [my son] Federico.”

She's got style, she's got grace, and Carson Branstine also has one heck of a serve. 

The 24-year-old tennis up-and-comer will face the top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon on Monday as Branstine looks to make an impact in her first showing at the All-England Club.

She's currently ranked 197th in the world and has already made a bit of a name for herself during a dominant collegiate tennis career at Texas A&M and the story of how she's funded her pro tennis career through modeling has captured the public's attention.

Branstine had described modeling as “a cool little side hustle” and a way to fund herself on the WTA tour without having to burden her parents for any financial help, she explained to a small gaggle of reporters recently, which included Clay and Wimbledon's website. 

“I love being in front of the camera during a shoot. It's fun, I love fashion. It's been one of the reasons I've been able to pay some of my trips. I didn't want to ask my parents for anything — I wanted everything to come from me and from my tennis,” she explained. 

Branstine has signed with two agencies and her social media is a mix of her tennis and modeling activities. 

The American-born Canadian tennis player suggested there was one big similarity between tennis and modeling in her eyes: “You are an object a lot, and people sometimes forget you're a person too.”

Despite injuries over her career, Branstine still found plenty of success during her days at Texas A&M and helped the program win a national championship in 2024. 

Away from the court, Branstine studied Society, Ethics, and Law, with a double minor in Philosophy and Sports Management, and even assisted an attorney for one year. 

“I did family law shadowing a lawyer, which was very emotional,” she said. 

Following her tennis career, Branstine would like to return to law school and eventually start a family. 

But directly in front of her is a chance to pull off a major upset at Wimbledon. 

She previously had defeated top-seeded  Lois Boisson to start the qualifying and expressed immense confidence in herself. 

“Maybe not everyone knows who I am, but I believe I can beat anyone. I know my game can stand up to anyone's, and I'm glad I can show that now,” she said.

Meet The Women's Tennis Player Turning Heads At Wimbledon This Year originally appeared on The Spun.

Wimbledon 2025 is officially underway on Monday morning.

The first round for the Men's and Women's Singles is underway on this Monday, June 30. Carlos Alcaraz will be looking to take home the title on the men's side after winning the French Open, while No. 1 seed Aryna Sabalenka will be looking to take home the trophy on the women's side.

ESPN will have full coverage of Wimbledon this year.

Sabalenka, 27, is currently taking on unseeded Carson Branstine. The Canadian tennis star has made headlines coming into Wimbledon this year. Branstine is a former collegiate tennis star turned professional model turned Wimbledon contender.

Branstine, 24, played college tennis for the Texas A&M Aggies. She helped lead the SEC program to a national championship during her redshirt senior season in 2024.

The Canadian tennis star has since turned pro. She has a career record of 133–71 and had a career-high world ranking of No. 190 set in May of 2025.

Branstine has been trending on social media, too. She has more than 30,000 followers on Instagram.

""Nice to meet you Wimbledon,"" she wrote coming into the 2025 tournament.

Branstine admitted that she is very grateful for everything that tennis has given her over the years.

“This sport has given me everything,” she told Wimbledon. “It gave me a free college education. My best friends play tennis. I've gotten to see the world and travel the world, not just as a tourist, but with a purpose. And that's something I take to heart, a lot.

""I really enjoy this game. It's giving me everything and I think that's why in some of these big moments, I was able to pull through in the last few weeks because I really enjoy being out there. It's so much fun.”

Branstine has been doing some modeling on the side, too. It's helped pay for her tennis career.

“A cool little side hustle,"" she admitted.

Branstine is all about tennis this week, though.

Of course, she has her work cut out for her as she attempts to take down the No. 1 overall seed in the tournament.

2-seed Carlos Alcaraz celebrates after winning match point against Fabio Fognini in the first round at Wimbledon. (0:26)

WIMBLEDON, England -- Carlos Alcaraz, locked in a five-set struggle at Centre Court, looked toward his coach Monday and shouted something about how Fabio Fognini -- 38, retiring after this season, winless in 2025 -- looked as if he could keep playing until he's 50.

""I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon,"" Alcaraz said later, ""because the level he has shown, he can still play three or four more years. Unbelievable.""

The two-time defending champion at the All England Club needed to go through more than 4 1/2 hours of back-and-forth shifts against the much-older and much-less-accomplished Fognini before emerging with a 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 victory in the first round.

It wasn't supposed to be that tough.

Consider, to begin with, that the No. 2-seeded Alcaraz is 22, already a five-time Grand Slam champion, including his latest at the French Open three weeks ago, and is currently on a career-best 19-match winning streak.

Consider, too, that Fognini has never been past the third round at the All England Club in 15 appearances and reached the quarterfinals at any major tournament just once -- way back at the 2011 French Open. He entered Monday ranked 138th and 0-6 this year.

There were times Monday when Alcaraz appeared to be something less than his best, far from the form he displayed during his epic five-set, 5 1/2-hour comeback victory over No. 1 Jannik Sinner for the championship at Roland-Garros.

Alcaraz double-faulted nine times. He faced a hard-to-believe 21 break points. He made more unforced errors, 62, than winners, 52.

He chalked some of that up to nerves.

""Playing the first match at Centre Court, and the first match of every tournament, is never easy,"" said Alcaraz, who beat Novak Djokovic in the 2023 and 2024 finals at that arena. ""I've been practicing pretty well. I've been playing on grass really well. But Wimbledon is special. It's different.""

Only twice has the reigning men's champion at Wimbledon been beaten in the first round the following year -- Lleyton Hewitt in 2003 and Manuel Santana in 1967.

Next for Alcaraz will be a match Wednesday against Oliver Tarvet, a 21-year-old British qualifier who plays college tennis at the University of San Diego and is ranked 733rd.

Still, Alcaraz said: ""I have to improve in the next round.""

Fognini -- whose wife, 2015 US Open champion Flavia Pennetta, held one of their children in the stands -- is a self-described hot-head and is known for mid-match flareups, including at Wimbledon, where he was fined $3,000 in 2019 for saying during a match that he wished ""a bomb would explode at the club"" and a then-record $27,500 in 2014 for a series of outbursts. He was put on a two-year probation by the Grand Slam Board in 2017 after insulting a female chair umpire at the US Open and getting kicked out of that tournament.

Such behavior wasn't displayed Monday. And when Alcaraz pushed a forehand long to cede the fourth set, Fognini nodded toward his guest box, where a member of his entourage stood to snap a photo with a cellphone. Things were picture-perfect for Fognini at that moment.

But at the outset of the fifth -- the first time the previous year's male champ was pushed that far in the first round since Roger Federer in 2010 -- Alcaraz recalibrated.

When the Spaniard broke to lead 2-0 in that set with a backhand volley winner, he pointed toward the stands, threw an uppercut and screamed, ""Vamos!"" In the next game, he saved a pair of break points, before the match was paused for more than 10 minutes because a spectator felt ill amid record-breaking high temperatures for Day 1 of Wimbledon.

When they resumed, Alcaraz outplayed Fognini the rest of the way.","{'href': 'https://www.espn.com', 'title': 'ESPN'}","tennis"

2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu ousted her 17-year-old compatriot Mingge (Mimi) Xu in the first round of Wimbledon, their home Grand Slam, on Monday. Raducanu will face another Grand Slam titlist in the second round -- 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.

Emma Raducanu's latest Wimbledon campaign started off without a hitch, as the Grand Slam champion eased past one of her rising compatriots who hopes to follow in her footsteps.

Wimbledon: Scores | Order of play | Draws

In an opening-day clash on Court No. 1, former Top 10 player Raducanu moved past 17-year-old wild card Mingge (Mimi) Xu 6-3, 6-3, booking a spot in the second round of her home Grand Slam for the fourth time in her four main-draw appearances.

Raducanu needed 1 hour and 25 minutes to prevail in Monday's battle of the Britons. It was the first time two British women faced off in the first round of Wimbledon since Anne Keothavong (now the current Billie Jean King Cup captain for Great Britain) defeated Naomi Broady in 2011.

A post shared by WTA (@wta)

Grand Slam experience pays off: Raducanu knows what it's like to have career breakthroughs as a teenager. At age 18, she made her Grand Slam main-draw debut here on home soil at 2021 Wimbledon, and raced to the Round of 16.

Her teenage dream reached a fever pitch in her second Grand Slam main draw at the 2021 US Open. There, still only 18 years old, she won 10 straight matches to become the first qualifier in the Open Era to win a Grand Slam singles title.

World No. 40 Raducanu continues to excel when kicking off majors. She is now 11-2 in Grand Slam first-round matches throughout her young career.

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

Tale of the match: Raducanu was in charge from the jump on Monday, bookending the first set with service breaks in the first and last games. Raducanu never faced a break point and hit only four unforced errors in the opening frame.

World No. 318 Xu, making her Grand Slam main-draw debut, found more winners in the second set (13, compared to her eight in the first set). Xu broke her more experienced countrywoman two times in that set.

However, Raducanu ended a flurry of five straight breaks with a forehand winner down the line to lead 4-2, and she was untroubled on serve after that.

Raducanu slammed an unreturned serve to close out her first match point and return to the second round. All told, she won three-quarters of her first-service points, and she finished the match with 25 winners to 12 unforced errors.

Vondrousova awaits: Raducanu will face a fellow Grand Slam champion in the second round, and a Wimbledon titlist to boot -- 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.

In one of the trickiest first-round draws of the event, Vondrousova of the Czech Republic ousted No. 32 seed McCartney Kessler of the United States 6-1, 7-6(3) in 1 hour and 25 minutes -- the same length as Raducanu's win.

This was a tough draw because both Vondrousova and Kessler won grass-court titles exactly eight days ago -- Vondrousova took the title at WTA 500 Berlin (her first title since 2023 Wimbledon) and Kessler prevailed at WTA 250 Nottingham.

In the clash between grass-court champions, former Top 10 player Vondrousova raced to a 6-1, 5-1 lead before Kessler (seeded at a Grand Slam for the first time) stormed back to force a tiebreak.

Despite her big lead, Vondrousova never had match point until the breaker, but she eventually closed out her first Wimbledon win since she beat Ons Jabeur in the 2023 final.

Rivalry breakdown: Vondrousova leads Raducanu 2-1 in their head-to-head. Interestingly, Raducanu's win came right here during her breakthrough run at 2021 Wimbledon, when she beat Vondrousova in the second round.

Vondrousova, though, avenged that loss at 2022 Billie Jean King Cup. She then beat Raducanu earlier this year in Abu Dhabi.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=australian+open+tennis","I'm the world no.99 making Wimbledon debut with Djokovic as my profile picture","https://talksport.com/tennis/3332381/nishesh-basavareddy-wimbledon-novak-djokovic/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 06:00:00 GMT","





Novak Djokovic is the face of tennis, but Nishesh Basavareddy uses his idol's face as his WhatsApp profile picture.

The 20-year-old US tennis player was dealt a tough hand at his Australian Open debut back in January, being drawn against 24-time major Grand Slam champion, Novak Djokovic.

However, he won hearts when he managed to win the first set against his idol, before Djokovic roared back for a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.

Immediately following the contest, Djokovic praised the play from his younger opponent - at the time a teenager making his main draw Grand Slam debut.

""He was a better player for the first set and a half, and he deserves every bit of applause that he got,” Djokovic said about Basavareddy.

“Very complete player. He did very pleasantly surprise me with all of his shots and his fighting spirit toward the end.”

The 37-year-old was made aware that his opponent's WhatsApp profile picture was of him, which left the Serbian almost lost for words. 

“I don't know what to say to that, to be honest. I obviously try not to think about those particular things when I am on the court,” Djokovic said via TNT Sports. ""But I do appreciate the support, and appreciation, if that's how I'm supposed to get that.”

Following on, Djokovic went on to speak very highly of the teenager, and believes that he has a big future ahead of him.

“He's a nice boy. He's a teenager still. I think if he keeps going this way, honestly, as I said, he didn't get carried away by the significance of the moment.

“It's not easy stepping out onto centre court for the first time, and handling the nerves and all. He's handled himself really, really well, so I'm sure we'll see a lot of him in the future.”

Basavareddy earned entry into the Australian Open as a man draw wildcard after his run to the semi-final at the ATP 250 in Auckland, where he came up against - and lost to - French veteran, Gael Monfils.

Now, the 20-year-old will wear white on the court having secured Wimbledon qualification for the very first time.

He was handed entry into the grass-court Slam following the withdrawal of China's Shang Juncheng due to a foot injury. 

His first-round opponent has been confirmed as fellow American, Learner Tien, whose name is a tribute to his mother's career as a teacher.

Like his Wimbledon opponent, Tien has also made some noise himself going into the Slam, after he beat world No. 10 Ben Shelton at the Mallorca Championships.

The par will face off on Court 6 among the early starters on Monday's first day of play at the All England Club.

Born in 2005, and of Indian descent, Basavareddy started playing tennis at the age of three, and attended Stanford University before forgoing his NCAA eligibility in order to officially turn pro at the end of 2024. 

This came after he won two challenger titles, and became World No. 139.

Currently, Basavareddy is being coached by Bryan Smith, who has also coached former World No. 1 in doubles, Rajeev Ram since he was a teenager.

Ram, who has shone on the doubles circuit throughout his career, has won 31 career titles, including the 2020 Australian Open, and three straight US Open titles from 2021-2023. 

Furthermore, Ram is also a two-time Australian Open mixed doubles champion, winning in 2019 and 2021 with Barbora Krejčíková, bringing his total career Grand Slam victories to six. 

Having helped add two Olympic silver medals to Ram's resume, he was runner-up in the Mixed Doubles at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, and the Men's Doubles at the 2024 Paris Games, Smith has shown that he certainly has the elite calibre to coach at the very top level.

Now, his task is to implement his formula for success and help the rising star reach his maximum potential.

He has already helped Basavareddy to win the Boys' Doubles title at the 2022 US Open alongside Ozan Baris

With Ram also there to mentor the young tennis star, and possessing the experience of having won titles in his own career as a pro, Basavareddy could not have a better support system around him as he continues to develop his craft.

The next task on the agenda: to coach/mentor the 20-year-old to victory in his first ever match at the iconic Wimbledon.

Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare on his return to Centre Court Monday, when he overcame Fabio Fognini and the intense London heat to reach the second round in five sets.

On the hottest opening day on record at The Championships, with temperatures reaching 31.4C, Alcaraz was made to work extremely hard against a free-hitting Fognini, who was competing at Wimbledon for the final time. In a topsy-turvy battle, which featured first-class shotmaking, Alcaraz showed his trademark grit to triumph 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 in four hours and 37 minutes. The Spaniard now holds a standout 14-1 fifth-set record, recently defeating Jannik Sinner in the Roland Garros final.

“I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because with the level he has shown, he can still play three or four more years,” said Alcaraz. “I have to give him credit for such a great match. Fabio is such a great player, he has shown in his whole career the level he has. I'm just a little bit sad that it's his last Wimbledon, but happy to have shared the court with him.”

Carlitos strikes again ☄️The defending champion battles past Fognini in an absolute five-set thriller, taking the win 7-5 6-7 7-5 2-6 6-1 🔥@wimbledon | #wimbledon pic.twitter.com/XQw9T2Ycqg

Alcaraz arrived in London having won his past 18 matches – the longest winning streak of his career. Aiming to join Bjorn Borg and become just the second man in history to win the Roland Garros-Wimbledon double in consecutive years, few would have expected Alcaraz to struggle against the 38-year-old Fognini, who as the third oldest man in the men's singles draw, stepped onto court on the back of a 10-match tour-level losing streak.

Yet for periods, Alcaraz was in real trouble on Centre Court. With David Beckham watching on in the Royal Box, Alcaraz rallied from a break down in the third set and finally put the Italian to bed in a dominant fifth set. With his win, the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings avoided becoming just the third defending champion to lose in the first round. Manuel Santana fell in 1967 and Lleyton Hewitt in 2003.

“Playing the first match on Centre Court is never easy,” said Alcaraz. “I have been playing on grass pretty well, but Wimbledon is special. I can feel the difference between Wimbledon and the other tournaments. I just try to play the best I could, but I would say it could be better. I have to improve.”

Alcaraz also maintained his perfect first-round record at majors (18-0) and extended his winning streak at Wimbledon to 15 matches. He will next meet British qualifier Oliver Tarvet after the 21-year-old beat Swiss Leandro Riedi 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to earn victory on his major debut.

Alcaraz is chasing his sixth title of the season, highlighted by his fifth major at Roland Garros and ATP Masters 1000 titles in Monte-Carlo and Rome. Earlier this month, Alcaraz triumphed at The Queen's Club for the second time.



Alcaraz was not at his fluid best in his first set back on Centre Court since defeating Novak Djokovic in last year's final. The World No. 2 saved all five break points he faced in the opener and produced the key bit of magic on the Italian's serve at 5-5, lifting a lob over Fognini to gain the decisive break.

Alcaraz was unable to push on after winning the opener and struggled for consistency in the second set, committing 20 unforced errors to 13 winners. He was punished in the second-set tie-break when Fognini levelled on his fourth set point after Alcaraz pushed a short forehand wide.

In an entertaining third set, which featured full-length dives from both players, Fognini won one of the points of the tournament to move to break point on the Alcaraz serve when trailing 3-5.

The Italian pulled the Spaniard from side to side with his aggressive baseline hitting before he moved forward to push Alcaraz deep into the forehand corner with a volley. On the stretch, the Spaniard managed to hit the baseline with a lob, but the Italian replied with a fierce overhead before knocking away a backhand volley. The Italian raised his arms aloft and punched the air before he earned the break back on the following point.

Alcaraz would not be denied, though. He increased his intensity and consistency in the fierce heat to break the Italian in the 12th game and lead again.

Fognini refused to go away, however, and opened his shoulders to hit his flat backhand through the court during a red-hot fourth set. The ball flew through the burning London air to the tune of 14 winners in the set, with the Italian forcing a fifth set to the delight of the packed crowd.

Fognini's fifth-set record — 24 wins to 16 losses, including his legendary comeback against Rafael Nadal at the 2015 US Open — showed his fighting spirit. But on what was his final Wimbledon appearance, the former Top 10 star's magic finally ran dry as Alcaraz pulled away to claim victory in the decider.

Alcaraz, now 43-5 on the year, is aiming to become the fifth man to win three consecutive Wimbledon titles. Following his victory, Alcaraz joined the crowd in giving Fognini a standing ovation off court.

Benjamin Bonzi wasted little time in notching the first major upset at Wimbledon, where he stunned ninth seed Daniil Medvedev 7-6(2), 3-6, 7-6(3), 6-2 on Monday.

The former Nitto ATP Finals champion, Medvedev, is currently 16th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. His opening-round defeat to Bonzi at Wimbledon comes after a second-round defeat to #NextGenATP Learner Tien at the Australian Open and a first-round loss to Cameron Norrie at Roland Garros last month.

Competing on the hottest opening day ever recorded at the grass-court major, according to the Met Office, the World No. 64 Bonzi's precision and patience from the back of the court proved too much for Medvedev during their first-round clash. He also overpowered Medvedev with a relentless barrage of serving.

 “This is special for me today,” said Bonzi in his on-court interview. “This is my first Top 10 win at a Slam. Obviously, it is always special at this tournament. The atmosphere, all the courts and the grass, everything really. I love this place, so it's very special and Daniil is a great player. He has reached two semi-finals. I knew it was a tough match, but sometimes it is better to play this kind of player in the first round. Anything can happen, so I'm very happy with the win.”

With his three-hour, seven-minute victory, Bonzi is into the second round at Wimbledon for the third time in his career. It marks the first time in seven SW19 appearances that Medvedev has failed to advance past the first round.

Bonzi struck cleanly from the baseline and found great success behind his own serve, which proved clinical in the first and third set tie-breaks. After improving to 2-0 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Medvedev and earning the second Top 10 win of his career, the Frenchman will next face Jordan Thompson.



 Nicolas Jarry also notched forged a Top 10 upset on Monday, although the Chilean took the long way around to overcome eighth seed Holger Rune. Having come through qualifying to earn his main-draw spot at SW19, Jarry rallied to a 4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4 triumph on No. 3 Court. It was his first main-draw win at a major since he reached the third round at the 2023 US Open. 

 “I'm very happy for today,” said Jarry, who was 0-5 in five-set matches prior to his victory against Rune. “It was a tough start to the match, but at the end I was able to play the game I played since the beginning of qualifying. I'm happy to gain that, to overcome all the bad thoughts in my head, and all the demons. It was a difficult challenge, so I'm so happy to be here.” 

 Jarry's second-round opponent will be Learner Tien, who prevailed 7-6(5), 6-3, 6-2 against his fellow #NextGenATP American Nishesh Basavareddy. Jarry defeated Tien in the pair's only previous competitive meeting, a qualifying match in Halle earlier this month.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:atptour.com","De Minaur's British summer: Wimbledon goals, Boulter by his side","https://www.atptour.com/en/news/de-minaur-wimbledon-2025-feature","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:06:26 GMT","

For Alex de Minaur, the British grass-court season is about more than just tennis, it's about home away from home.

The Australian has become a familiar face on UK soil, not just for his dynamic grass-court game but also thanks to his relationship with fiancé and British No. 2 Katie Boulter. Their shared journey, on and off the court, has anchored De Minaur's growing connection to the country, turning this leg of the season into something more personal.

“I love the UK,” De Minaur told ATPTour.com ahead of the grass swing “I've spent a lot of time over here in recent years. I think it's a completely different style of living than in Spain. There's a lot more greenery, a lot more countryside, which I do enjoy. Being at Wimbledon is special and when it comes to the court and the tennis, I am ready to produce my best again this year.”



De Minaur's Wimbledon campaign came to an abrupt halt last year due to a hip injury, just before a highly anticipated quarter-final clash with Novak Djokovic. But the disappointment did little to dim his star among local fans. With his trademark speed, gritty baseline play and quiet charisma, he's been affectionately dubbed an ‘honourary Brit' at times in recent years.

That label fits for more reasons than one. His bond with Boulter has made the UK feel like a second home, complete with local hideaways and quiet park strolls.

“I've been quite fortunate that I've had a pretty good tour guide with Katie,” De Minaur said. “She's shown me around the best spots. The grass season has always been one of my favourite seasons in the year and it feels quite good to stay in the same place for the entirety of the season.

“We definitely do have some of our special areas that we like to keep quiet, because it does tend to get a little bit crazy during that Wimbledon timeline. But yeah, we've got enough special areas where we can get our alone time and really enjoy doing what we love.”

A post shared by Wimbledon (@wimbledon)

The couple's summer stretch in the UK provides an opportunity to carve out more time together on a global Tour, which can leave them on opposite sides of the globe.

“Whenever we are at the same tournaments, it just makes life a lot easier,” De Minaur said. “You get that sense of tranquillity, you've got each other. Our teams are almost like an extension of family… Even though we're away from home, or wherever we may be, it feels like we're all together and we're all at home.” 

On court, De Minaur has steadily built his resume on grass. A finalist at The Queen's Club and a former Eastbourne titlist, the 26-year-old's foot speed and flat groundstrokes have made him one of the most dangerous players on the surface.

And as he eyes another deep run at Wimbledon in 2025 following his 2024 quarter-final showing, the support he feels from the British crowd adds an extra layer of motivation.

“I definitely do feel the support, and it's a pretty cool feeling, especially in a place like Wimbledon, where there's such rich history, culturally and tennis-wise,” De Minaur said. “Everyone just loves the sport. And for them to have my back and show such great support, even though I'm not from that country, is pretty special.”

De Minaur will begin his Wimbledon campaign on Tuesday against Spaniard Roberto Carballes Baena.

Vondrousova awaits: Raducanu will face a fellow Grand Slam champion in the second round, and a Wimbledon titlist to boot -- 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.

In one of the trickiest first-round draws of the event, Vondrousova of the Czech Republic ousted No. 32 seed McCartney Kessler of the United States 6-1, 7-6(3) in 1 hour and 25 minutes -- the same length as Raducanu's win.

This was a tough draw because both Vondrousova and Kessler won grass-court titles exactly eight days ago -- Vondrousova took the title at WTA 500 Berlin (her first title since 2023 Wimbledon) and Kessler prevailed at WTA 250 Nottingham.

In the clash between grass-court champions, former Top 10 player Vondrousova raced to a 6-1, 5-1 lead before Kessler (seeded at a Grand Slam for the first time) stormed back to force a tiebreak.

Despite her big lead, Vondrousova never had match point until the breaker, but she eventually closed out her first Wimbledon win since she beat Ons Jabeur in the 2023 final.

Rivalry breakdown: Vondrousova leads Raducanu 2-1 in their head-to-head. Interestingly, Raducanu's win came right here during her breakthrough run at 2021 Wimbledon, when she beat Vondrousova in the second round.

Vondrousova, though, avenged that loss at 2022 Billie Jean King Cup. She then beat Raducanu earlier this year in Abu Dhabi.

More to come...

2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu ousted her 17-year-old compatriot Mingge (Mimi) Xu in the first round of Wimbledon, their home Grand Slam, on Monday. Raducanu will face another Grand Slam titlist in the second round -- 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova.","{'href': 'https://www.wtatennis.com', 'title': 'WTA Tennis'}","tennis"

On the hottest day in Wimbledon history, Carlos Alcaraz had his feet to the fire. The two-time defending champion was given all he could handle by former Top 10 player Fabio Fognini, playing in his final Wimbledon, on Day 1 at the All England Club but survived a five-set first round in more than four hours on Centre Court, 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 6-1.As air temperatures soared past 90 degrees Fahrenheit, Alcaraz was just the third reigning men's champion in the Open Era taken to five sets in his first round match the next year, following Roger Federer in 2010 (against Alejandro Falla) and Bjorn Borg in 1978 (against Victor Amaya) thanks to the combination of an off-kilter start from his side and a vintage performance by the 38-year-old Fognini, who entered Wimbledon on an 11-match losing streak at tour level.But after four sets that lasted nearly four hours, Alcaraz found a more consistent level against a fading Fognini to avoid becoming just the third reigning Wimbledon men's champion to lose his first match the following year in four hours and 38 minutes, and avoid losing in the first round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time.While Alcaraz admitted his play could've been better, he first paid deep respects to the Italian veteran 16 years his senior who reached his best ranking of No. 9 in 2019.""To be honest, I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because the level he just showed, he can still play three, four more years,"" Alcaraz said. ""I have to give him the credit of a great match. He's a great player; he has shown during his whole career the level and the talent that he has ... so I'm a little bit sad that it was his Wimbledon, but happy to have shared the court with him and the locker room with him.""

Alcaraz hit 62 unforced errors in total, 35 of which came off of his forehand. The up-and-down nature of his play was evident in the middle of the match, though he neve trailed on the sets-won scoreboard. The first nine games of the match went with serve before Alcaraz won the last three in a row, and in set three, he regrouped after losing a 5-3 lead to forge ahead two-sets-to-one.But he only hit three errors in the final set, where play was stopped for nearly 15 minutes after three games as a result of a spectator medical issue. Alcaraz had previously broken Fognini for 2-0 from 40-15 behind, and later saved two break points to lead 3-0. Out of the break, he broke again from 40-0.""Playing the first match on Centre Court is never easy,"" he confessed. ""I've been practicing pretty well, I've been playing on grass pretty well, but Wimbledon is special. It's different. I could feel the difference between Wimbledon and the other tournaments.

In general, I think it was a great match.""Alcaraz is now 14-1 in five set matches in his career, a mark which includes the nearly five-and-a-half hour epic he won against Jannik Sinner earlier this month to triumph at Roland Garros.

2025 Austrian Grand Prix: Best race start onboards

Red Bull endured a difficult home race at the Austrian Grand Prix, with Max Verstappen eliminated on the first lap and Yuki Tsunoda the final finisher.

Christian Horner was left to rue a “very frustrating” sequence of events in Sunday's Austrian Grand Prix after Red Bull left their home race without scoring any points.

Max Verstappen completed only two corners at the Red Bull Ring before being taken out of the action by Mercedes rival Kimi Antonelli, who misjudged his approach to Turn 3 and subsequently earned a three-place grid penalty for Silverstone.

Yuki Tsunoda, meanwhile, was the final finisher in 16th position, having struggled to make an impression after his Q1 exit and been given a 10-second penalty for tipping Franco Colapinto's Alpine into a spin exiting Turn 4.

The result means Red Bull fall even further behind their rivals in the Teams' Championship, holding 162 points to McLaren's 417, while Verstappen is 61 adrift of Oscar Piastri in the Drivers' standings.

“A frustrating day,” Red Bull team boss Horner summed up on F1 TV's post-race show. “Starting with Max, he had a great start and was well-positioned for Turn 1. At Turn 3 unfortunately Kimi just lost control and wiped him out. Very frustrating… Obviously Kimi's apologised. It is what it is.

“I think when you look at the pace, we wouldn't have fought the McLarens today, but we'd have fought the Ferraris hard, for sure. George [Russell] had no pace. It was frustrating.

“With Yuki, it's difficult to make progress starting where he did on the grid, then picking up a penalty as well with Colapinto. A horrible race for him today as well. Frustrating, but we'll move on quickly to Silverstone.”

With that in mind, Horner was asked how Red Bull can “remedy” the struggles several drivers have now faced in the seat alongside Verstappen – and ensure that both cars are in a position to score points moving forward.

“We need to understand with Yuki what's gone wrong [this weekend],” he continued. “FP1 and FP2, certainly FP2 and FP3, he was looking okay. Qualifying it seemed to fall apart for him.

“When you're out of position, you're down the pack like that, when it's so tight… he's struggling, I think he's struggling for confidence. But we'll work with him, we'll try and help him through it.

“The car is… it's a car that's evolved over the years around the development path that we've taken. It isn't an easy car to drive, but it's not that difficult either. We'll work with him and hopefully it'll make a step up in Silverstone.”

Given the significant gaps that have developed in both championships, Horner knows Verstappen and Red Bull now face a tall order to add to their recent title successes in 2025.

“Well, look, the championship we're not even thinking about,” he conceded. “We're just focused on each race now. They're [McLaren] a long way out of touch. We'll just take things race by race.

Verstappen has won the last four Drivers' titles on the bounce, while Red Bull were crowned Teams' champions in 2022 and 2023 before being overhauled by McLaren last season.

Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto brought home his first points of the season at the Red Bull Ring, crossing the line ahead of his team mate Nico Hulkenberg.

Gabriel Bortoleto claimed his maiden points in F1 at the Austrian Grand Prix, rounding off Kick Sauber's strongest weekend yet as Nico Hulkenberg also finished in the top 10.

The Red Bull Ring brought the Brazilian success in his junior career, including his first F2 victory last season, and those previous performances carried forward into the Grand Prix as he achieved his best F1 result so far.

After showing improved pace throughout practice, the 20-year-old progressed to the final part of Qualifying for the first time this year, eventually netting P8 on the grid and beating the likes of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli.

He remained in that position when the chequered flag fell, negotiating two pit stops and a meaningful on-track battle with Fernando Alonso, who is coincidentally a member of his management team and mentored him through his stints in F3 and F2.

“I feel like we had a very intense battle – probably the most intense battle I have had in F1 so far,” Bortoleto said after the race on the late fight with Alonso. “Outside, inside, and then playing with the blue flags as well with [Lando] Norris and then Oscar [Piastri].

“It has been a crazy one, you know? Nothing to say, just a great battle and I'm glad that I've been able to fight with Fernando until the end of the race for these points.

“We did a great job on the pit stops, we did a great job with the strategy. I feel like we did everything that was in our hands. I just hope that we can keep this up – a weekend like this repeating every single weekend… I think we can score more points in the season and have great results.”

Sauber elected to swap Hulkenberg and Bortoleto after the first round of pit stops, allowing the rookie to chase down a bigger points haul. While the gap to Alonso started at nine seconds, he rapidly closed it down and embarked on a multi-lap battle with his mentor.

The Spaniard put up an impressive defence, especially with the added challenge of allowing frontrunners Norris and Piastri to pass under blue flags, and held onto P7. He was later spotted congratulating Bortoleto on his mighty drive to take four points.

Asked whether it was a relief to finally score, Bortoleto said: “I always knew I was capable of it. I'm not in Formula 1 for a random reason. It's just good to be in the points finally – more for the team than for myself because they really deserve to have points and everything.

“For myself, I'm here because I want to win one day. I'm not going to be happy because I scored a few points, you know? But for sure it's already an achievement. We should be happy with every small achievement and we are going in the right direction to achieve our bigger dream, which will one day be winning championships.”

It was Sauber's most successful weekend yet in 2025 as Hulkenberg bounced back from starting last on the grid to gain 11 positions and secure another two points, bringing the team into a close fight with Aston Martin and Haas in the team standings.

“Obviously got a bit of help from the race circumstances – a few cars dropping out – but nevertheless, I think it was a solid race from us,” Hulkenberg said.

“Very positive obviously, double points. From last, I think that's pretty decent and I'm not sure I could have asked for much more today from there.

“Since Barcelona there's been a change of momentum and I think we have much more of a grip now on the car and on the season. We seem to be performing much better, especially in the race stints, which is obviously very encouraging and where we wanted to be at the start of the season.

""We will try to continue this – it's never easy, we always have to work hard but I'm happy and optimistic for now.”

The full official starting order for Sunday's 2025 Austrian Grand Prix at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg.

McLaren's Lando Norris blitzed Qualifying in Austria to claim pole, but that doesn't automatically mean he'll have things his own way when the lights go out on Sunday, especially with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc alongside him on the front row.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri will also be very keen to make up places from P3, yellow flags having put paid to his second Q3 run. And don't dismiss Lewis Hamilton in the run to Turn 1, as he lines up next to the McLaren for Ferrari.

Canada winner George Russell starts fifth for Mercedes, joined on row three by a rejuvenated Liam Lawson in the Racing Bulls. Behind them are Red Bull's World Champion Max Verstappen and his sim-racing buddy Gabriel Bortoleto, the Kick Sauber rookie a career-best eighth.

Completing the top 10 we have the second Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli, and Pierre Gasly, whose dramatic spin in the final corner was responsible for bringing out the aforementioned yellow at the end of Qualifying.

The Austrian Grand Prix at Spielberg's Red Bull Ring produced not only a memorable race, but also a treasure trove of top trivia to dive into.

An actioned-packed Austrian Grand Prix kept fans glued to the edge of their seats. It also kept our number-crunchers rather busy. Here's our round-up of their findings, from success and race-winning symmetry at McLaren, to the end of an amazing run of points at Red Bull.

•	McLaren scored their fourth 1-2 finish of the season, the team's most since 2007.

•	For Norris, it was his seventh career victory.

•	The last McLaren driver to win at the Red Bull Ring was David Coulthard in 2001.

•	Only two drivers have won exactly seven Grands Prix for McLaren: Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.

•	Piastri finished second in Austria for the second year in a row.

•	Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished in P3 for his third podium finish in the last four Grands Prix.

•	It was Leclerc's fifth podium finish at the Red Bull Ring, his most at any circuit.

•	Team mate Lewis Hamilton tied his best GP result of the season (he also finished P4 at Imola).

•	Hamilton finished fourth for Mercedes in last year's race.

•	George Russell took P5 for Mercedes and has only failed to score once this season (11th in Monaco).

•	Liam Lawson's P6 for Racing Bulls was his career-best finish.

•	At Aston Martin, Fernando Alonso now has back-to-back seventh-place finishes, in Canada and Austria.

•	P8 for Kick Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto was his first career points finish.

•	That was Sauber's best result at the Red Bull Ring since Kimi Raikkonen finished fourth in 2001.

•	Bortoleto's team mate Nico Hulkenberg scored points in P9 from last on the starting grid.

•	Hulkenberg is the first Sauber driver to score in three consecutive races since Valtteri Bottas in 2022.

•	It was the first double points finish for Sauber since Qatar 2023.

•	P10 in the Haas for Esteban Ocon was his fifth points finish of the season.

•	With Yuki Tsunoda the last classified finisher in P16 and Max Verstappen going out on Lap 1, Red Bull's 77-race scoring streak ended today (four short of the all-time record set by Ferrari).

•	With neither Alex Albon nor Carlos Sainz completing the race, Williams suffered their first double DNF/DNS since Sao Paulo 2024.

•	It was Albon's third consecutive race retirement.

•	Verstappen's last two retirements on the first lap have been when he was hit by a Mercedes, the previous one being Silverstone 2021.

•	For Verstappen it was the end of a 31-race points streak (and 74 of the last 75 races).

•	Kimi Antonelli had never retired on the first lap before today (the last Mercedes lap-one retirement was Lewis Hamilton at Qatar 2023).

•	Antonelli's only points finish in the last five races was his podium finish in Canada.

Liam Lawson secured sixth place for Racing Bulls in Austria, as he made an audacious one-stop strategy work on an incredibly hot day at the Red Bull Ring.

Liam Lawson was in an ecstatic mood after recording his best-ever F1 finish with sixth in the Austrian Grand Prix, though his race was nearly over before it started on the opening lap.

The Racing Bulls driver came close to being taken out by Mercedes rookie Kimi Antonelli in Turn 3, with the two banging wheels as the Italian locked up and sailed straight on.

While Lawson narrowly avoided a race-ending crash, it was his former Red Bull team mate Max Verstappen instead that took the brunt of the collision, with both he and Antonelli forced to retire from the Grand Prix then and there.

Lawson put that bit of luck to good use as he went on to secure sixth, one of just two drivers to make a one-stop strategy work in Spielberg. With track temperatures passing 50C, making a set of tyres last was tricky – but Lawson was aided by having Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso on his tail.

Alonso was the second driver on a one-stop, and he was able to provide a buffer to some quicker two-stopping cars behind – even if the sight of the Spaniard in his wing mirrors all afternoon did nothing for Lawson's heart rate.

“I'm a bit lost to be honest, it was a very tough race,” Lawson told Sky Sports F1. ""Especially after Lap 1, I don't know how I survived it to be honest.

“I thought – when I saw Kimi coming I was like, okay, this is over. But somehow, we got out of it. And then the speed was good, we made the one-stop work which was key for us. With the temperatures I wasn't sure about it, but the team knew, so very, very happy.

“It is always Fernando who is behind, I think he was within DRS for 70 laps today! And you try not to make a mistake. I thought he was quicker, but I just spoke to him and he thought I was quicker, and he was using me to keep DRS!”

Lawson managed to make his hard tyres last 38 laps on Sunday, two longer than Alonso. But his team mate had an even tougher ask – Isack Hadjar made to do a 41-lap stint on his hard tyre.

That was despite the rookie two-stopping, the Frenchman forced into a very early opening stop after running wide twice on the opening lap to avoid contact. He did fight his way back up into the points, only to drop down the order late on.

At first it looked like his tyres had finally run out of life, but later Hadjar confirmed it was floor damage that prevented him scoring in Austria.

“We did a very good race,” Hadjar said. “We were comfortably in the points, and 15 laps towards the end of the race we got floor damage.

“I mean I thought P8 was secure, and then I was losing more than a second per lap. And yeah, that was a tough end to the race.”

The Racing Bulls rookie was told the damage was acquired through Turn 1, “probably the sausage kerb,” and reflected that all in all, it was a “shame.” This was the first time since Lawson returned to the team that he has managed to beat Hadjar on a Sunday, as he recorded just his second top 10 of the season.

	Audiences should dust off their knowledge of cerulean: The Devil Wears Prada sequel is officially happening.


	The film is heading into production this week two decades after the beloved movie hit theaters, and is set to shoot in New York and Italy. Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are on board for the follow-up film, which is adding Kenneth Branagh to the cast, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter.




	The 2006 film, based on the book of the same name, follows Andy (Hathaway), a recent college journalism graduate as she lands one of the most coveted jobs in publishing as the assistant to Anna Wintour stand-in Miranda Priestly (Streep). Andy dives into the world of magazines and high fashion thanks to her fellow assistant (Blunt). The film grossed a massive $326 million at the worldwide box office and earned Streep an Oscar nomination.

	As previously reported, the sequel will have Priestly, still the head of Runway, contending with the headwinds of publishing, with the magazine now in a diminished state. Blunt's onetime assistant will now be an executive at a luxury brand conglomerate that advertises with Runway.


	Branagh will be playing Priestly's husband, while Tucci will return as Nigel Kipling, who served as the art director of Runway in the first film.


	The new film was announced on social media, in a video featuring some of the film's more iconic lines. See the announcement of the Devil Wears Prada sequel below.

With the cast's options expiring, the Ryan Murphy-produced series is off the schedule for the foreseeable future.



		By McKinley Franklin, Rick Porter 

	June 30, 2025 10:54am	




Doctor Odyssey won't be setting sail for a second season — for now, and maybe not ever. But ABC maintains that the series hasn't been canceled, even as its cast is on the verge of being free to pursue other work.


	The series, co-created by Ryan Murphy, Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, was the only scripted ABC show whose future was up in the air as the 2024-25 season came to a close. ABC has repeatedly said that it's still weighing the show's future: Disney Television Group president Craig Erwich told The Hollywood Reporter in May that “We're continuing to have creative conversations with Ryan, and we'll talk to him about what the next chapter looks like.”

					TV Ratings: Game 7 Gives NBA Finals a Six-Year High		
			









	Yet as those conversations were happening, Doctor Odyssey's sets were being struck, sources tell THR, and contract options for the cast are set to expire Monday. Those things almost always point to a show's cancellation — something director and executive producer Paris Barclay seemed to acknowledge on social media over the weekend. Yet ABC and 20th Television, the Disney-owned studio that produces the series and where Murphy is based, haven't moved off the “discussing its future” line. 


	Murphy's eponymous company has plenty of business with Disney, of course, including ABC's 911 and its forthcoming spinoff 911: Nashville, which will fill the same Thursday-night slot in the schedule this fall that Doctor Odyssey did last season. Murphy also produces a host of shows for FX and Hulu, and sources cited his workload as one of the factors behind Doctor Odyssey's limbo status.

	











	A source compared Doctor Odyssey's handling to the way broadcasters often treat unscripted shows — formal cancellations for reality series tend to be rare, and formats can be revived sometimes years after they last aired (à la Fox's upcoming Fear Factor reboot and ABC's own Match Game revival). But for a network scripted series, which operate on stricter timetables than those at streamers or cable outlets, Doctor Odyssey's situation is uncommon, to say the least.


Doctor Odyssey — which stars Joshua Jackson as a doctor on a cruise ship — drew a decent-sized, but not world-beating, audience in its first season, averaging 7.74 million viewers across all platforms over 35 days. It ranked in the middle of the pack for ABC and 64th across all of TV (including streaming-only shows), according to Nielsen's 35-day ratings.


	The series is also the subject of a lawsuit by crewmembers over alleged sexual harassment and retaliation on the show's set.


	In the lawsuit, Caroline Mack, Alicia Haverland and Ava Steinbrenner claimed they were subject to an “unchecked campaign of sexual harassment” that saw their supervisor, assistant props master Tyler Patton, bombard them with sexual comments and unwanted touching. They also note that they were fired after complaining about the alleged misconduct. 


	Along with Jackson, Doctor Odyssey also stars Phillipa Soo, Sean Teale and Don Johnson. The first season also featured a slew of high-profile guests ranging from Shania Twain to John Stamos, along with a 911 crossover that resulted in some of Doctor Odyssey's best on-air ratings of the season.

	











Doctor Odyssey is produced by 20th TV in association with Ryan Murphy Television. Murphy, Baitz and  Baken executive produced the first season with Jackson, Johnson, Eric Paquette, Alexis Martin Woodall, Eric Kovtun, Scott Robertson and Nissa Diederich. Barclay served as director and EP.

Plus, Cardi B's ""Outside"" debuts at No. 10.


													By
												

	Gary Trust



Alex Warren's “Ordinary” continues atop the Billboard Hot 100, as his first leader on the list adds a fourth week at No. 1.


	Plus, Cardi B's new single “Outside” launches at No. 10 on the Hot 100, becoming her 13th career top 10.


	Meanwhile, Morgan Wallen logs his sixth week with at least three simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s this year — surpassing Kendrick Lamar for the most such weeks in 2025.


	Browse the full rundown of this week's top 10 below.


	The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. All charts (dated July 5, 2025) will update on Billboard.com tomorrow, July 1. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram.


	(Effective this week, SiriusXM streaming data is now included in the Hot 100, as well as Billboard's streaming and genre-specific multimetric charts. Such activity is classified as programmed streams and represents listens of select current-based live music channels via SiriusXM's app or website.)


Luminate, the independent data provider to the Billboard charts, completes a thorough review of all data submissions used in compiling the weekly chart rankings. Luminate reviews and authenticates data. In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published.


	“Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.8 million official streams (down 3% week-over-week), 64.2 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 4%) and 6,000 sold (down 6%) in the United States June 20-26.


	The single spends a second week at No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart; rebounds 4-2 on Streaming Songs, following four weeks at the summit; and holds at No. 2 after seven weeks atop Digital Song Sales.


	“Ordinary” is also the most scorching hit on the Songs of the Summer chart, having led all five weeks since the seasonal survey made its annual return after Memorial Day.


	Cardi B's “Outside” soars onto the Hot 100 at No. 10, with 15.6 million streams, 6 million in airplay audience and 14,000 sold from its June 20 release through June 26. It's her 13th top 10 and first since “Enough (Miami)” debuted at its No. 9 peak in March 2024. She boasts five No. 1s — the most among women rappers — from her debut hit, “Bodak Yellow (Money Moves),” in 2017, through “Up,” in 2021.


	“Outside” opens at No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, marking Cardi B's eighth leader.


	The single, which was available in its original form and a cappella and instrumental versions in its first week, previews Cardi B's second LP, Am I the Drama?, due Sept. 19, as announced June 23.


	(Also notably, the Hot 100 debut of “Outside” ends an unprecedented four-week run of every song in the top 10 having peaked at No. 1 or No. 2.)


	Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, rises 3-2 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 and McRae's first. It adds a fifth week atop Streaming Songs (22.3 million, up 3%) and a sixth week at No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart.


	Wallen follows on the Hot 100 with the No. 2-peaking “Just in Case,” which keeps at No. 4, and “I'm the Problem,” which lifts 6-5 — as Wallen runs up his sixth week with at least three simultaneous top 10s this year, one-upping Kendrick Lamar for the most in 2025.


	Wallen moves up on the leaderboards for the most simultaneous Hot 100 top 10s both dating to the chart's 1958 start and in a single year. Here's a look at both standings through the July 5-dated survey.


Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s All-Time:


Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s in a Single Year:


	Similarly, Wallen claims five songs in the Hot Country Songs top 10. Dating to his first such frame in January 2021, it's his 27th week with at least half the chart's top 10 — no other act has more than one week earning the honor (Beyoncé, in 2024, and Zach Bryan and Taylor Swift, both in 2023).


	Wallen's I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three of his current top 10s, secures a sixth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.


	Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” dips 2-3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted as her second No. 1, and first chart-topping debut, two weeks earlier.


	Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” descends 5-6 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. It notches a 27th week at No. 1 on both the multimetric Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts, extending the longest rule on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs (dating to October 1958, when the chart became the genre's all-encompassing songs ranking).


	Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stays at No. 7 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. 1 beginning last July, and Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars' “Die With a Smile” is stationary at No. 8 after five weeks at No. 1 beginning in January.


	Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. 1 song, remains at No. 9. It posts a record-padding 67th week in the top 10 and a record-extending 97th week on the chart overall.

Ticketmaster notified fans over the weekend that the event had been canceled.

	The opening date of Marilyn Manson U.K. tour—originally set for Oct. 29 at the Brighton Centre—has officially been canceled following public backlash, political pressure and an open letter from a member of Parliament urging city officials to pull the show.

	On Saturday, fans who went online to contact Ticketmaster received a message saying “this event has been cancelled.” The show was also removed from Manson's official website, confirming that the U.K. leg of the One Assassination Under God – Chapter 1 Tour will now begin on Oct. 31 in Bournemouth.

	The cancellation follows a formal letter from Green MP Siân Berry, addressed to Brighton & Hove City Council leader Councillor Bella Sankey, calling for the show to be canceled at the publicly owned venue. The letter was co-signed by victim support organizations and the University of Sussex Student Union.




			Trending on Billboard		







	In the letter, Berry cited “multiple allegations of sexual assault, grooming and domestic violence” made against Manson in recent years. “Many survivors in Brighton and Hove, and organizations supporting them, will have very serious concerns about this booking and its impact on other people visiting the city centre, local residents and the wider community,” Berry wrote. “Freedom of expression is an important principle that should be defended, including in relation to artists, but there is an obvious risk to community cohesion.”

	











	An activist group called No Stage for Abusers also urged Brighton Centre and the city council to cancel the show through an online campaign. Manson—whose legal name is Brian Warner—was named in 2021 by actress Evan Rachel Wood as her alleged abuser, leading to more women coming forward with similar claims. Multiple civil lawsuits have since been filed against the singer, accusing him of sexual assault, harassment, and grooming. Manson has denied all allegations.


	In January, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office announced that it would not file criminal charges, citing the expiration of the statute of limitations and insufficient evidence. The alleged incidents occurred between 2009 and 2011 in West Hollywood.


	Berry acknowledged the absence of criminal charges but referenced council policies that support listening to survivors and protecting community safety. 


	“The level and nature of the accusations against Warner are concerning enough alone, but so too is the message sent out by providing a platform for this individual, at our city's biggest publicly owned venue, and what this will mean to survivors,” she said. “We believe a solution must be found and that, despite these difficulties, the Council should act in line with its obligations to our values and the serious concerns around public safety and community cohesion.”


	Manson and his representatives have not yet commented publicly on the cancellation.


Stories about sexual assault allegations can be traumatizing for survivors of sexual assault. If you or anyone you know needs support, you can reach out to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). The organization provides free, confidential support to sexual assault victims. Call RAINN's National Sexual Assault Hotline (800.656.HOPE) or visit the anti-sexual violence organization's website for more information.

Billboard breaks down the different sentencing scenarios for the rapper and mogul, depending on what kind of verdict the jury comes back with.


													By
												

	Rachel Scharf



As jury deliberations get underway in the racketeering and sex-trafficking trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, you may be wondering what kind of prison time he's facing if convicted. The answer, it turns out, is a bit complicated.


	There are a few different scenarios for Combs' potential penalties depending on how the jury, which began deliberating in secret on Monday morning (June 30), decides the case. Combs is facing five charges: one count of racketeering, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of interstate prostitution.


	Each charge has its own sentencing minimum and maximum. And to make things even more complex, the maximum sentence for racketeering conspiracy changes depends on what underlying crimes Combs allegedly committed with his associates.


	Here, Billboard breaks down what kind of prison time Combs would face in each scenario.


Scenario 1: No prison on the table


	The simplest option is that Combs is acquitted of all the charges against him. In that case, he'd face no sentencing and would immediately be freed from the pretrial detention center where he's been in custody since his September 2024 arrest.


	Prosecutors only get one shot trying each criminal charge — a legal principle known as double jeopardy — and they can't appeal an acquittal. That means Combs would officially be out of the woods on all of the counts brought against him here, though prosecutors at the federal or state level could try to charge him with different crimes.


Scenario 2: 15 years to life


	Combs faces the most severe potential prison time if he's convicted of sex trafficking. That's because the crime carries a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years and a maximum of life in prison.


	To find Combs guilty of sex trafficking, the jury would need to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the rapper used violence, money and blackmail to coerce singer Cassie Ventura and an anonymous woman known as “Jane” to have sex with escorts during dayslong hotel parties called “freak-offs.”


	Ventura and Jane both spent multiple days on the witness stand recounting the alleged abuse, and jurors saw a now-infamous surveillance video of Combs kicking Ventura in a hotel hallway and then dragging her by the hair to a room where a freak-off was happening.


	Combs' lawyers, meanwhile, argued throughout the trial that Ventura and Jane were “swingers” rather than sex-trafficking victims. They said that while Combs may have engaged in some regrettable domestic violence, both women's text messages conveying enthusiasm for the freak-offs demonstrate that they consented to these sex parties.


Scenario 3: Zero to 20 years


	There is the possibility that Combs will be acquitted of sex trafficking but convicted of racketeering with two different underlying crimes. In this scenario, jurors could find that Combs did operate a syndicate as defined by the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act — the federal “RICO” statute often deployed against mobsters and cartels — but that the crimes committed by Combs and his underlings were unrelated to the freak-offs.


	Possible underlying crimes that the jury could use to convict Combs of RICO without sex-trafficking include bribery, drug-dealing and arson. The last option relates to allegations that Combs set Kid Cudi's car on fire in 2012, when Cudi was dating Ventura.


	In this case, Combs would be subject to no mandatory minimum and a maximum of 20 years in prison. The same potential sentencing range would also apply if Combs gets acquitted of both sex-trafficking and RICO, but convicted on the two charged counts of transporting sex workers across state lines for the freak-offs.


Scenario 4: Zero to 40 years


	This one is just about math. If Combs is acquitted of sex trafficking but convicted on both the RICO charge and the interstate prostitution counts, you add up the zero to 20 years he faces for each and get to zero to 40. Once again, there would be no mandatory minimum in this case.


A grain of salt  


	Remember that sentencing maximums are just that: maximums. Even when a criminal defendant faces a lengthy potential prison term, judges have discretion and often don't impose the maximum sentence.


	Judges typically base their sentencing decisions on what are called guidelines: a nonbinding, suggested range calculated by the U.S. Probation Department by taking into consideration factors like the seriousness of an offense and a defendant's criminal history. If Combs is convicted, there will be a months-long process where he's interviewed by Probation and both sides get their chance to weigh in on the guidelines range before sentencing.

					By Anthony D'Alessandro 

Editorial Director/Box Office Editor


	Production is in full swing on 20th Century Studios' long-awaited The Devil Wears Prada 2 with the core four of Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci officially announced by Disney, but there's a plus one: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh, who'll play the husband to Streep's ice queen fashion magazine editor, Miranda Priestly. You'll remember from the first movie Priestly confesses that all is not well in the state of Denmark with her better half; it's hard to be her.


	Great timing here for 20th Century Studios in regards to the ultimate release of this movie on May 1 next year: The fashion industry is now in an era where Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour recently stepped down after 37 years (it's been rumored that the original author of The New York Times bestseller, Lauren Weisberger, was inspired by Wintour, whom she was the personal assistant to). In addition, romantic comedies are finding a way (Anyone But You) in this post pandemic box office, and the original 2006 movie was a big destination for female moviegoers grossing close to $125 million U.S./Canada and over $326 million worldwide.

	











	The sequel is reportedly about Priestly facing the headwind decline of the print industry (did that ever roll up the runways' red carpets?). You'll remember the first movie follows Hathaway's earnest, yet sharp assistant Andy Sachs as she's baptized by fire by Priestly and her second ferocious assistant Emily played by Blunt. There's also a great romantic sub-plot involving Andy torn between two dudes, the shaggy, non-industry, great grill-cheesemaking Nate (Entourage‘s Adrian Grenier) and a fellow fashion industry colleague Christian Thompson played by Simon Baker.

	










			Watch on Deadline		







	Aline Bros McKenna, the writer who adpated the first movie, is back along with the original film's director David Frankel, in addition to Oscar-winning Forrest Gump producer Wendy Finerman.


The Devil Wears Prada was nominated for two Oscars: for Streep as Best Actress and Patricia Field's Costume Design. 


	Here's a little teaser that dropped this AM on 20th Century Studios' Instagram:

Hello millennials

They're recasting? James Naughton played her husband in the original movie and he's still alive and working. Unless Branagh plays her second husband.

It was pretty clear in the first movie that Miranda & Naughton's character were headed towards a (very acrimonious) divorce.

Miranda even says as much when she and Andy are in Paris for Fashion Week.

When Andy asked Miranda if she should “fetch” the latter's husband – Miranda reveals he's not coming.

She even makes a caustic remark about how her disastrous personal life helps sells papers for Rupert Murdoch.

So I think it's a safe assumption that Branagh is playing Miranda's next husband.

Probably second (third or fourth) husband. I believe they were about to divorce at the end of the movie.

	The U.S. State Department said that it has revoked visas to the Bob Vylan duo for leading a chant of “death” to the Israeli Defense Forces at a music festival in the United Kingdom last weekend.


	Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau wrote on X on Monday, “The State Department has revoked the US visas for the members of the Bob Vylan band in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants. Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.”


	Video of the chant showed Bobby Vylan shouting “free, free Palestine” and “death, death to the IDF.” Vylan also posted the video to his Instagram account. “I said what I said,” he wrote on Sunday. 

	











	The group has a North American tour scheduled with Grandson starting in October.

	Police in Avon and Somerset are investigating Bob Vylan and Kneecap's performances for what was described as a “public order incident.” 


	The BBC has said that it regretted not cutting the livestream of the festival for the “antisemitic sentiments,” while their agents at UTA have dropped them.

EYEROLL.

This is a really fun act. Saw ‘em open a show a couple of years ago. Really affable stage banter. Very interested in really agreeable global human rights issues. If you're interpreting this act as the bad guys, then I've got some news for you.

I wish the United States government were more concerned about housing, poverty, effective taxation, next-generation energy, and technology that will keep our workforce competitive in the coming decades.

This is a contrived culture war distraction, from an administration that's desperately trying to get us to stop paying attention to things that really matter.

Denounce hate speech on all sides, how hard is that?  No need to make this a left or right issue.

“Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.”

No. Only Republican politicians are allowed to do that in ‘Murica.

Loving this news.

Associate Editor, TV


EXCLUSIVE: Justin Hartley has signed a new multi-year first-look deal with 20th Television through his company, ChangeUp Productions. The agreement marks an evolution from ChangeUp's original pod deal with the studio, which began in 2019, the same year he launched the prodco.


	Under the new deal, Hartley will continue to develop and produce original content across broadcast, cable and streaming via ChangeUp, where Julianna LaRosa serves as Head of Development.


	“Julianna and I are delighted to extend our collaboration with 20th. Over the past six years, the studio has championed our projects, resulting in the unparalleled success of Tracker, the #1 show on television,” shared Hartley. “ChangeUp is ramping up to deliver an impressive slate of upcoming projects, and we are truly fortunate to have such exceptional partners in Eric Schrier, Karey Burke, Carolyn Cassidy, Jane Francis and their outstanding teams,” he added.

	The deal follows the record-breaking success of Tracker on CBS, which Hartley both stars in and executive produces. Since its Super Bowl debut in 2024, the action-drama has reached over 100 million viewers to date and became the first new series to rank as the #1 series on TV since 2000. Both seasons ranked as the most-watched broadcast series of the year.


Tracker stars Hartley as Colter Shaw, a lone-wolf survivalist driven by his past troubles who uses his instincts to find the missing and collect rewards. Supported by lawyer Reenie, his business handler Velma Bruin (Abby McEnany) and tech expert Bobby Exley (Eric Graise), Colter will stop at nothing to get the job done. The series was created by Ben H. Winters and is based on the bestselling novel The Never Game by Jeffery Deaver. Season 3 begins production this summer.

	











	Before his work on Tracker, he was part of the ensemble cast of NBC's critically acclaimed, award-winning series This Is Us opposite Mandy Moore, Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown, Chrissy Metz and Jon Ortiz. Hartley played Kevin Pearson, for which he received multiple Critics' Choice Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (2019, 2020, 2021). Additionally, Hartley and his cast members won back-to-back SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2018 and 2019. On the film side, Hartley starred opposite Rebel Wilson in the summer action-comedy, Bride Hard. He is repped by CAA and Jackoway Austen Tyerman, and LaRosa is repped by CAA.


	ChangeUp Productions continues to build out a slate of original, character-driven projects across TV and film.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","On The Bear , Carmy says exactly what Syd's been waiting to hear at exactly the wrong time","https://www.avclub.com/the-bear-recap-season-4-episode-5-replicants","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 12:00:00 GMT","

[Editor's note: The recap of episode six publishes July 1. This recap contains spoilers.]    

The clock is ticking down before The Bear goes kaput. The problem is that the restaurant is run by people—and people live on their own timelines, which almost never align with each other. That's the jumping-off point for “Replicants,” an episode that flits between characters, offering us glimpses into their lives both together and alone.

Even if he's not telling anyone about it, Carmy is finally healing. He begins the episode at Al-Anon, listening to another attendee (played by the great Kate Berlant) give a monologue about the complexities of loving an addict: her brother, who after six months of sobriety relapsed and trashed her apartment while he was supposed to be plant-sitting. “He's my brother, and I love him. I want to kill him and then love him and kill him again,” she says—a Zen koan for the modern age. 

Afterward, Carm heads to the Frank Lloyd Wright Home & Studio to rediscover his sense of wonder. “I'm just a traveler, eatin' up my travelin' time,” Paul Simon croons as Bear roams the corridors of Wright's masterpiece, running his hands along the furniture and gazing up at the arched ceilings. Incidentally, Wright was a perfectionist whose commitment to his art took a heavy toll on the people who loved him. Sound like anyone we know?

The next morning, everyone gets down to the business of being alive in an imperfect world. Tina tests out a new recipe on her husband (portrayed by David Zayas), making him promise he'll be honest about the quality. “Sucks,” he says with a wide, loving smile. Meanwhile, Sweeps is going over his sommelier training while hitting balls at the batting cages, and Richie is obsessing over the fact that he couldn't afford the giant teddy bear his daughter wanted, but friggin' Frank could. 

Elsewhere, Sydney is spiraling out. She's frantically searching through her (still not unpacked!) moving boxes, searching for her favorite cleaver. She finally calls her dad (played by Robert Townsend), not to catch up, but to ask if he's seen it. She freezes when she notices that he sounds sick, but he swears he's fine. It's an obvious lie, but Syd is too caught up in her own shit to notice.

We also check in with Marcus' roommate, Chester (Carmen Christopher), who's now side hustling as a real-estate agent. His first sale: Marcus' mom's house. He seems to truly believe in the value of setting up clients with their dream houses, but Marcus takes a darker tone: When you sell a house, it's always for bad reasons—death, divorce, running out of cash.

Throughout this montage, Christopher Storer's direction captures the common mood—part hope, part anxiety. (“​​If I have to live in fear, where will I get my ideas? / With all those crazy people gone, will I slowly slip away?” Lou Reed asks himself on the backing soundtrack.) There's a particularly striking moment when the camera whip-zooms toward Richie mid-panic attack. The shot flashes between his sweaty face and his happiest memories: celebrating in the kitchen at Ever, cuddling with Tiff, sharing a peaceful silence with Mikey. All gone now.

Ebraheim gives Albert a tour of The Beef, including an introduction to certified weirdos Chuckie, Chi-Chi, and Teddy. Ebra is nervous when Albert tells him the operation is crazy small, but it's a good thing: If he can succeed on such a tight budget, his next step should be franchising. Somewhere, Mikey Berzatto is rolling in his grave.

Carmy 2.0 shows up at The Bear ready to tackle his problems head-on. Tina points out the biggest one as he helps her unpack their paltry boxes of ingredients. She gives him a tough-love pep talk: He's gotta stop changing the menu every night. Every dish is incredible, but it would be even better—and cost-effective—if he stuck with the same ones. “I just wanted you to hear something out loud,” she finishes. “You're the shit, baby. You got nothin' to prove.” If Carm's ever going to believe in his talent, Tina is the one to get through to him. 

Inside, he finds Marcus staring hard at the most gorgeous dessert in culinary history. Carmen is blown away when he tries a bite and over the moon when Marcus tells him that the flower-shaped cup is also edible. It's going to be a beast to keep such a delicate creation intact, but Carm has a solution that delights Marcus as much as it does us: Luca (Will Poulter), the world's sexiest pastry chef, has agreed to work as a stage for a few weeks. 

But no one is more excited than Syd. When they run into each other, the chemistry they shared at the Ever funeral sparks back up immediately. She teases him about the way he pronounces “chives” in his English accent, and he counters with an adorably terrible attempt at a Chicago drawl. These two need to make out yesterday.

Then there's Richie and Jessica, who have been quietly falling for each other ever since they met at Ever. He's driving himself crazy in a futile attempt to write another “inspiring” speech for the team, and Jessica helps him express what he's really searching for: “The Beef was fuckin' rockin',” he tells her. “It was alive, and you were a part of it, and it was a fuckin' vibe in there.” She immediately gets it when Richie dishes about the Great Teddy Bear Feud, and he lights up when she tells him that she races cars. Now that's a fuckin' vibe.

Syd finds Carmy in the kitchen, ready to finally tell him about her gig with Shapiro. But she's distracted when she notices tonight's menu on the counter: all repeats. He apologizes for his insistence on changing it up every night, admitting that it was selfish and unfair. It's exactly what she's been waiting to hear at exactly the wrong time. He's on the edge of telling her about the new terms of the agreement, but they're interrupted by the arrival of Natalie and the cutest li'l baby you ever did see. (I love you, Sugar, but also, I really wanted to know what's in that mysterious contract!)

The entire staff is smitten the moment they lay eyes on Sophie, but you can see the fear on Carm's face: He's terrified his niece is another good thing he'll break. Natalie makes the right call when she passes the baby not to her anxious brother but to kind, steady Marcus. It's equally adorable when Richie heads to the kitchen to meet the kid: “Who wants to melt some provolone on a fuckin' baby right now?”

While Richie tells the baby about Carm's “refrigerator complex,” Syd heads to the alley to take a call from an unknown number that's been blowing up her phone. The moment her face falls, we know that The Bear vs. Shapiro decision is suddenly background noise. It's Carmy who's the first to hear the news that Emmanuel is in the ICU after he had a heart attack. 

I saw this plot turn coming from a million miles away, but my qualms fell thanks to Ayo Edebiri's painfully honest performance of a woman whose world is crumbling down around her. Carm offers to drive her to the hospital, but she tells him to stay, determined to deal with it on her own. A less emotionally stunted man would insist on going with her anyway, but Carmy is not that guy. Despite how far he's come, he still has no idea how to be there for the people who need him.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:avclub.com","F1 The Movie transforms the sport into just another piece of intellectual property","https://www.avclub.com/f1-the-movie-branding-exercise-marketing-content-intellectual-property","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 18:01:52 GMT","

At my advanced screening for F1 The Movie, most of the audience was clad in team gear, McLaren shirts, hoodies with Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna's MP4/4 on it, and even one guy in a hat branded with Dallara, the manufacturer that makes chassis for racecars. It was a fan event as much as any Grand Prix weekend, but instead of watching real cars rush by, pounding our chests with wind and filling our lungs with exhaust and bits of rubber flung from tires, facsimiles of real racecars crisply crossed the IMAX screen.

There is a viscerality to racecars inherently lost on screen, but for a long time the utter instability of the machines provided thrills. Think of the way the backends slip out every turn in Steve McQueen's Le Mans, or stiff suspensions shaking the cameras apart in John Frankenheimer's Grand Prix, even though they never neared racing speeds while filming the latter. F1 cars, in their current iteration, are too stable. Many have bemoaned how thrilling the Group B cars of the '80s were compared to the World Rally Championship of today, and that is because the old cars looked like they were going beyond the limit, flying over bumps and stuttering as their turbos kick in. 

When Le Mans finally screened for the drivers that participated in filming, they were initially disappointed by how cut apart their racing footage had been, and believed that the racing—which they conducted in real prototype sports cars at near full speeds at great risk to themselves—would have looked better if shots were held for duration. But now, filming at near-racing speeds isn't very interesting. Anyone with an F1TV subscription can watch real drivers run real races at real speeds at any time. Of course, that is something the enthusiasts will do, not someone going to the theater to watch F1, that thing they've heard some of their friends had gotten into, for the first time. So who is F1 The Movie actually for? 

Formula 1 has been in the air lately. Someone might have told you to watch the Netflix series Drive To Survive. You might have seen F1 appear on the TVs of suburban sports bars or had an F1® Arcade pop up in your major metropolitan area. You may have seen tech people promoting a haptic trailer for F1 The Movie. Even if none of these have pierced your bubble, you've probably seen an ad for Brad Pitt in F1, with footage of spinning cars and movie stars and big text from Twitter users claiming that “F1 IS A FULL BODY EVENT” during a commercial break. F1—the racing series, the movie, the marketing event—is everywhere.

Ever since the sport was acquired by Liberty Media Group at the start of 2017, and subsequently launched Drive To Survive, there has been a massive boost in popularity to the stodgy and pretentious old sport of (mostly) European rich kids driving around in circles, particularly in the United States, a market once thought unattainable. It was a combination of the right thing at the right time, with the Netflix series gaining modest attention before exploding in popularity during COVID lockdowns, which led many new eyes to what would become an all-time great championship rivalry in 2021 between Mercedes' previously dominant Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's up-and-comer hotshot Max Verstappen. The histrionics of Drive To Survive‘s reality TV approach to motorsport was now unfolding in real time to millions around the world who might have never cared about the sport before, and there was no going back. 

F1 The Movie is the next step in this broader marketing push. Like its forebears in racing cinema, it started with Hollywood approaching F1, although unlike the reluctance from the Drivers Association to participate in Grand Prix or Driven, F1 The Movie was met with such open arms that it seems to be an official extension of the sport. This is not because of a particular realism in storytelling, although it touts that in its technical side, but because the film works to boost the prestigious, yuppieish appeal of Formula 1 as an intellectual property.

Anyone with a passing familiarity with the sport will find a lot strange about F1 The Movie‘s plot. Its story is an amalgamation, both of recent racing history (even casual fans will immediately recognize references to Bahrain 2020 and Abu Dhabi 2021) as well as older events (there is a recreation of Martin Donnelly's 1990 crash for character backstory). While F1 The Movie might work as a broad introductory text, its consolidation of racing incidents ends up leaving a baffling picture of what the sport is. For instance, Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) has a penchant for intentionally crashing into rivals to cause safety cars, which neutralize the race, bunch up the pack of cars, and in effect make people's pit stop times shorter. There is precedent for this kind of cheating: In the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, Nelson Piquet Jr. intentionally hit his Renault into the wall on the main straight in order to cause a safety car, which allowed his teammate Fernando Alonso to get a cheap pit stop and ultimately win the race. “Crashgate,” as it is known, is one of the most controversial moments in modern F1 history, one still litigated (literally, in court) to this day. Sonny Hayes commits a Crashgate every single race. 

The accuracy of the film could be endlessly nitpicked and critiqued (as many racing fans like to do, regardless), like how Hayes seems much too old to return to the sport. Having raced in 1993, he can't be younger than in his 50s, and in an age when F1's grid has been so locked off, there would likely be younger talent in feeder series or even less-old old drivers in other world-class competitions that could sub into his character's role. Pitt's age does open an opportunity to say that he raced against greats like Michael Schumacher, Alain Prost, and Ayrton Senna. The problem, though, is that those drivers changed the sport and effectively put renegade drivers like Hayes out of business. Senna and Prost's rivalry wasn't so much the playboy vs. the professor like James Hunt and Niki Lauda (fictionalized in Rush), but was one ultra-methodical, “does nothing except live and breath racing” driver versus one who is also that, but even more. Schumacher and his seven World Drivers' Championship titles would be the nail in the coffin for F1 drivers looking to be anything less than completely dedicated athletes. All three drivers had their outbursts and fits of immaturity, sure, but they represented a shift from anything genuinely roguish in the sport to one where the name of the game is absurd precision.

This can be justified in that the film works in part as a star vehicle for Pitt. However, this falls into the same pitfall as filmmaker Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun: Maverick, another vehicularly fetishistic blockbuster where an opportunity to hand off star power to a new generation is denied, instead banking on the nostalgia of the former glory of the old headliner. F1 The Movie is the vanity of Pitt's shirtless scene in Once Upon A Time…In Hollywood stretched out for 156 minutes. It is playing into a similar “they really did it!” stunt spectacle as the latest Tom Cruise works, too, with Pitt and Damson Idris often themselves piloting the cars we see on track. Like sticking actors in real jets to film Maverick, it's an unnecessary gimmick. Does this actually translate to a more thrilling film, when someone's face is obscured almost entirely by a helmet? It just boils down what makes good marketing, like talking about how G-forces can't be replicated without actually throwing the actors around at hundreds of miles an hour.

The one thing F1 The Movie does adopt from reality is the commentators, employing F1's top voices David “Crofty” Croft and Martin Brundle to do their actual job for the film. But what the commentators do when you watch a broadcast is supplement—help you make quick sense of the chaos you are seeing in front of you, and what to keep an eye on when it seemingly gets boring. What Crofty and Brundle do in F1 The Movie is give sense where there is none, add narrative where sense can't be found, and stitch together loose threads unraveling at 200 mph so that the filmmakers don't have to make it all cohere. They are used as a shortcut rather than a tool of elevation. Listen to the way Leigh Diffey calls the last lap of the Cup Series road race at Watkins Glen last year: The camera replicates a crane down and then chases alongside the two leaders in heated battle, with Diffey laying out the stakes of the story before reaching a fever pitch on the pass. It would be incredible to see without a word spoken over it, and yet the commentary brings it to transcendence. In F1 The Movie, the commentary is merely the duct tape holding the thing together.

F1 The Movie tries to sell itself on this faux-realism, and on images never before seen, or never before possible, since no one before has ever miniaturized digital IMAX cameras and strapped them to an F2-spec car done up to look and feel like one from F1. RACER (a magazine briefly featured in the film), focuses its summer issue cover story on this technical achievement. But the images Kosinski comes up with aren't new—his final “wow” moment, flying around on the track while the camera is fixed to the front end of a car, is the same gimmick that Frankenheimer used to stun audiences back in 1966 at the very beginning of Grand Prix. F1 The Movie is not iterative, but reiterative, both with its reuse of images better seen before and its quintessential story of old dog vs. young gun. It's nothing new as a movie, but simply the newest piece of F1 content.

So who is F1 The Movie for? It might be best to look at the executive producers. Among the usual Hollywood suits are the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Mercedes team boss-owner Toto Wolff, and the CEO of F1 Stefano Domenicali. The trio make cameos after the denouement, affirming all that's unfolded before, their branding exercise now complete. Like how F1 teams no longer need to be winning races, or even scoring many points, to be gold mines for investors, F1 The Movie doesn't need to be a particularly good film, or even successful at the box office, as the mere existence of the film and its advertising is enough to solidify the brand that F1 wishes to proliferate. 

It fits well Martin Scorsese's idea of “theme park cinema,” a cinema driven by its consumption rather than its images, not just because the film tries to feel at times like a rollercoaster, but because the point isn't really to watch F1 The Movie. It's to buy into the brand of F1 the sport. As much as F1 The Movie is for those people that are on the fence about F1—herding the final crop of people who can potentially be sold hats and water bottles, who haven't yet spent hours binging a Netflix show (but can somehow be convinced to see a two-and-a-half-hour movie)—it is also for the stakeholders. It's a film for the team owners, the FIA board members, the track promoters, the merch resellers, or anyone, not just the executives at Apple and Warner Bros., financially invested in a sport that has turned itself into an IP.

Ryan Gosling has already played a teacher (“Half Nelson”) and an astronaut (“First Man”), but with “Project Hail Mary,” he's both. That's right: Gosling is leading the feature as a middle school biology teacher who travels to space to save the universe. 

The film, which is based on the bestselling book by “The Martian” author Andy Weir, centers on Ryland Grace (Gosling) who wakes up from a coma with amnesia. He gradually remembers that he was sent to the Tau Ceti solar system, 12 lightyears from Earth, to find a means of reversing a solar dimming event that could cause the extinction of humanity. Ryland has to travel through space to keep the Sun and every other star in the galaxy from dying.

The official synopsis reads: “Science teacher Ryland Grace (Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone.”

“Project Hail Mary” debuted a first look earlier this year. The feature is directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller and written by Drew Goddard. Sandra Hüller, Lionel Boyce, Ken Leung, Milana Vayntrub, and James Ortiz co-star.

“Project Hail Mary” is produced by Gosling, Lord, Miller, Weir, Amy Pascal, Aditya Sood, and Rachel O'Connor. The executive producers are Patricia Whitcher, Drew Goddard, Sarah Esberg, Lucy Kitada, Nikki Baida, and Ken Kao. 

In addition to “Project Hail Mary,” Gosling will also star in “Star Wars: Starfighter.” The standalone franchise film will take place five years after the events of 2019's “Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker.” Shawn Levy is directing with Jonathan Tropper writing the script. Levy and Tropper previously worked together on “This Is Where I Leave You” and “The Adam Project.”

Amazon MGM Studios will release “Project Hail Mary” in theaters March 20, 2026. Check out the film's first trailer below.

Vin Diesel is promising “Fast and Furious” fans that the late Paul Walker‘s Brian O'Conner will return for the final film in the blockbuster franchise. Diesel, who stars in and produces the films, said during an appearance at Walker‘s brother Cody Walker's car festival Fuel Fest that the eleventh “Fast and Furious” feature will have a reunion between characters Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and O'Conner (Walker).

Walker died in 2013 in a car accident prior to the completion of the seventh film. His brothers Cody and Caleb served as stand-ins for his character in that film, which used CGI and VFX to give Walker's character a sendoff as he drove off into the sunset. The character of Brian O'Conner exited the franchise at the end of “Furious 7” with the explanation that he was settling down with his family, including Jordana Brewster's Mia Toretto, who is Diesel's onscreen sister.

Now, Diesel is detailing just how O'Conner will return to cap off the franchise. “Just yesterday I was with Universal Studios… The studio said to me, ‘Vin, can we please have the finale of ‘Fast and Furious' [in] April 2027?' I said, ‘Under three conditions because I've been listening to my fan base,'” he said. “The first is to bring the franchise back to L.A. The second thing was to return to the car culture, to the street racing. The third thing was reuniting Dom and Brian O'Conner. That is what you're going to get in the finale.”

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






It's unclear yet whether this planned eleventh feature will be a single, final installment or not. Diesel previously told Fandango in 2023 that the tenth film, “Fast X,” could be a trilogy. “Without giving away too much, I can say this, going into making this movie, the studio had asked if this could be a two-parter and after the studio saw this Part One, they said, ‘Could you make “Fast X: The Finale” a trilogy?,'” Diesel said.

The tenth feature also saw the franchise debut of Paul Walker's daughter Meadow Walker, who joined Diesel onscreen for the first time exactly a decade after her father's death. “Thanks to my dad, I was born into the ‘Fast' family,” Walker wrote on Instagram at the time. “I can't believe now I get to be up there too with those who have been around to see me grow up… I am so blessed to be able to honor my father's legacy and share this with him forever.”

And the Walker family is all for honoring Paul Walker's character, too. His brother Caleb told the AP in 2018 that he hoped O'Conner would be in more films. “I just hope we get to — I don't know — have a little cameo and bring Paul back to save the day and I get to help create that again,” Caleb said. “That's my dream and I hope we get to do that in one of the future movies.”

 










Brother Cody added, “I think there could potentially be a way to do it. But it would take a lot of thought and it'd have to be tasteful.”

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:pitchfork.com","Bob Vylan's U.S. Visas Revoked by Trump Administration After “Death to the IDF” Chant at Glastonbury","https://pitchfork.com/news/bob-vylan-us-visas-revoked-by-trump-administration-after-death-to-the-idf-chant-at-glastonbury/","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 17:55:26 GMT","

Bob Vylan have had their U.S. visas revoked by the Trump administration after the English punk duo's frontman, who goes as Bobby Vylan, led a chant of “Death, death to the IDF” at the Glastonbury festival on Saturday, June 28, CNN reports. The duo had already come under fire from the British prime minster, Keir Starmer; Glastonbury organizers; and the BBC, which has apologized for livestreaming the chant aimed at the Israeli Defense Forces. British police are investigating whether their comments amount to a criminal act, BBC News notes.

Bob Vylan have long been vocal supporters of Palestine, particularly in light of the Israeli military's continued assault on Gaza and the West Bank. A backdrop to the duo's set read messages such as: “United Nations have called it a genocide. The BBC calls it a ‘conflict.'” On stage, Bobby Vylan told the crowd, “Sometimes we have to get our message across with violence because that's the only language some people speak, unfortunately.” He later responded to the controversy on Instagram, citing a responsibility to teach “children to speak up for the change they want and need.” He added, “Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.”

Bob Vylan had been due to tour the United States in October and November; those dates, naturally, are in jeopardy. Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, wrote on X that the state department had “revoked the US visas for the members of the Bob Vylan band in light of their hateful tirade at Glastonbury, including leading the crowd in death chants. Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.” Bob Vylan have also been dropped by United Talent Agency.

Glastonbury organizers posted on social media that they were “appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan.” Dozens of other artists made pro-Palestinian remarks at the festival, and Palestinian flags were a fixture among the crowds, as Amyl and the Sniffers noted in a statement defending Bob Vylan and Kneecap. But Bob Vylan's chants “very much crossed a line,” according to Glastonbury, whose organizers—along with several British politicians and the BBC—have presented the group's criticism of the Israeli military as antisemitic.

British police are also investigating Kneecap for their Glastonbury set, though it has not been specified what part of the show is under scrutiny; Keir Starmer had called for the group to be pulled from the Glastonbury lineup in advance. In a rare break from custom, the BBC, which airs continuous footage from Glastonbury's main stages, refused to broadcast Kneecap's set, but later uploaded a largely unedited stream of the show to its iPlayer platform. Kneecap band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, better known as Mo Chara, recently appeared in court on a terror charge relating to the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag during a 2024 concert.

Bobby Vylan's statement reads, in full:

As I lay in bed this morning, my phone buzzing non stop, inundated with messages of both support and hatred, I listen to my daughter typing out loud as she fills out a school survey asking for her feedback on the current state of her school dinners. She expressed that she would like healthier meals, more options and dishes inspired by other parts of the world. Listening to her voice her opinions on a matter that she cares about and affects her daily, reminds me that we may not be doomed after all. Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place. As we grow older and our fire possibly starts to dim under the suffocation of adult life and all its responsibilities, it is incredibly important that we encourage and inspire future generations to pick up the torch that was passed to us. Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change. Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.

Today it is a change in school dinners, tomorrow it is a change in foreign policy.

	You remember the original Jurassic Park, right? The blockbuster that crawled out of the primordial ooze of 1993, signaled that Steven “I Made Jaws” Spielberg could still turn a beach-read paperback into box-office gold, and gave the Tyrannosaurus Rex his biggest P.R. boost in 66,000,000 years? 


	Of course you do. Its particular blend of something old (dinosaurs), something new (bleeding-edge CGI), something borrowed (a very familiar plot), and something blue (Jeff Goldblum, Nerd Sex Symbol) quickly made the adaptation of Michael Crichton's novel one of the most successful movies of all time, and the film continues to be a favorite of folks testing the levels on their home entertainment sound systems. The original begat a sequel, which begat a trilogy, which begat a second trilogy that concluded with two Jurassic crews teaming up. Had the series quietly gone extinct after 2022's Jurassic World: Dominion, even the most dedicated popcorn-cinema junkie might have gone, Well, like the dinos, it had a good run. But as both the first film and the history of Hollywood over the past five decades reminds us, nothing ever really dies. Especially if it's a billion-dollar franchise.

	











	So, welcome… to Jurassic World: Rebirth! The seventh entry hits theaters with a whole new cast of characters, an extremely optimistic subtitle, and a cleverly meta take on the cycles of mass pop culture phenomena. Once upon a time, the movie tells us, people flocked to see these giant creatures resurrected from old DNA. Then the novelty wore off, the public grew bored with all those nouveau brontos and triceratops, and thanks to indifference, competing “engineered entertainment” distractions and a few industry-shaking catastrophes, the whole notion of gasping in awe at revived beasties became extremely passé. Feel free to draw any parallels you care to.

	Hence, in Rebirth‘s world of 2025, dinosaurs have once again gone the way of the, er, dinosaurs. Most have died out, though a handful continue to thrive in the oxygen-rich environments and tropical climates near the equator. Humans have been forbidden to travel to the island of Ile Saint Hubert, where many of the remaining dinos continue to live. That's also where the company responsible for the amusement parks once conducted experiments and lab-tested potential new cross-bred species. And, as a preamble shows us, it's where an accident once happened involving an errant candy-bar wrapper, an employee, and a Xenomorph-like monstrosity named Distortus Rex. [Quick side note: There's a lot of product placement in the movie, even by studio summer-blockbuster standards. But given the way a state-of-the-art testing facility is almost singlehandedly brought down by a Snickers™, Mars Inc. may want to consider asking for their money back.]

	Naturally, just because the area is completely off limits doesn't mean that some profit-hungry douchebag won't hire mercenaries to escort him there. Enter Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend). He's a representative for a pharmaceutical company who knows that the DNA of several different dinosaurs may hold the key to solving many major diseases that afflict us Homo sapiens. Whoever gets the DNA first will dominate the market, so Krebs is determined to beat the competition. He gets “situational security and reaction” expert Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson) to sign on for a steep price. They recruit Dr. Henry Loomis (Wicked‘s Jonathan Bailey) to join them, since they'll need a paleontologist to identify the specific species. The chance to actually see one up close is too good for him to pass up. Plus he'll function as the conscience-in-residence for this hunting party. “Is it a crime to kill a dinosaur?” Krebs sneers. “It's a sin,” Loomis replies.


	Add in Duncan (Mahershala Ali), a ship captain working out of a Caribbean port who Zora enlists to transports them to this lost world, and his crew — most of whom do have names, but may as well be called Future Snacks 1-7 — and you have the group that will face off against those hungry, angry dinos. Actually, make that one of the groups. We're also introduced to the Delgados, a family on a sailing trip across the Atlantic. The father, Reuben (The Lincoln Lawyer‘s Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), has decided to do one last voyage with his kids before the oldest, Teresa (Luna Blaise), goes away to college. She's brought her less-than-helpful boyfriend (David Iacono) along as well, much to Pop's chagrin. The youngest, Isabella (Audrina Miranda), rounds out the team. After an encounter with a whale-like dino, their sloop capsizes. Duncan picks up their distress signal and picks the Delgados up. Everyone heads to Ile Saint Hubert. The groups get separated. Guess what happens next?

	The divide-and-conquer idea is smart on paper, given that two different sets of explorers — one by choice, the other by chance — doubles both the narrative terrain that can be covered and the amount of possible fill-in-the-blank–osauruses the VFX artists can gin up for your blockbuster-viewing pleasure. Zora & Co. get to take on a protective mother pterodactyl, while the Delgados must keep a T. Rex from chomping on both a blow-up raft and themselves, etc. Veteran screenwriter and the scribe behind the original Jurassic Park, David Koepp, is an expert at juggling dueling plot lines, and he's brought back a lot of the monster-movie vibe that made the first movie such an old-school adrenaline rush. But not even he can keep you from feeling that such ping-ponging back and forth ends up leeching the tension from both stories long before the groups inevitably join forces again. It doesn't help that, despite the family-drama angle, the amateur survivalists aren't nearly as interesting as the professional soldiers-for-hire, the nebbishy scientist and the mustache-twirling corporate villain. You understand the need for kids in peril, but you wish they'd just stuck with the adventurers.

	And while director Gareth Edwards knows how to mount a production heavy with CGI spectacle and multi-character business (he's responsible for the 2014 Godzilla reboot as well as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story), there's a sort of auto-pilot feel to the proceedings here. Jurassic World: Rebirth has a better-than-average filmmaker at the helm, a top-notch screenwriter, a bona fide movie star in action-hero mode, one of the best actors working today — both Johansson and Ali are doing a lot of heavy lifting here, and are serious troupers in terms of scared-reaction-shot duties — and the benefit of a reliable, time-tested intellectual property. 


	So why the hell does this feel so generic, so by-the-numbers, so instantly forgettable? The whole thing resembles the blockbuster version of a readymade, assembled from various, recognizable spare parts and elevated only by virtue of its name. Fans and completists may still get giddy over a ScarJo vs. Dinos showdown, and you should never underestimate the power of giant, toothy jaws chomping down on poor, hapless humans. But long before the big showstopping climax, you'll start to understand why the movie's jaded public became bored by what once seemed thrilling and unique. Subtitling this Rebirth seems to have been an act of extreme optimism.

	If Republicans manage to pass Donald Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” millions of Americans will lose access to health care, food assistance, and other critical public support programs. One would hope that Democrats — despite being the minority in both chambers — would put up the strongest fight they can against the disastrous piece of legislation.


	Sen. John Fetterman's mind is on the beach. 


	“I just want to go home. I've missed our entire trip to the beach, my family's going to be back before we're [done],” the Pennsylvania Democrat told reporters on Monday. “Again I'm going to vote no. There's no drama with the way the votes are … But all the Democrats, we all know how that's going to do and I don't think it's really helpful to put people here till some ungodly hour.” 


	While it's a shame that the GOP's war against the health of low income Americans is interfering with lawmakers' summer plans, it's reasonable to expect that an elected lawmaker would swallow their frustrations in service of the millions of people who stand to lose a lot more than a few vacation days. 

	










			Popular on Rolling Stone		







	“Does Fetterman think his job is beach like Ken from Barbie?! He's a United States Senator! You're expected to work long hours and take hard votes,” one Democratic aid told Huffpost. Joe Calvello, a former Fetterman aid, also sounded off. “This bill is the biggest transfer of wealth from the working class to the 1% and Fetterman's message to voter is that he just wants to go home,” he wrote.

	











	After the video of his comments gained traction on social media, Fetterman wrote on X that “not one single Democrat will vote for the ‘big beautiful bill.' I'm here to vote on these amendments and keep the ball rolling. I'm a HARD NO on the final bill won't support cutting Medicaid, SNAP or adding up to $5T to our national debt.” 


	Fetterman's recent pivot towards soft Republicanism has been a source of increased frustration among Democrats. Just last week, the Pennsylvania senator sided with the GOP to block the advancement of a bill that would limit Trump's ability to conduct unilateral military strikes without the approval of Congress.

	In May, the Pennsylvania chapter on Indivisible, a progressive organizing group that supported Fetterman in his 2022 run for the Senate, called for him to step down from his seat. 


	“In contrast to your behavior before you became a Senator, you have demonstrated a disdainful attitude towards many of your constituents, particularly those most engaged in the civic process in the media and in communications from your office,” they wrote. “You have failed to fulfill the most basic duties of the office by avoiding contact with your constituents who can't even leave voicemails after business hours, refusing to hold town halls, yelling at visitors in your office and inexcusably missing more votes than any other member of the current Senate.” 


	The group cited Fetterman's confirmation votes in favor of several of Trump's Cabinet members, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as failure to challenge GOP efforts to cut programs benefiting low income Pennsylvanians. 


	“We're looking to the leaders who will fight for us, because even today there are folks among the Democratic Party who think we should roll over and play dead,” Indivisible Co-Founder Leah Greenberg said during Philadelphia's “No Kings” rally earlier this month. “Anyone seen John Fetterman here?” she rhetorically asked the crowd.

	Over the weekend, Democrats used several tactics in an effort to delay a final vote on the Big Beautiful Bill, and secure as much debate time as they could to publicly critique its most problematic provisions. Fetterman expressed frustration with his party after Democrats refused to waive Senate procedures requiring bills to be read when introduced for debate, resulting in a 16-hour marathon read-out of the almost 1000 page long legislation, which was followed by 20 theoretical hours of debate — split evenly between the parties — of which Democrats are expected to squeeze out every second they possibly can.

	“It's not like it's pathetic to force the clerk to read it or anything,” Fetterman complained to reporters of the grueling weekend procedural activities.


	While his colleagues are working overtime crafting floor speeches, negotiating critical amendments, and stirring up as much public outcry against the legislation as they can, it's obvious that though Fetterman is physically present in the Senate, he'd rather be anywhere else – probably the beach.

	***


	The last decade of Lizzo's career has been a microcosm of the modern American fame arc.  The Houston-raised MC/singer/songwriter/flautist has gone from Prince-cosigned cult phenomenon to bona fide pop star to full-on backlash recipient and workplace-harassment-suit defendant, a process given extra intensity by the always-on news cycle and the constant hum of social-media chatter. While she's had her successes — she's accumulated chart-topping singles, Grammys and an Emmy, a shapewear line, and a nascent acting career — the highs and lows take a toll.


	As she told Rolling Stone, there was only one way for her to get out of her head: She had to get in the studio and work on music on her own terms. Over a two-week period, she took time out from making the follow-up to 2022's Special and busted out a hip-hop mixtape. While hip-pop cuts like the fizzy anthem “Juice” and the summer-song kiss-off “Truth Hurts” showed off Lizzo's dexterity with hooks and rhymes, My Face Hurts From Smiling is all about swagger, from the double-middle-finger salute Lizzo flaunts on its cover to its closing declaration, “It's a Lizzo summer, bitch.”

	











	In May, Lizzo laid some verses atop the Atlanta rappers Pluto and YK Niece's viral hit “Whim Whammiee,” a pumping cut with a playful braggadocio and a glittery Zaytoven-produced beat. Lizzo's additions promoted her clothing line (“Bitch, it's summer, we outside, put some Yitty on your titties,” she orders), shouted out Labubus and Kendrick Lamar's “N95,” and flaunted her sexual prowess in unbridled fashion. Getting back in touch with her hip-hop roots — and receiving raves — inspired her to dig in deeper and craft a mixtape, a form that allowed her and her collaborators — including longtime producer Ricky Reed—more space to play.

	The raunchy, high-energy My Face Hurts From Smoling, which clocks in at just over half an hour, starts off with a bang — or, really, a “Crashout”: “We outside, ho! We outside!” her friend and former groupmate Lexo taunts as Lizzo big-ups her ability to go “through the bullshit, turn it to a boppin'.” That idea, where the only way out of a rough patch is through music, persists throughout the tape, with Lizzo sending fire in the direction of her naysayers and reveling in how unstoppable the idea of complete creative freedom makes her feel. “Just 4 Fun” pairs schoolyard taunts and trap snares with Lizzo in high-speed mode, stealing a girl from a Call of Duty-glued mark and kicking another hapless game-player to the curb; “Bend it Ova” is a giddy bedroom romp set to a sparse beat that's part roller-rink jam, part abstract vocal art. Doja Cat drops in for “Still Can't Fuh,” which combines chopped-up gospel choirs with a withering assessment of a man who doesn't quite measure up, while SZA adds heat to “IRL,” a call to touch grass—“I can't let no comment section ever fuck with my vibe,” Lizzo declares.

NEW HAMPSHIRE — Whether you're a believer or skeptic, World UFO Day on July 2 is an occasion to ponder unexplained phenomena seen over the skies of the Granite State over several decades.

World UFO Day 2025 commemorates the 78th anniversary of what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers.” It started with the first widely publicized U.S. sighting of an unidentified flying object by a civilian pilot searching the Cascade Mountains of Washington for a crashed military aircraft, followed by the crash of a mysterious object near Roswell, New Mexico, on July 2, 1947. 

Together, those incidents more or less made it safe for Americans to talk about strange occurrences in the sky. 

The National UFO Reporting Center takes thousands of reports a year from people who can't explain what they're seeing, whether a bright light, a peculiarly shaped object, or an aircraft that rapidly accelerates and decelerates just as quickly, seemingly exceeding current understanding of propulsion.

This year alone, 17 reports have been made about strange sightings in the skies over New Hampshire. 

Some examples include a dark, silver disc, rotating with red and white lights, in Campton earlier this month. In Alton in May, a person reported seeing a cone-shaped object with lights that were not flashing or moving. Then, it traveled along the road and disappeared. A person from Rye reported a low-altitude, slow-moving aircraft that appeared to change form and defy conventional flight behavior. In Plymouth, another person reported an object in May that was not a plane or satellite. A white orb was reported in Hudson in mid-April. 

On June 24, 1947, civilian pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier, Washington, when he saw nine crescent-shaped objects flying in formation at about 10,000 feet at about a nearly impossible speed for the times of 1,200 to 1,700 mph.

It wasn't the first sighting of a UFO, but the public quickly became fascinated — and slightly terrified — after Arnold's sighting was reported worldwide. News coverage often included references to a “flying saucer,” a play on Arnold's statement that the object moved “like a saucer would if you skipped it over water.”

More reports followed during what became known as the “summer of the flying saucers,” including the Roswell incident. The Roswell Army Air Field announced in a July 8, 1947, news release that it had recovered the wreckage of a “flying disc” from W.W. “Mac” Brazel's ranch about 75 miles north of Roswell. 

The release was straightforward, noting:

The Roswell Army Air Field mentioned nothing in its press release about alien life, but people were already growing uneasy about what might be circling overhead. Brazel was among them. 

He thought the object he found on his ranch was similar to what Arnold had seen, or to the objects described in stories about flying saucers and discs, so he gathered some of the material from the wreckage, including rubber strips, tinfoil and thick paper, and deposited them with Sheriff George Wilcox, who in turn turned it over to the commanding officer of the Roswell Army Air Field.







Within 24 hours of the original press release, the military backtracked and said a mistake had been made and the “flying disc” was in reality a crashed weather balloon.

The story was widely accepted, and the Roswell incident might have become a forgotten chapter in history if not for a 1978 conversation between physicist and ufologist Stanton T. Friedman and Marcel, by then retired, according to an account in BBC's Sky At Night Magazine.

Marcel said the weather balloon story had been a cover, the photos had been staged, weather balloon debris had been substituted for the real wreckage, and that everyone involved in the retrieval believed it to be an extraterrestrial craft. The story was corroborated by a number of other retired military personnel who had been at Roswell at the time.

Some skeptics dismissed it as a tall tale, saying Marcel and others were seeking attention or writing themselves into the story. Regardless, Roswell became embedded in pop culture books, documentaries and movies.

One story that captured the attention of conspiracy theorists was that the military had seized the wreckage to reverse-engineer an extraterrestrial flight at Area 51 — a highly classified Air Force military installation in the Nevada desert primarily known for its role in developing and testing experimental aircraft and weapons systems. And a fake film clip purported to show “an alien autopsy” connected to Roswell.

Bowing to public pressure about the incident in the 1990s, the government launched a retrospective investigation that concluded the object that crashed was a Project Mogul weather balloon carrying top-secret equipment designed to search the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet nuclear tests.

2025 brings an interesting new twist to the story. 

According to an investigation by The Wall Street Journal published on June 6, the government fueled the UFO conspiracy theories, especially during the Cold War, to hide its true mission at Area 51. Specifically, the Pentagon wanted to conceal the development of advanced aircraft, such as the otherworldly-looking F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter, according to the report.

The disinformation campaign was uncovered by the All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, established by the Pentagon in 2022, to investigate UAP reports. A report last year dismissed the notion that the government covered up the existence of extraterrestrial life But, The Journal reported, “public disclosure left out the truth behind some of the foundational myths about UFOs: The Pentagon itself sometimes deliberately fanned the flames, in what amounted to the U.S. government targeting its own citizens with disinformation.”

As an investigation of the possibility of deliberate misinformation to hide secret programs continues, the government continues to take UAP and other unexplained phenomena seriously, The Associated Press reported.

Chales Fabian disappeared from Paradise in 1981

PARADISE, Calif. - The mysterious disappearance of Charles Fabian, a Paradise man who vanished more than 40 years ago, remains unsolved.

Fabian, affectionately known as Chuck by his friends, was last seen in August 1981. His wife reported him missing five days later, telling police it wasn't unusual for him to leave without informing her, but this time he hadn't taken any money and left his car behind.

When he went missing, Fabian was 27 years old. Today, he would be 70. He is described as white, standing 6 feet 2 inches tall, weighing 210 pounds, with brown hair and brown eyes. Notably, his left eye is glass.

Fabian also has distinctive tattoos, including a rose with the name Kathy on his arm and a peacock.

Anyone with information regarding Charles Fabian's disappearance is urged to contact Paradise Police at (530) 872-6241.

Follow:


            New satellite images show continuing work at Iran's Fordow nuclear enrichment plant, which was struck by US B-2 bombers just over a week ago.
    


            The imagery was collected by Maxar Technologies on Sunday. Maxar said it “reveals ongoing activity at and near the ventilation shafts and holes caused by last week's airstrikes on the Fordow fuel enrichment complex.”
    


            The pictures show “an excavator and several personnel are positioned immediately next to the northern shaft on the ridge above the underground complex. The crane appears to be operating at the entrance to the shaft/hole.”
    


            According to Maxar, several additional vehicles are also seen below the ridge and are parked along the path that was built to access the site.
    


            Earlier this month, American B-2 bombers dropped more than a dozen bunker-buster bombs on Iran's Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites, while Tomahawk missiles launched from a US submarine hit the Isfahan site in central Iran.
    


            The US Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP)﻿ bombs targeted the two ventilation shafts at Fordow, according to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan Caine.
    


            He told a Pentagon briefing last week that most of the bombs dropped at Fordow “were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down into the complex at greater than 1,000 feet per second, and explode in the mission space.”
    


            Former nuclear inspector David Albright, who now leads the Institute for Science and International Security, said that imagery from Fordow on Saturday showed “the Iranians are actively working at the two MOP impact sites penetrating the ventilation shafts” at the plant.
    


            Albright assessed that the activity “may include backfilling the craters, as well as conducting engineering damage assessments and likely radiological sampling. The craters above the main shafts remain open.”

            “We have observed that the Iranians have also rapidly repaired the bomb cratering damage on the main entrance road from only a few days prior. However, there are yet no indications of any efforts to reopen any of the tunnel entrances,” Albright posted on X.
    


            On Sunday, the head of the UN's nuclear watchdog said US strikes on Iran fell short of causing total damage to its nuclear program and that Tehran could restart enriching uranium “in a matter of months,” contradicting President Donald Trump's claims the US set Tehran's ambitions back by decades.
    


            The comments by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi appear to support an early assessment from the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency, first reported on by CNN, which suggests the United States' strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites last week did not destroy the core components of its nuclear program, and likely only set it back by months.
    


            While the final military and intelligence assessment has yet to come, Trump has repeatedly claimed to have “completely and totally obliterated” Tehran's nuclear program.

The S&P/TSX Composite Index, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all reached new record closing highs on Monday, as hopes for global trade deals and possible rate cuts eased investor uncertainty. The equity gains came as the Canadian dollar recouped all the ground it lost in a volatile pre-weekend move when U.S. President Donald Trump said he was halting trade talks with Canada. 

Both U.S. indexes ended the quarter with double-digit gains while Canada's main stock index rose 7.8% in the three-month period. The TSX has now gained for four straight quarters, and is up 8.6% since the start of the year. 

The TSX has been resilient thanks to expectations that a Canada-U.S. trade deal is looming and its favourable valuations coming into the year. Its strong performance underscores the reality that the index isn't the best representation of the underlying Canadian economy, which continues to struggle, said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. 

The Canadian benchmark, with its heavy representation of mining stocks, has been aided by strength in gold. Meanwhile, firm performance by banks and consumer stocks has helped to offset weakness in the energy sector. 

“BMO's strategy team continues to like Canadian equities given current valuations and a low earnings expectations bar. We just need some of this strength to bleed into the real economy,” Kavcic said in a note.

The S&P/TSX composite index on Monday ended up 164.79 points, or 0.6%, at 26,857.11, eclipsing the record closing high it posted on Thursday. 

The materials group rose 1.6% as the price of gold climbed. Heavily weighted financials added 0.6% and technology ended 0.9% higher. Of 10 major sectors, only energy ended lower. It lost 0.5% as the price of oil settled 0.6% lower at US$65.11 a barrel, weighed by easing Middle East risk and a possible OPEC+ output increase in August.

The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, rose as the U.S. said it will resume trade negotiations with Canada immediately after Ottawa scrapped its digital services tax targeting U.S. technology firms. Trump on Friday had halted the talks in response to the digital levy.

The loonie was trading 0.3% higher by late day at 1.3635 per U.S. dollar, or 73.34 U.S. cents, extending its recovery from an intraday low of 1.3758 on Friday. For June, the currency was up 0.8%. That's its fifth straight month of gains, the longest such stretch since 2020.

“Anyone who sold the Canadian dollar on Friday learned another tough lesson that Trump headlines are to be faded,” said Adam Button, chief currency analyst at ForexLive. “The market is increasingly eager to buy the dip on any opportunity and that includes selling the (U.S.) dollar.”

International police body Interpol says scam centers that use human trafficking victims to carry out their crimes have gone global. Once limited to Southeast Asia, the criminal model is spreading — and uses AI.

Human trafficking-fueled scam centers have significantly expanded their operations worldwide, according to a crime trend update released on Monday by the international police agency Interpol.

Hubs where trafficking victims are forced to take part in online fraud first emerged in a few Southeast Asian nations, but investigators are now also uncovering similar fraud centers in other regions.

According to the international police organization, victims now come from 66 countries across all continents, highlighting what Interpol describes as a ""global crisis"" involving hundreds of thousands of people.

Scam centers are now increasingly found in other regions, including the Middle East, West Africa — fast emerging as a new regional hub — and Central America.

Victims are often lured with fake job offers and then held captive in scam compounds. Many are blackmailed over alleged debts, beaten, sexually exploited, and in some cases tortured or raped.

Inside these centers, they are forced to run online scams, mostly targeting people abroad to steal money.

A 2024 Interpol-led operation exposed dozens of cases where victims were coerced into committing fraud, including a raid on an industrial-scale scam centre in the Philippines. That same year, police dismantled a centre in Namibia where 88 youths were forced to scam others.

Emerging technologies are fuelling this trend further. The crime update notes a surge in the use of artificial intelligence, from generating fake job ads to creating deepfake profiles for ""sextortion"" and romance scams.

Interpol says the pool of those preyed upon has widened significantly.

While early human trafficking victims were mainly Chinese-speaking and came from China, Malaysia, Thailand or Singapore, people are now being trafficked to such hubs from South America, East Africa and Western Europe.

""Tackling this rapidly globalizing threat requires a coordinated international response,"" said said Interpol's acting head of police services Cyril Gout.

The report found that about 90% of human trafficking facilitators came from Asia, while 11% were from South America or Africa.

About 80% of these facilitators were men, with 61% aged between 20 and 39.

Online scam centers were initially concentrated in Cambodia, with additional trafficking hubs later uncovered in Laos and Myanmar. Today, similar operations have been identified in at least four more Asian countries, and evidence shows the model is spreading to other regions such as West Africa, where cyber-enabled financial crime is already common.

In its findings, Interpol warned that the spread of such criminal networks needs urgent, coordinated action to disrupt trafficking routes and support victims.

Interpol said that these criminal hubs are increasingly intertwined with other major transnational crimes, demanding a globally coordinated response.

Trafficking routes used for scam centers are being exploited for smuggling drugs, firearms, and endangered wildlife like tigers and pangolins, Interpol said.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The top military commander in charge of troops deployed to Los Angeles to respond to protests against immigration raids has asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth if 200 of those forces could be returned to wildfire fighting duty, two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Monday. 

President Donald Trump ordered the deployment of about 4,000 California National Guard troops and 800 active duty Marines against the wishes of Gov. Gavin Newsom in early June to respond to a series of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Los Angeles. 

The federal troops' domestic deployment raised multiple legal questions, including whether the administration would seek to employ emergency powers under the Insurrection Act to empower those forces to conduct law enforcement on U.S. soil, which they are not permitted to do except in rare circumstances. The Marines, however, are primarily assigned to protecting federal buildings. 

The Insurrection Act has not been used. But in at least one circumstance, Marines have temporarily detained civilians in Los Angeles.

California has just entered peak wildfire season, and Newsom has warned that the Guard is now understaffed due to the Los Angeles protest deployment. 

The top military commander of those troops, U.S. Northern Command head Gen. Gregory Guillot, recently submitted a request to Hegseth to return 200 of the National Guard troops back to Joint Task Force Rattlesnake, which is the California National Guard's wildfire unit, the officials said. 




The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet announced publicly. 

Trump has contended that “there has been an invasion” of migrants entering the country without legal permission. At the height of the deployments some members of Congress in their annual budget hearings with the secretary questioned whether he foresaw extending the deployment nationwide, Hegseth did not provide a direct response. 

The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, at the time told the lawmakers “I don't see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading, but I'll be mindful of the fact that there have been some border issues.”

Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss Republicans' effort to pass President Donald Trump's budget bill and offer clarification on how it would impact the deficit. 

Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus are warning they have serious issues with the Senate's version of President Donald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" as it's currently written.

The group of GOP rebels argued in a public statement on Sunday that the Senate bill adds $1.3 trillion to the federal deficit, whereas the House-passed bill would increase the federal deficit by $72 billion.

""Even without interest costs, it is $651 billion over our agreed budget framework,"" the statement read.

The Senate is currently working through the bill and is expected to finish sometime later Monday or even on Tuesday.

The Senate bill would add an extra $1 trillion to raise the debt limit, compared to the House version and permanently extend certain corporate tax cuts in President Donald Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that the House only extended temporarily.

It also includes several specific new additions aimed at easing Senate Republicans' own concerns with the bill, including a $25 billion rural hospital fund to offset issues with Medicaid cuts, and a tax break for whalers that appears aimed at Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska.

The Senate is operating under a mechanism called ""current policy baseline,"" which would effectively zero-out the cost of extending TCJA tax cuts by calculating them as the de facto operational policy rather than calculating the cost as if they were not in place.

Absent congressional action, TCJA tax cuts expire at the end of 2025.

DEM DELAY TACTIC ENDS, DEBATE BEGINS ON TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

Conservatives in the House have warned they have serious issues with the bill, however. 

Reps. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., and Eric Burlison, R-Mo., both House Freedom Caucus members, said the bill could face steep odds — even fail — in the lower chamber if changes were not made.

Both said it could fail in a House-wide procedural vote before lawmakers could even contend with the measure itself. A rule vote is traditionally taken to allow for debate on legislation before lawmakers weigh in on it.

""If it gets through [the House Rules Committee], I don't think it survives on the floor in the current form it's in. You know, we told the senators that,"" Norman told Fox News Digital. ""They knew this all along.""

Norman said Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., had done a ""good job,"" but added of the Senate, ""They've got fighters... but we've just got to have certain things that comply with our House version.""

The legislation could still change before it gets to the House, however, as the Senate works through a parade of amendments from both Democrats and Republicans.

Burlison said it could depend on the fate of an amendment by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., which would significantly hike the Medicaid financial burden for states that expanded their Medicaid population under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). 

The change, if passed, would roll back the current 90% rate that the government pays for the Medicaid expansion population through the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) back down to the non-expansion rate, which hovers as low as 50%.

Scott's proposal could add hundreds of billions in savings to the plan, in addition to the nearly $1 trillion the Senate plan already saves in Medicaid spending.

""I don't see how what the Senate is doing will pass the House if [Rick Scott's amendment] does not pass at the minimum. It's probably going to take more spending reductions than that, but that would get the majority of us there,"" Burlison told Fox News Digital, without commenting on House GOP leaders.

He predicted the bill could be ""killed"" in the House-wide rule vote otherwise.

Indeed, several House Freedom Caucus members have taken to X to publicly urge Senate Republicans to approve Scott's amendment.

""All Republican Senators should vote YES on Senator Rick Scott's very reasonable 'elimination of theft from Medicaid' FMAP amendment,"" Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La., posted.

Fox News Digital reached out to Speaker Mike Johnson's office for comment on House Freedom Caucus members' comments.

Notably, key provisions originally in the House bill were stripped out of the legislation for not being ""Byrd-compliant.""

NATIONAL DEBT TRACKER: AMERICAN TAXPAYERS (YOU) ARE NOW ON THE HOOK FOR $36,215,806,064,740.36 AS OF 6/27/25

The ""Byrd Bath"" is a process during the budget reconciliation process in which the Senate parliamentarian, a non-partisan, unelected official tasked with advising on Senate policy, combs through the bill for whether it adheres to the strict budgetary guidelines of the reconciliation process.

Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process to advance Trump's agenda on taxes, the border, energy, defense, and the debt limit via one massive piece of legislation.

Budget reconciliation allows Republicans to bypass any Democratic opposition to pass their bill by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51.

They're aiming to have a bill on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July.

A GOP aide told Fox News Digital, ""The Senate version contains more in Byrd-compliant savings than the House, and correctly scores extending current tax policy as revenue-neutral — and assumes the kind of growth that was also massively underestimated last time around.""

The aide noted that the White House Council of Economic Advisers said the bill will generate $4.1 trillion in economic growth thanks to tax permanence, which is more than the House version.

Senate Republicans argue the bill would lead to $1.6 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years — above the House Freedom Caucus' demanded $1.5 trillion threshold.

Mark Zuckerberg on Monday unveiled his company's ""superintelligence"" ambitions as he takes on AI rivals OpenAI and Google in what he called ""the beginning of a new era for humanity,"" according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider.

The new lab will be led by Alexandr Wang, the former Scale AI CEO who joined Meta earlier this month after the company invested $14.3 billion in his data-labeling startup. Nat Friedman, former GitHub CEO and a prominent AI investor, will partner with Wang to co-lead MSL's research and product initiatives.

""As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight,"" Zuckerberg wrote in the memo, which Bloomberg first reported on. ""I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way.""

Zuckerberg emphasized that Meta's AI efforts aim to build systems that are not only as capable as humans, but ""personal"", deeply integrated into how people interact with technology.

The announcement comes amid a broader and increasingly aggressive push by Meta to compete with OpenAI and Google in the race to build the most advanced AI systems. AI has become Zuckerberg's top priority this year, fueling massive investments in infrastructure like chips and data centers, and a hiring spree targeting researchers from rival labs.

In addition to the Scale AI investment, Meta has reportedly held acquisition talks with Perplexity and Runway. The company is also reportedly expected to acquire PlayAI, a voice replication startup, as part of its push into AI personal assistants.Read Zuckerberg's full memo below: As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight. I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way. Today I want to share some details about how we're organizing our AI efforts to build towards our vision: personal superintelligence for everyone.

We're going to call our overall organization Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This includes all of our foundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab focused on developing the next generation of models.

Alexandr Wang has joined Meta to serve as our Chief AI Officer and lead MSL. Alex and I have worked together for several years, and I consider him to be the most impressive founder of his generation. He has a clear sense of the historic importance of superintelligence, and as co-founder and CEO he built ScaleAI into a fast-growing company involved in the development of almost all leading models across the industry.

Nat Friedman has also joined Meta to partner with Alex to lead MSL, heading our work on AI products and applied research. Nat will work with Connor to define his role going forward. He ran GitHub at Microsoft, and most recently has run one of the leading AI investment firms. Nat has served on our Meta Advisory Group for the last year, so he already has a good sense of our roadmap and what we need to do.

We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I'm excited to share as well:

I'm excited about the progress we have planned for Llama 4.1 and 4.2. These models power Meta AI, which is used by more than 1 billion monthly actives across our apps and an increasing number of agents across Meta that help improve our products and technology. We're committed to continuing to build out these models.

In parallel, we're going to start research on our next generation of models to get to the frontier in the next year or so. I've spent the past few months meeting top folks across Meta, other AI labs, and promising startups to put together the founding group for this small talent-dense effort. We're still forming this group and we'll ask several people across the AI org to join this lab as well.

Meta is uniquely positioned to deliver superintelligence to the world. We have a strong business that supports building out significantly more compute than smaller labs. We have deeper experience building and growing products that reach billions of people. We are pioneering and leading the AI glasses and wearables category that is growing very quickly. And our company structure allows us to move with vastly greater conviction and boldness. I'm optimistic that this new influx of talent and parallel approach to model development will set us up to deliver on the promise of personal superintelligence for everyone.

We have even more great people at all levels joining this effort in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. I'm excited to dive in and get to work.

Apple is considering using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house, according to a report from Bloomberg on Monday.

The iPhone maker continues to build out a project internally dubbed “LLM Siri” that uses in-house AI models, according to Bloomberg. However, Apple has reportedly asked OpenAI and Anthropic to train versions of their AI models that can run on Apple's cloud infrastructure for testing.

Apple was forced to delay its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges the company reportedly ran into. This failure may have been a long time coming; Apple has been falling behind Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic in the AI race for the last several years.

While Siri can already call on ChatGPT for difficult questions, Apple now seems to be exploring a much deeper integration with technology from third-party AI providers.

"https://news.google.com/rss/search?q=site:gizmodo.com","The ‘Superman' We Need Right Now: A Report From the Set of James Gunn's New DC Film","https://gizmodo.com/superman-james-gunn-set-visit-dc-david-corenswet-rachel-brosnahan-2000620467","Mon, 30 Jun 2025 16:00:31 GMT","

When Superman started kissing the football on a stick, it all clicked together. The day was June 24, 2024 and io9 was in Cleveland to watch the filming of James Gunn's Superman. At the end of a giant battle over the streets of Metropolis, the Man of Steel knelt down to kiss and profess his love to an inanimate object that special effects would later transform into his dog, Krypto. That little dash of heartfelt weirdness, in the middle of a massive action scene, did a near-perfect job of showing what the film's cast and crew had been trying to articulate all day: this is not just a unique, new Superman, it's James Gunn's Superman.

Superman is coming to theaters July 11 but last summer it was day 65 of 88, about two-thirds of the way through production. That production that started in Norway then went to Atlanta had now hit the streets of Cleveland, a city that's both ripe with Superman history (character creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster came up with the character there) and also had just the right look to stand in for Gunn's Metropolis. It's here where the exteriors of the Daily Planet were filmed, where several blocks were shut down and redecorated with all manner of cars, rubble, and extras, standing in for the giant climactic battle between Superman, his friends, and Lex Luthor. Or so we guessed.

Over a year from release, almost everyone involved that we spoke with—writer-director James Gunn, and stars David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, Edi Gathegi, Wendell Pierce, Skyler Gisondo, Beck Bennett, Sara Sampaio, Mikaela Hoover, and more—were very cautious about what could, and couldn't, be revealed. But in between the lines was the message that Gunn is making a Superman movie about a character who is struggling. He's struggling to find a legacy between his Earth and Kryptonian roots, struggling to make a meaningful relationship with Lois Lane, and of course struggling to fight some kind of world-ending threat that may or may not have to do with tech billionaire Lex Luthor hoping to rid Earth of his archnemesis.

Whatever the story is actually about, it's focused and direct. The film takes place over the span of about a week and picks up in a world where superheroes have existed for centuries and Superman is already a hero. “Superman already exists. Lois and Clark already know each other. Lex hates Superman's guts from the beginning, although they don't know each other personally. So we start right in the middle of the action,” Gunn said.

Corenswet loved that as a place to start his character, one he could potentially be playing for a long, long time. “The way I think you learn about a character is watching what strategies they employ to overcome whatever their big problem is to begin with, and how they react, how their spirit reacts, how they react when they they fail, when they fall short, when their strategy doesn't work. And that's the whole opening sequence of this movie,” the new Superman said.

“You're seeing Superman right in the middle of a big fight, the fight of his life at that point, although he'll have bigger ones later. And really throwing everything he's got at this fight and very few things are working … it's really seeing a character who … a lot of people think of as invincible and impervious and always optimistic and hopeful. And you're seeing him in a moment where all of that is being very heavily tested. And so, as a moment to meet the character and especially where he doesn't really overcome … to have that be the jumping off point for the rest of the story was really fun because it leaves you everywhere to go.”

From there, in typical Superman fashion, the film will feature the character as Superman, Clark Kent, and interestingly enough, a version best described as “Clark Superman”—a take where the character's identity is known. Corenswet says most of his time is as Superman himself but it's pretty split throughout the film. “It's a lot of Superman and a small but significant amount of Clark,” he said. “And then there's a, I don't know, 20% of a middle ground where he's either with people who know both of his identities or with people as Superman, where he's not really performing as Superman. He's not in public as Superman, so there's more of Clark in that Superman than there is normally. And then there are a couple of moments where as Clark, he is with somebody who also knows that he's Superman, but first he's Clark. These would be like scenes with Ma and Pa Kent where he's not pretending to be Clark. He's not his character of Clark, but he's more the boy who grew up than he is the superhero that everybody sees.”

Over the course of multiple decades, movies, actors, directors, and more, everyone has seen all those versions of Superman and more. To bring something different to the character and vibe of the film, Gunn made sure his star was very well-versed in All-Star Superman, the 2005 comic series written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely. It was a huge inspiration for the filmmaker as well as the actor.

“The thing that I found in that was the gentle nerdiness of Superman,” Corenswet said. “I love seeing when he goes into his Fortress of Solitude that he's got a man cave. Not in the way that… it's not a Bat Cave. He's got his technology and stuff, but it's mostly all of these relics and fun things that he's gotten to collect because he does what he does. And he wants to show them off to Lois because he can't show them off to many people because he's not supposed to. That sort of… the gentle loneliness of that, but without any sense of dark brooding, just like brimming with excitement about the things that he gets to do and collect. And wanting to bring other people into that and just not being able to.”

While that specific scene isn't in the movie itself, the Fortress of Solitude definitely is, as is Superman's friend and love interest, Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane. Their relationship is front and center from the very beginning and, on set in 2024, everyone was very careful about revealing too many specifics about it. However, we now know from marketing that Lois is aware of Superman's secret identity for most of the film. And that revelation brings a lot of context to how Gunn described their relationship last year.

“I don't think it's something we've ever seen in any superhero movie ever,” Gunn said about his two leads. “It's a complicated relationship and we really get into it. There are long scenes that are about their relationship and the way they relate and what it would be like for a person who's this incredibly intelligent, strong-headed, stubborn, skeptical journalist, to have a relationship with someone who can lift a skyscraper.”

“Yeah, I think it's pretty special,” Brosnahan, best known for her award-winning role on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, said in agreement. “There have been so many wonderfully iconic versions of this relationship. And I do think that this particular film is honoring the mythology and the lore that's been built before, but it's swinging the lens to look at it from a slightly different angle at a slightly different point in time.”

Lois Lane is never just about her relationship with Clark Kent or Superman, though, and that's no different in this version. Brosnahan is bringing a grounded nature to the character, a hard-hitting journalist who has a very distinct perspective on Superman and his place in this world. “She's hungry for that front page, always,” she said. “And there's a big story that unfolds over the course of this movie that she becomes embroiled in. I think she appreciates Superman's existence, and then sometimes has questions about his methodology. I think she's somebody who sees around every corner and questions everything and everyone.”

Another person who sees every angle from every direction is Lex Luthor. We've seen many versions of Lex over the years but this one has more going on than most. Though he's still that billionaire tech genius on the outside, this Lex goes much deeper. “One of the things I really love about this version of Lex is that all his beliefs and fears are what drive him” Hoult said. “But in some ways that drive is real and what he is weary of, what Superman represents, is something that could be a real danger and threat to humanity … his beliefs and almost his love of humanity and this idea that they should be master of their own fate and destiny is important to him. [While] the rest of society has kind of fallen into this path of trusting Superman, believing in Superman.”

Among the people who believe in Superman, of course, is James Gunn himself. Gunn is not just the writer and director, he's also the co-president of DC Films, meaning he has more than a little riding on the success of this movie. And so, he feels, Superman is something a bit more elevated than the previous comic book movies he's known for. “I start with a place that's very hopeful, fun, but incredibly grim, incredibly serious, all at the same time. It's humorous, but it certainly is not as comic, or as much a comedy as either Suicide Squad or Guardians,” he said.

Brosnanan put an even finer point on Gunn's film. “It feels hopeful rather than explicitly comedic to me,” she said. “I think one of the things I love about so many of these movies is that they're a real shot in the arm of hope. It reminds you the reason people love comic books is because they teach us that superheroes aren't the only superheroes. They aren't the only ones with important powers in these worlds. They remind us the importance of courage and tenacity and interest in each other's well-being… A lot of these movies, you know, the best Batman movies were such a specific representation of these comics at a specific moment in time. And I think part of the reason they were so successful is because they felt like what we needed. So the hope is that this version is the Superman movie right now.”

Right now, on the set of Superman, a whole block of downtown Cleveland is closed off and covered with Metropolis emergency vehicles. There are piles of rubble everywhere, smoking cars, giant blue screens standing in for landing spaceships. And, at one point, seemingly the entire cast reuniting for what must have been the very end of the film. We can't hear what they're saying. We do know that there are well over 100 Easter eggs in the film, with seemingly every street, store, van and Post-It note in the movie given careful consideration as a little treat for audiences. Oh, and there's also a man who can leap tall buildings in a single bound, kneeling down, kissing a rubber football on a stick, and saying he loves it. Yup, this is a James Gunn Superman movie all right.

Superman opens in theaters July 11. Warner Bros. provided travel and accommodations to Cleveland for this story.

Fans of “General Hospital” have spent the last week or so anticipating the demise of Natalia Ramirez, played by Eva LaRue. She got a DWI, and it wasn't her first one, so ADA Turner had her over a barrel. If she handed over everything she had on Sonny Corinthos, then it would be an even trade; otherwise, Natalia was looking at years in the clink. She went to Sonny and told him everything, and he agreed to relocate her to Belize. All she had to do was trust him.

Instead, Natalia flipped out once she realized that Sonny wouldn't be joining her in Belize, and the last time that we saw her, she was mixing pills and booze until she passed out. Now, Soap Opera Digest is confirming that Eva LaRue has wrapped up her run on the sudser.

The actress, who first made her debut on “General Hospital” on February 26, 2024, will air for the final time this week. She shared her thoughts on the show, saying, “I was originally only supposed to be on the show for a couple of months, and it ended up being a much longer run, which was great — and really fun because there are so many ‘All My Children' actors there and so it felt like home.”

LaRue says that she knew her days were numbered. “I started to feel it in January. They tried to rehabilitate my character, and then all of a sudden, I have these scenes in January where, because Natalia had lied about her ex-husband [Sidwell] and broken his trust, Sonny was like, ‘We can't be friends anymore.' And I thought, ‘Uh-oh, there we go,' because that [relationship with Sonny] was kind of my character's only lifeline.”

It seemed for a moment like the GH writers wanted to put Natalia and Sonny together as more than friends, but Eva knew that was never going to work. “People just weren't buying it, because they just hated my character so much. I was so vilified that no matter what [the writers] did, it just wasn't a solid enough rehabilitation that they were gonna buy me with Sonny. And so when they finally let that idea go, I realized, ‘Okay, I'm probably not much longer for this world.' ”

On her last day of filming, “Frank [Valentini] called me upstairs and we had a really good exit chat. It was really fun working for Frank,” LaRue shares. “He was lovely and we've been friends for a zillion years, going back to the New York days. And he and John [Callahan, ex-Edmund, AMC, her late ex-husband] were good friends.”

The actress absolutely loved sharing scenes with Maurice Benard, saying,  “What a rock star! That was a blast. I was so glad they put me with Maurice. That was really fun.”

Then there was Carlo Rota, whose Jenz Sidwell ended up being Natalia's ex-husband. “He's so great. I actually had hope for a minute there that even if it didn't work out with Sonny, that they were going to somehow pair me and Carlo up to be villains together. I was like, ‘Maye they'll just double down on the villain/villainess thing and have us be in cahoots!' I thought that could be super-interesting. I thought, ‘Oh, this could be super-good because our stuff is so fiery and so fun. And it was fun having a son for a minute there, too, in the form of Adrian Anchondo (Marco).”

In the end, Eva loved her time as Natalia. “I had a blast at General Hospital. I loved being there, and I had a lot of really great scenes, and I loved everybody that I got to work with. It was just an awesome experience, and I was really glad that I got to stay longer than I was supposed to.”
