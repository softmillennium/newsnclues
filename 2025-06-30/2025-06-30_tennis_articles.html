                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Fabio Fognini produced such a memorable performance Monday at Wimbledon against Carlos Alcaraz, the 38-year-old is considering making it his last match. The nine-time ATP Tour singles champion had already made clear this would be his final season and therefore his last appearance at Wimbledon. But after pushing the second seed to five gripping sets on Centre Court, he is thinking about leaving the sport on a high. “I think this probably [the] best way to say [goodbye] to Wimbledon, and maybe for the tennis. That's what I'm thinking now,” Fognini said. I have a lot of emotion coming to my mind. Yes, was super amazing atmosphere over there.

I didn't win so many matches… “I said before, there is no better way to play in this court with a great champion that I have a lot of respect with him and for his team, because I know them very, very well.” Alcaraz has now won a personal-best 19 consecutive matches, but for much of his clash with Fognini, the Spaniard was left scrambling for answers. Fognini, who once stunned Rafael Nadal in five sets at the US Open, was not far from ousting Alcaraz at SW19. “To finish here, I can't ask a better way. Now, of course, there is something that is salty in my mouth because I had my chance, if we [are] speaking about tennis,” Fognini said. He played against Jannik one month ago [an] amazing final, so all the respect for him.” It was even more meaningful for Fognini considering he entered the match on a 10-match tour-level losing streak. It was not only proof for himself, but for the world, that on his day the Italian could test anyone on the circuit. But I was up again 2-1 with [a] break. This is probably, if we can say, the worst game when I was up with my serve. Then I won very good the fourth one. I didn't deserve to be 4-Love down, at least 2-2. © Copyright 1994 - 2024 ATP Tour, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>ESPN will have full coverage of Wimbledon this year. Sabalenka, 27, is currently taking on unseeded Carson Branstine. The Canadian tennis star has made headlines coming into Wimbledon this year. Branstine, 24, played college tennis for the Texas A&M Aggies. She helped lead the SEC program to a national championship during her redshirt senior season in 2024. The Canadian tennis star has since turned pro. Branstine has been trending on social media, too. "Nice to meet you Wimbledon," she wrote coming into the 2025 tournament. “This sport has given me everything,” she told Wimbledon. “It gave me a free college education. I've gotten to see the world and travel the world, not just as a tourist, but with a purpose. And that's something I take to heart, a lot. It's giving me everything and I think that's why in some of these big moments, I was able to pull through in the last few weeks because I really enjoy being out there. Branstine has been doing some modeling on the side, too. “A cool little side hustle," she admitted. Branstine is all about tennis this week, though. Of course, she has her work cut out for her as she attempts to take down the No. Meet The Women's Tennis Player Turning Heads At Wimbledon This Year first appeared on The Spun on Jun 30, 2025 This story was originally reported by The Spun on Jun 30, 2025, where it first appeared.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The two-time defending champion was given all he could handle by former Top 10 player Fabio Fognini, playing in his final Wimbledon, on Day 1 at the All England Club but survived a five-set first round in more than four hours on Centre Court, 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 6-1.As air temperatures soared past 90 degrees Fahrenheit, Alcaraz was just the third reigning men's champion in the Open Era taken to five sets in his first round match the next year, following Roger Federer in 2010 (against Alejandro Falla) and Bjorn Borg in 1978 (against Victor Amaya) thanks to the combination of an off-kilter start from his side and a vintage performance by the 38-year-old Fognini, who entered Wimbledon on an 11-match losing streak at tour level.But after four sets that lasted nearly four hours, Alcaraz found a more consistent level against a fading Fognini to avoid becoming just the third reigning Wimbledon men's champion to lose his first match the following year in four hours and 38 minutes, and avoid losing in the first round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time.While Alcaraz admitted his play could've been better, he first paid deep respects to the Italian veteran 16 years his senior who reached his best ranking of No. "To be honest, I don't know why it's his last Wimbledon, because the level he just showed, he can still play three, four more years," Alcaraz said. "I have to give him the credit of a great match. He's a great player; he has shown during his whole career the level and the talent that he has ... so I'm a little bit sad that it was his Wimbledon, but happy to have shared the court with him and the locker room with him."

The first nine games of the match went with serve before Alcaraz won the last three in a row, and in set three, he regrouped after losing a 5-3 lead to forge ahead two-sets-to-one.But he only hit three errors in the final set, where play was stopped for nearly 15 minutes after three games as a result of a spectator medical issue. Alcaraz had previously broken Fognini for 2-0 from 40-15 behind, and later saved two break points to lead 3-0. Out of the break, he broke again from 40-0. "Playing the first match on Centre Court is never easy," he confessed. In general, I think it was a great match. "Alcaraz is now 14-1 in five set matches in his career, a mark which includes the nearly five-and-a-half hour epic he won against Jannik Sinner earlier this month to triumph at Roland Garros.

After topping a veteran, Alcaraz will next face a relative unknown quantity in the form of British qualifier Oliver Tarvet. "I just saw his name when he qualified for the first time," Alcaraz said. If he's in the second round, he has a great level, so I be focused on that and will try to put my best tennis on the match. "I just saw his name when he qualified for the first time," Alcaraz said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Ahead of Wimbledon, Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff showed that they had put any differences aside when they performed a TikTok dance together last week. After Gauff defeated Sabalenka at Roland Garros earlier this month to win the French Open, Sabalenka made some controversial comments as she stated that she believed Gauff won not because she played great, but because Sabalenka did not perform well in the poor conditions and was overly emotional. Sabalenka went on to say she thought that Iga Swiatek would have defeated Gauff had she beaten Sabalenka in the semifinal. Sabalenka received lots of backlash for her comments, and Gauff disagreed, pointing out that she had defeated Swiatek recently in straight sets. Sabalenka went on to release a statement and acknowledged that Gauff earned her victory. Sabalenka additionally messaged Gauff privately to apologize, and said she learned her lesson from her comments. "We've always been really good with Coco," Sabalenka said over the weekend. "Honestly, as I said in my statement and in my message to her, I didn't want to offend her. I was just completely upset with myself and emotions got over me and I just completely lost it. I messaged her to apologize and make sure she understood that I didn't mean to offend her. I'm happy that she was like, 'All good, don't worry.' So, I hope the U.S. media can be easy on me right now." It was a tough time for me. The lesson is learned and definitely not going to happen again." On Gauff's end, she said it was not hard to accept Sabalenka's apology and that she understood where Sabalenka was coming from with some of her comments after the French Open. "I understood what she was trying to say," Gauff said. Some of the stuff she said in the presser I was a bit more surprised about. It wasn't very hard to accept that apology. ... That [Tiktok] was to show people we are on good terms. I thought it would be a good idea for that so people could see it and move on because I think we're both tired of talking about it."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>I don't know why it is Fabio's last Wimbledon because the level he has shown shows he can still play for three or four more years. I have to give him the credit for such a great match. He has shown the level and talent he has throughout his whole career and he has shown that once again today, so I'm just a bit sad that this is probably his last Wimbledon. I'm happy to have shared the court and locker room many times with him. We got to enjoy the last of him. 🤩Carlos Alcaraz wins an epic duel in the sun against Fabio Fognini, 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/JF9prwRk1q The entire Royal Box are on their feet clapping. This is probably the last time Fognini will play on Centre and he gave it everything. A touch of class from Carlos Alcaraz, who leads the applause for Fabio Fognini 👏#Wimbledon pic.twitter.com/ZiRn7ya2aJ Unreturned serve to open the game from Alcaraz followed by a drop shot winner, 30-0. Fognini stays alive with a forehand return winner down the line. Top spin second serve into the corner, Fognini nets a backhand return. He deserves it because he has put on a show and given the fans value for their money. Alcaraz to serve for the match next! Alcaraz wants this over and done with. How will that delay impact things now? It starts brightly for Fognini as he builds a 40-15 lead. Alcaraz fights back and makes it decue then earns a break point. Fognini saves it with a forehand winner but faces another break point against him when he nets a volley. Fognini miscues a backhand long and Alcaraz breaks. Rather repugnant scenes in this suspension of play on Centre Court. As a spectator is treated for what we should pray is ‘only' sunstroke, other fans whip out their phones to try to get selfies with Alcaraz. Alcaraz is at one end of the court, keeping an eye on what is happening and twirling his racket. Fognini is at the other end, talking to his support box. But a chair is being brought out it appears.</p>

Reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova will open her title defense next Tuesday against 2025 breakout star Alexandra Eala on Centre Court -- one of several first-round clashes to circle in the draw for the 2025 Championships. Krejcikova missed the first five months of 2025 with a back injury and had to withdraw from this week's Eastbourne quarterfinals citing a thigh injury. Eala captured the tennis world's attention in March by defeating three Grand Slam champions -- Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek -- to reach the Miami semifinals. The 20-year-old Filipina has reached her first grass-court final this week in Eastbourne. The three-time major winner opens against fast-rising qualifier Carson Branstine, and potential third-round opponents include 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova, Nottingham titlist McCartney Kessler and 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu. 2 seed Coco Gauff will start against the big-hitting Nottingham finalist Dayana Yastremska, with former World No. Meanwhile, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, playing the final Championships of her career, will face No. 10 seed and 2024 quarterfinalist Emma Navarro in the first round. [1] Aryna Sabalenka vs. [6] Madison Keys[4] Jasmine Paolini vs. [5] Zheng Qinwen[7] Mirra Andreeva vs. [3] Jessica Pegula[8] Iga Swiatek vs. [2] Coco Gauff This week in Wimbledon qualifying, Carson Branstine served notice of her confidence. "Maybe not everyone knows me, but I think I can beat anyone out there," the Canadian said after defeating Lois Boisson, her second upset of a No. 1 survive Branstine -- and, indeed, a guaranteed former Wimbledon quarterfinalist in Round 2, either Marie Bouzkova or Lulu Sun -- she'll still have to navigate a section that includes two of this year's grass-court titlists just to reach the fourth round. That includes Vondrousova, who defeated Sabalenka en route to the Berlin title last week. A silver lining is that these dangerous opponents will have to take each other out first: Vondrousova opens against Kessler, and the winner will potentially face Raducanu in the second round. Raducanu herself faces an intriguing start against a British compatriot, 17-year-old wild card Mingge Xu. 14 seed Elina Svitolina, a two-time semifinalist, is projected to be Sabalenka's fourth-round opponent. Ruse stretched Keys to a 7-6(1), 2-6, 7-5 scoreline in the Australian Open second round. Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Aryna Sabalenka, Marketa Vondrousova, Elina Svitolina, Donna Vekic Last year's finalist, Jasmine Paolini, has built on the momentum of her 2024 breakthrough this season, most notably claiming the Rome title on home soil last month. 11 Anastasija Sevastova, the 35-year-old currently making a comeback from both maternity leave and an ACL injury. Sevastova also has prior form on grass: between 2016-18, she reached three consecutive Mallorca finals, claiming the title in 2017. Two big hitters lie in Paolini's projected path before the quarterfinals: No. Anisimova was a 2022 Wimbledon quarterfinalist, and reached her first grass-court final at Queen's two weeks ago. 5 seed Zheng lost in the first round last year to eventual quarterfinalist Lulu Sun, and starts against another potential banana skin this year. 1 Katerina Siniakova has beaten Zheng in both of their completed meetings -- both of which have come on grass, at Wimbledon 2023 and Berlin 2024. Zheng leads her head-to-head against Osaka 2-1, including their only grass-court meeting at Berlin 2024. 12 seed Diana Shnaider, the 2024 Bad Homburg champion, is Zheng's projected fourth-round opponent. Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Jasmine Paolini, Ons Jabeur, Jelena Ostapenko Watching the 37-year-old mother-of-two Maria slicing her way to the Queen's title was a reminder that old-school finesse can be as effective -- if not more -- on grass than modern-day power. She'll have another shot at a big-name upset if she meets Pegula in the second round, having won both of her previous meetings against the American -- albeit on clay in 2011 and 2016 respectively. Maria will have to defeat Katie Volynets first, while Pegula opens against Elisabetta Cocciaretto. Maria isn't the only mother to watch in this quarter. Kvitova, who announced this week that she will retire from the sport this year, will be appearing at Wimbledon for the last time. Despite having only won one match since returning from maternity leave in February, the Czech will be motivated to go out on a high. Meanwhile, former Eastbourne champion Belinda Bencic's comeback from maternity leave started superbly, with the Abu Dhabi title in February rocketing the Swiss player back into the Top 100, but was set back by an arm injury ahead of Roland Garros. Bencic is in Pegula's section of the draw, and will start against big-serving Alycia Parks. 7 seed reached her first Grand Slam fourth round at Wimbledon two years ago, but has won just one match on the surface since. She opens against Mayar Sherif, and is projected to face either Navarro or Krejcikova in the fourth round. Another 2007-born player, Iva Jovic, could be one to watch in the third quarter as well. She opens against Suzan Lamens and could face No. Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Barbora Krejcikova, Petra Kvitova, Tatjana Maria The last time Gauff faced Yastremska was arguably a turning point in her season. But Gauff clawed back a 0-6, 6-2, 7-5 victory -- and went on to make three consecutive clay-court finals, culminating in her second major crown at Roland Garros. In the rematch, Yastremska comes in with better form on grass, having made the Nottingham final while Gauff lost her Berlin opener to Wang Xinyu. She'll face either Azarenka or in-form qualifier Anastasia Zakharova in the second round. She's defeated projected third-round opponent Kenin in both of their meetings this year, including a 6-0, 6-0 whitewash in Miami -- but Kenin won their only previous grass-court encounter at Wimbledon 2023. 19 seed Liudmila Samsonova, fast-rising 19-year-old Maya Joint -- who has reached her first grass-court final in Eastbourne this week -- and last year's Eastbourne champion, No. 1 Iga Swiatek is in a position she's rather unaccustomed to. 8 seeding is her lowest in over four years, since she was also seeded No. The Pole did not reach a final in over a year, since winning her fifth major title in Paris last year -- but she snapped that drought in Bad Homburg this week to notch the first grass-court final of her career. After her semifinal exit at Roland Garros to Sabalenka, Swiatek told press that a silver lining was that she would be able to do a proper grass-court pre-season for the first time rather than needing to decompress after a gruelling clay swing. She opens against Polina Kudermetova, and is projected to face No. All eyes could be on a marquee fourth-round match between Swiatek and No. Rybakina -- who led Swiatek 6-1, 2-0 at the same stage of Roland Garros before falling -- starts against Armenian No. Former Wimbledon semifinalists or better: Elena Rybakina, Victoria Azarenka Barbora Krejcikova will open her Wimbledon title defense against Alexandra Eala, while Aryna Sabalenka's section of the 2025 draw includes Carson Branstine, Marketa Vondrousova, Emma Raducanu and McCartney Kessler.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz is eyeing a third consecutive title at SW19, and opens up proceedings on Centre Court on Monday against Italian journeyman Fabio Fognini. Third seed Alexander Zverev is also in action on Monday, while British No 2 Jacob Fearnley faces highly-rated Brazilian Joao Fonseca. Raducanu is the third match on court. British No 2 Katie Boulter faces a tough first round test against ninth seed Paula Badosa in the second match on Centre Court, while world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka is also in action on Day 1. Two double faults put Raducanu under pressure, and Xu eventually breaks back - again! Three breaks on the trot in this one as Raducanu wrestles back control, breaking Mimi Xu for a 3-1 lead in this second set. Can she back up the break this time? It's doubtful Carlos Alcaraz will need to be told. If the effervescent, at times mesmerising, 22-year-old Spaniard wants to claim his third consecutive Wimbledon title, he'll have to play a damn sight better than he did here on day one. Gasps were aplenty at last Friday's draw ceremony when wily old fox Fabio Fognini was picked to face the defending champion. The old-school maverick is entering his final months on tour and, at the age of 38, seemed a routine first round conquest for Alcaraz, himself on an 18-match win-streak following his French Open triumph against Jannik Sinner. Yet the inspired Italian thrived in a final big-match moment here, conducting the 15,000 in attendance with a brash arrogance even if, in the end, he came up short. Ultimately, Alcaraz prevailed in five captivating sets, emerging triumphant via a 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 scoreline, over four-and-a-half hours, on the hottest opening day in Wimbledon history. New knights of the realm Gareth Southgate and David Beckham endured their fair share of unconvincing victories in England colours and they witnessed another one here, perched in the front row of the Royal Box. Raducanu races to 40-0 on serve courtesy of some brilliant serving but is pegged back to deuce - and Xu breaks back at the first time of asking! This was Fabio Fognini's last ever match at Wimbledon before bidding farewell to the sport. After that performance, Carlos Alcaraz isn't sure why! “Unbelievable, I have to give him the credit. “A little bit sad that it's his last Wimbledon but happy to have shared the court with him so many times.” She had chances to hold in a mammoth service game but was eventually broken after multiple deuces. Fogioni holds to 30 after another nervy service game in this fifth set. Now, an on-fire Alcaraz serves for the match. Elsewhere, Felix Auger-Aliassime has finally won that five-set epic against James Duckworth. Harriet Dart is now locked in a decider against Dalma Galfi, having split the first two sets 6-3 each. Marketa Vondrousova has been pegged back to 5-4 from a 3-0 lead, after taking the first set 6-1, but she's serving for the match now. And Henry Searle - boys' champion here two years ago - is staring down the barrel of defeat, 5-1 down to Ethan Quinn in the fourth set and two sets to one down.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Nick Kyrgios has not played tennis on the ATP Tour since the Miami 2025 Masters 1000 in March While he had planned to play the grass and Wimbledon season, he finally announced his withdrawal on June 3. Kyrgios confirms his intention to return to the circuit this summer, in Washington, and intends to also play the US Open and UTS in Hong Kong (October 14-15). He told Tennis Majors on Saturday in London while filming an episode of the show All On The Table, designed by UTS and broadcast on YouTube. “I had an injury to my right knee a few days ago,” he revealed. I was just on the practice court, and my right knee was kicking me a little bit, it didn't calm down in time for the grass season. But I'm going to play in Washington (July 21-27) and do the American tour. In his Instagram post announcing his absence, he spoke of a “small incident along the way”. Kyrgios has won Washington twice, in 2019 and 2022, and has not played there since winning the title three years ago. He reached the quarter-finals of the US Open, beaten by Karen Khachanov in five sets, with big ambitions following his final at Wimbledon. My body can't stand it too much anymore.” For the past two years, Kyrgios has not been able to play consistently, hampered by his wrist and knee. This will be the second appearance of the Australian, who played one match at UTS New York in 2024. “I'm just going to play UTS for the rest of my life! I have never been to Hong Kong. In the way I eat, and all that.” Your email address will not be published.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>LONDON (AP) — Ninth-seeded Daniil Medvedev is out of another Grand Slam tournament in the first round after losing to 64th-ranked Benjamin Bonzi 7-6 (2), 3-6, 7-6 (3), 6-2 at Wimbledon on Monday. And that followed a second-round loss at the Australian Open to 19-year-old qualifier Learner Tien. “For the moment, I'm not that worried,” said Medvedev, who is ranked No. “If I finish the year somewhere around (No.) 15 in the world, maybe I will be more worried. For the moment, I am not.” The last time Medvedev lost consecutive Grand Slam first-round matches was in 2017 — at Melbourne Park in his major tournament debut, followed by Roland-Garros. Medvedev lost in five sets to Cameron Norrie in Paris this year. In 2023, the Russian was seeded No. 2 at Roland-Garros and lost in the first round to Thiago Seyboth Wild, a qualifier who was ranked 172nd at the time.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In that same tournament, he announced himself to the world when he claimed his maiden Top 10 win by defeating Daniil Medvedev. Hailing from Irvine, California, Tien is the latest American star to emerge in recent years. “I think (it was) one of my dad's old rackets that were lying around. "So they didn't really even expect for me or my sister to start playing tennis that young. "It's not like they were prepped with little kiddy rackets or anything. I got to the courts a couple times a week, just with my dad, just watching him play in random men's leagues. "So that's kind of how I got introduced. Eventually my dad started taking me to the courts, randomly feeding me balls from a pretty young age, and then it kind of just progressed from there on.” Tien went on to excel in junior tournaments and secured a spot in the prestigious United States Tennis Association youth development programme. Although tennis for a while wasn't Tien's priority, he had entered high school early at the age of 11 after being homeschooled by his mom, who named him Learner in homage to her profession as a teacher. I wouldn't have summer break and stuff like that. I would just work throughout the year. So I just naturally finished those early grades pretty quick. And then, yeah, I didn't see really a reason just to stop me there. “I obviously like tennis more than I like school, so it was a good motivation for me to kind of get away from school just to go and play. But throughout juniors, my parents did a very good job, honestly, of not putting a lot of pressure on me to win" Now it's June 2025, and tennis is definitely Tien's priority. That French Open dream was cut short, as Tien faced a mammoth task in the first round with World No.3 and last year's finalist Alexander Zverev standing opposite him. But fast forward a month, and Tien has fared better in the first round  of another Grand Slam. He secured a 7-6, 6-3, 6-2 win on Court 6 to advance to the second round at the All England Club. I think if you told both of us a long time ago that this would happen, we would both be really happy," Tien said, after his first win at Wimbledon that came over a friend he first met on court at Under-8 level. "I honestly just think that it's cool we got to play each other here on this stage. We've been playing for a long time through juniors, national tournaments, challengers." Tien, who will play Holger Rune or Nicolas Jarry next, is regarded as one of the brightest talents in tennis, and he has been touted as a future top 10 player. Speaking exclusively to talkSPORT earlier this year, long-time broadcaster Jonathan Overend discussed how far the American can go. And the really exciting thing for tennis in 2025 is there's a crop now of teenage talents," Overend explained. "And for a little while we've been looking down the rankings and thinking, 'Okay, where are the really young players? Not just Tien, Alex Michelsen also had a great year from the United States. "We've got the young Brazilian, Joao Fonseca, who is potentially going to be a future world number one. "I'd be maybe a little bit more confident in saying Fonseca is a future top 10 and potential grand slam champion than Tien. Fonseca can whack players off the court. "Tien, a little bit more crafty, might rely on those longer matches, the physicality of things, and his all-round stroke play. I'm talking potential top 10 players in the not too distant future." Overend went on to suggest the likes of Tien, Fonseca and Michelsen can one day climb the rankings to lead a new generation of players. He continued: "There are loads of them (young stars). "And that's what's really exciting, because I think for the casual tennis fans, people have been saying for the last couple of years now, 'What's going to happen after Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic?' "You know, where are the next players? Well, the answer is there's loads of them. That's what's making this tennis season so exciting, that we're now building a crop of players who could win the big titles in the next couple of years."

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur was reduced to tears after she was forced to retire from her round one match. Jabeur was first out on Court 14 but after just 26 minutes of action in her match against Viktoriya Tomova disaster struck. The Tunisian looked visibly distressed sat on her courtside seat and a medical time-out was called. She had her blood pressure taken and her vitals were checked before she was taken away off court for further examination. 'I wasn't expecting not to feel good,' Jabeur said in a statement after it was decided she would no hold a press conference. 'I've been practising pretty well in the last few days but I guess these things happen. It doesn't really help me with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it was a very tough season for me. 'So I hope I'm going to feel better and we'll see what's going to happen.' The delay to treat Jabeur lasted 14 minutes before she attempted valiantly to try and play on. But early in the second set with the sun beaming down and delivering scorching hot temperatures, Jabeur elected to retire.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Carlos Alcaraz is a walking tennis highlight reel, but the two seconds that best explain his brilliance on grass don't involve him hitting the ball at all. A few times each match, Alcaraz will end up on defense in his backhand corner. The ball will arc from his opponent's right to their left, cutting through the air and getting lower and lower. Against most players, nothing more than an average volley or pick-up would win the point. Against the two-time Wimbledon champion, only a brilliant, perhaps absurd shot will keep them in it. Those two seconds explain why the other 127 players in the Wimbledon men's singles draw have one big problem: Alcaraz on grass. He has already won five Grand Slam titles at 22. He would probably win a Grand Slam played on the moon. He won the French Open on the clay of Roland Garros in Paris, took a few days to relax in Ibiza, Spain, and then went to Queen's Club in London to play a grass tune-up, where he waltzed to the title on the strength of the weakest part of his tennis: his serve. It has long been the missing link in his game, but of late he has joked about wanting to be a serve bot, after changing his motion and learning to be more accurate, more often. If he serves like he did at Queen's, then the All England Club might save some time by handing him the trophy this week, instead of going through the formality of 127 matches. He averaged 12 aces per match and half of his first serves went unreturned. That is a big jump, but the scariest thing about this is that Alcaraz hasn't won 27 of his 30 career matches on grass by being a serve bot. Last year's Wimbledon final apart, he's won most of them by not relying on it at all. It's not even about the power of his groundstrokes, which are as much of an audio experience as they are a visual one. That's because the Alcaraz of grass, or “grasscaraz” as he would have it, is a different experience to the Alcaraz of acrylic and clay — especially clay, on which he is also the best male player in the world. 13 seed at Wimbledon, may be more qualified to talk about this than anyone. He faced Alcaraz in both matches, 22 days apart. Paul described the two experiences as he chomped on a sandwich in the mixed zone at Roland Garros, before heading back onto the court for a doubles match with Taylor Fritz. He won a set on the grass, and lost in straight sets on the clay, but that was best of three. “On the clay, you can kind of escape some points,” he said. “You can go from defense to neutral a little easier. On the grass, once you're on defense with him, it's pretty difficult to get out of that defensive position. Once he's in command of a point on grass, it's basically impossible to wrestle control back. He's especially adept at taking those small steps that allow players to maintain their balance at high speed on the grass, stopping and pivoting out of tight spaces. That helps, but he also has the skill that makes the greatest player faster than everyone else: anticipation. This is why Alcaraz has a win rate on the grass that matches Rafael Nadal's on clay, albeit over a small sample size. It's closer to that of eight-time champion Roger Federer — but Alcaraz is getting closer to possessing the serve accuracy that made Federer's life even easier. If he unites those two poles, watch out. “The best person on grass right now is Alcaraz, because he is this combination of Roger and Andre [Agassi],” Annacone said during a recent interview. “He can take it early and be on top of the net before you blink.” It's what he does in that two-second window of genius. Alcaraz will sprint to catch up with a backhand and knife a short slice that passes just inches above the net. The opponent will chase in after it and have to hit the ball up, and Alcaraz, more often than not, is right there to intercept it and put it away. That's anticipation, but it's also the skill of that curving, arcing slice, and the seconds it buys him to turn a regulation volley for his opponent into a pressure shot that needs to be perfect to win the point. That's essentially unbeatable, especially if his serve is firing like it did at Queen's. Alcaraz, who first played on grass in 2019 as junior at a tournament in Roehampton and then at Wimbledon, uses this two-shot combination on every court. But it's on grass, where the movement delta between him and everybody else not named Novak Djokovic is widest — and where time is more precious than any other surface — that it is most effective. During his title run at Queen's, Alcaraz won 37 percent of points when his opponent was on the attack. In last year's final against Novak Djokovic, he stole 39 percent of points, luring errors from Djokovic's racket on the volley. In his quarterfinal against Paul, he stole 45 percent. Alcaraz said Saturday there is a fit between how he likes to play and the kind of tennis that excels on grass. “I really want to hit slices, dropshots, going to the net all the time, playing aggressively,” he said. “It's the style that you have to play.” After he won at Queens, he explained how low his expectations were about making the transition from clay to grass. He had just two days of practice on it before the tournament. “It's really complicated,” he said of the switch. But, you know, I just got used to the grass really quick.” Indeed, he did, especially considering that it's not even his favorite surface. That figures, given he's the two-time defending French Open champion, too. Men who play professional tennis really do have a big problem.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The 24-year-old tennis up-and-comer will face the top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon on Monday as Branstine looks to make an impact in her first showing at the All-England Club. She's currently ranked 197th in the world and has already made a bit of a name for herself during a dominant collegiate tennis career at Texas A&M and the story of how she's funded her pro tennis career through modeling has captured the public's attention. Branstine had described modeling as “a cool little side hustle” and a way to fund herself on the WTA tour without having to burden her parents for any financial help, she explained to a small gaggle of reporters recently, which included Clay and Wimbledon's website. “I love being in front of the camera during a shoot. I didn't want to ask my parents for anything — I wanted everything to come from me and from my tennis,” she explained. Branstine has signed with two agencies and her social media is a mix of her tennis and modeling activities. The American-born Canadian tennis player suggested there was one big similarity between tennis and modeling in her eyes: “You are an object a lot, and people sometimes forget you're a person too.” Despite injuries over her career, Branstine still found plenty of success during her days at Texas A&M and helped the program win a national championship in 2024. “I did family law shadowing a lawyer, which was very emotional,” she said. But directly in front of her is a chance to pull off a major upset at Wimbledon. She previously had defeated top-seeded  Lois Boisson to start the qualifying and expressed immense confidence in herself.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Most mornings you can find DJ Bennett, Belleview's first tennis champion in school history, in Auburn's tennis training facility recovering from an oblique strain. Through rounds of dead bugs and planks, Bennett prepares for her next chance to qualify for the U.S. Open before her 22nd birthday. Just 10 years ago Bennett was forming the dream of playing professional tennis. In November, Bennett, Auburn's first NCAA women's singles finalist earned a slot in the first American Collegiate Wildcard Playoff. "Every young tennis player dream about it, but not many people get to say that they're actually doing it," Bennett said. July marks a busy run of tournaments for Bennett. Her first tournament of the month is the McLeod for Health Florence Open in Florence, South Carolina during July 21-27. The draws for each tournament haven't released yet but there's an opportunity for Bennett to win prize money and her first taste of the biggest stage in American professional tennis. "It was a long build up,” Bennett said. I had a lot longer like mentally to prepare, knowing that I was going to be playing that event for like seven months." Now that eight months have passed Bennett is a strong tournament run from her first opportunity to make the U.S. Open main draw, but the hunt is far from over. Bennett is still a rising star in her sport. Whether the 11-year-old girl who watches in wonder behind Bennett's mature exterior realizes or not the professional ranks are calling her name. "It could go to another American playing those tournaments, but it's still like a good opportunity and a good chance to have another shot at making it to New York in August."</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>1 Jannik Sinner talked about his unexpected pairing with Emma Navarro by tournament officials without any prior communication between the players. Speaking at a Wimbledon press conference, Sinner shared details about the unusual arrangement: “It was very unexpected, to be honest. I just met her yesterday for the first time. The tournament, they wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up.” This revelation sparked outrage from Navratilova, who expressed her concerns through a series of tweets. The tennis icon, who won 10 mixed doubles Grand Slam titles during her career, did not hold back in her criticism of the USTA's decision. The new format reduces the field from 32 teams to just 16, with eight teams earning direct entry based on combined singles rankings and eight receiving wild card entries. A STAR-STUDDED 🤩 lineup of teams have officially entered the reimagined US Open Mixed Doubles Championship! The matches will follow a shortened format with sets played to four games instead of six, featuring no-ad scoring and tiebreaks at 4-4. She wrote: “It's an exhibition and I am fine with that. I hope it's not counted as a real tournament.” It's an exhibition and I am fine with that. I hope it's not counted as a real tournament. She stated the decision as wrong as she wrote: “How can it count when it is an exhibition where highly ranked doubles players who don't get a chance to play at all? How can it count when it is an exhibition where highly ranked doubles players who don't get a chance to play at all? This new format faced sharp criticism from the defending champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori as they declared the changes as “profoundly wrong” and a “profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players.” ɪᴍ ᴍᴀᴋɪɴɢ ᴏᴠᴇʀ 𝟷𝟹ᴋ ʙᴜᴄᴋs ᴀ ᴍᴏɴᴛʜ ᴡᴏʀᴋɪɴɢ ᴘᴀʀᴛ ᴛɪᴍᴇ. ɪ ᴋᴇᴘᴛ ʜᴇᴀʀɪɴɢ ᴏᴛʜᴇʀ ᴘᴇᴏᴘʟᴇ ᴛᴇʟʟ ᴍᴇ ʜᴏᴡ ᴍᴜᴄʜ ᴍᴏɴᴇʏ ᴛʜᴇʏ ᴄᴀɴ ᴍᴀᴋᴇ ᴏɴʟɪɴᴇ sᴏ ɪ ᴅᴇᴄɪᴅᴇᴅ ᴛᴏ ʟᴏᴏᴋ ɪɴᴛᴏ ɪᴛ. ᴡᴇʟʟ, ɪᴛ ᴡᴀs ᴀʟʟ ᴛʀᴜᴇ ᴀɴᴅ ʜᴀs ᴛᴏᴛᴀʟʟʏ ᴄʜᴀɴɢᴇᴅ ᴍʏ ʟɪғᴇ…..➤➤ s­­a­­l­­a­­r­­y­­h­­e­­r­­e­­.­­c­­o­­m Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The American tennis star, who clinched her second Grand Slam title after a hard-fought 6-7(5), 6-2, 6-4 victory over Sabalenka, offered a calm and mature perspective on what many considered demeaning remarks from her rival. Sabalenka had stirred headlines post-match by saying she was “too emotional” during the final and even claimed that Iga Swiatek would have beaten Gauff had the final featured those two instead. “It was a terrible condition day” – Coco Gauff shows maturity “Yeah, I mean, obviously, some people are critiquing what she said in the speech. The 2023 US Open champion acknowledged that some of the things said during Sabalenka's post-match press conference caught her off guard, but she didn't dwell on it. Rather than holding a grudge, Coco Gauff took the high road, emphasizing that private acknowledgment was all she needed to move on. “When people I was talking to in my circle about it, I was like, if she apologises, not even publicly, it was just more so privately, I will be fine and we'll move on. Gauff also clarified that their relationship had always been cordial before the incident and that she believed Aryna Sabalenka's comments were misunderstood. The practice session between Coco Gauff and Aryna Sabalenka on Centre Court has turned heads ahead of the tournament, signaling that whatever tension existed between them may now be firmly in the past. Gauff's poised and graceful response, coupled with her determination to focus on the game, speaks volumes about her growth both on and off the court.</p>
