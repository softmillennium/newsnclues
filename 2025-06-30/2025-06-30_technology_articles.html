                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Apple is considering using AI models from OpenAI and Anthropic to power its updated version of Siri, rather than using technology the company has built in-house, according to a report from Bloomberg on Monday. The iPhone maker continues to build out a project internally dubbed “LLM Siri” that uses in-house AI models, according to Bloomberg. However, Apple has reportedly asked OpenAI and Anthropic to train versions of their AI models that can run on Apple's cloud infrastructure for testing. Apple was forced to delay its AI-enabled Siri, originally slated for 2025, until 2026 or later due to a series of technical challenges the company reportedly ran into. This failure may have been a long time coming; Apple has been falling behind Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic in the AI race for the last several years. While Siri can already call on ChatGPT for difficult questions, Apple now seems to be exploring a much deeper integration with technology from third-party AI providers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. Department of Justice announced on Monday that it had taken several enforcement actions against North Korea's money-making operations, which rely on undercover remote IT workers inside American tech companies to raise funds for the regime's nuclear weapons program, as well as to steal data and cryptocurrency. Wang is accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft. The feds also indicted eight more people who participated in the scheme: six Chinese nationals and two Taiwanese citizens, who are accused of conspiring to commit wire fraud, money laundering, identity theft, hacking, and to violate sanctions. At times, they used hardware devices known as keyboard-video-mouse (KVM) switches, which allow one person to control multiple computers from a single keyboard and mouse. The fraudulent scheme allegedly also involved the North Korean workers stealing sensitive data, such as source code, from the companies they were working for, such as from an unnamed California-based defense contractor “that develops artificial intelligence-powered equipment and technologies.” The feds also said they seized at least 21 web domains, 29 financial accounts used to launder tens of thousands of dollars, and more than 70 laptops and remote access devices, including KVMs. Five North Korean nationals were indicted for wire fraud and money laundering after they stole more than $900,000 in crypto from two unnamed companies, thanks to their use of fake or stolen identities, the DOJ said.

Over the past few months, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been on a recruiting frenzy to poach some of the most sought-after talent in AI. The social media giant has invested $14.3 billion in Scale AI and hired Alexandr Wang, its CEO, to run Meta's Superintelligence Labs. News of the memo was first reported by Bloomberg. “We're going to call our overall organization Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This includes all of our foundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab focused on developing the next generation of our models,” Zuckerberg wrote in the memo on Monday. Zuckerberg introduced Wang, who will be the company's “chief AI officer” and leader of MSL, as well as former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Google on Monday announced a series of updates intended to bring its Gemini AI and other AI-powered tools deeper into the classroom. At the ISTE edtech conference, the tech giant introduced more than 30 AI tools for educators, a version of the Gemini app built for education, expanded access to its collaborative video creation app Google Vids, and other tools for managed Chromebooks. The updates represent a major AI push in the edtech space, where educators are already struggling to adapt to how AI tools, like AI chatbots and startups that promise to help you “cheat on everything,” are making their way into the learning environment. In higher ed, meanwhile, colleges are wrestling with whether or not plagiarism detectors can even identify AI-written content. Amid this disruption, Google is charging ahead with AI tools, saying it thinks that “responsible AI” can help drive “more engaging and personalized learning experiences,” when used in conjunction with human-led teaching. Teachers can also create custom versions of the Gemini AI called “Gems,” which will work as AI experts that help students who need extra support or want to better understand the subject. This is essentially just taking an activity that students are already doing — asking an AI chatbot to explain a topic or answer questions — and redirecting that activity back to Google's own AI technology, where it's specifically been trained on the teacher's own classroom materials. Soon, teachers will also be able to offer students real-time support for the AI-powered reading buddy when using the Read Along in Classroom tool. Plus, along with a handful of updates for managed Chromebooks, Google introduced new teaching mode called Class Tools. This allows teachers to connect directly with their students via Google Classroom and share content to the kids' screens, like videos, articles, slides, and quizzes.

Discovered by GamingOnLinux, Fabio Valentini, a member of the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee, clarified in a discussion thread that 32-bit removal from Fedora 44 was "just the earliest 'reasonable' target" and wasn't a plan he fully expected to go through. The programmer was disappointed by the sheer number of commenters responding harshly to the change, saying, "I was expecting a lot of feedback on this one, but not hundreds of people shouting 'DON'T DO THIS, WHY DON'T YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR USERS, I WILL SWITCH DISTROS IMMEDIATELY levels of feedback." Valentini clarified that the proposal aimed to address specific technical issues that package maintainers and release engineers encounter with Fedora. "I am disappointed in some of the reactions this ! 32-bit support is rapidly declining in the industry, and moving Fedora to 64-bit exclusively will give Fedora maintainers and developers more breathing room to work on more important things in the operating system. "Dealing with widely used software falling out from under our feet won't be fun," Valetini said in regards to keeping 32-bit support around for now. No timeline was provided for when the proposal might be reconsidered. But, given that 32-bit support is being dropped by many software developers in the industry—even Windows 11 no longer ships with a 32-bit version—there's little doubt that Fedora will eventually drop 32-bit support, regardless of the circumstances. Worse still, the change would also allegedly force SteamOS clone Bazzite to shut down entirely for the same reasons. For now, those users and projects get a reprieve.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>When Superman started kissing the football on a stick, it all clicked together. At the end of a giant battle over the streets of Metropolis, the Man of Steel knelt down to kiss and profess his love to an inanimate object that special effects would later transform into his dog, Krypto. That little dash of heartfelt weirdness, in the middle of a massive action scene, did a near-perfect job of showing what the film's cast and crew had been trying to articulate all day: this is not just a unique, new Superman, it's James Gunn's Superman. Superman is coming to theaters July 11 but last summer it was day 65 of 88, about two-thirds of the way through production. That production that started in Norway then went to Atlanta had now hit the streets of Cleveland, a city that's both ripe with Superman history (character creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster came up with the character there) and also had just the right look to stand in for Gunn's Metropolis. It's here where the exteriors of the Daily Planet were filmed, where several blocks were shut down and redecorated with all manner of cars, rubble, and extras, standing in for the giant climactic battle between Superman, his friends, and Lex Luthor. Over a year from release, almost everyone involved that we spoke with—writer-director James Gunn, and stars David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, Edi Gathegi, Wendell Pierce, Skyler Gisondo, Beck Bennett, Sara Sampaio, Mikaela Hoover, and more—were very cautious about what could, and couldn't, be revealed. But in between the lines was the message that Gunn is making a Superman movie about a character who is struggling. He's struggling to find a legacy between his Earth and Kryptonian roots, struggling to make a meaningful relationship with Lois Lane, and of course struggling to fight some kind of world-ending threat that may or may not have to do with tech billionaire Lex Luthor hoping to rid Earth of his archnemesis. Whatever the story is actually about, it's focused and direct. Lex hates Superman's guts from the beginning, although they don't know each other personally. Corenswet loved that as a place to start his character, one he could potentially be playing for a long, long time. “You're seeing Superman right in the middle of a big fight, the fight of his life at that point, although he'll have bigger ones later. And you're seeing him in a moment where all of that is being very heavily tested. From there, in typical Superman fashion, the film will feature the character as Superman, Clark Kent, and interestingly enough, a version best described as “Clark Superman”—a take where the character's identity is known. Corenswet says most of his time is as Superman himself but it's pretty split throughout the film. “And then there's a, I don't know, 20% of a middle ground where he's either with people who know both of his identities or with people as Superman, where he's not really performing as Superman. He's not in public as Superman, so there's more of Clark in that Superman than there is normally. Over the course of multiple decades, movies, actors, directors, and more, everyone has seen all those versions of Superman and more. To bring something different to the character and vibe of the film, Gunn made sure his star was very well-versed in All-Star Superman, the 2005 comic series written by Grant Morrison and drawn by Frank Quitely. Their relationship is front and center from the very beginning and, on set in 2024, everyone was very careful about revealing too many specifics about it. However, we now know from marketing that Lois is aware of Superman's secret identity for most of the film. And that revelation brings a lot of context to how Gunn described their relationship last year. “I don't think it's something we've ever seen in any superhero movie ever,” Gunn said about his two leads. There are long scenes that are about their relationship and the way they relate and what it would be like for a person who's this incredibly intelligent, strong-headed, stubborn, skeptical journalist, to have a relationship with someone who can lift a skyscraper.” “Yeah, I think it's pretty special,” Brosnahan, best known for her award-winning role on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, said in agreement. “There have been so many wonderfully iconic versions of this relationship. And I do think that this particular film is honoring the mythology and the lore that's been built before, but it's swinging the lens to look at it from a slightly different angle at a slightly different point in time.” Lois Lane is never just about her relationship with Clark Kent or Superman, though, and that's no different in this version. I think she appreciates Superman's existence, and then sometimes has questions about his methodology. We've seen many versions of Lex over the years but this one has more going on than most. Though he's still that billionaire tech genius on the outside, this Lex goes much deeper. “One of the things I really love about this version of Lex is that all his beliefs and fears are what drive him” Hoult said. “But in some ways that drive is real and what he is weary of, what Superman represents, is something that could be a real danger and threat to humanity … his beliefs and almost his love of humanity and this idea that they should be master of their own fate and destiny is important to him. Among the people who believe in Superman, of course, is James Gunn himself. And so, he feels, Superman is something a bit more elevated than the previous comic book movies he's known for. “I start with a place that's very hopeful, fun, but incredibly grim, incredibly serious, all at the same time. Brosnanan put an even finer point on Gunn's film. “It feels hopeful rather than explicitly comedic to me,” she said. It reminds you the reason people love comic books is because they teach us that superheroes aren't the only superheroes. They aren't the only ones with important powers in these worlds. They remind us the importance of courage and tenacity and interest in each other's well-being… A lot of these movies, you know, the best Batman movies were such a specific representation of these comics at a specific moment in time. And I think part of the reason they were so successful is because they felt like what we needed. Right now, on the set of Superman, a whole block of downtown Cleveland is closed off and covered with Metropolis emergency vehicles. There are piles of rubble everywhere, smoking cars, giant blue screens standing in for landing spaceships. We do know that there are well over 100 Easter eggs in the film, with seemingly every street, store, van and Post-It note in the movie given careful consideration as a little treat for audiences. Yup, this is a James Gunn Superman movie all right. Warner Bros. provided travel and accommodations to Cleveland for this story.

I would guess that things like dorms are largely paid for from tuition. How much is tuition at the state college in your city? It seems like you have a grudge and any show of spending for a university is reason to criticize it.I'm all for reform, but this vengeful callous destruction of science is not reform. Even then, plenty of universities have old, decaying, buildings and run-down labs. It seems like you have a grudge and any show of spending for a university is reason to criticize it.I'm all for reform, but this vengeful callous destruction of science is not reform. And yet, I haven't seen a single example of administrative downsizing in our public universities—not one. Instead, I hear about professors losing grant funding and international students facing stress over visa uncertainty.So when I say universities aren't hearing the message, I'm referring specifically to the glaring lack of reform in their administrative structures. So when I say universities aren't hearing the message, I'm referring specifically to the glaring lack of reform in their administrative structures. You've been fooled by right-wing propaganda that claims "reform", but it's not about reform for them, it is about crushing educated people so they cannot oppose their authoritarianism. Let me be clear: This is precisely about sides and ideologies. Like nobody enjoys giving up more than half of their grants to the school admin. Its really on the nose when these two examples has been anything but fundamental. There are many people out there that don't believe these things are worth working towards.In lieu of a thorough argument I'll post this old clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xcQIoh3FQQ In lieu of a thorough argument I'll post this old clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xcQIoh3FQQ Presumably this is in reference to the years 1993-1995, 2009-2011, and 2021-2023...? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divided_government_in_the_Unit...> recently in some places it has been blatantly about ideologiesI agree if we use the word "ideology" in an absolute, philosophical sense, but I think this it's missing the authors point entirely. To illustrate with a more familiar term: basically every part of social life is technically political, but when people say 'this isn't about politics', they're trying to communicate that it doesn't relate to the actively-debated divisions of the day among elected officials. US prosperity is something that no side will own up to opposing, and yet here we are, dismantling our soft power in the academic sphere and beyond at a breakneck pace. > recently in some places it has been blatantly about ideologiesI agree if we use the word "ideology" in an absolute, philosophical sense, but I think this it's missing the authors point entirely.

It is, I suppose, pushing an ideology that everyone should support education, research, clean air, and safe roads, but any belief in some sort of universal good must rely on an ideology, if only circularly on the ideology that there is such a thing as a universal good. Things like Medicare which those same rural folks vote against. Now we cut off the pipeline and investment into those wealth generating areas so that long term, the nation will head into decline... TFA seems to say "This is important and we shouldn't cut general funding", but also goes on to call on industry, in particular large tech company CEOs to push back against ideologically driven funding cuts. That toes the line of calling for political responses. The article lists a bunch of old-timers, like Page and Brin. Right now, everyone is talking about the "$100M offers" from Meta, for people who completed (or dropped out) of their computer science PhDs.What does "not standing for industry" mean to you? What does "not standing for industry" mean to you? The more productive (and I mean literally in terms of producing something) they look down on it. I know I am over-generalizing, but its like college teaches them you are Satan if you work for an oil company or Monsanto and a saint if you work for the EPA or FDA. Are you implying that a) academia does not benefit from industry or b) if industry's survival were threatened academia would not care?Academia benefits hugely from industry and would/does stand to protect those benefits. >The tech giants whose founders and engineers were trained in these institutions, whose core technologies were incubated in these research environmentsThere is a reason many of those founders dropped out than continue. It turns out that what you learn is useless and inefficient compared to picking up the knowledge externally. Practical experience is a much better teacher than the people at universities. Every day at class I would keep a tally of how many lies and incorrect statements and explainations would get made every day.Also notice how those core technologies are not listed because it would weaken there point.It's natural for universities to argue for why they are still relevant in the 21st century.

Luckily I already had a software job during my 1st year, so those years weren't totally wasted. Acknowledging that I was supported by an NSF graduate research fellowship, so I benefitted from the thing I malign, but NSF, academia, and the whole federal government pissed off a good chunk of the country with DEI initiatives, codified by affirmative action, extra grant requirements, and ideological purity statements. I do fear this is the end of America's post-WW2 STEM hegemony, but at the same time, it feels a little good Revanchism typically does, but it's a highly destructive path. But that probably means finding or creating a different state to do it in. Alternatively if you really do deeply want these things you could acknowledge we can't share them, find some way to separate yourself, and go build them with like minded people and without the rest of the country. But that probably means finding or creating a different state to do it in. The human emotion of spite is an attitude, not a permanent trait we call "evil". You've felt spite.I've never killed a national institution out of spite like these people are trying to do with academia. But I yearn to someday eliminate the Forbes 500 list. How essential is it to your future well-being that those people keep on existing at their current level of wealth?

How essential is it to your future well-being that those people keep on existing at their current level of wealth? Accumulation of scientific knowledge is a positive externality, and the current administration doesn't care about benefits to other countries. Or costs to other countries, for negative externalities as from CO2. The reality is that our companies will still be able to hire scientists from foreign universities. The Germans rolled deep at a Harvard get together I was at and nearly all of them were from TUM or Mannheim. And the brightest was actually out of Ludwig Maximillian.So humanity's capacity to push the boundaries of science forward is safe with or without us. But it's perfectly right for other people to feel differently. So humanity's capacity to push the boundaries of science forward is safe with or without us.

If you said that corporate America is no place for DEI and everyone should be hired based on merits alone, I would agree.I don't think the reason for the lack of US citizen minorities being underrepresented in tech is because of systemic racism and when I did do my stint at Amazon post 2020, I found the performative “allyship, DEI initiatives moan worthy at best and considering that Amazon is the shittyist employer in BigTech, I found it laughable”. Yes I knew that going in and it was a remote position. I went in with my eyes wide open.But on the other hand, if it is a pipeline problem, where should initiatives happen to give opportunities in tech if not in academia and who should do it if not the government?That being said, it would be a lot more palatable to voters if it was based on economic background than race. I can't say with a straight face that had less opportunities as a minority when I went to private school from k-8th and came from an upper middle class background and had up to date computers where I taught myself  how to program ever since the mid 80s.And the sane party that decries putting people in positions they aren't qualified for nominated RFK to head the DHHS and other unqualified people to be heads of other agencies.Not to mention the shit show of DOGE.

On one research grant I led for NASA, the grant reviewer asked me to count the number of minority students on the team, from their picture displayed on one of my slides. That's just the kind of information I didn't gather because I was trying to run a research task and had employed the entire lab a professor led.That's fine, but we should also recognize how weird it is. That's fine, but we should also recognize how weird it is. Like people who vote for more than one political party? That really has nothing to do with what's going on. I feel comfortable saying that it is a plain fact that the Trump administration is not just pushing back against woke language or affirmative action, they are dismantling the entire scientific infrastructure. ), but denying that it's happening is doing yourself a disservice. I think you're mischaracterizing the basic mechanics of referrenda. Again, without getting too far into political particulars, I think it's objectively true that "stop the woke" was only a small part of Trump's campaign, even if we grant that that phrase logically implies what's happening now. Of course all voters should read up on everything a candidate says, but we know that's far from the case. I think you're mischaracterizing the basic mechanics of referrenda.

Jace from self-confessed “silly tech” YouTube channel MetraByte has shared a video documenting their attempts to get Windows 95 and Doom up and running on the Sony PlayStation 2. Indeed, it might have, but the hacky nature of getting x86 code to run on Sony's MIPS machine, plus the well-known foibles of Windows 95, built on DOS, meant there were lots of hurdles. It is quite a long story, but Jace condensed tens of hours of coaxing the PS2 to run Windows 95 into less than half an hour (video embedded above). In parts of the video you can see Jace use a specially prepared USB stick or HDD which packed in the following contents: The former is designed primarily for enjoying simple games, where the latter is billed as an accurate (and slower) general-purpose x86 emulator. Such is the slow and frustrating process of getting an x86 OS onto this MIPS console. Nearly every process took an ungodly amount of time, hampered by limited and slow I/O on the PS2, the emulation layer, and these early editions of Windows sitting precariously upon DOS. Using Bochs wasn't plain sailing, either. Jace had to deal with a wide range of system hurdles, complaints about read errors, write errors, boot order, drive letter and mounting configurations, missing files, drivers, and more. Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox. In total, it took about “14 hours” to complete the Windows 95 install by Jace's reckoning. Eventually, at the desktop, they managed to run Paint, but it wasn't much fun without a mouse installed. Subsequent attempts to get Doom95 up and running were, not surprisingly, fruitless.

Supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted on X that the company is planning a new 13-inch laptop using an A18 Pro chip.The laptop, which Kuo says would launch at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, would be Apple's first Mac running on an A-series chip. Those single-core scores are only slightly lower than what you see in the M4, which range between 3,400 and 3,700 points on the same test, depending on which Mac they're in. This device will also reportedly come in various colors, including silver, blue, pink, and yellow. Apple's latest experiment with color on Mac laptops has been with the tastefully muted sky blue on the M4 MacBook Air.Kuo states that Apple is looking to sell 5–7 million units of this product in 2026. It's unclear how much they might cost, but presumably, these would be entry-level laptops that undercut the $999 MacBook Air. The M3 MacBook Air has dropped to $799 new on sale before. Apple's current affordable play is at Walmart, which sells the M1 MacBook Air with the old design, 256GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM for $649.A lower price might put Apple in a position to compete with cheaper Chromebooks and mid-level Windows laptops in a play for the education market and for those who might only use their laptops for email, web browsing, and other simple tasks.The reference design is reportedly being supplied by Everwin Precision in Shenzhen, China. Beyond the laptop, Kuo claims that Everwin is building frames for smart glasses due to ship in 2027. Those would feature audio playback, a camera, and video recording like Meta's AI glasses, as well as "AI environmental sensing." Kuo says the glasses will lack display functionality.

But it took decades for them to become widely available and, more importantly, affordable. Now we appear to have moved from “affordable” to “absolutely dirt cheap,” if Best Buy's $169 sale (58% off) on the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is any indication. We're not going to tell you the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook is fancy, or jam-packed with incredible features or the very latest bells and whistles. What we can tell you is, it's abundantly solid, especially for high school or college students. The stuff you do every single day, like browse, check and send email, post to your social media, and maybe catch up on a little streaming on the clear, full-HD screen. The IdeaPad Slim 3 does all of those things very well, and can do them all day long thanks to the 13.5-hour battery life. Again, the IdeaPad Slim 3 isn't going to blow you away with a massive array of ports to become the hub of a huge desktop setup, but it has what you need — one USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, a microSD card reader, and a headphone/microphone aux jack. It will run an external monitor just fine, and an external SSD to augment the 64GB of built-in storage is also easy to connect. WiFi 6 and Bluetooth connections are present and accounted for, and the HD screen's 60Hz refresh rate will make your streaming or online videos come through smoothly, although it's not a great choice for gaming. And then there is, of course, the touchscreen, which easily sets the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 apart from any sub-$200 laptop or Chromebook we can think of.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Prime Day deal hunters normally set their sights on finding the best deals on items they've been thinking about buying for months, sometimes years. But when those deals are attached to brand-new products from an established trailblazing brand like Roborock, that's a game-changer. And while the remarkable Zaros series sell for upwards of $1,500, the Qrevo and Q Series bots will be offered for a mere fraction of that price. These four new robot cleaners — the Q7 M5+, Q10 S5+, Qrevo S5V, and QV35A — come with Roborock's combination of cleaning power, innovative convenience features, and great pricing. And as part of their Prime Day rollout, those great prices will be greater yet. That's essential, as anyone who's ever watched pet hair choke a robot vacuum into submission knows. All of that hair and dirt ends up in a self-emptying charging dock for both Q Series models, which can go up to 7 weeks before needing its dust bag changed. PreciSense LiDAR navigation lets the Q7 M5+ scan your home's floor-plan to create and remember a detailed layout and most efficient route to follow, and it will even suggest No-Go Zones in areas where it anticipates it could get stuck. Vacuuming might end up being only half of the Q7 M5+'s job, because it's also a superior robotic mop for hard surfaces. Bottom Line: The intuitive and easy to control Q7 M5+ is perfect for first-time robot vacuum buyers, and it'll be one of the hottest Prime Day deals among robot cleaners. The Q7 M5+ will be available for $279.99, down from $429.99. This robot makes smart cleaning affordable for everyone. With the Q10 S5+ comes the same HyperForce vacuuming power, but an upgraded mopping experience thanks to Roborock's VibraRise 2.0 mopping system. No matter where you send the Q10 S5+, it's ready to run the inevitable obstacle course it will encounter in your home — especially if you have little kids, big kids, teenagers, or anyone else who's not great at picking up after themselves. The Q10 S5+ uses Reactive Tech Obstacle Avoidance — a structured-light system that spots objects in its path and navigates around them, even in cluttered areas and rooms. It also features Roborock's upgraded VibraRise 2.0 mopping system for a better cleaning experience, along with Reactive Tech Obstacle Avoidance to navigate around obstacles more efficiently. While this does mean a slightly higher price, the added comfort and convenience are well worth it. During Prime Day, you'll be able to get it for $349.99 down from $549.99. Combined with incredible value pricing that will be even better during Roborock's Prime Day rollout event, the Qrevo series represents the latest evolution of robot cleaners. The QV 35A also calls a robust multifunctional and fully automated dock its home for charging, mop self-washing and air drying, auto dust emptying, and auto mop tank refills. The mop's wash cycle runs in 3 cycles — a pre-wash, medium rinse, and high-speed spin dry that thoroughly cleans the mop heads so they're in pristine condition for the next cleaning run. The large-capacity dustbin can go up to 7 weeks before needing to be emptied, and the QV 35A's dock removes up to 99.9% of pollen particles as it empties the dust, preventing them from escaping into your home and aggravating allergy sufferers. Both the QV 35A and Qrevo S5V have detachable dock bases that are easily cleanable to remove dirt and mud buildup. Bottom Line: The Roborock QV 35A delivers an all-in-one robot vacuum experience for under $400, featuring a multifunctional dock, powerful 8,000Pa HyperForce suction, and an anti-tangle side brush for hassle-free cleaning—which makes it hard to find a better deal at this price point. During Prime Day, it will be available for $399.99 down from $649.99. We saved the best for last: The Qrevo S5V is a 12,000Pa powerhouse vacuum paired with dual spinning mops that can extend to reach floor edges and other obstacles the unit intelligently detects and works around for incredibly thorough cleaning. When it's not giving your floors the best cleaning ever, the Qrevo S5V's home is a multifunctional dock where it can self-clean its mop heads, dry them with warm air, automatically refill its water tank, and automatically empty the dirt and dust from the vacuum, all while charging the Qrevo S5V 30% faster than competing models. The Qrevo S5V's anti-tangle power comes from its DuoDivide main brush, which is actually two parallel brushes that work in tandem to steer hair toward the vacuum inlet rather than let it wind around the brush. Two spinning mop units move at 200rpm, with 30 levels of water flow that dirty floors just can't compete with. The FlexiArm feature lets those spinning mop heads extend out by 1.85mm for cleaning coverage of 98.8% along your floor's edges. Bottom Line: The Roborock Qrevo S5V is the most affordable and advanced model in the Qrevo series, offering powerful 12,000Pa suction, effortless hair removal with its Dual Anti-Tangle System, and thorough cleaning along edges thanks to FlexiArm Edge Mopping—all designed to make smart cleaning simple and accessible.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Microsoft has taken “a genuine step toward medical superintelligence,” says Mustafa Suleyman, CEO of the company's artificial intelligence arm. The tech giant says its powerful new AI tool can diagnose disease four times more accurately and at significantly less cost than a panel of human physicians. The experiment tested whether the tool could correctly diagnose a patient with an ailment, mimicking work typically done by a human doctor. Microsoft's researchers then built a system called the MAI Diagnostic Orchestrator (MAI-DxO) that queries several leading AI models—including OpenAI's GPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, Meta's Llama, and xAI's Grok—in a way that loosely mimics several human experts working together. Suleyman was previously an executive at Google working on AI. AI is already widely used in some parts of the US health care industry, including helping radiologists interpret scans. The latest multimodal AI models have the potential to act as more general diagnostic tools, though the use of AI in health care raises its own issues, particularly related to bias from training data that's skewed toward particular demographics. The company could also develop tools to help medical experts improve or even automate patient care. “What you'll see over the next couple of years is us doing more and more work proving these systems out in the real world,” Suleyman says. In the last few years, both Microsoft and Google have published papers showing that large language models can accurately diagnose an ailment when given access to medical records. The new Microsoft research differs from previous work in that it more accurately replicates the way human physicians diagnose disease—by analyzing symptoms, ordering tests, and performing further analysis until a diagnosis is reached. Microsoft describes the way that it combined several frontier AI models as “a path to medical superintelligence” in a blog post about the project today. "Our model performs incredibly well, both getting to the diagnosis and getting to that diagnosis very cost effectively," says Dominic King, a vice president at Microsoft who is involved with the project. “It is quite exciting,” says David Sontag, a scientist at MIT and cofounder of Layer Health, a startup that builds medical AI tools. But Sontag says that Microsoft's findings should be treated with some caution because doctors in the study were asked not to use any additional tools to help with their diagnosis, which may not be a reflection of how they operate in real life. He adds that it remains to be seen whether the AI system would significantly reduce costs in practice. “This is an impressive report because it tackles highly complex cases for diagnosis,” says Eric Topol, a scientist at the Scripps Research Institute. Showing that AI could, in theory, reduce the cost of medical care is novel, he adds. “Then you can get a very rigorous evaluation of cost,” Sontag says.

The even faster-traveling thermal pulse in between those two would flash-fry any flammable thing out to maybe twice the distance of the blast wave, and even at the outer edge of said thermal pulse, this includes causing lethal, almost total third to fourth-degree burns over any living tissue.It would not be a good day for the people of whatever wider region that surrounds its impact point.Globally, we'd also see atmospheric effects.

When one party controls all three branches of government, and the executive branch does what they want regardless of laws (which aren't enforced because said party controls the enforcers as well), you get anything but a consensus. Besides, even if "one party controls all three branches of government" is true, they still don't control all the involved committees, do they? Unless by approval you mean "this isn't worth a civil war" the argument is that older people are more conservative (represented by Republicans who cancel this NASA initiative) and younger are more progressive (represented by Democrats) Gotta say I never seen anyone run out of arguments this quickly.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The newest addition to Trump's health agency wants to create new cities in the sea, extend human lifespan, and Make America Healthy Again. When Jim O'Neill was nominated to be the second in command at the US Department of Health and Human Services, Dylan Livingston was excited. As founder and CEO of the lobbying group Alliance for Longevity Initiatives (A4LI), Livingston is a member of a community that seeks to extend human lifespan. As Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new right-hand man, O'Neill is expected to wield authority at health agencies that fund biomedical research and oversee the regulation of new drugs. And while O'Neill doesn't subscribe to Kennedy's most contentious beliefs—and supports existing vaccine schedules—he may still steer the agencies in controversial new directions. Montana just passed a new bill backed by longevity enthusiasts that will enable access to drugs and therapies that are not approved by the FDA. Although much less of a public figure than his new boss, O'Neill is quite well-known in the increasingly well-funded and tight-knit longevity community. His acquaintances include the prominent longevity influencer Bryan Johnson, who describes him as “a soft-spoken, thoughtful, methodical guy,” and the billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel. In speaking with more than 20 people who work in the longevity field and are familiar with O'Neill, it's clear that they share a genuine optimism about his leadership. And while no one can predict exactly what O'Neill will do, many in the community believe that he could help bring attention and resources to their cause and make it easier for them to experiment with potential anti-aging drugs. This idea is bolstered not just by his personal and professional relationships but also by his past statements and history working at aging-focused organizations—all of which suggest he indeed believes scientists should be working on ways to extend human lifespan beyond its current limits and thinks unproven therapies should be easier to access. He has also supported the libertarian idea of creating new geographic zones, possibly at sea, in which residents can live by their own rules (including, notably, permissive regulatory regimes for new drugs and therapies). “In [the last three administrations] there weren't really people like that from our field taking these positions of power,” says Livingston, adding that O'Neill's elevation is “definitely something to be excited about.” If O'Neill still holds the views he has espoused over the years, that's “worrisome,” says Diana Zuckerman, a health policy analyst and president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit think tank in Washington, DC. “There's nothing worse than getting a bunch of [early-stage unproven therapies] on the market,” she says. “Getting things on the market quickly means that everybody becomes a guinea pig,” Zuckerman says. The consumer advocacy group Public Citizen puts it far more bluntly, describing O'Neill as “one of Trump's worst picks” and saying that he is “unfit to be the #2 US health-care leader.” His libertarian views are “antithetical to basic public health,” the organization's co-president said in a statement. “It can be a quite powerful position,” says Patricia Zettler, a legal scholar at Ohio State University who specializes in drug regulation and the FDA. Trump says he wants to make IVF more accessible, but his administration's other actions are putting reproductive freedom at risk. But it is what he did after that has helped him cultivate a reputation as an ally for longevity enthusiasts. O'Neill appears to have had a close relationship with Thiel since at least the late 2000s. And he spent seven years as managing director of Mithril Capital Management, a “family of long-term venture capital funds” founded by Thiel, according to O'Neill's LinkedIn profile. O'Neill got further stitched into the longevity field when he spent more than a decade representing Thiel's interests as a board member of the SENS Research Foundation (SRF), an organization dedicated to finding treatments for aging, to which Thiel was a significant donor. As CEO, O'Neill oversaw a student education program and multiple scientific research projects that focused on various aspects of aging, according to the organization's annual reports. And in a 2020 SRF annual report, O'Neill wrote that Eric Hargan, then the deputy secretary of HHS, had attended an SRF conference to discuss “regulatory reform.” While de Grey calls him “the devil incarnate”—probably because he believes O'Neill “incited” two women to make sexual harassment allegations against him—the many other scientists, biotech CEOs, and other figures in the longevity field contacted by MIT Technology Review had more positive opinions of O'Neill, with many claiming they were longtime friends or acquaintances of the new deputy secretary (though, at the same time, many were reluctant to share specific views about his past work). Longevity science is a field that's long courted controversy, owing largely to far-fetched promises of immortality and the ongoing marketing of creams, pills, intravenous infusions, and other so-called anti-aging treatments that are not supported by evidence. Pretty much everyone in the field that I spoke with appears to be hopeful about what O'Neill will do now that he's been confirmed. Namely, they hope he will use his new position to direct attention and funds to legitimate longevity research and the development of new drugs that might slow or reverse human aging. Longevity clinics offer a mix of services that largely cater to the wealthy. Eric Verdin, president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging in Novato, California, says O'Neill has “been at the Buck several times” and calls him “a good guy”—someone who is “serious” and who understands the science of aging. Celine Halioua, CEO of the biotech company Loyal, which is developing drugs to extend the lifespan of dogs, echoes these sentiments, saying she has “always liked and respected” O'Neill. “He's been definitely interested in wanting us as a society to make progress on age-related disease.” After his confirmation, the A4LI LinkedIn account posted a photo of Livingston, its CEO, with O'Neill, writing that “we look forward to working with him to elevate aging research as a national priority and to modernize regulatory pathways that support the development of longevity medicines.” While plenty of treatments have been shown to slow aging in lab animals, none of them have been found to successfully slow or reverse human aging. And many longevity enthusiasts believe drug regulations are to blame. He has long supported deregulation of new drugs and medical devices. During his first tour at HHS, for instance, he pushed back against regulations on the use of algorithms in medical devices. “We should reform [the] FDA so that it is approving drugs after their sponsors have demonstrated safety and let people start using them at their own risk,” he said. Right to Try laws are being adopted and expanded throughout the country. In one state, they'll allow healthy people to access unproven treatments. This sentiment appears to be shared by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In a recent podcast interview with Gary Brecka, who describes himself as a “longevity expert,” Kennedy said that he wanted to expand access to experimental therapies. O'Neill was essentially suggesting that drugs be made available after the very first stage of clinical testing, which is designed to test whether a new treatment is safe. These tests are typically small and don't reveal whether the drug actually works. “It's just absurd to think that the regulatory agency that's responsible for making sure that products are safe and effective before they're made available to patients couldn't protect patients from charlatans,” says Holly Fernandez Lynch, a professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania who is currently on sabbatical. Robert Steinbrook, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, largely agrees that this kind of change to the drug approval process is a bad idea, though notes that he and his colleagues are generally more concerned about O'Neill's views on the regulation of technologies like AI in health care, given his previous efforts on algorithms. That requirement won't change unless Congress acts on the matter, she says: “It remains to be seen how big of a role HHS leadership will have in FDA policy on that front.” A major goal for a subset of longevity enthusiasts relates to another controversial idea: creating new geographic zones in which people can live by their own rules. The goal has taken various forms, including “network states” (which could start out as online social networks and evolve into territories that make use of cryptocurrency), “special economic zones,” and more recently “freedom cities.” While specific details vary, the fundamental concept is creating a new society, beyond the limits of nations and governments, as a place to experiment with new approaches to rules and regulations. They considered Rhode Island as the site but later changed their minds. Some of those same longevity enthusiasts have set up shop in Próspera, Honduras—a “special economic zone” on the island of Roatán with a libertarian approach to governance, where residents are able to make their own suggestions for medical regulations. Another pop-up city, Vitalia, was set up there for two months in 2024, complete with its own biohacking lab; it also happened to be in close proximity to an established clinic selling an unproven longevity “gene therapy” for around $20,000. The people behind Vitalia referred to it as “a Los Alamos for longevity.” Another new project, Infinita City, is now underway in the former Vitalia location. “We are also negotiating with countries to establish a SeaZone (a specially designed economic zone where seasteading companies could build their platforms),” the organization explains on its website. In that presentation, he talked up the benefits of a free market for health care, saying that seasteads could offer improved health care and serve as medical tourism hubs: “The last best hope for freedom is on the sea.” “That's essentially what we're doing in Montana,” says A4LI's Livingston, referring to his successful lobbying efforts to create a hub for experimental medicine there. Under new state laws, anyone can access such treatments, providing they have been through an initial phase I trial as a preliminary safety test. A freedom city for longevity biotech is “being discussed,” says Friedman, although he adds that those discussions are still in the very early stages. He says he'd possibly work with O'Neill on “changing regulations that are under HHS” but isn't yet certain what that might involve: “We're still trying to research and define the whole program and gather support for it.” Some libertarians, including longevity enthusiasts, believe this is their moment to build a new experimental home. Not only do they expect backing from O'Neill, but they believe President Trump has advocated for new economic zones, perhaps dedicated to the support of specific industries, that can set their own rules for governance. While campaigning for the presidency in 2023, Trump floated what seemed like a similar idea: “We should hold a contest to charter up to 10 new cities and award them to the best proposals for development,” he said in a recorded campaign speech. But given how frequently Trump changes his mind, it's hard to tell what the president, and others in the administration, will now support on this front. And even if HHS does try to create new geographic zones in some form, legal and regulatory experts say this approach won't necessarily speed up drug development the way some longevity enthusiasts hope. “The notion around so-called freedom cities, with respect to biomedical innovation, just reflects deep misunderstandings of what drug development entails,” says Ohio State's Zettler. Making matters even murkier, a lot of the research geared toward finding those therapies has been subject to drastic cuts.The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research in the world and has supported major scientific discoveries, including those that benefit longevity research. But in late March, HHS announced a “dramatic restructuring” that would involve laying off 10,000 full-time employees. “In the worst-case scenario, all aging research [would be stopped],” he says. “Someone like [O'Neill], who's an advocate for aging and longevity, would be fantastic to have at HHS,” says Matthew O'Connor, who spent over a decade at SRF and says he knows O'Neill “pretty well.” But he adds that “we shouldn't be cutting the NIH.” Instead, he argues, the agency's funding should be multiplied by 10. “The solution to curing diseases isn't to get rid of the organizations that are there to help us cure diseases,” adds O'Connor, who is currently co-CEO at Cyclarity Therapeutics, a company developing drugs for atherosclerosis and other age-related diseases. But it's still just too soon to confidently predict how, if at all, O'Neill will shape the government health agencies he will oversee. “We don't know exactly what he's going to be doing as the deputy secretary of HHS,” says Public Citizen's Steinbrook. “Like everybody who's sworn into a government job, whether we disagree or agree with their views or actions … we still wish them well. Pigs whose DNA makes them resistant to a virus could be the first big consumer product using gene editing. The multimillionaire longevity influencer thinks his new faith could save humanity from superintelligent AI. The stigmatized idea could get a massive boost from “tech bros”—and some scientists are cheering them on. Try refreshing this page and updating them one more time.</p>
