                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Zuckerberg on Monday unveiled his company's "superintelligence" ambitions as he takes on AI rivals OpenAI and Google in what he called "the beginning of a new era for humanity," according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider. "As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight," Zuckerberg wrote in the memo, which Bloomberg first reported on. "I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way." Zuckerberg emphasized that Meta's AI efforts aim to build systems that are not only as capable as humans, but "personal", deeply integrated into how people interact with technology. AI has become Zuckerberg's top priority this year, fueling massive investments in infrastructure like chips and data centers, and a hiring spree targeting researchers from rival labs. In addition to the Scale AI investment, Meta has reportedly held acquisition talks with Perplexity and Runway. The company is also reportedly expected to acquire PlayAI, a voice replication startup, as part of its push into AI personal assistants.Read Zuckerberg's full memo below: As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight. I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way. Today I want to share some details about how we're organizing our AI efforts to build towards our vision: personal superintelligence for everyone. We're going to call our overall organization Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). This includes all of our foundations, product, and FAIR teams, as well as a new lab focused on developing the next generation of models. Alexandr Wang has joined Meta to serve as our Chief AI Officer and lead MSL. Nat will work with Connor to define his role going forward. He ran GitHub at Microsoft, and most recently has run one of the leading AI investment firms. Nat has served on our Meta Advisory Group for the last year, so he already has a good sense of our roadmap and what we need to do. We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I'm excited to share as well: I'm excited about the progress we have planned for Llama 4.1 and 4.2. These models power Meta AI, which is used by more than 1 billion monthly actives across our apps and an increasing number of agents across Meta that help improve our products and technology. I've spent the past few months meeting top folks across Meta, other AI labs, and promising startups to put together the founding group for this small talent-dense effort. We have a strong business that supports building out significantly more compute than smaller labs. We have deeper experience building and growing products that reach billions of people. I'm optimistic that this new influx of talent and parallel approach to model development will set us up to deliver on the promise of personal superintelligence for everyone. We have even more great people at all levels joining this effort in the coming weeks, so stay tuned. Are you a current or former Meta employee with more insight to share?</p>

Apple:

Apple Inc. is considering using artificial intelligence technology from Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, sidelining its own in-house models in a potentially blockbuster move aimed at turning around its flailing AI effort.

The iPhone maker has talked with both companies about using their large language models for Siri, according to people familiar with the discussions. It has asked them to train versions of their models that could run on Apple's cloud infrastructure for testing, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.</p>

CEO of Meta Platforms Mark Zuckerberg

Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced a major restructuring of the company's artificial intelligence group, including a commitment to developing AI “superintelligence,” or systems that can complete tasks as well as or even better than humans. 

Zuckerberg wrote Monday to employees that Meta's AI efforts will fall under a new group called Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL, which will be led by Alexandr Wang, the former CEO of data-labeling startup Scale AI, according to an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg. Wang, whom Zuckerberg called the “most impressive founder of his generation,” will serve as chief AI officer. </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday that he's creating Meta Superintelligence Labs, which will be led by some of his company's most recent hires, including Scale AI ex-CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. Zuckerberg said the new AI superintelligence unit, MSL, will house the company's various teams working on foundation models, like the open-source Llama software, products and Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) projects, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC. Earlier in June, the company said it would hire Wang, now Meta's chief AI officer, and some of his colleagues as part of a $14.3 billion investment into Scale AI. Meta also hired Friedman and his business partner, Daniel Gross, who was CEO of Safe Superintelligence, the AI startup created by OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever, CNBC earlier reported. Meta had attempted to buy Safe Superintelligence, but was rebuffed by Sutskever. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a recent podcast that Meta was recruiting AI researchers from his company, offering signing bonuses as high as $100 million. Here is Zuckerberg's full internal memo released on Monday: As the pace of AI progress accelerates, developing superintelligence is coming into sight. I believe this will be the beginning of a new era for humanity, and I am fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way.

Alexandr Wang has joined Meta to serve as our Chief AI Officer and lead MSL. Alex and I have worked together for several years, and I consider him to be the most impressive founder of his generation. He has a clear sense of the historic importance of superintelligence, and as co-founder and CEO he built ScaleAI into a fast-growing company involved in the development of almost all leading models across the industry. Nat will work with Connor to define his role going forward. He ran GitHub at Microsoft, and most recently has run one of the leading AI investment firms. Nat has served on our Meta Advisory Group for the last year, so he already has a good sense of our roadmap and what we need to do.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>CANNES, France — Robinhood stock climbed 10% to an all-time high Monday after the company rolled out tokenized shares of OpenAI and SpaceX to users in Europe as part of a larger crypto rollout. It is the company's first move to make private equity accessible via blockchain. The announcement, which came Monday during the company's product showcase in Cannes, is part of a broader push to expand Robinhood's crypto footprint globally. The tokenized assets will be available exclusively through Robinhood's EU crypto app, where more than 200 tokenized stocks and ETFs are now tradable 24 hours a day, five days a week with no commission or spread. To mark the launch, Robinhood is giving 5 euros worth of OpenAI and SpaceX tokens to every eligible user in the European Union who onboards to trade stock tokens by July 7. "We wanted to make sure we were giving access," said Johann Kerbrat, senior vice president and general manager of crypto at Robinhood. "What we discussed on stage was how to address the inequality between people who have historically had access to these kinds of companies and everyone else. That's the really exciting part: Now everyone will be able to get it." "The goal with tokenization," he added, "is to let anyone participate in this economy." This marks the first time Robinhood has tokenized private companies — a milestone made possible, in part, by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. "There are no accredited investor rules here in the EU, so anyone who qualifies to trade stock tokens is able to access them," Kerbrat said. Although the EU rollout is underway, Robinhood said U.S. users shouldn't expect access anytime soon. CEO Vlad Tenev has publicly called for changes, arguing that blockchain could unlock broader participation in private markets. The tokenized shares are being distributed via Robinhood's custody wallet into user accounts, part of a broader infrastructure push that also includes the company's new layer 2 blockchain built on arbitrum, which were announced the same day. And while American users can't yet access tokenized shares of private companies, they are gaining access to crypto staking. Robinhood also launched staking for ethereum and solana in the U.S., a feature that was previously blocked by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The White House claimed Monday that Canada "caved" to President Donald Trump by hastily rescinding its digital services tax after the president threatened to shut down trade negotiations between the two major trading partners. "It's very simple: Prime Minister [Mark] Carney and Canada caved to President Trump and the United States of America," press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a briefing. "It was a mistake for Canada to vow to implement that tax that would have our tech companies," Leavitt said. Carney, she added, called Trump Sunday night to "let the president know that he would be dropping that tax, which is a big victory for our tech companies and our American workers." Neither the office of the prime minister nor his Liberal Party immediately responded to CNBC's requests for comment. Leavitt's remarks came hours after top Trump economic aide Kevin Hassett said the White House will likely ask more countries to drop their own digital services taxes as part of ongoing trade talks, following Canada's concession. "My expectation is that the digital services taxes around the world will be taken off, and that that will be a key part of the ... ongoing trade negotiations that we have," Hassett, the director of Trump's National Economic Council, said on CNBC's "Squawk on the Street." The remark from Leavitt and Hassett came one day after Canada walked back its DST in order to "advance broader trade negotiations" with the United States. That reversal — just hours before the first collection under the new tax was due — came on the heels of Trump's surprise threat Friday to terminate all trade talks with Ottawa as long as the DST remained in place. Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney now aim to strike a trade deal by July 21, according to a statement Sunday from the Department of Finance in Ottawa. "I'm very pleased to see that Canada is removing its DST, which means that we didn't have to put in this really complicated retaliation to the tax code," Hassett said Monday. "But you could expect that countries that have digital sales taxes of the future are going to be facing the wrath of [U.S. Trade Representative] Jameson Greer" over "these unfair trade practices," Hassett said. Hassett said he believes the U.S. has "frameworks" for "a whole number of deals" that will be agreed to shortly after a major Trump-backed budget bill passes through Congress. If that happens, Hassett predicted, there will be a "marathon session" in the Oval Office in which Trump and his aides will tick down a list of countries and make final calls on U.S. tariff rates for each. "We can do whatever we want," he said Friday when asked whether he would stick with one of those dates. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>This was CNBC's live blog covering European markets. Regionally, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 and Germany's DAX were also down 0.4%. Germany's Bayer was the third biggest loser due to the U.S. Supreme Court delaying a decision on a long-running litigation over its weedkiller. "We see this request as an encouraging step," said Bayer CEO Bill Anderson. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also advanced 207 points, or 0.5%. Germany's annual inflation rate unexpectedly eased to 2% in June, bringing Europe's largest economy in line with the European Central Bank's target, preliminary data from statistics office Destatis showed Monday. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 2.2% in the twelve months to June. The German print is harmonized across the euro zone, allowing for a direct comparison with other single currency states. In a Monday note, analysts at Citi said the latest text of U.S. President Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill" looked "incrementally negative for wind." That's in part due to proposed changes to the rules surrounding tax credits for wind projects, which will become more restrictive, and a potential new tax on wind developments that have "material assistance" from foreign entities of concern. While this would not technically apply to Vestas, "the complexity of supply chains could leave operators fearful" and "potentially prevent new orders being placed in the near term, even to western suppliers," according to Citi. However, they added that while the bill would provoke an initial negative reaction in Vestas shares, its scaling in offshore and European market growth story supported the stock longer-term. Analysts at Sydbank meanwhile took a positive view on the stock in a Monday note, maintaining their "buy" recommendation. "The Senate has submitted a bill with significant reductions in subsidies for onshore wind. This increases the risk of a significant and drastic decline in activity levels in the years after 2027, but may open up a very high order intake from the US in 2025 and 2026 for Vestas," they wrote, according to a Google translation. The U.K.'s trade deal with the U.S. came into effect today, slashing tariffs on British-made autos and removing levies on Britain's aerospace sector. But while U.K. steel has also been given a preferential tariff rate of 25%, compared with 50% for other trade partners, questions remain over when — and by how much — tariffs on U.K. metals can be reduced further, as promised. The U.K. government said Monday that it is still working with The Trump administration to bring tariffs on Britain's core steel products down to 0%. The regional Stoxx Automobiles and Parts index was last seen trading 1.3% lower, with French vehicle parts supplier Valeo leading losses on a 2.8% drop. Speaking to CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" this morning, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic emphasized how hard it has become for the Federal Reserve to make inflation forecasts amid fast-changing U.S. policy and foreign relations — citing Canada's recent walk-back on its digital services tax as an example. Bostic said he is therefore focusing on the inflation expectations of businesses and consumers and the actions they are taking, and where he sees risks to the outlook for taming price rises. "The textbook story for economics is, if you do tariffs, it's a one time shift. "What we are seeing today, though, is not just a one-time shift, it's actually something that's being stretched out over a much longer period of time. I think that runs the risk that people start to feel like inflation is always with them, this elevated level of inflation is always with them." Bostic, who is not currently a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, also told CNBC he doesn't think the data will support an interest rate move in July and that he see's the so-called "terminal rate" — neither stimulating nor restricting inflation and growth — "somewhere in the mid threes." Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo has called for a revamped Eurogroup — the informal body comprised of finance ministers for euro zone member states — days after announcing his candidacy for presidency of the group. Cuerpo told CNBC the group needs to be "more agile, more efficient in decision making," adding that he has a track record of bringing people to the table and striking deals. Three European finance or economy ministers have put themselves forward for the role, with Irish incumbent Paschal Donohoe facing competition from Lithuania's Rimantas Šadžius and Cuerpo. Euro zone bond yields are extending declines this morning after regional German inflation data. Preliminary national inflation data will be released this afternoon. The German 2-year yield was last down 2 basis points at 1.85%. The U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to have enough clarity on the trajectory of the U.S. economy to justify an interest rate cut in July, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Monday. "We're only going to have one more measure of inflation. We're going to have a lot that's unknown about how other policies are impacting the labor market. And without that kind of clarity, I don't think it's going to be my view that it'll be appropriate to move in any direction at this point," Bostic said. Tackling the issue of when the data might be sufficient to support a move, Bostic said the Fed would be closely monitoring how businesses and consumers respond to tariffs and other economic factors. "I'm hearing more [businesses] say that they may not expect this whole thing to play out, to where they're at their final strategy, till even 2026, so this could be a much more extended period than I think many expect," he told CNBC. European stocks opened in the green on Monday, with the Stoxx 600 index up 0.1% in early deals, building on last week's gains. Global sentiment appears broadly robust, with Asia-Pacific stocks turning mixed but U.S. futures remaining higher. In Europe, sectors are mixed, with autos down 0.6% and banks slipping 0.25% as financial services gain 0.6%. Beneficiaries of the U.K.-U.S. trade deal, which took effect this morning, are slightly higher, having already notched strong gains on the previous announcement. Key details include British car export tariffs being reduced from 27.5% to 10%, along with duties on aerospace goods such as engines and aircraft parts being slashed to zero. The U.K. has still been left with a baseline 10% tariff and an outlined agreement that will put zero tariffs on core steel products has not been finalized. The U.K.'s statistics agency meanwhile on Monday confirmed that economic growth for the first quarter of 2025 was 0.7%, in line with its previous estimate. The positive start for Europe comes after similar sentiment in Asia-Pacific markets overnight, as investors parsed details on trade negotiations and data points, including Japan's industrial output figures for May and China's manufacturing activity for June. Meanwhile, U.S. stock futures rose early Monday as investors look to cap an exuberant month for stocks, despite uncertainty over global trade negotiations. Market watchers in Europe will be looking at the latest inflation data out of Italy and Germany on Monday, as well as German retail sales, for signs of inflationary pressures and a hit to consumer confidence. Traders will also be digesting data out of China earlier that showed manufacturing activity contracted for a third straight month in June, despite Beijing's stimulus efforts helping to stabilize certain aspects of the industrial sector.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Sign up today for the new CNBC Sport Newsletter WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert called it a "truly monumental day" for the league. "These are proud cities with powerful sports legacies, each one rich in basketball tradition," she said. "This is a bold step forward as we grow our footprint." Each team will pay $250 million in franchise fees to join the league, according to a person familiar with the terms who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic details. Those fees would represent a historic high for the WNBA. More than a dozen cities submitted bids, including Kansas City, St. Louis, Austin, Houston, Miami, Denver and Charlotte, North Carolina. The league said Monday each location was selected after analyzing market viability, infrastructure and local support. Engelbert said Houston, specifically, is one the league will continue to have its eye on for future expansions. The CNBC Sport newsletter with Alex Sherman brings you the biggest news and exclusive interviews from the worlds of sports business and media, delivered weekly to your inbox. "Today marks a transformative day in Cleveland's sports history," said Nic Barlage, CEO of the Rock Entertainment Group, which owns the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers and other professional sports teams in the city. This would not be Cleveland's first foray into professional women's basketball. That team folded after seven seasons as the team's owner, Gordon Gund, cited low attendance and said he could not find a way to make the team profitable. The Detroit WNBA ownership group is led by Tom and Holly Gores, owners of the Detroit Pistons. "This is a huge win for our city," said Arn Tellem, the vice chairman of the Detroit Pistons basketball franchise. The Detroit Shock played from 1998 to 2009, winning three championships and setting records for attendance before moving to Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Philadelphia team will be owned by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, owner of the Philadelphia 76ers, which includes Josh Harris, David Blitzer and David Adelman. Comcast holds a minority stake in the team. Harris, co-founder and managing partner of HBSE, said bringing the WNBA to the city "wasn't just a nice-to-have, it was an obligation."

Video Games:

Nintendo pulled its products from Amazon.com Inc.'s US site.

Nintendo Co. pulled its products from Amazon.com Inc.'s US site after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, meaning the e-commerce company missed out on the recent debut of Nintendo's Switch 2 — the biggest game console launch of all time.

The Japanese company stopped selling on Amazon after noticing that third-party merchants were offering games for sale in the US at prices that undercut Nintendo's advertised rates, according to a person familiar with the situation. Enterprising sellers were buying Nintendo products in bulk in Southeast Asia and exporting them to the US, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential information.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Elon Musk on Friday announced Tesla had accomplished a major self-driving milestone: The company's first fully autonomous Model Y drove itself to its new home. "The first fully autonomous delivery of a Tesla Model Y from factory to a customer home across town, including highways, was just completed a day ahead of schedule!!" Musk said in a post on X. Tesla's much-anticipated launch of its Full Self-Driving technology has been repeatedly delayed over the years. Musk initially promised Tesla's cars would demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017. Musk, in his posts on X announcing the feat, added: "There were no people in the car at all and no remote operators in control at any point. While the Model Y's highway voyage makes it among the first passenger vehicles to drive itself on an interstate without a human operator, Waymo autonomous cars were granted regulatory approval to start testing their driverless capabilities on freeways in 2024, according to their website — however, while testing is underway, Waymo's robotaxis can't take riders on the highway yet. Self-driving freight trucks from Aurora have also been operating in Texas since early May, including traversing Interstate 45, where the typical speed limit is between 70 and 75 miles per hour. Ashok Elluswamy, a Tesla engineer, said in a separate post on X that the Model Y achieved a maximum speed of 72 miles per hour on the highway. Responding to Elluswamy, Musk said the pace was "Zippy!"</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Vancouver-based athleisure brand filed a lawsuit against Costco on Friday in California court, accusing it of ripping off the designs of its yoga jackets and chinos. In the 49-page filing, it spotlighted three product lines — its Scuba hoodies and sweatshirts, Define jackets, and ABC pants — saying Costco had created "confusingly similar" dupes of them. It said Costco had infringed its "trade dress," a broad trademark law that protects the look and feel of a product. In the lawsuit, Lululemon put pictures of Costco's and its products side by side in tables to emphasize design similarities. It also compared Costco's Spyder women's yoga jacket, which retails for $21.90, to the Lululemon Define jacket, which retails for $128. "There is even a hashtag 'LululemonDupes' on social media platforms such as TikTok that social media influencers use when promoting these copycat products," Lululemon said in the filing. Lululemon said it wanted damages from Costco in the form of lost profits and compensation for patent infringement. It also wants Costco to stop manufacturing and selling more products that are "identical or confusingly similar" to Lululemon's clothing. Lululemon has accused other companies of copyright infringement. In 2021, the brand sued exercise equipment company Peloton after it launched its clothing line. Lululemon used similar wording in that lawsuit, saying Peloton's products looked "confusingly similar" to its own Align leggings. In 2012, Lululemon sued Calvin Klein, saying the latter infringed design patents on its now discontinued Astro yoga pants' signature waistband and design.</p>
