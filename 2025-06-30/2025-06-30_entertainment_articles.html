                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>If Republicans manage to pass Donald Trump's so-called “Big Beautiful Bill,” millions of Americans will lose access to health care, food assistance, and other critical public support programs. While it's a shame that the GOP's war against the health of low income Americans is interfering with lawmakers' summer plans, it's reasonable to expect that an elected lawmaker would swallow their frustrations in service of the millions of people who stand to lose a lot more than a few vacation days. “Does Fetterman think his job is beach like Ken from Barbie?! You're expected to work long hours and take hard votes,” one Democratic aid told Huffpost. After the video of his comments gained traction on social media, Fetterman wrote on X that “not one single Democrat will vote for the ‘big beautiful bill.' I'm here to vote on these amendments and keep the ball rolling. Fetterman's recent pivot towards soft Republicanism has been a source of increased frustration among Democrats. In May, the Pennsylvania chapter on Indivisible, a progressive organizing group that supported Fetterman in his 2022 run for the Senate, called for him to step down from his seat. “You have failed to fulfill the most basic duties of the office by avoiding contact with your constituents who can't even leave voicemails after business hours, refusing to hold town halls, yelling at visitors in your office and inexcusably missing more votes than any other member of the current Senate.” The group cited Fetterman's confirmation votes in favor of several of Trump's Cabinet members, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as failure to challenge GOP efforts to cut programs benefiting low income Pennsylvanians. “We're looking to the leaders who will fight for us, because even today there are folks among the Democratic Party who think we should roll over and play dead,” Indivisible Co-Founder Leah Greenberg said during Philadelphia's “No Kings” rally earlier this month. Rick Scott Demands More Cuts to Medicaid, Which His Company Allegedly Scammed Scarlett Johansson, Sheryl Crow, Zayn Malik Urge Congress Not to Cut Food-Assistance Programs Over the weekend, Democrats used several tactics in an effort to delay a final vote on the Big Beautiful Bill, and secure as much debate time as they could to publicly critique its most problematic provisions. Fetterman expressed frustration with his party after Democrats refused to waive Senate procedures requiring bills to be read when introduced for debate, resulting in a 16-hour marathon read-out of the almost 1000 page long legislation, which was followed by 20 theoretical hours of debate — split evenly between the parties — of which Democrats are expected to squeeze out every second they possibly can. Kristi Noem Secretly Pocketed Cash From Dark Money Group: Report Watch the Cure's Robert Smith Join Olivia Rodrigo for ‘Friday I'm in Love' While his colleagues are working overtime crafting floor speeches, negotiating critical amendments, and stirring up as much public outcry against the legislation as they can, it's obvious that though Fetterman is physically present in the Senate, he'd rather be anywhere else – probably the beach.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>At my advanced screening for F1 The Movie, most of the audience was clad in team gear, McLaren shirts, hoodies with Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna's MP4/4 on it, and even one guy in a hat branded with Dallara, the manufacturer that makes chassis for racecars. It was a fan event as much as any Grand Prix weekend, but instead of watching real cars rush by, pounding our chests with wind and filling our lungs with exhaust and bits of rubber flung from tires, facsimiles of real racecars crisply crossed the IMAX screen. There is a viscerality to racecars inherently lost on screen, but for a long time the utter instability of the machines provided thrills. When Le Mans finally screened for the drivers that participated in filming, they were initially disappointed by how cut apart their racing footage had been, and believed that the racing—which they conducted in real prototype sports cars at near full speeds at great risk to themselves—would have looked better if shots were held for duration. But now, filming at near-racing speeds isn't very interesting. Of course, that is something the enthusiasts will do, not someone going to the theater to watch F1, that thing they've heard some of their friends had gotten into, for the first time. You might have seen F1 appear on the TVs of suburban sports bars or had an F1® Arcade pop up in your major metropolitan area. You may have seen tech people promoting a haptic trailer for F1 The Movie. Even if none of these have pierced your bubble, you've probably seen an ad for Brad Pitt in F1, with footage of spinning cars and movie stars and big text from Twitter users claiming that “F1 IS A FULL BODY EVENT” during a commercial break. Ever since the sport was acquired by Liberty Media Group at the start of 2017, and subsequently launched Drive To Survive, there has been a massive boost in popularity to the stodgy and pretentious old sport of (mostly) European rich kids driving around in circles, particularly in the United States, a market once thought unattainable. It was a combination of the right thing at the right time, with the Netflix series gaining modest attention before exploding in popularity during COVID lockdowns, which led many new eyes to what would become an all-time great championship rivalry in 2021 between Mercedes' previously dominant Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull's up-and-comer hotshot Max Verstappen. The histrionics of Drive To Survive‘s reality TV approach to motorsport was now unfolding in real time to millions around the world who might have never cared about the sport before, and there was no going back. Like its forebears in racing cinema, it started with Hollywood approaching F1, although unlike the reluctance from the Drivers Association to participate in Grand Prix or Driven, F1 The Movie was met with such open arms that it seems to be an official extension of the sport. This is not because of a particular realism in storytelling, although it touts that in its technical side, but because the film works to boost the prestigious, yuppieish appeal of Formula 1 as an intellectual property. Its story is an amalgamation, both of recent racing history (even casual fans will immediately recognize references to Bahrain 2020 and Abu Dhabi 2021) as well as older events (there is a recreation of Martin Donnelly's 1990 crash for character backstory). While F1 The Movie might work as a broad introductory text, its consolidation of racing incidents ends up leaving a baffling picture of what the sport is. For instance, Sonny Hayes (Brad Pitt) has a penchant for intentionally crashing into rivals to cause safety cars, which neutralize the race, bunch up the pack of cars, and in effect make people's pit stop times shorter. There is precedent for this kind of cheating: In the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, Nelson Piquet Jr. intentionally hit his Renault into the wall on the main straight in order to cause a safety car, which allowed his teammate Fernando Alonso to get a cheap pit stop and ultimately win the race. “Crashgate,” as it is known, is one of the most controversial moments in modern F1 history, one still litigated (literally, in court) to this day. Pitt's age does open an opportunity to say that he raced against greats like Michael Schumacher, Alain Prost, and Ayrton Senna. The problem, though, is that those drivers changed the sport and effectively put renegade drivers like Hayes out of business. Senna and Prost's rivalry wasn't so much the playboy vs. the professor like James Hunt and Niki Lauda (fictionalized in Rush), but was one ultra-methodical, “does nothing except live and breath racing” driver versus one who is also that, but even more. Schumacher and his seven World Drivers' Championship titles would be the nail in the coffin for F1 drivers looking to be anything less than completely dedicated athletes. All three drivers had their outbursts and fits of immaturity, sure, but they represented a shift from anything genuinely roguish in the sport to one where the name of the game is absurd precision. However, this falls into the same pitfall as filmmaker Joseph Kosinski's Top Gun: Maverick, another vehicularly fetishistic blockbuster where an opportunity to hand off star power to a new generation is denied, instead banking on the nostalgia of the former glory of the old headliner. It is playing into a similar “they really did it!” stunt spectacle as the latest Tom Cruise works, too, with Pitt and Damson Idris often themselves piloting the cars we see on track. Like sticking actors in real jets to film Maverick, it's an unnecessary gimmick. It just boils down what makes good marketing, like talking about how G-forces can't be replicated without actually throwing the actors around at hundreds of miles an hour. What Crofty and Brundle do in F1 The Movie is give sense where there is none, add narrative where sense can't be found, and stitch together loose threads unraveling at 200 mph so that the filmmakers don't have to make it all cohere. F1 The Movie tries to sell itself on this faux-realism, and on images never before seen, or never before possible, since no one before has ever miniaturized digital IMAX cameras and strapped them to an F2-spec car done up to look and feel like one from F1. RACER (a magazine briefly featured in the film), focuses its summer issue cover story on this technical achievement. F1 The Movie is not iterative, but reiterative, both with its reuse of images better seen before and its quintessential story of old dog vs. young gun. It's nothing new as a movie, but simply the newest piece of F1 content. It might be best to look at the executive producers. Like how F1 teams no longer need to be winning races, or even scoring many points, to be gold mines for investors, F1 The Movie doesn't need to be a particularly good film, or even successful at the box office, as the mere existence of the film and its advertising is enough to solidify the brand that F1 wishes to proliferate. It fits well Martin Scorsese's idea of “theme park cinema,” a cinema driven by its consumption rather than its images, not just because the film tries to feel at times like a rollercoaster, but because the point isn't really to watch F1 The Movie. As much as F1 The Movie is for those people that are on the fence about F1—herding the final crop of people who can potentially be sold hats and water bottles, who haven't yet spent hours binging a Netflix show (but can somehow be convinced to see a two-and-a-half-hour movie)—it is also for the stakeholders.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>British police are investigating whether their comments amount to a criminal act, BBC News notes. Bob Vylan have long been vocal supporters of Palestine, particularly in light of the Israeli military's continued assault on Gaza and the West Bank. '” On stage, Bobby Vylan told the crowd, “Sometimes we have to get our message across with violence because that's the only language some people speak, unfortunately.” He later responded to the controversy on Instagram, citing a responsibility to teach “children to speak up for the change they want and need.” He added, “Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.” Bob Vylan had been due to tour the United States in October and November; those dates, naturally, are in jeopardy. Foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.” Bob Vylan have also been dropped by United Talent Agency. Glastonbury organizers posted on social media that they were “appalled by the statements made from the West Holts stage by Bob Vylan.” Dozens of other artists made pro-Palestinian remarks at the festival, and Palestinian flags were a fixture among the crowds, as Amyl and the Sniffers noted in a statement defending Bob Vylan and Kneecap. British police are also investigating Kneecap for their Glastonbury set, though it has not been specified what part of the show is under scrutiny; Keir Starmer had called for the group to be pulled from the Glastonbury lineup in advance. In a rare break from custom, the BBC, which airs continuous footage from Glastonbury's main stages, refused to broadcast Kneecap's set, but later uploaded a largely unedited stream of the show to its iPlayer platform. Kneecap band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, better known as Mo Chara, recently appeared in court on a terror charge relating to the alleged display of a Hezbollah flag during a 2024 concert. As I lay in bed this morning, my phone buzzing non stop, inundated with messages of both support and hatred, I listen to my daughter typing out loud as she fills out a school survey asking for her feedback on the current state of her school dinners. Teaching our children to speak up for the change they want and need is the only way that we make this world a better place. As we grow older and our fire possibly starts to dim under the suffocation of adult life and all its responsibilities, it is incredibly important that we encourage and inspire future generations to pick up the torch that was passed to us. Let us display to them loudly and visibly the right thing to do when we want and need change. Let them see us marching in the streets, campaigning on ground level, organising online and shouting about it on any and every stage that we are offered.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>But ABC maintains that the series hasn't been canceled, even as its cast is on the verge of being free to pursue other work. ABC has repeatedly said that it's still weighing the show's future: Disney Television Group president Craig Erwich told The Hollywood Reporter in May that “We're continuing to have creative conversations with Ryan, and we'll talk to him about what the next chapter looks like.” Yet as those conversations were happening, Doctor Odyssey's sets were being struck, sources tell THR, and contract options for the cast are set to expire Monday. Those things almost always point to a show's cancellation — something director and executive producer Paris Barclay seemed to acknowledge on social media over the weekend. Murphy's eponymous company has plenty of business with Disney, of course, including ABC's 911 and its forthcoming spinoff 911: Nashville, which will fill the same Thursday-night slot in the schedule this fall that Doctor Odyssey did last season. Murphy also produces a host of shows for FX and Hulu, and sources cited his workload as one of the factors behind Doctor Odyssey's limbo status. A source compared Doctor Odyssey's handling to the way broadcasters often treat unscripted shows — formal cancellations for reality series tend to be rare, and formats can be revived sometimes years after they last aired (à la Fox's upcoming Fear Factor reboot and ABC's own Match Game revival). But for a network scripted series, which operate on stricter timetables than those at streamers or cable outlets, Doctor Odyssey's situation is uncommon, to say the least. In the lawsuit, Caroline Mack, Alicia Haverland and Ava Steinbrenner claimed they were subject to an “unchecked campaign of sexual harassment” that saw their supervisor, assistant props master Tyler Patton, bombard them with sexual comments and unwanted touching. Along with Jackson, Doctor Odyssey also stars Phillipa Soo, Sean Teale and Don Johnson. Doctor Odyssey is produced by 20th TV in association with Ryan Murphy Television.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>EXCLUSIVE: Justin Hartley has signed a new multi-year first-look deal with 20th Television through his company, ChangeUp Productions. Under the new deal, Hartley will continue to develop and produce original content across broadcast, cable and streaming via ChangeUp, where Julianna LaRosa serves as Head of Development. “Julianna and I are delighted to extend our collaboration with 20th. “ChangeUp is ramping up to deliver an impressive slate of upcoming projects, and we are truly fortunate to have such exceptional partners in Eric Schrier, Karey Burke, Carolyn Cassidy, Jane Francis and their outstanding teams,” he added. 'Very Young Frankenstein' Series From Mel Brooks, 'What We Do In The Shadows' Team Nears FX Pilot Order Russell Crowe, Rami Malek & Michael Shannon Movie 'Nuremberg' Acquired By Sony Pictures Classics The deal follows the record-breaking success of Tracker on CBS, which Hartley both stars in and executive produces. Since its Super Bowl debut in 2024, the action-drama has reached over 100 million viewers to date and became the first new series to rank as the #1 series on TV since 2000. Tracker stars Hartley as Colter Shaw, a lone-wolf survivalist driven by his past troubles who uses his instincts to find the missing and collect rewards. Supported by lawyer Reenie, his business handler Velma Bruin (Abby McEnany) and tech expert Bobby Exley (Eric Graise), Colter will stop at nothing to get the job done. Before his work on Tracker, he was part of the ensemble cast of NBC's critically acclaimed, award-winning series This Is Us opposite Mandy Moore, Milo Ventimiglia, Sterling K. Brown, Chrissy Metz and Jon Ortiz. Hartley played Kevin Pearson, for which he received multiple Critics' Choice Award nominations for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series (2019, 2020, 2021). Additionally, Hartley and his cast members won back-to-back SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2018 and 2019. ChangeUp Productions continues to build out a slate of original, character-driven projects across TV and film. Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

The Hot 100 blends all-genre U.S. streaming (official audio and official video), radio airplay and sales data, the lattermost metric reflecting purchases of physical singles and digital tracks from full-service digital music retailers; digital singles sales from direct-to-consumer (D2C) sites are excluded from chart calculations. For all chart news, you can follow @billboard and @billboardcharts on both X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram. (Effective this week, SiriusXM streaming data is now included in the Hot 100, as well as Billboard's streaming and genre-specific multimetric charts. Such activity is classified as programmed streams and represents listens of select current-based live music channels via SiriusXM's app or website.) In partnership with Billboard, data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed, using established criteria, before final chart calculations are made and published. “Ordinary,” on Atlantic Records, tallied 19.8 million official streams (down 3% week-over-week), 64.2 million radio airplay audience impressions (up 4%) and 6,000 sold (down 6%) in the United States June 20-26. The single spends a second week at No. 1 on the Radio Songs chart; rebounds 4-2 on Streaming Songs, following four weeks at the summit; and holds at No. 2 after seven weeks atop Digital Song Sales. Cardi B's “Outside” soars onto the Hot 100 at No. It's her 13th top 10 and first since “Enough (Miami)” debuted at its No. 1 on Digital Song Sales, marking Cardi B's eighth leader. The single, which was available in its original form and a cappella and instrumental versions in its first week, previews Cardi B's second LP, Am I the Drama?, due Sept. 19, as announced June 23. (Also notably, the Hot 100 debut of “Outside” ends an unprecedented four-week run of every song in the top 10 having peaked at No. Morgan Wallen's “What I Want,” featuring Tate McRae, rises 3-2 on the Hot 100, after it debuted in May as Wallen's fourth No. 1 on the multimetric Hot Country Songs chart. 2-peaking “Just in Case,” which keeps at No. 4, and “I'm the Problem,” which lifts 6-5 — as Wallen runs up his sixth week with at least three simultaneous top 10s this year, one-upping Kendrick Lamar for the most in 2025. Here's a look at both standings through the July 5-dated survey. Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s All-Time: Most Weeks With 3-Plus Simultaneous Hot 100 Top 10s in a Single Year: Dating to his first such frame in January 2021, it's his 27th week with at least half the chart's top 10 — no other act has more than one week earning the honor (Beyoncé, in 2024, and Zach Bryan and Taylor Swift, both in 2023). Wallen's I'm the Problem, the parent set of all three of his current top 10s, secures a sixth week at No. Sabrina Carpenter's “Manchild” dips 2-3 on the Hot 100, after it debuted as her second No. 1, and first chart-topping debut, two weeks earlier. Kendrick Lamar and SZA's “Luther” descends 5-6 after 13 weeks atop the Hot 100 beginning in March. Shaboozey's “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” stays at No. 7 on the Hot 100, following its record-tying 19 weeks at No. Teddy Swims' “Lose Control,” which led the Hot 100 for a week in March 2024, and became the year's No. Get weekly rundowns straight to your inbox A daily briefing on what matters in the music industry Send us a tip using our anonymous form.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Houston-raised MC/singer/songwriter/flautist has gone from Prince-cosigned cult phenomenon to bona fide pop star to full-on backlash recipient and workplace-harassment-suit defendant, a process given extra intensity by the always-on news cycle and the constant hum of social-media chatter. While hip-pop cuts like the fizzy anthem “Juice” and the summer-song kiss-off “Truth Hurts” showed off Lizzo's dexterity with hooks and rhymes, My Face Hurts From Smiling is all about swagger, from the double-middle-finger salute Lizzo flaunts on its cover to its closing declaration, “It's a Lizzo summer, bitch.” Lizzo's additions promoted her clothing line (“Bitch, it's summer, we outside, put some Yitty on your titties,” she orders), shouted out Labubus and Kendrick Lamar's “N95,” and flaunted her sexual prowess in unbridled fashion. Kristi Noem Secretly Pocketed Cash From Dark Money Group: Report Watch the Cure's Robert Smith Join Olivia Rodrigo for ‘Friday I'm in Love' The raunchy, high-energy My Face Hurts From Smoling, which clocks in at just over half an hour, starts off with a bang — or, really, a “Crashout”: “We outside, ho! We outside!” her friend and former groupmate Lexo taunts as Lizzo big-ups her ability to go “through the bullshit, turn it to a boppin'.” That idea, where the only way out of a rough patch is through music, persists throughout the tape, with Lizzo sending fire in the direction of her naysayers and reveling in how unstoppable the idea of complete creative freedom makes her feel. “Just 4 Fun” pairs schoolyard taunts and trap snares with Lizzo in high-speed mode, stealing a girl from a Call of Duty-glued mark and kicking another hapless game-player to the curb; “Bend it Ova” is a giddy bedroom romp set to a sparse beat that's part roller-rink jam, part abstract vocal art. Doja Cat drops in for “Still Can't Fuh,” which combines chopped-up gospel choirs with a withering assessment of a man who doesn't quite measure up, while SZA adds heat to “IRL,” a call to touch grass—“I can't let no comment section ever fuck with my vibe,” Lizzo declares. But her overwhelming charisma was a large part of what helped propel her ascent of the charts all those years ago, and on the frothy, bawdy My Face Hurts From Smiling she sounds newly energized — and ready to rumble with all comers.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Paleontologist Dr. Henry Loomis (Jonathan Bailey) is hosting mercenary Zora Bennett (Scarlett Johansson) and pharmaceutical businessman Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend) at his shuttering dinosaur museum. Go to an uninhabited island full of wild dinosaurs, extract blood from three of the biggest creatures, and bring it back so that Big Pharma can make cutting-edge, life-saving, incredibly profitable heart medicine. Martin has to qualify that he doesn't mean dinosaurs at a zoo or in academia, because the past 10 years of Jurassic World have brought back dinosaurs in a fully-functioning amusement park, set them free from captivity, and let them roam undomesticated across the world. and it reveals the core issue with Jurassic World Rebirth. Don't worry about those, Jurassic World Rebirth says via Martin Krebs, this is the real deal. But despite being the most technically adept Jurassic film since 2001—delivering many dino skirmishes, a competent understanding of action editing and pacing, and no locusts to speak of—Rebirth never escapes its own production backstory: a swiftly assembled brand correction steered by competent hired hands. Director Gareth Edwards—the Rogue One and Godzilla filmmaker who knows how blockbusters should be lit and composed, if nothing else—gives audiences a scintillating kill to whet our appetite: A scientist clad in a crisp white Andromeda Strain-style suit is trapped behind a heavy blast door, which is the third time the director has pulled this trick in his five-film career, although it's the first time the victim has died at the hands of a dinosaur. The weak, obvious, and oversnarked characterization courtesy of screenwriter David Koepp (who previously wrote the first two Spielberg-directed films) sabotages several actors' chances of giving a good performance—Jonathan Bailey and Rupert Friend just about clear this bar, but Scarlett Johansson is helpless as a smug and sarcastic antiheroine. A twist in the tale is that Jurassic World Rebirth has two storylines. The A-list cast embarks on their fetch quest to sample blood from dinosaurs of sea, land, and air, while single dad Reuben (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) leads a yacht trip with his two daughters Teresa (Luna Blaise) and Isabella (Audrina Miranda), along with Teresa's irksome, layabout boyfriend Xavier (David Iacano). They are rescued from capsizing by sea captain Duncan Kincaid (Mahershala Ali) and inadvertently brought to Saint-Hubert's shores. Even though the family drama suffers from the same repetitive, cloying simplicity as Zora and Henry's predictable ethical conflict (are they okay with giving miracle medicine to greedy pharmaceutical conglomerates? Neither of these arcs are convincing on their own terms, but Rebirth‘s structure forces the film to highlight only the most watchable bits. It's a moment lifted from Crichton's original novel, and Edwards lends an edge-of-your-seat aggression to the creature's animal instincts, playing precisely with perspective and geography and never letting the audience think they're safe for longer than a moment. But 2025 may just be too late to inspire excitement for photorealistic, expertly animated monster carnage. When Jurassic World Rebirth reveals the identity of the dangerous experimental dinosaur that triggered an island-wide evacuation, one's first mental association is Alien: Resurrection—and therefore, last year's brand-exploiting Alien: Romulus—the wonderment promised by the film's throwback, legacy-honoring tone dwindles, and cynicism takes hold. Jurassic World Rebirth‘s attempt at rejuvenating its franchise mirrors the vitality of its once-extinct reptiles: This movie may have breathed life back where once it was thought lost, but this life is not pure or sustainable.

The “Jurassic” franchise has long become a lot like the bioengineered mutant dinosaur — amusingly dubbed “Distortus Rex” — that escapes from an InGen research facility in the series' loud nap of a new installment: Pointless to keep alive but impossible to kill. The mere existence of Gareth Edwards' “Jurassic World: Rebirth” would have been enough to clarify that condition, and yet this back-to-basics standalone — arriving just a few summers after the franchise's bone-dumb second trilogy ended with a billion-dollar blah — takes pains to remind us that the “Jurassic” period won't stop printing money just because Universal doesn't know how to spend it. Related Stories Vin Diesel Teases a ‘Fast and Furious' Reunion with the Late Paul Walker's Character in Final Franchise Film ‘Project Hail Mary' Trailer: Ryan Gosling Tries to Salvage the Sun (and Save the Universe) in Astronaut Drama Life finds a way, and no “Jurassic” movie since the first one has more convincingly illustrated how, in the absence of evolution, survival is forced to become its own reward. That idea is baked into the premise of David Koepp's script, which takes place 32 years after “dinosaurs came back,” and roughly a decade after people grew bored of them (Koepp very much included). And as if things weren't bad enough for our cold-blooded friends, it turns out that global warming isn't the best vibe for prehistoric lizards, and most of the remaining dinosaurs have retreated to a handful of equatorial islands whose climate more closely resembles the ancient world. We don't bother them, they don't bother us, and nature is left to run its course — or it would have been if not for all of those meddling corporations. This time it's a pharmaceutical giant called ParkerGenix, whose scientists have discovered that a trillion-dollar cure for heart disease could be cultivated from the blood of the three biggest dinosaurs left on Earth. Naturally, they want to brand it before anyone else gets the chance (nothing revs up the imagination like a race for medical patents! ), which is why they've given sleazebag goon Martin Krebs (Rupert Friend, serving yassified Dennis Nedry) the blank check necessary to hire a team capable of going to Skull Island — or whatever the abandoned InGen testing site is called — and getting the samples ParkerGenix needs. Leading the pack is former special-forces operative Zora Bennett (a pathologically chipper Scarlett Johansson, often rocking some casual Linda Hamilton cosplay), who's allegedly still reeling from the death of a beloved colleague on her most recent mission. I say “allegedly” because she never shows a hint of human emotion, even after witnessing the death of a beloved colleague on her current mission, but everyone makes a point of paying their condolences for her loss. After walking away with $200 million of ParkerGenix's money, Zora will be able to pay for them herself. Getting rich wouldn't ease the grief he feels for his dead son, which is a mighty cheap device for a movie so uninterested in its characters (Koepp's script doesn't exactly follow through on the notion of people internalizing “life finds a way” on their own terms), but getting chewed alive by dinosaurs wouldn't hurt the guy anymore than he already is. Ed Skrein is definitely also there, along with Bechir Sylvain and Philippine Velge, who might as well be wearing t-shirts that say “eat me first.” Styled to look like Steve from “Sex and the City,” “Wicked” star Jonathan Bailey rounds out the team as the bookish paleontologist Henry Loomis, who studied under franchise icon Dr. Alan Grant, but is still dumb enough to go to an InGen island full of untamed dinosaurs. Adventurous dad Reuben Delgado (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) might be even dumber for thinking he can sail around it, as the known existence of prehistoric species doesn't stop him from steering his two daughters — and the older one's wastoid boyfriend — straight through Mosasaurus territory as they make their way across the Atlantic. (These characters are introduced with a Vampire Weekend song, which is an amusingly multiplex-brained way of teeing up the fact that Reuben's eldest is going to NYU in the fall.) Distortus is a big ugly chungus, and it basically does so little that its enormous paw tracks are the only impression its capable of leaving behind. That would be disappointing in and of itself, but it's even more so with an effects wizard like Edwards at the helm, whose “Godzilla” remains among the most sweeping and majestic monster movies of the 21st century (in addition to being an unfathomably perfect audition reel for directing a “Jurassic” sequel). It's no secret that Edwards joined “Rebirth” just a short while before it raced into production, and that Universal targeted “The Creator” creator because he was one of the only proven filmmakers capable of delivering a CGI-fest like this in time for its predetermined summer 2025 release date. And as we all remember from “Jurassic Park,” there are never any negative consequences for operating on a timeline that prioritizes shareholder value above structural integrity. It would be disingenuous to suggest that “Rebirth” is totally deprived of tolerable setpieces and/or well-engineered thrills; the T-Rex cameo has some fun with an inflatable raft, while the Quetzalcoatlus sequence introduces a high-flying pinch of “Indiana Jones” into a movie so desperate to coast off Spielbergian magic that it doesn't seem to care where it comes from. Alas, to a less explicit but similarly enervating degree as the previous “Jurassic World” titles, this movie is undone by its need to make dinosaurs feel modern enough to compete against the rest of today's multiplex fare. Much as I appreciate Edwards' decision to shoot on 35mm film, his facility with CGI ends up being less of a feature than a bug in the context of a franchise that requires your brain to believe in the context of its franchise. It's no wonder that none of the kids in “Rebirth” are ever sufficiently petrified about their situation, or that “Jurassic Park” continues to be the only one of these movies that doesn't feel like watching people enjoy a theme park ride second-hand. Bad as some of the previous sequels have been, none of them have been so eager to measure themselves against Spielberg's masterpiece. Nothing in this movie is quite as maddening as the second trilogy's attempt to make audiences invest in a specific Velociraptor (though Edwards half-heartedly tries to sweeten us on an adorable baby Aquilops named Dolores), but the extent to which this franchise is just fending off its own extinction has never been more obvious than it is in during the “Rebirth” sequence that pays homage to the kitchen encounter from the first movie.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Foo Fighters have shared a cover of “I Don't Wanna Hear It,” a song from Minor Threat's first 7" release. According to the YouTube description, Foo Fighters recorded the instrumentals in 1995, and Dave Grohl finished his vocals in 2025. Listen to the cover below. As a teenager, he famously wrote MacKaye a letter, and, in his late twenties, he cited Minor Threat as one of his five favorite hardcore bands. “They sort of made hardcore what it is, with Ian's vocals and the whole straight-edge ‘no drink-no drugs' thing,'” he told Melody Maker. They started a new era. Foo Fighters have been relatively quiet since releasing But Here We Are, their first album after the death of drummer Taylor Hawkins, in 2023. They'll return to the stage in October, but it will be without Josh Freese, who briefly took over for Hawkins on drums.

Diesel, who stars in and produces the films, said during an appearance at Walker‘s brother Cody Walker's car festival Fuel Fest that the eleventh “Fast and Furious” feature will have a reunion between characters Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and O'Conner (Walker). His brothers Cody and Caleb served as stand-ins for his character in that film, which used CGI and VFX to give Walker's character a sendoff as he drove off into the sunset.

The third thing was reuniting Dom and Brian O'Conner. That is what you're going to get in the finale.” It's unclear yet whether this planned eleventh feature will be a single, final installment or not. Diesel previously told Fandango in 2023 that the tenth film, “Fast X,” could be a trilogy. “Without giving away too much, I can say this, going into making this movie, the studio had asked if this could be a two-parter and after the studio saw this Part One, they said, ‘Could you make “Fast X: The Finale” a trilogy?,'” Diesel said. The tenth feature also saw the franchise debut of Paul Walker's daughter Meadow Walker, who joined Diesel onscreen for the first time exactly a decade after her father's death. “I can't believe now I get to be up there too with those who have been around to see me grow up… I am so blessed to be able to honor my father's legacy and share this with him forever.” “I just hope we get to — I don't know — have a little cameo and bring Paul back to save the day and I get to help create that again,” Caleb said. Brother Cody added, “I think there could potentially be a way to do it. We use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The A-listers who attended the couple's glamorous Venice wedding looked stunning in designer suits and dresses from Oscar de la Renta, Dolce & Gabbana, Roberto Cavalli, and other renowned brands. But the feathers, lace, and velvet guests wore to the pajama party on June 28 didn't disappoint, either. The pajamas worn to this wedding pajama party were not the kind of clothes most of these celebrities probably sleep in. This was an opportunity to showcase another carefully selected outfit. For some, it was all about creating a sexy, alluring look. Over it, he wore a black jacket. CBS News journalist Gayle King also looked more comfortable, wearing a white tank top dress with a colorful robe thrown over it in green, blue, yellow, and tan. Producer Brian Grazer was set to party and sleep in his satin animal-print button-down pajamas. Kris, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner were spotted together on one of the water taxis headed to the Arsenale di Venezia. Kylie wore a silver, fringed crop top and a white skirt, while Kris was the more extravagant of the three in her patterned gray and white outfit, featuring a black feather boa on top. The business mogul and reality star wore a low-cut, sultry corset over a tiny tulle skirt, with sheer stockings held up by garters. She also carried a satin and tulle cape, but it did little to cover her sexy outfit. A post shared by Fashion Bomb Daily (@fashionbombdaily) Along with their own fancy and stylish pajamas, guests were gifted footwear from the Bezos. The men received Vibi Venezia blue velvet Venetian slippers. Women, however, were given Amazon plush, black open-toe slippers.</p>
