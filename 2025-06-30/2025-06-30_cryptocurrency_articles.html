                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Bitcoin continues to face sellers at $109,000 even as most traders anticipate all-time highs and select altcoins rally at the start of the week. Bitcoin is facing selling near $109,000, but the shallow pullback suggests the uptrend may resume. BNB and HYPE are showing strength, having broken above their immediate resistance levels. Bitcoin remains on track for a positive monthly close in June as long as it stays above $104,600. If that happens, it will only be the second occasion since 2020 that Bitcoin has closed June in the green, per CoinGlass data. Bitcoin's failure to break out of the all-time high at $111,980 has not deterred investors from buying more. CoinShares data shows $2.2 billion in inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded products last week. In addition to steady ETF inflows, Bitcoin treasury companies continued their purchases. Similarly, Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said in a post on X that the firm bought 1,005 Bitcoin at an average price of $107,601. Could Bitcoin stay above $106,000, or will bears pull the price below the level? How are altcoins likely to behave? The S&P 500 Index bounced off the 20-day exponential moving average (6,029) on June 23, indicating a positive sentiment. Sellers are likely to have other plans. They will try to pull the price back below 6,147, trapping the aggressive bulls. Conversely, a break and close below the 20-day EMA suggests profit-booking by the bulls. Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is near the oversold territory, indicating that bears are in control. The bulls are unlikely to give up easily and will try to push the price back above the breakdown level of 97.92. If they manage to do that, the index could rally to the 50-day SMA (99.28). That suggests the bulls are not hurrying to book profits as they anticipate another leg higher. This is a vital level for the bears to defend because a break above it signals the resumption of the uptrend. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair risks falling to $104,500 and then to the $100,000 support. Ether's (ETH) recovery is facing selling near the 50-day SMA ($2,534), indicating that the bears are active at higher levels. Both moving averages have flattened out, and the RSI is near the midpoint, signaling a possible range-bound action in the near term. Buyers are expected to vigorously defend the $2,323 level because a break below it may sink the pair to $2,111. The next trending move may begin on a break above $2,879 or below $2,111. Sellers will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below the $2 support. If they can pull it off, the pair may fall to $1.61. BNB (BNB) broke above the resistance line of the descending channel pattern on Sunday, suggesting that the correction may be over. There is minor resistance at the 50-day SMA ($654), but if buyers do not allow the price to dip back into the channel, the BNB/USDT pair could surge to $675 and subsequently to $698. This positive view will be invalidated in the near term if the price turns down sharply and breaks below $636. The pair may then decline to $625. Solana (SOL) turned up from the $140 support on Friday and rose above the 20-day EMA ($148) on Saturday. If they manage to do that, the SOL/USDT pair could attempt a rally to the overhead resistance of $185. Sellers are expected to aggressively defend the $185 level because a break above it clears the path for a rally to $220. Related: Ethereum risks 25% price drop as ‘massive whale' moves $237M in ETH to exchanges Dogecoin (DOGE) has recovered to the 20-day EMA ($0.17), which is the first obstacle to watch out for. If that happens, the selling could accelerate, and the pair may tumble to $0.10. Buyers will gain strength after they propel the pair above the $0.21 overhead resistance. Cardano (ADA) has risen close to the 20-day EMA ($0.59), which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. Buyers are expected to defend the $0.50 level with all their might because a break below it will complete a descending triangle pattern. That may start a downward move to $0.40. A trend change will be signaled after buyers drive the pair above the downtrend line. The pair may then slump to $30.69. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' May Get a 'Hail Mary' Bitcoin Tax Exemption As Senate Republicans race to pass President Donald Trump's sweeping budget reconciliation bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a last ditch initiative is underway in the halls of Congress to tack on an amendment to the legislation that would benefit crypto investors in potentially numerous ways. The buzziest of the bunch appears to be a provision that would, at last, apply a so-called de minimis exemption to capital gains taxes on small amounts of crypto, which could provide a pathway for greater adoption of cryptocurrency for payments. At the moment, disposing of even small amounts of, say, Bitcoin to buy a burger, or a nominal amount of Ethereum to pay a gas fee on the network, requires users to calculate capital gains and losses on every transaction. Whether a change to these tax laws makes it to the final version of the Big Beautiful Bill, though, is still TBD. At the same time, Senate Republicans are meeting privately to determine whether to add all or part of a crypto tax provision to the bill that Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has been working on for well over a year, sources familiar with the matter told Decrypt. “It wasn't clear it would be done in time for inclusion in the [Big Beautiful Bill],” one crypto policy leader familiar with the deliberations told Decrypt, speaking of Lummis' crypto tax provision. Legislators involved want to get a win for crypto if they can, but not risk adding more chaos to a legislative process that has already been mired with Republican defections and controversy. The decision will ultimately come down to Lummis, Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo (R-ID), and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD), sources said. “I am working on an OBBB amendment to ensure Americans can use digital assets without fear of tax violations,” Lummis said. A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a question from Decrypt about the president's support for the quickly unfolding initiative. Crypto policy leaders are most confident the amendment will include two elements unlikely to rock the boat in the Senate: a clarification on tax timing for crypto staking and mining rewards, and a mark-to-market accounting provision for companies that hold crypto on their balance sheets. The staking measure would explicitly clarify that Americans who earn crypto rewards via staking or mining will only be taxed on those rewards once they are sold. The mark-to-market accounting provision would allow companies greater flexibility in reporting increases in value of stockpiled crypto, even when those gains are unrealized. In recent months, publicly traded companies have flocked to buy up cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana as a means of passively boosting their balance sheets. A third provision that industry leaders think could possibly make the cut today, and get taken up for a vote as an amendment to the Big Beautiful Bill, is a de minimis tax exemption for crypto assets. “There have been so many different versions of this text,” they said. While crypto industry leaders Decrypt spoke to Monday had slightly differing thoughts on the respective odds of different provisions making it into the Big Beautiful Bill, they all agreed in one regard: it's either happening today, or it's not happening at all.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>In a note to clients last week, Ed Campbell of Rosenberg Research said the next big resistance level for crypto is $114,000. Should the token rise another 6% to clear the $114,000 mark, it could spark a fresh rally of as much as 25% to $143,000. "While momentum may fade later this summer, a breakout now (or soon) would reinforce the bullish macro setup and could extend Bitcoin's leadership well into the second half of the year," Campbell wrote. The note pointed to a handful of bullish catalysts the firm believes will act as tailwinds to bitcoin's price going forward. The idea is to make it harder for new bitcoins to be mined and making the token more scarce. Investors are more concerned about storing their wealth in dollar assets like US government bonds than they were in the past, making bitcoin an attractive alternative to some investors. "Bitcoin is increasingly used to preserve wealth and ensure mobility," Campbell and Rosenberg said, pointing to spikes in on-chain activity during recent crises. Bitcoin's adoption by institutions has boosted its credibility and attracted more funds to the crypto, another major catalyst for bitcoin's price. Lower interest rates are generally bullish for risk assets, including crypto. The note points to several pro-crypto officials Trump has appointed during his term, as well as actions that support bitcoin's price, like banning a US central bank digital currency and the creation of a strategic bitcoin reserve. "The removal of regulatory overhang could unlock significant capital and reinforce Bitcoin's positioning as a strategic reserve asset," Campbell said. Bitcoin is up 15% this year, beating the S&P 500's 5% year-to-date gain.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bank of Korea has put its central bank digital currency (CBDC) pilot on hold, as political and market support grows for private-sector stablecoins pegged to the Korean won. Seven banks joined the CBDC pilot's first phase, which ran from April to June and involved 100,000 users making test payments at participating merchants, including 7-Eleven. The second round, which was set to begin later this year and expand to remittances and more merchants, has now been postponed. Officials from several participating banks told local media the project was proving costly and lacked a clear path to real-world use. The delay coincides with a broader shift in South Korea's digital asset policy under newly elected President Lee Jae-myung, who campaigned on legalizing and promoting won-based stablecoins. His ruling Democratic Party submitted a bill this month that would allow companies with at least 500 million KRW (around $370,000) in equity to issue their own stablecoins. According to Yonhap News and The Chosun Daily, the Bank of Korea is waiting to see how this legislation plays out before moving forward with further CBDC tests. Banks seem to prefer the stablecoin route, which could offer clearer monetization opportunities. Retail investors are also betting on crypto's continued growth. A recent survey by Hana Financial found that 27% of South Koreans aged 20 to 59 already hold digital assets, and 70% of them plan to increase their exposure over the next year. Interest in stablecoins isn't staying within Korean borders either. Following its IPO, U.S.-based Circle — the company behind USDC — became the most purchased overseas stock by Korean investors, who have collectively funneled $443 million into it. Locally, KakaoPay's stock has surged 134% in the past month on optimism over friendly crypto policy.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Bank of Korea is reportedly suspending its digital currency program amid increased stablecoin enthusiasm. The central bank (BOK) has paused preparations for the next phase of its digital won program, Bloomberg News reported Monday (June 30), citing comments from a bank official. Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a bill creating a regulatory framework for dollar-backed stablecoins, while Hong Kong and Taiwan are the jurisdictions in Asia exploring rules for stablecoins. The Bloomberg report points out that at a recent an international conference hosted by the BOK, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller argued that stablecoins create an opportunity for nonbanks to enter the payments sector, creating competition for banks that could lower costs. The report comes days after a BOK official called for won-pegged stablecoins to be rolled out gradually, starting with strictly regulated commercial banks. “It is desirable to first allow banks, which are under a high level of regulations, to issue (won-based stablecoins) and gradually expand to the non-bank sector with the experience,” said Ryoo Sang-dai, the BOK's senior deputy governor, whose comments at a press conference were reported by Reuters. At the same time, not every banking institution is totally on board with stablecoins, as covered here last week. For example, the newly published Bank for International Settlements Annual Economic Report 2025 includes a chapter which argues that stablecoins “perform poorly” as a form of sound money. “The document argued that most stablecoins fail critical criteria for a currency, such as price stability, universal acceptability and trust. It also pointed to the fact that stablecoins are frequently exploited by criminals and lack the elasticity of credit that underpins modern financial systems,” PYMNTS wrote. We're always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Digital brokerage Robinhood (HOOD) is extending its crypto footprint with a slate of new offerings, including developing its own blockchain network based on Arbitrum ARB$0.3467 and launching tokenized stocks trading, the company announced on Monday. The firm today has debuted its stock token offering, issued on the Ethereum layer-2 Arbitrum, for European users, giving access to over 200 U.S. equities and ETFs witt around-the-clock trading during weekdays. The firm also confirmed it's building its own layer-2 blockchain network optimized for tokenized assets. The company announced it's opening access to private equity tokens, starting with tokenized shares in OpenAI and SpaceX. "We will continue to work with regulators and bring the entire Robinhood ecosystem on-chain," chairman and CEO Vlad Tenev, said during the launch event in Cannes, France. HOOD shares, traded on Nasdaq, rallied to a fresh record high of $91, advancing over 8% during the Monday session. Robinhood's push into tokenized assets comes as competition with digital asset exchanges is heating up to offer a unified trading hub for all kinds of financial instruments. Asset tokenization is a read-hot sector that aims to bring real-world assets including equities, funds, real estate onto blockchain rails promising cheaper, faster and more efficient settlements and around-the-clock trading. While rivals have teamed up with regulated asset tokenization specialists to offer stock tokens, Robinhood is building its own tokenization engine to do so, Seong Lee, head of crypto products, told CoinDesk in an interview. As part of the firm's crypt push, Robinhood is rolling out perpetual futures, a popular derivative instrument among crypto traders, for European users. Trades are routed through Bitstamp, one of the world's longest-running active crypto exchange which Robinhood acquired for $200 million. The firm has also introduced crypto staking for U.S.-based investors starting with Ethereum's ether ETH$2,478.95 and Solana's SOL SOL$157.03 that lets token holders earn rewards without leaving the application. UPDATE (June 30, 15:45 UTC): Adds Robinhood introducing private equity tokens of OpenAI, SpaceX. Krisztian Sandor is a U.S. markets reporter focusing on stablecoins, tokenization, real-world assets.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The online brokerage Robinhood is doubling down on its crypto ambitions. Dubbed Robinhood Stock Tokens, the assets—basically shares of popular companies in a crypto wrapper—will have zero commission fees, and holders will receive dividend payments within the brokerage's app. Customers will have access to stock tokens representing more than 200 different companies and be able to trade them 24 hours a day, five days a week. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood chairman and CEO, said during an event on Monday those tokens even include privately traded companies like OpenAI and SpaceX. The user experience is designed to be as easy for non-crypto traders as possible, said Steven Goldfeder, cofounder and CEO of Offchain Labs, a key Arbitrum developer. “For many European users that don't want to engage with crypto for whatever reason, they don't even have to know or care that it is crypto underneath,” he added. Robinhood didn't specify when it would launch its new blockchain, but it said the new chain plans to support trading 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Robinhood's tokenized stock offering and planned blockchain comes as part of a broader push by the firm to expand its crypto products offering under a newly friendly regulatory regime in Washington, D.C. After President Donald Trump, who's called himself a “pro-crypto president,” won reelection in November, Robinhood reinstated many of the cryptocurrencies, including Solana and XRP, that it had delisted from its platform. Once Trump assumed office in January, his administration issued a series of pro-crypto executive orders. In May, Robinhood made inroads into Canada when it acquired the Toronto-based WonderFi for nearly $180 million. And, in June, the publicly traded company based in Menlo Park, Calif., closed its $200 million acquisition of the crypto exchange Bitstamp after a year of regulatory review. And the online trading app said it will let U.S. customers stake cryptocurrencies—when crypto holders put their digital assets in escrow to support the security of a blockchain. Users will first be able to stake Ethereum and Solana.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>As legislative interest grows around stablecoins, banks appear to be pivoting their priorities. On June 26, the Bank of Korea notified participating financial institutions that it would suspend discussions and preparations for the second phase of its CBDC pilot, known as Project Han River. Despite progress, banks demanded a clearer roadmap for rollout and questioned the feasibility of further participation without stronger guarantees. Read More: Over 10M Koreans Bet on Crypto: 70% Eye Bigger Investments Amid Retirement Fears On average, each bank invested approximately 5 billion KRW ($3.75 million) into infrastructure and compliance systems for the first round of testing. Combined, the institutions are estimated to have spent nearly 35 billion KRW ($260 million). One banking executive remarked, “The CBDC, stablecoins, and deposit tokens aren't well-differentiated. With stablecoin regulation underway, there's too much uncertainty to continue investing without knowing the end game.” Lawmakers are currently drafting a bill to permit issuance of won-pegged stablecoins, which could be issued by either banks or fintech firms. “They want to wait until there's clarity on the stablecoin law before continuing,” one participant confirmed. Notably, the organizational structure of BOK's CBDC division is also changing. As CBDC development stalls, banks are accelerating efforts to develop and issue their own stablecoins, sometimes in cooperation with blockchain firms. Several banks are exploring joint ventures and consortia that would issue digital tokens pegged to the Korean won. BOK had previously asserted that its “deposit token” model was essentially equivalent to a stablecoin under government oversight. However, with the CBDC initiative delayed, banks are now pursuing parallel paths. Read More: South Korea Eyes Opening Crypto Market to Foreign Investors Amid AML Challenges Stocks tied to stablecoin and digital payment technology plunged as news of the suspension emerged. Stocks related to other stablecoins like ME2ON and Dozn also experienced sharp declines. Crypto analysts point out that although both CBDCs and stablecoins have similar transactional use cases, they are fundamentally very different in structure. As the competition for stablecoin regulation intensifies, South Korea's move can serve as an illustration for other countries considering the development of CBDC vs. private sector alternatives. But with no binding commercial plan or guarantee of funding, enthusiasm has cooled. Isabella specializes in tracking how blockchain technology is transforming industries worldwide.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Today's top-performing coins integrate next-generation development tools, efficient consensus mechanisms, and vast scalability potential. These three attributes, technology, speed, and growth potential, are setting apart a few cryptocurrencies currently gaining serious traction. For instance, Qubetics introduces a developer-first approach driven by its AI-integrated IDE. This article unpacks why these three are great choices for anyone analyzing the best crypto coins to invest in now. With 2025's focus on high-tech features more than mere crypto noise, these tokens can be worthwhile candidates. Qubetics is attracting widespread attention for one key reason: it simplifies blockchain development to the point where anyone, regardless of coding experience, can build on it. Central to this transformation is QubeQode, the project's powerful Integrated Development Environment (IDE). QubeQode reimagines smart contract creation through a drag-and-drop user interface designed for accessibility without compromising technical capabilities. This model allows development teams to scale more efficiently while expanding accessibility for those without traditional coding backgrounds. QubeQode includes AI-driven features that auto-generate optimized code snippets, identify vulnerabilities in smart contract logic, and suggest efficiency improvements. This use of AI in blockchain development not only boosts productivity but also enhances code quality and security. This multi-layered approach makes Qubetics highly versatile among the best crypto coins to invest in now. With a fixed token price of $0.3370, more than $18.1 million has already been raised. Over 516 million $TICS tokens have been sold, with the number of unique holders surpassing 28,300. What's noteworthy is that fewer than 9 million $TICS tokens remain at this stage. The presale wraps up just three hours earlier at 8:00 AM UTC. This isn't just a listing; it's a pivotal leap from presale hype to real-world trading, hinting at broader liquidity, stronger exchange visibility, and enhanced enterprise traction. Market analysts have modeled additional growth scenarios based on network utility post-mainnet launch. While not guarantees, these forecasts present realistic possibilities given market trends. It eliminates complexity without sacrificing capability, and its AI integration redefines what blockchain development workflows can look like in the future. Ripple is well known for transforming how money moves across borders. It enables near-instant global payments by connecting financial institutions through its proprietary blockchain protocol. Unlike traditional remittance systems, which rely on intermediaries and often take days to settle, Ripple transactions finalize in seconds with minimal fees. The technology underpinning Ripple has proven resilient, scaling efficiently even under high-volume traffic. Its consensus protocol avoids energy-intensive mining while still maintaining decentralization through trusted validators. This structure allows the network to process over 1,500 transactions per second, outperforming legacy systems and many Layer 1 chains. Its proven track record, technical scalability, and regulatory alignment make it one of the best crypto coins to invest in now. Through its partnership with USDD and a growing network of decentralized finance protocols, Tron is becoming a stable and liquid foundation for value transfer across jurisdictions. This dual utility, serving both high-frequency dApp activity and stablecoin settlement, gives Tron a unique place in the crypto stack. The market is saturated with tokens promising innovation, but few deliver across all metrics: developer accessibility, technical performance, and real-world use cases. Ripple connects institutional finance to decentralized systems with speed and precision. Tron scales with ease, supporting millions of users daily and growing use in stablecoin settlements. They embody what the best crypto coins to invest in now truly represent: long-term utility built on technological excellence. Qubetics is a blockchain platform featuring QubeQode, an AI-integrated drag-and-drop development environment that simplifies smart contract creation and dApp deployment. Early-stage blockchain projects carry risks such as price volatility, smart contract bugs, and regulatory uncertainty. Ripple uses a unique consensus protocol that relies on trusted validators rather than mining, enabling fast, low-cost transactions while maintaining decentralization. This guide highlights three standout cryptocurrencies (Qubetics, Ripple, and Tron) as some of the best crypto coins to invest in now, thanks to their advanced technology, speed, and growth potential. Qubetics revolutionizes blockchain development with its AI-powered drag-and-drop IDE, QubeQode, making smart contract creation accessible and efficient. Ripple excels in institutional finance by enabling near-instant, low-cost cross-border payments with its scalable consensus protocol. Tron focuses on high-speed transactions and supports millions of daily users with its delegated proof-of-stake mechanism, fostering a growing ecosystem of decentralized apps and stablecoin use.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The idea is that by avoiding the volatility that crypto is often known for, stablecoins can work better as a form of internet-based currency. They offer the potential for faster and cheaper money transfers, especially across borders, though come with their own risks. One of the biggest concerns so far is that without regulation, it's been hard to know if stablecoin issuers like Tether International and Circle Internet Financial actually hold the collateral they claim. Regulators in Canada, however, still treat stablecoins like other forms of crypto: as a security. That means it's considered an investment, rather than a form of payment. “We're keen for Canada to also embrace some frameworks and definitions around stablecoins,” said Matheson. “A lot of the advocacy work in Canada has been focused on our federal government, our new Minister of Finance (François-Philippe) Champagne, to help his office understand the opportunity to embrace crypto.” Tether, the largest U.S.-dollar backed stablecoin, has seen the market capitalization of its token go from under US$10 billion in 2020 to almost US$160 billion. For merchants, the option offers potential savings on fees linked to other forms of payments like credit cards, though for consumers the benefits aren't so clear. While it's still not clear what consumer appetite is for stablecoins, they're already proving to be very popular with criminals. Research firm Chainalysis figures that there was some US$51 billion of stablecoins received by illicit cryptocurrency addresses last year, and that they accounted for 63 per cent of all illicit crypto flows. And while criminal flows are a problem now, there is also growing concerns about the implications of stablecoins becoming a bigger segment of the financial industry. The Bank for International Settlements, a central bank-backed global institution tasked with helping maintain financial stability, put out a warning just last week. “If stablecoins continue to grow, they could pose financial stability risks,” said BIS in a report. The monetary system can transform into a next-generation system built on tried and tested foundations ... or society can relearn the historical lessons about the limitations of unsound money, with real societal costs, by taking a detour involving private digital currencies.” There's also a concern of stablecoins trying to act more like banks by offering interest on holdings, and the potential stability risks that come with that. The U.S. law actually prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying interest, in part because of such concerns, but Matheson wants to see Canada to drop its own ban. “Currently that is not a permitted activity in Canada, providing yield on stablecoins, but it's something certainly our industry is advocating for with our regulators.” But Matheson said modernizing rules around crypto is the answer. "Regulatory clarity will trump all other temporary behaviour or experimentation that we're seeing in the market.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>It seems like meme coins are making a comeback, and one Solana-based token is leading the way. At the same time, a new Solana meme coin called Snorter (SNORT) is gaining traction in its ICO, already raising over $1.2 million from early backers. PENGU has had a great week, now trading around the $0.015 level. In the last day alone, it jumped another 13%, leaving other Solana meme coins like Dogwifhat in the dust on both price and trading volume. A few factors are driving up demand for this penguin-themed token. If approved, this fund would hold PENGU tokens and Pudgy Penguins NFTs, which is a huge sign of potential institutional interest. Plus, on-chain data shows that big money is moving in. For the technical traders, PENGU also broke out of a falling wedge pattern on Friday and is now trading above its 50-day EMA. The total market cap for meme coins has climbed back above $54 billion, and daily spot trading volumes have increased by 32% since yesterday. This optimism seems tied to the broader market finding its footing again. Bitcoin pushed past $107,000 yesterday, partly due to some unexpected news from the White House. An order for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to look into crypto-based federal housing loans is seen as a huge deal. With all this activity, smaller Solana-based meme coin projects, such as Snorter, are seeing an uptick in demand. Snorter has now raised over $1.2 million in its ICO, with SNORT tokens currently available for just $0.0967 each. Most of the hype is because it's pairing degen fun with an actual product. Snorter's team is building a trading bot inside Telegram designed to give meme coin traders an edge. Th bot uses Solana's speed for near-instant trades, automated sniping of new token launches, copy trading, and even scam detection. With the crypto bot market already worth $41 billion, it's a clever move. Snorter has even been featured on popular ranking sites like CoinSniper. And none of this early hype comes at the expense of security, since Coinsult and SolidProof have audited the SNORT token, finding no vulnerabilities.

BitMine Immersion continues to enhance its asset-light and mining business by increasing its existing treasury holdings by over 16x. LAS VEGAS, June 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- (NYSE AMERICAN: BMNR) ("BitMine" or the "Company") today announced the pricing and signing of a private placement for the purchase and sale of 55,555,556 shares of common stock (or common stock equivalents in lieu thereof) at a price of $4.50 per share for expected aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $250 million before deducting placement agent fees and other offering expenses (funded in a combination of cash and cryptocurrencies) to implement an Ethereum treasury strategy. The transaction was led by MOZAYYX with participation from a high quality group of investors including Founders Fund, Pantera, FalconX, Republic Digital, Kraken, Galaxy Digital, DCG, Diametric Capital, Occam Crest Management, and Thomas Lee. ETH will serve as the Company's primary treasury reserve asset. Thomas Lee, newly appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors, said, "This transaction includes the highest quality investors across trad-fi and crypto venture capital, properly reflecting the rapid and continued convergence of traditional financial services and crypto." By having a direct ETH treasury position, the Company has access to native protocol-level activities, such as staking and decentralized finance mechanisms, on the Ethereum network. Thomas Lee, Chairman of BitMine, states, "Stablecoins have proven to be the 'chatGPT' of crypto, leading to rapid adoption by consumers, merchants and financial services providers. Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent, recently stated the stablecoin market could reasonably  reach $2 trillion (Bloomberg) compared to the current $250 billion (per defillama.com). Ethereum is the blockchain where the majority of stablecoin payments are transacted (according to Block.co) and thus, ETH should benefit from this growth. One of the key performance metrics (KPI) for BitMine going forward is to increase the value of ETH held per share. Jonathan Bates, CEO of BitMine, said, "The private placement will accelerate BitMine's treasury holdings shortly after its first treasury purchase on June 9, 2025. FalconX, Kraken, and Galaxy Digital plan to partner with the Company to grow a world class Ethereum treasury strategy alongside existing custody partners, BitGo and Fidelity Digital." Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. acted as advisor to the lead investor, MOZAYYX. Winston & Strawn LLP acted as counsel to the lead investor, MOZAYYX. FitzGerald Kreditor Bolduc Risbrough LLP acted as counsel to the Company. Greenberg Traurig, LLP acted as counsel to the placement agent.
