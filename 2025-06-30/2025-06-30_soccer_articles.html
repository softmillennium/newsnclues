                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Half-time breaks should be extended to 20 minutes in extreme heat, the global players' union has said. According to Fifpro's medical director, Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, an extended half-time break would provide a necessary additional tool in helping to keep players' core temperatures within their normal range. “A cooling break generally lasts three minutes and they are designed to decrease the [player's] temperature through the use of ice,” he said. A half-time of 15 minutes might not be enough to decrease the core temperature. So a lot of research is being done into alternative mitigation strategies and it could be that a half-time of 20 minutes is significant. It has been shown [to work] in the laboratory. “We are partially happy because Fifa have been quite responsive once the tournament was under way,” Phillips said. “Obviously, it would have been better if that had happened in advance, but it's better that they have adapted and they've put in place various different mitigation measures. So there has been a positive reaction from Fifa, which is good. It's any competition organiser staging tournaments in this kind of heat. Their protocols [need to] reflect more of the good practice in Australia, US and other countries that deal with this week after week in their national leagues.” Philips also warned that European football would have to get used to hot weather dictating that international tournaments are played in the winter. Alexander Bielefeld, Fifpro's director of policy and strategic relations, said: “I think the scheduling discussion is an important one for the years to come. And it might not just relate to, let's say, off-season breaks of the players but also to other issues that relate to player welfare or safe attendance by spectators, or the performance on the pitch.”</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Football's global players union has urged FIFA to abandon plans for midday and afternoon kick-offs to avoid the heat in three “extremely high risk” venues at next summer's World Cup. A report by FIFPRO, which represents more than 70,000 professional players worldwide, identified Kansas City and Miami, along with Monterrey in Mexico, as cities that carried “extremely high risk” of heat-stress injury if World Cup matches are played in the afternoon. Another five World Cup host cities were cited as “very high risk” (Boston, Philadelphia and Guadalajara) or “high risk” (Los Angeles and New York/New Jersey). Only San Francisco and Vancouver were classed as “low risk”. Weather conditions have disrupted this summer's Club World Cup in the U.S., with FIFPRO saying that the matches between Chelsea and Esperance de Tunis, and Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid, should not have been allowed to kick off in such extreme heat in Los Angeles at midday local time. FIFPRO has made representations to FIFA about kick-off times, but the union's leadership fears “commercial interests” — driven by a pressure to satisfy a huge global TV audience, particularly in Europe and Asia — will hold sway in some cases. Professor Dr Vincent Gouttebarge, FIFPRO's medical director, told reporters on a Zoom call on Monday: “From our research, a couple of cities and some matches on the ongoing Club World Cup can be labelled as having a higher risk for heat-related illness, or, in the worst case, extreme high risk for heat related illness. “There are certain areas in a country that will be more at risk. So think about match destinations such as Orlando or Miami, for example, where you can see over a period of years that there's a higher risk attached to these venues and destinations. “The question is, if we look at match scheduling and match planning ahead of the tournament, if we actually need midday kick-off times in these locations or in these high-risk areas — if we should probably move towards late kick-off times as a preferences for these venues.” FIFPRO general secretary Alex Phillips said some of its recommendations for the Club World Cup had been taken on board by FIFA, but others — including around kick-off times — had been rejected. Obviously it would have been if that had happened in advance, but it's better than they have adapted and they've put in place various different mitigation measures. There's additional water around the pitch, towels and so on.” He also proposed shorter but more frequent in-game cooling breaks, suggesting that the three-minute break used at the Club World Cup (generally at 30 and 75 minutes) are less beneficial.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Chelsea are just three games away from winning the Club World Cup and adding more silverware to their impressive first under Enzo Maresca. Maresca has admitted he has needed to rotate his players in the United States, with extreme weather conditions playing a part in the tournament. Chelsea's 4-1 win over Benfica in the Round of 16 was overshadowed by a two-hour delay to proceedings due to thunder and lightning. Cole Palmer was bemused at the situation, just like many other players were. When they came back they were forced to go through extra time, where goals from Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall put the game beyond doubt. His displays at the Club World Cup have left it hard to disagree with him. In fact, according to WhoScored, Neto has been the best performing player in the competition so far. He will be looking to keep his excellent goalscoring record up when the Blues take on Palmeiras in the early hours of Saturday morning. Both are going to be expecting minutes when they arrive at Stamford Bridge, putting pressure on those already at the club to perform. However, Neto's performances are showing to Maresca that he should be one of the shoo-ins for a role, as the Italian faces a nice headache next season.</p>

The FIFA Club World Cup has assumed the form that “most always assumed it would eventually take: that of a summer Champions League, played out in higher temperatures and emptier stadiums with stranger kick-off times and a smaller, but still entirely familiar, European cast,” according to Liam Twomey of THE ATHLETIC. There is “hope” that revenue from Club World Cup participation can “help clubs like Flamengo keep their best players for a little longer,” though many of the European clubs taking them away are “also getting richer in the United States this summer.” Twomey: “More likely is that this new competition, which some hoped might disrupt football's established order, simply ends up reinforcing it” (THE ATHLETIC, 6/29).

BROAD PLAN: THE ATHLETIC's Adam Crafton wrote for “bums on seats, and dollars in the bank,” Miami's “backdoor route” was “probably a sound analysis of the broader American market, which is often entranced by moments and characters.” And if the Club World Cup was to “stand a chance of take-off -- particularly after many false starts” -- Inter Miami F Lionel Messi's involvement represented FIFA President Gianni Infantino “taking a shot in the last-chance saloon.” Messi became the “face of the tournament,” building on his existing relationships with Adidas and InBev (who are also FIFA sponsors) to promote the competition, while FIFA's “marketing blitz on social media and on highway billboards placed Messi front and centre” (THE ATHLETIC, 6/29).

NOT ENOUGH FIREPOWER: ESPN.com's Lizzy Becherano wrote “not even Lionel Messi could bridge the talent deficit between MLS' biggest glamour club and Europe's elite.” Before leaving as Inter coach, Gerardo “Tata” Martino “voiced concerns” over MLS's roster restrictions, “warning that the strict rules work only to hinder the teams on an international setting.” Prior to the inaugural Club World Cup match, Martino's successor, Javier Mascherano, “complained about the club's lack of transfer business ahead of the competition.” The league's “inflexible system and the tight transfer window provided to teams by FIFA left Inter Miami at a disadvantage.” The MLS roster system and designated player structure “give way for squads to often seem imbalanced.” Becherano: “The MLS setup might work against other teams within the league, but the game against PSG once again exposed the divide between European and American soccer” (ESPN.com, 6/29). Messi said that Inter Miami had “left a good image” at the Club World Cup (ESPN.com, 6/29).

ROOM TO GROW: In San Diego, Tom Krasovic wrote “don't be too hard on MLS and America's soccer dreamers, however.” MLS is “still an infant by world soccer standards” with only 30 years of existence. Krasovic: “It's unfair to expect any MLS team to consistently match the football quality of Europe's better clubs.” MLS can “still produce entertaining soccer.” It “ought to be able to create a successful niche -- if its leaders sharpen their games.” The league “still can carve out a fruitful place on the global scene.” Krasovic: “MLS must make sure its economic model continues to allow for spendy approaches like Miami's. But the wrong conclusion would be for MLS to decide that jacking up its players' salaries will result in much better soccer. MLS should look to increase players' pay, but European leagues and the Saudi League will still live in a different financial stratosphere” (SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE, 6/29). </p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>What you need to know about Denver in 5 min The United States Women's National Soccer Team returned to Colorado this week — getting the same result: a victory. Over 18,500 fans turned out to watch Coach Emma Hayes lead her team to a 4-0 win over  Ireland 4-0 at DICK'S Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City on Thursday night — mirroring their 4-0 victory over South Korea at the stadium last year. “Definitely a new team in Denver would be really cool for a lot of people and it'll definitely draw a lot of attention,” said Trinity Bulger, a nine-year-old soccer player who was celebrating her birthday at the match with her family. He believes Colorado's strong soccer community will support the new women's club. “I think there's enough momentum here among women's sports and soccer specifically,” Bulger said. “There's a massive following, so I don't think it's going to be any problem filling that out on a regular basis.” It didn't take long for the Mile High City to buy in. More than 10,000 people have placed non-refundable deposits for season tickets. The Cherry Creek School District Board of Education unanimously approved a deal to build the team's headquarters and training facility in Centennial in March. The Denver City Council plans to spend up to $70 million to provide land for the permanent stadium and fund surrounding improvements at Sante Fe Yards, with the team kicking in tens of millions more. “We have a great partnership with the city,” Millet said. “We broke ground at our training facility in Centennial a few weeks ago. So, we're really excited about the investment this ownership group is making to support these female athletes, give them a purpose-built training facility stadium that really is going to meet their needs as professional athletes.” Megan Tate and her husband Will took their daughters, Ava and Olivia, to Thursday's match after missing out on the USWNT last year. They live near DICK's Sporting Goods Park and attend lots of Colorado Rapids matches, but they're hoping the new club will be more family-friendly. “We would love to see games earlier so kids can go. I think, at 7 p.m., we go to a lot of Rapids games, but it's hard because the games are so late,” Tate said. “Prices for games are expensive and we want to see it more available and accessible to all people.” “At Dick's Sporting Goods Park, we have the stadium, but there's nothing around it. And that's been kind of a frustration with people living in this community,” Tate said. And I'm sure it's going to make it so much more accessible to so many other people in the community.” Many fans showed up to the USWNT match wearing the jerseys of Colorado natives Heaps,  Sophie Wilson, and Mallory Swanson. She was one of several European-based players who were given a rest for the summer by Hayes. She currently plays for OL Lyonness of the Premier Ligue in France. “We talked a little bit about even if she finds it really difficult to rest, that there's seven types of rest. And for her the mental rest is important,” Hayes said. “I said to her, ‘This is important to be somebody's wife and someone's daughter and someone's sibling,'” Hayes said. “And then, we both started laughing because I said, 'You're also someone's dog owner, so embrace this time because it won't come again. The Wilsons also announced they're expecting their first child in March. Wilson's Triple Espresso mate Mallory Swanson is also expecting her first child with her husband, Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson. Despite their absences, Kyla Wallace proudly wore the jersey of her favorite player Wilson. A soccer player herself, she says it's an inspiration seeing three USWNT stars come from Colorado. “It's inspiring because people, even from not a huge soccer place, can still become stars,” said Wallace, who was with her mother Ashley, father Jonathan, and sister Aspen. That match featured a Colorado connection when Wilson set Swanson up for the opening goal in the 34th minute. Swanson finished with two goals and an assist. But the Colorado crowd accepted her as their own, she said, and she was more relaxed this time around. This year I felt really hydrated, which was good,” Hayes joked. “I think the atmosphere in this stadium is incredible. “I think it will be a fabulous place to come and play, especially with this crowd.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The US men's national team face upset-minded Guatemala in a 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup semifinal on Wednesday evening at St. Louis CITY SC's Energizer Park. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino's roster includes 15 MLS players. After topping Group D with three straight wins, the USMNT needed penalty kicks to advance past Costa Rica in the quarterfinals. Real Salt Lake midfielder Diego Luna and Columbus Crew fullback Max Arfsten both scored their first international goals in the 2-2 draw, then New York City FC goalkeeper Matt Freese made three saves during spot-kicks. Damion Downs deposited the winning PK to settle a 4-3 shootout scoreline. They're chasing the program's eighth Gold Cup title and first since 2021. Former Real Salt Lake striker Rubio Rubín headed home a second-half equalizer, cancelling out Jonathan David's first-half PK. José Morales scored the winning spot-kick and goalkeeper Kenderson Navarro impressed while filling in for the injured Nicholas Hagen (Columbus Crew). Los Chapines, whose squad includes D.C. United defender Aaron Herrera and CF Montréal attacker Olger Escobar, are in their first Gold Cup semifinal since 1996. They keep defying expectations as the No.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Herculez Gomez takes a look at what the USMNT still has to improve on after narrowly beating Costa Rica on penalties in the Gold Cup. MINNEAPOLIS -- As Mike Tyson once opined, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. But the United States men's national team went one better in its Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal matchup against Costa Rica. Players alternated between villain and hero, sometimes within a single half. You had Max Arfsten conceding a penalty, assisting on Diego Luna's equalizer and scoring his first international goal, only to get beat in the run-up to Costa Rica's second. There was Malik Tillman, who missed a first-half penalty, assisted on Arfsten's goal, converted his attempt in the shootout and took heaps of abuse -- both physical and verbal -- from Los Ticos all game long. Luna looked bright in a creative role, and the midfield of Tyler Adams, Sebastian Berhalter and Luca de la Torre showed promise. "OK, we [concede] a penalty, we get the penalty, we miss a penalty, and then the team keep going and keep believing in the way to play." The biggest hero of them all was Matt Freese. The goal he conceded against Haiti was on him. He probably could have done better in the run-up to Alonso Martínez's 71st-minute equalizer, when he gave up a juicy rebound from Carlos Mora. And when the penalty shootout beckoned, there was a sense that Costa Rica, with legendary keeper Keylor Navas in net, had the edge. After all, this is a man who during his college days at Harvard University did "a very long research project on penalty kicks." However, preparation will get a keeper only so far. The here and now in a shootout provides its own unique set of challenges, most of them psychological. Freese's save from Juan Vargas in the second round of spot kicks got the USMNT's nose in front, only for Berhalter to then sky his attempt over the bar. The miss required a mental reset for Freese, who then saved Francisco Calvo's attempt. "And then after the second save I did the same thing, kept telling myself, 'I want another.'" But Freese was ready again and denied Juan Rojas with the first kick in sudden death, leaving Downs to fire home the winner. "I don't know about being sure of yourself to win. Mauricio Pochettino believes his USMNT is starting to show its quality after the team advanced to the Gold Cup semifinals. Everything about this game -- and this tournament -- has yielded layers of experience that are priceless for a young group. It's still unclear how many players from this roster will be around to contribute when the 2026 FIFA World Cup begins in a little less than a year -- especially when all the stars are reintegrated -- but it's imperative that they be ready if their name is called, and passing these kinds of tests will provide them with the kind of foundation that can't be obtained anywhere else. It's encouraging to see this group survive, and in some cases thrive. "I think everyone in our team has that mentality, but there's going to be certain situations where you're tested, you know what I mean?" But it's when s--- gets hard [you find out] if you're going to step up to the plate. And tonight a lot of guys did that." This applies to Arfsten perhaps most of all. He said postmatch: "I mean football is ups and downs. But for me it was just all about trying to make my mark on this game and get my 'get-back,' as some would say. That said, there were plenty of other lessons to be learned from this match. They are the kinds of experiences that are easier to digest when you're winning, but could come back to bite the team later if they're not corrected. But the killer third goal never came, and as Costa Rica dug deep into its bench -- even as it was missing five players due to suspension or injury -- the match tilted in favor of Los Ticos. "I think you can put the game to bed, and I think that's an important moment that if you give some of these teams life, then they're going to be able to take it," Adams said. Semifinal opponent Guatemala, which survived a penalty shootout of its own to upset heavily favored Canada, has excelled at breathing life into games that appeared to be out of reach. The U.S. will need to be on its guard. But with every step, every triumph, and yes, even the mistakes, this USMNT is discovering a little bit more about itself. And it can deliver in the toughest of circumstances so that the team still comes out on top.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Manchester City return to Orlando's Camping World Stadium on Monday night to take on Saudi Pro League giants Al Hilal in the last-16 of the FIFA Club World Cup. It was a statement victory last time out for Pep Guardiola and his players as they brushed beyond Italy's Juventus courtesy of a 2-5 victory in Florida, securing themselves a first-placed finish in Group G. That status as group winners also ensured a more favourable route to a potential final for the Premier League giants, positioning themselves on the left-hand side of the tournament bracket and avoiding some of Europe's biggest club sides. From a team news perspective, Claudio Echeverri will remain sidelined as he continues his recovery from an ankle problem that could end his tournament as a whole, while Rico Lewis' three-match ban for a red card on matchday one will end after the clash with Al Hilal. FIFA have confirmed that Venezuela's Jesús Valenzuela has been appointed as the on-field match referee for Manchester City against Al Hilal at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, Florida this week. The Acarigua-born official has so far taken charge of two matches at this summer's FIFA Club World Cup in Porto's 4-4 draw with Ahly and Chelsea's 2-0 win over LAFC, issuing nine yellow cards across those contests and awarding one penalty kick. Accompanying Jesús Valenzuela at the Camping World Stadium on Monday night will be the appointed duo of Assistant Referees Jorge Urrego and Tulio Moreno, completing a team of Venezuelan officials on the pitch. Overseeing proceedings between Manchester City and Al Hilal from the positions in VAR will be Venezuelan referee Juan Soto as Video Assistant Referee, accompanied by Assistant Video Assistant Referee, Hamza El Fariq of Morocco. Standing between the Manchester City and Al Hilal dugouts headed by Pep Guardiola and Simone Inzaghi respectively will be Argentina's Yael Falcón as Fourth Official. The contest has also seen a reserve official appointed in the role of ‘Fifth Official', according to FIFA's appointment list, in Argentina's Maximiliano Del Yesso.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>MINNEAPOLIS (June 29, 2025) – The U.S. Men's National Team completed the comeback after trailing early and outlasted Costa Rica in an epic penalty kick shootout in the final quarterfinal match of this year's Concacaf Gold Cup. Goalkeeper Matt Freese saved three kicks for the United States, including one from Costa Rica's Francisco Calvo, who converted a penalty in regulation, to lead the United States to victory. The USMNT advances to the semifinal where it will face Guatemala on Wednesday, July 2 at Energizer Park in St. Louis. The United States entered Sunday's match at U.S. Bank Stadium as winners of Group D, going undefeated in the group stage with three wins over Trinidad and Tobago, Saudi Arabia and Haiti. In those three matches, the United States only conceded once. Los Ticos earned wins over Suriname and Dominican Republic, then played head coach Miguel Herrera's home country of Mexico to a scoreless draw. Mexico finished as the group-winner based on goal differential. Head coach Mauricio Pochettino made three changes to the starting XI that faced Haiti last weekend, inserting Max Arfsten, Sebastian Berhalter and Diego Luna. Seven starters were 25 years of age or younger, though everyone had seen Gold Cup action prior to Sunday's match. Defending his first penalty kick for the United States in his fourth straight start, Freese guessed correctly, diving to his left and getting a hand on the ball, but Calvo's hit had enough power to push past Freese and into the back of the net to give Costa Rica an early 1-0 lead. Despite falling behind for the first time in this year's tournament, the United States looked determined and created several exciting moments. De la Torre's accurate cross set up an acrobatic volley for Luna, but the shot sailed high. In the 31st minute, Costa Rica defender Juan Vargas took down Tillman with a dangerous foul near the endline. And the relentless pursuit paid off with a goal from Luna. The midfielder corralled Arfsten's cross with a controlled first touch and set up his left-footed shot beautifully. Arfsten closed in on the pass from Tillman and tucked it away with his right foot for his first international goal. The United States nearly scored again moments later. In a play that looked reminiscent of the USA's lone goal against Saudi Arabia, Sebastian Berhalter delivered excellent service into the box on a direct free kick. Defender Chris Richards' header was on frame, but Navas made the save to keep his team within striking distance. With about 20 minutes to play in regulation, Costa Rica equalized. Carlos Mora cut through two defenders and took a shot on goal. He slipped a short pass to Alonso Martínez who delivered from close range to tie the match at 2-2 in the 71st minute. Both teams saw near misses in the final moments of regulation. For Costa Rica, it was a right-footed strike from Martínez that clanged off the post. Tillman, who got close several times throughout the match, just missed for the U.S. with a terrific strike that travelled high. The match was tied 2-2 at the end of regulation and proceeded straight to a penalty kick shootout. Martínez opened with a controlled finish right down the middle. Freese saved the second attempt from Costa Rica's Juan Pablo Vargas, setting the tone that he was not to be underestimated. With the kicks all tied up going into the fifth round, Freese came up huge twice more. He read Calvo and didn't flinch from his spot in the middle, staying in position to punch the shot away. On Costa Rica's next attempt, he sprawled out to his right to deny Andy Rojas, making his third save of the shootout. CRC – FRANCISCO CALVO, 12th minute: Costa Rica was awarded a penalty kick after the U.S. was called for a foul inside the box. After taking a brief pause, Calvo struck the ball low with his right foot. CRC – ALONSO MARTÍNEZ (CARLOS MORA), 71st minute: Mora controlled his own rebound after his initial shot was saved by Freese and fed the ball to Alonso around the six-yard box. Max Arfsten finished the match with two goal contributions. He scored his first international goal in the 47th minute and recorded his third career assist on Luna's goal. Malik Tillman recorded his second career assist on Arfsten's goal. The starting XI averaged 21 caps and 11 in official competition. The lineup had an average age of 25 years, 235 days. The USMNT moves to 20W-17L-7D all-time against Costa Rica and is 8W-0L-1D against Los Ticos in the Concacaf Gold Cup. The USMNT is 6W-5L in 11 all-time penalty kick shootouts.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The U.S. men's national team defeated Costa Rica in a thrilling Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal that went to a penalty shootout at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday, June 29. The penalty shootout went to a sudden-death sixth round. After U.S. goalkeeper Matt Freese stopped Andy Rojas' attempt, Damion Downs — a 20-year-old making just his second USMNT appearance — put his attempt past Costa Rica's legendary shot-stopper Keylor Navas for the victory. Freese made three saves in the penalty shootout, and nearly made saves on two other attempts. In regulation, the game was a back-and-forth tussle. Costa Rica opened the scoring early on a penalty kick. Early in the second half, Max Arfsten scored his first USMNT goal before Costa Rica answered in the 71st minute with an equalizer that eventually forced the game to go to a penalty shootout. Mexico takes on Honduras — which upset Panama — in the other semifinal. USA TODAY Sports provided updates and highlights from Sunday's USMNT-Costa Rica quarterfinal at the Gold Cup. Costa Rica finally made the USMNT pay for letting its opponent hang around. U.S. goal keeper Matt Freese made a save on Carlos Mora's attempt, but the rebound returned to Mora who dished it to Alonso Martinez, who knotted up the score at 2-2 in the 71st minute. Now, Costa Rica has snagged the momentum in this spirited Gold Cup quarterfinal. There will be no extra time if the game is tied after regulation. Arfsten has rebounded nicely from his foul that led to a penalty, assisting on Diego Luna's equalizer and now scoring to put the USMNT into the lead. That pressure finally paid off in the 43rd minute when Diego Luna got his shot past Costa Rica's legendary goalkeeper Keylor Navas. A kerfuffle followed the play as emotions are running high at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. Costa Rica's Kenneth Vargas and U.S. defender Chris Richards were issued yellow cards for their involvement in the pushing and shoving. A yellow card was issued to Juan Pablo Vargas for his foul on Tillman. Getting a goal past Costa Rica's 38-year-old goalkeeper Keylor Navas — arguably still the best 'keeper in Concacaf — will be a challenge for the USMNT. A reckless challenge by USMNT defender Max Arfsten inside the 18-yard box on Kenneth Vargas resulted in a penalty shot goal by Costa Rica's Francisco Calvo in the 12th minute. The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup quarterfinal between the USMNT and Costa Rica is set to kick off at 7 p.m. ET, with the teams meeting at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. USMNT coach Mauricio Pochettino has gone more or less back to the group that navigated the first two Group D games comfortably, with one interesting wrinkle: Luca de la Torre and Sebastian Berhalter have been joined by Tyler Adams, hinting at a wide role for Malik Tillman. We'll see how it plays out, but right now it looks like a more combative, defensively sound 11 for the USMNT. Defenders (9): Max Arfsten (Columbus Crew), Alex Freeman (Orlando City SC), Nathan Harriel (Philadelphia Union), Mark McKenzie (Toulouse/France), Tim Ream (Charlotte FC), Chris Richards (Crystal Palace/England), Miles Robinson (FC Cincinnati), John Tolkin (Holstein Kiel/Germany), Walker Zimmerman (Nashville SC) Midfielders (9): Brenden Aaronson (Leeds United/England); Tyler Adams (Bournemouth/England), Sebastian Berhalter (Vancouver Whitecaps/Canada), Johnny Cardoso (Real Betis/Spain), Luca de la Torre (San Diego FC), Diego Luna (Real Salt Lake), Jack McGlynn (Houston Dynamo), Quinn Sullivan (Philadelphia Union), Malik Tillman (PSV Eindhoven/Netherlands) Whatever is wrong with the U.S. men's national soccer team, and pull up a chair because there's lots to discuss, diversity isn't it. In fact, researchers who've looked at both club and national teams across the world recently found diversity actually made squads better. Alex Freeman, a 20-year-old defender who plays professionally for Orlando City SC of Major League Soccer, is the son of former NFL wide receiver Antonio Freeman. Antonio Freeman spent eight of his nine NFL seasons with the Green Bay Packers, helping the team win Super Bowl XXXI. In that victory, Freeman had an 81-yard touchdown reception. Alex Freeman made his USMNT debut as a starter in the team's 2-1 defeat against Turkey on June 7.
