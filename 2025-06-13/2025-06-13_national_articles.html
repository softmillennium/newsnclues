                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel attacked Iran's capital early Friday in strikes that targeted the country's nuclear program and killed at least two top military officers. The new Israeli military operation against Iran is giving President Donald Trump a fresh test of his campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts. It lands as he's dealing with domestic turmoil: Opponents of his administration are set to rally in hundreds of cities on Saturday during the military parade in Washington to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, which coincides with Trump's birthday. A U.S. official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the conversation took place. It comes after protests erupted last week over immigration raids. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 who's overseeing the 4,700 troops deployed by President Trump, said the Marines finished training on civil disturbance and are starting their operations by replacing National Guard troops. The National Guard soldiers can then be assigned to protect more law enforcement agents on raids, Sherman said. Smoke rises after a missile attack in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, June 13, 2025. While the official didn't say how the U.S. provided assistance, both U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft and destroyer-based missile defenses have intercepted missiles in previous attacks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations. But she said in the Friday statement that violence will not be tolerated. “I strongly urge protestors to remain peaceful and calm as they exercise their First Amendment right to make their voices heard,” the Democratic governor said. Officials did not provide details on any specific aspects of Trump's talks with top aides in the White House Situation Room or how long it went. The five-member commission helps protect consumers from dangerous products by issuing recalls, suing errant companies and more. Government data this week revealed that Trump's tariffs have yet to cause a broader rise in inflation. Still, many companies have announced price hikes due to the tariffs.

The statement also didn't specify which law enforcement agencies are involved. ▶ Read more about what's going on at Delaney Hall A convoy of buses moves along Interstate Highway 10 after leaving the Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, Calif, Monday, June 9, 2025, near Redlands, Calif. (AP Photo/Gregory Bull) Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 who is overseeing the 4,700 troops deployed in Los Angeles, said Friday that 200 Marines have finished training on civil disturbance. Sherman said the Marines will take over operations at noon local time in downtown Los Angeles. He says they will be protecting federal property and personnel. There are currently no plans for him to appear before reporters. Kilmar Abrego Garcia‘s plea was the first chance the Maryland construction worker has had in a U.S. courtroom to answer the Trump administration's allegations against him since he was mistakenly deported in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. “There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,” his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said last week. U.S. attorneys have asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to keep Abrego Garcia in jail, describing him as a danger to the community and a flight risk. Most of the sprawling city has been spared as protests continue downtown, near City Hall and a federal detention center where some immigrants are being held. On the third night of an 8 p.m. curfew, Los Angeles police arrested several demonstrators who refused to leave a downtown street, and Homeland Security officers deployed flash bangs to disperse a crowd near the jail. Nine officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injuries. ▶ Read more about the crackdown and protests in Los Angeles “The deadline has come and gone and Mahmoud Khalil must be released immediately,” his lawyers said in a statement provided by the American Civil Liberties Union. “Anything further is an attempt to prolong his unconstitutional, arbitrary, and cruel detention.” Spokespeople for the Justice Department and Homeland Security didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Gavin Newsom's office expressed concern that the data will be used for immigration raids supported by the National Guard troops and Marines Trump deployed in Los Angeles. “This potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.” Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the data was shared legally, “to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.” An internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press show that Medicaid officials unsuccessfully sought to block the data transfer, citing legal and ethical concerns. The dataset includes people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that use only state taxpayer dollars. ▶ Read more about how DHS now has personal data of immigrant Medicaid enrollees Elon Musk's image has lost some of its luster with Republicans since the tech billionaire's messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds. Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog “very favorably” compared with April, according to the new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation — and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts — may have cost him.

(AP Photo/George Walker IV) Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a symbol of Trump's immigration crackdown, will stand before a Tennessee judge on Friday for a court hearing to determine whether he can be released from jail pending trial on human smuggling charges. His lawyers have called the charges filed last week “preposterous.” Before the hearing began in Nashville, Abrego Garcia's wife told a crowd outside a church that Thursday marked exactly three months since the Trump administration “abducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.” She said, “Kilmar wants you to have faith,” and that he wanted his supporters and family to know that “I will be victorious because God is with us.” “If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform Friday. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order directing Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California, and set an appellate hearing for Tuesday. Gavin Newsom had asked for an emergency intervention to stop troops from supporting immigration raids. ▶ Read more about California's legal challenge of Trump's military deployment in Los Angeles The U.S. president said Friday morning that “we know what's going on” when asked what sort of advance warning he got from Israel about its attack on Iran. It was, we know what's going on,” he told the Wall Street Journal. The United States is shifting ships and other military resources in the Middle East in response to Israel's strikes on Iran and a possible retaliatory attack by Tehran, two U.S. officials said Friday. The president is meeting with his National Security Council principals, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Friday morning to discuss the situation, one of the officials said.

(AP Photo/Olga Fedorova) Exactly what happened at the 1,000-bed Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility Thursday night remains unclear. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka expressed concern Friday “about reports of what has transpired at Delaney Hall this evening, ranging from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees.” The Democrat called for an end to the “chaos.” Protesters outside the detention center locked arms and pushed against barricades as vehicles passed through gates and inmates inside relayed word that their meals had been delayed. Amy Torres, executive director of New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said some officers sprayed pepper spray and tackled and dragged protesters away. Messages seeking comment were left with ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and local police. The Republican president's March 25 executive order sought to overhaul elections nationwide by compelling officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections, accepting only mailed ballots received by Election Day and conditioning federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The White House has defended the order as “standing up for free, fair and honest elections” and called proof of citizenship a “commonsense” requirement. Special envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to go to Oman this weekend for talks on Tehran's nuclear program, but it's not clear if the Iranians would participate, officials said. In an interview with ABC News on Friday morning, Trump said the Israeli attack on Iran was “excellent” and again previewed more attacks to come. “We gave them a chance and they didn't take it,” Trump told ABC's Jon Karl. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California after he deployed them there following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids. The ruling came only hours after a federal judge's order was to take effect at noon Friday. We'll answer a few each day during our live coverage. Just hours before Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, President Donald Trump was still holding onto tattered threads of hope that a long-simmering dispute over Tehran's nuclear program could be resolved without military action. But with the Israeli military operation called “Rising Lion” now underway — something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says will go on for “as many days as it takes” — Trump will be tested anew on his ability to make good on a campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts. ▶ Read more about the new test to Trump's agenda</p>

Columns of smoke rose Friday over Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz after Israeli strikes on the country. Israel attacked Iran's capital early Friday in strikes that targeted the country's nuclear program and killed at least two top military officers. In response, Iran fired more than 100 drones at Israel.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel launched blistering attacks on the heart of Iran's nuclear and military structure Friday, deploying warplanes and drones previously smuggled into the country to attack key facilities and kill top generals and scientists -- a barrage it said was necessary before its adversary got any closer to building an atomic weapon. Iran retaliated late Friday by unleashing scores of ballistic missiles on Israel, where explosions flared in the skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below. “We will not allow them to escape safely from this great crime they committed,” Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a recorded message in which he vowed revenge. A Tel Aviv area hospital said it was treating 15 injured civilians. U.S. ground-based air defense systems in the region are helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the measures. An explosion is seen during a missile attack in Tel Aviv, Israel, Friday, June 13, 2025. Israel had long threatened such a strike, and successive American administrations had sought to prevent it, fearing it would ignite a wider conflict across the Middle East and possibly be ineffective at destroying Iran's dispersed and hardened nuclear program. But a confluence of developments triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack — plus the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump — created the conditions that allowed Israel to finally follow through on its threats. On Thursday, Iran had been censured by the U.N.'s atomic watchdog for not complying with obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Friday afternoon at Iran's request. In a letter to the council, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the killing of its officials and scientists “state terrorism” and affirmed his country's right to self-defense. Its Mossad spy agency positioned explosive drones and precision weapons inside Iran ahead of time, and used them to target Iranian air defenses and missile launchers near Tehran, according to two security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity. It was not possible to independently confirm the officials' claims. Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. Israel said it struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, too, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. The official said Israel is prepared for an operation that could last up to two weeks, but that there was no firm timeline. Damage is seen in a building after an explosion in a residence compound after Israel attacked Iran's capital Tehran, Friday, June 13, 2025. Iran confirmed all three deaths, significant blows its governing theocracy that will complicate efforts to retaliate. Khamenei said other top military officials and scientists were also killed. In a video statement sent to journalists Friday, he said he ordered plans for the attack last November, soon after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon, one of Iran's strongest proxies. In its first response Friday, Iran fired more than 100 drones at Israel. Israel said the drones were being intercepted outside its airspace, and it was not immediately clear whether any got through. Israel's military said it called up reservists and began stationing troops throughout the country as it braced for further retaliation from Iran or Iranian proxy groups. “Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire,” he wrote. On Friday, the U.S. began shifting military resources in the region, including ships, as Israel prepared for more retaliation, two U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Officials in Washington had cautioned Israel against an attack earlier in the week, so as not to disrupt U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear enrichment program. Firefighters and people clean up the scene of an explosion at a residence compound after Israeli attacks in Tehran, Friday, June 13, 2025. Israeli leaders cast the attack as necessary to head off an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs, though it remains unclear how close the country is to achieving that or whether Iran had actually been planning a strike. Iran maintains its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only. Over the past year, Israel has been targeting Iran's air defenses, hitting a radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery in April 2024 and surface-to-air missile sites and missile manufacturing facilities in October. For Netanyahu, the operation distracts attention from Israel's ongoing and increasingly devastating war in Gaza, which is now over 20 months old. There is a broad consensus in the Israeli public that Iran is a major threat, and Israel's opposition leader, Yair Lapid, a staunch critic of Netanyahu, offered his “full support” for the mission against Iran. But if Iranian reprisals cause heavy Israeli casualties or major disruptions to daily life, public opinion could shift quickly. The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah issued a statement that offered condolences and condemned the attack, but did not threaten to join Iran in its retaliation. Khamenei, the Iranian Supreme Leader, said in a statement that Israel “opened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers.” Smoke rises after an explosion in Tehran, Iran, Friday, June 13, 2025. Israel attacked Iran's capital early Friday, with explosions booming across Tehran. Israel has long been determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a concern laid bare on Thursday when the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years censured Iran over its refusal to work with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site and install more advanced centrifuges. Iran would need months to assemble, test and field any weapon, which it so far has said it has no desire to do. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess Iran does not have a weapons program at this time. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took “unilateral action against Iran” and that it believed the strikes were necessary for its self-defense. The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was closely monitoring radiation levels.</p>

EXCLUSIVE: A senior lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives said the current conflict with Israel and Iran could be a singular opportunity for Iranians to overthrow their authoritarian Islamic government. "Now that their top leadership has been taken out, if there's ever a time for the people to rise up against this theocracy, I would think the conditions are set," Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital on Friday. Part of that trip was in Israel, where the congressional delegation met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others. "I think this is the perfect opportunity – it would have been better if, I don't know what level of coordination took place, but I mean, when an event like this happens – to have this theocracy that's in power, out of power, and liberate the people of Iran," McCaul said. There's a real opportunity for that to just end." Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman emeritus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, spoke with Fox News Digital about Israel's strikes on Iran. Israel unleashed a barrage of airstrikes in and around Tehran beginning Thursday night Eastern Time. "They were very close to a nuclear bomb," McCaul said. Israel said it hit Iranian nuclear sites, and that its strikes killed multiple senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran responded by launching missiles toward Israeli territory on Friday afternoon. McCaul said it was a "major setback" for Iran but that he was sure that officials in Tehran would respond. "When we were in the region, they felt certain that Iran would strike our military sites in Saudi, Jordan and the UAE," he said. "The big talk also at that time was, give CENTCOM time to get prepared in the region to get all of its strategic assets in place for a response. The Texas Republican also recalled what he now believes were telling signs that some kind of military operation was imminent. McCaul met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent weeks. While in Israel last month, McCaul said he asked Netanyahu about reports that Iran was preparing a nuclear strike. "He said that, ‘I will strike Iran with or without you.'" "I said, ‘Well, sir, we need you to coordinate with us. Indeed, President Donald Trump told Fox News Channel's chief political anchor Bret Baier on Thursday he had prior knowledge that Israel was going to conduct pre-emptive strikes on Iran. Firefighters and people clean up the scene of an explosion in Tehran, Iran, following Israeli airstrikes on Friday, June 13, 2025. Trump said the strike happened on Day 61 after Iran had a 60-day window to make a deal with the U.S. to contain its nuclear enrichment. But McCaul was not optimistic Tehran would agree to sufficient standards. It's not clear as of now whether those talks will resume. But if they were to fall through again, McCaul said, Iranians would have incentive to push for a new government "once and for all." Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has promised a "legitimate and powerful response" to Israel's strikes. Previous digital bylines seen at Daily Mail and CBS News.

EXCLUSIVE: More Americans support rather than oppose Israeli airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, according to a new national poll conducted before Israel's Friday attack on Iran. According to the poll, which was first shared with Fox News on Friday, 45% of those questioned said they would support Israel conducting targeted airstrikes against Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Iran fail. Thirty-seven percent said they opposed Israeli airstrikes, with 18% unsure. Smoke rises from a location allegedly targeted in Israel's wave of strikes on Tehran, Iran, on the early morning of June 13, 2025. But the poll indicates a partisan divide.

After throwing fireworks in the direction of law enforcement, protesters disperse when police respond by firing tear gas. LOS ANGELES – The U.S. Secret Service confirmed Thursday that it is "aware" of threatening "Kill Trump" graffiti messages spray-painted around the city of Los Angeles during this week's riots. A spokesman for the protective agency would not confirm whether an investigation is underway but did say that it knows of the violent messaging directed at both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. The messaging was seen in the city's downtown area amid civil unrest following Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests of criminal illegal immigrants. "Kill Trump," the other said, with "JD Vance" spray-painted below. Last weekend, clashes between rioters and police erupted in Paramount, California, after ICE conducted arrest operations targeting illegal immigrants with criminal records. The riots quickly spread to Los Angeles, where the Los Angeles Police Department faced down bad actors of their own. Protesters attempt to light a Molotov cocktail as a firework explodes during a protest in Compton, California, on Saturday, June 7, 2025 after federal immigration authorities conducted operations. Trump activated the California National Guard and U.S. Marines. He has been in a legal battle with Gov. Gavin Newsom over control of the National Guard. Other federal law enforcement agencies have also turned their attention to the city amid the tension. FBI Director Kash Patel warned those who commit violence against police, saying "if you assault a law enforcement officer, you're going to jail—period." Police officers stand amid tear gas during a protest against federal immigration sweeps in downtown Los Angeles on June 8, 2025. Hundreds have been arrested since the riots began last weekend. The Trump administration, which says it has arrested criminal illegal immigrants who have been convicted of murder, sex crimes against children and battery, is continuing its ICE operations. How much longer will Governor Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass continue to prioritize these criminal illegal aliens over their own citizens?" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on Wednesday. "Secretary Noem has a message to the LA rioters: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law and arrest criminal illegal aliens," McLaughlin added. Fox News' Alexandra Koch and Cameron Arcand contributed to this report.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>On the third night of an 8 p.m. curfew Thursday, Los Angeles police arrested several demonstrators who refused orders to leave a street downtown. Earlier, officers with the Department of Homeland Security deployed flash bangs to disperse a crowd that had gathered near the jail, sending protesters sprinting away. Protests over President Trump's stepped-up enforcement of immigration laws intensified after Trump called up the National Guard to the city. Protesters in Los Angeles are demanding an end to Trump's immigration crackdown, despite curfew and police response.

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., is pushed out of the room as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem holds a news conference regarding the recent protests in Los Angeles on Thursday, June 12, 2025. LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marines were seen standing guard outside a federal building in Los Angeles on Friday as they started operations after protests erupted last week over immigration raids. Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 who is overseeing the 4,700 troops deployed by President Donald Trump, said the Marines finished training on civil disturbance and are starting their operations by replacing National Guard troops. Guard soldiers can then be assigned to protect more law enforcement agents on raids, Sherman said. They wore combat gear and carried rifles as they mingled with the National Guard, who have been checking IDs of those entering the parking lot. Both Guard members and Marines were then seen loading boxes onto a military transport truck. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that had directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California, shortly after a federal judge had ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. Some 2,000 National Guard troops have been in the city since last week when immigration raids set off protests. Some have provided protection to immigration agents making arrests. Another 2,000 Guard members were notified of deployment earlier this week. The 200 Marines will be replacing soldiers protecting the federal building, which will allow more Guard members to be assigned to protecting federal agents on their operations, Sherman said. None of the military troops will be detaining anyone, he added. “I would like to emphasize that the soldiers will not participate in law enforcement activities. Rather, they'll be focused on protecting federal law enforcement personnel,” Sherman said. Roughly 500 National Guard members have been used to provide security on immigration raids after undergoing expanded instruction, legal training and rehearsals with the agents doing the enforcement before they go on those missions. It's unclear if the Marines will eventually provide security on raids. A total of 700 Marines have been trained to work in LA. The movement of Marines into LA comes as a curfew has been in place in downtown and protests have ended after a few hours with arrests this week largely for failure to disperse. The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Elsewhere, demonstrations have picked up across the U.S., emerging in more than a dozen major cities. Gavin Newsom has called the troop deployment a “serious breach of state sovereignty” and a power grab by Trump, and he has gone to court to stop it. Sherman said the U.S. Marine Corps is responsible for guarding U.S. embassies overseas so they are well-trained on how to defend a federal building. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has put 5,000 National Guard members on standby in cities where demonstrations are planned. In other Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they may deploy troops. A group of Democratic governors earlier signed a statement this week calling Trump's deployments “an alarming abuse of power.” In Los Angeles, troops work in shifts and the public is likely to only see a few hundred out, Sherman said. So far, the protests have been centered mostly in downtown near City Hall and a federal detention center where some immigrants are being held. Nine officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injuries.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from the US three months ago, has pleaded not guilty to federal human trafficking charges. Abrego Garcia is in court Friday morning wearing a red detention uniform. He faces counts of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain. Prosecutors allege he transported undocumented people in the US on more than 100 trips between Texas, Maryland and other states. Prosecutors allege that over several years, Abrego Garcia “operated in the illicit world of an international smuggling ring.” They argue the law shouldn't even prompt the court to consider detaining him and holding a hearing like Friday's, let alone decide he should stay behind bars awaiting trial. Related live story Cities brace for weekend protests over Trump's immigration crackdown “The Court cannot find that Mr. Abrego Garcia poses a serious risk of international flight simply because he's charged with a crime that the government finds distasteful,” his lawyers wrote to the Tennessee court this week. She said Kilmar urges anyone who, like him, remains in immigration custody to “have faith.” “He says to continue fighting and (we) will be victorious because God is with us,” she said. Vasquez Sura, who is a US citizen, also stressed that her family should have never been put in this situation. “Our son, Kilmar Jr., is right now at his kindergarten graduation,” she said through tears. “My son is alone on his big day … and I'm here fighting for my husband – for his Dad – to come back home.” Attorney General Pam Bondi held a news conference touting Abrego Garcia's indictment last week, calling an aspect of the conspiracy, where children allegedly were transported for profit, “disturbing.” The indictment also alleges he trafficked drugs and firearms. “These facts demonstrate Abrego Garcia is a danger to our community,” Bondi said. They also say children he is alleged to have transported aren't victims or at risk of harm because they were riding on the floorboard of his SUV, meaning some of the Justice Department's arguments to keep Abrego Garcia detained may not be enough for the judge to agree. In a separate federal court proceeding in Maryland, Abrego Garcia's attorneys are arguing for Trump administration officials to be sanctioned because of their handling of his deportation situation, and the lack of information they provided to his legal team following multiple court orders, while Abrego Garcia was in El Salvador this year.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Israel launched an unprecedented decapitation strike of head Iranian figures as part of its wider strikes against Iran, taking out the country's top nuclear scientists and military leaders. Beginning at around 3:30 a.m. Tehran time, Israel launched a series of strikes targeting Iranian missile sites, nuclear facilities, military command and control centers, and the apartments of military leaders and nuclear scientists. The three most powerful military commanders were killed. An Israeli security source told Fox News that over 20 sites, including apartments and offices, were hit in less than 15 minutes. Here are the major figures killed in Friday's decapitation strikes: Like most senior Iranian commanders, Salami made a name for himself during the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988. One day before his death on Friday, he said Iran was “fully ready for any scenarios, situations, and circumstances.” “The enemy thinks it can fight Iran the same way it fights defenceless Palestinians who are under an Israeli siege,” he said. Salami's death was confirmed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who appointed Major Gen. Mohammad Pakpour as his replacement. His brother, Hassan, reportedly founded the IRGC's military intelligence unit during the war and served with distinction as a division commander, ultimately being killed by Iraqi forces. Bagheri took over the branch in 1983 after his brother's death, according to Iranian media cited by Al Jazeera. Like most Iranian military figures, Mohammad Bagheri kept a secretive persona but was closely involved in IRGC operations. As head of the armed forces, Bagheri commanded 500,000 active personnel. He was tapped as responsible for Iran's ballistic missile strikes against Israel last year, and a 2019 drone and missile strike against Saudi oil facilities. “Hajizadeh publicly pledged allegiance to the idea of destroying Israel on multiple occasions in recent years and played a central role in formulating the plan to destroy Israel,” a statement from the IDF read. He was a major commander during the Iran-Iraq War. He was also known as a key diplomat and close adviser to Khameini. Shamkhani represented Iran in high-level China-brokered peace talks with Saudi Arabia, leading to the two re-establishing diplomatic ties after a long-running cold war. Most recently, he took part in nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration. Iranian state media confirmed the death of six nuclear scientists. Among them were Fereydoon Abbasi, former head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization; Mohammad Mahdi Tehranchi, president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran and a major figure in Iran's nuclear weapons program; Abdulhamid Minouchehr, head of nuclear engineering at Shahid Beheshti University; Ahmad Reza Zolfaghari, nuclear engineering professor at Shahid Beheshti University; Amirhossein Feqhi, a nuclear professor at the university; and a nuclear scientist who was identified only as Motallebzadeh, who was allegedly killed along with his wife. Abbasi had survived an assassination attempt in 2010, which killed fellow nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A federal appeals court on Friday denied President Donald Trump‘s bid to rehear his appeal of a jury's verdict that he was liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll and defaming her. Trump's lawyers further alleged that the judgment could set a dangerous precedent if allowed to stand. A concurring opinion filed by Judge Myrna Perez, and joined by Judges Eunice Lee, Beth Robinson, and Sarah Merriam, said there was “no manifest error by the district court” and that Trump's lawyers failed to show “the standard for en banc review” was met. “Simply relitigating a case is not an appropriate use of the en banc procedure. In those rare instances in which a case warrants our collective consideration, it is almost always because it involves a question of exceptional importance or a conflict between the panel's opinion and appellate precedent,” Perez said. “The dissenting opinion ignores this rule of restraint. It points to no exceptionally important issues, nocases that actually conflict with the panel's decision, and no persuasive justification for review of this case by the full Court,” Perez added. Judge Steven Menashi filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Judge Michael Park, expressing concern over the admission of character evidence in the trial against Trump. “The result was a jury verdict based on impermissible character evidence and few reliable facts. Trump also appealed a separate defamation ruling against him won by Carroll over the sexual assault claims, in which she won an additional $83.3 million in damages for a denial of the claim Trump made in 2019.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Iran's highest-ranking military officer, the head of its elite Revolutionary Guards Corps and its air force and a former national security chief have all been killed in Israel's unprecedented Operation Rising Lion. Their deaths will send shockwaves through the nation's military establishment and could seriously hamper the Islamic Republic's ability to respond to Israel's attacks. Here's what you need to know about them. As the head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major General Hossein Salami, was one of the most powerful men in Iran, overseeing its most potent military arm and reporting directly to its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Born in 1960, according to a US sanctions docket, Salami had headed the secretive and IRGC since 2019. The IRGC is also believed to provide materials and support to Yemen's Houthis, enabling the group to strike international shipping in the Red Sea and launch missiles and drones at Israel. Salami was at the helm of the IRGC when Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in April and October last year, in the first direct strikes by Iran on Israeli territory. The site was now manufacturing “new special missiles,” semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News reported. Salami was head of the IRGC when it shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet shortly after it took off from Tehran's international airport, killing all 176 people on board. An unnamed IRGC commander of the Tor M1 surface-to-air missile defense system that shot down the plane was sentenced to 13 years in prison, according to Iran's Mehr news outlet. CNN's security analyst Beth Sanner said that removing Salami is akin to taking out the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff: “You can imagine what Americans would do,” she said. Since 2016 Mohammad Bagheri had served as the chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, which IISS estimated could call on more than 500,000 active personnel. The General Staff is “the most senior military body in Iran, which implements policy and monitors and coordinates activities within the armed forces”, according to a US Treasury document laying out sanctions against Bagheri in 2019. Photos published by Iran's Tasnim news outlet showed him allegedly meeting with Iranian troops fighting on the ground alongside government forces in Syria in 2017. The next month Reuters reported that during the meeting the Saudi defense minister had delivered a warning to Bagheri: take President Donald Trump's offer to negotiate a nuclear agreement seriously because it presents a way to avoid the risk of war with Israel. Ali Shamkhani was a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and represented Tehran at talks which sealed a landmark agreement to restore diplomatic ties with foe Saudi Arabia. Iranian state TV network IRINN confirmed his death following Israel's unprecedented strikes on Friday. Shamkhani served as the country's top national security official for a decade from 2013, and before that served in a number of important roles, including in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the ministry of defense. Shamkhani represented Iran in China-brokered talks with Saudi officials that led to the two countries agreeing to re-establish diplomatic ties after years of hostility. The former national security chief was ambitious, experts say, and had an extensive portfolio. Some analysts suggested at the time that Khamenei may have thought him too ambitious. Still, he remained a close aide to the supreme leader, and gave advice as Iran re-entered nuclear talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump. In April, days before talks with the US, he warned Tehran could expel UN nuclear inspectors and cease cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if it feels under threat. Hajizadeh headed the country's missile program, which was involved in defending the country's air space and carrying out attacks overseas. The Israeli military said Hajizadeh was killed alongside other senior air force leaders in a strike as they gathered at an underground command center.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Kamala Harris's campaign thought it knew exactly how to beat Donald Trump. With just weeks left before Election Day, it warned over and over that he was “unhinged, unstable, and unchecked.” But instead of amplifying that message, Future Forward—the $900 million super PAC that the campaign was counting on for a flood of ads—had a different plan. O'Malley Dillon told her team that she had never seen anything else like this. Usually super PACs follow the lead of the candidates they support, while taking on less savory tasks, such as viciously attacking their opponents. But Future Forward had built a bigger internal research program than the campaign had, and its leaders saw only one clear path to victory. The Harris team liked Future Forward's economic ads, but they believed that Trump's approval ratings were dangerously high. There needed to be a sustained, direct attack on him. So Harris's team shifted strategy to do some of that themselves. “People might not mind ‘unhinged' if their fingers are caught in the door,” one Future Forward strategist started telling colleagues inside the organization. They did not believe that there was evidence in the voter data to justify a switch back to the politics of protecting democratic norms. Listen: A former Republican strategist on why Harris lost Campaigns and groups such as super PACs are not allowed to directly coordinate on many ad-spending decisions, but there are legal ways for them to signal their desires. Future Forward began quietly raising alarms in private polling memos that it knew the campaign would read. But the way I see it, the presidential campaign is a forest,” a top Harris-campaign adviser told us about their objections to Future Forward's approach. When Harris eventually lost, she did so with the backing of two different efforts that sometimes worked at cross-purposes, an error that both sides still believe may have cost Democrats the election. “We should have been one streamlined engine whose true mission was to elect Kamala Harris and defeat Donald Trump,” Rufus Gifford, a veteran Democratic fundraiser who worked for the Harris campaign, told us. But seven months after the loss to Trump, there has been little meaningful discussion of what happened between the fighting factions of the Democratic Party—although O'Malley Dillon and Chauncey McLean, a co-founder of Future Forward, did meet on Wednesday to talk through their post-election views. I'm not sure,” one major donor to the group told us. This story is based on interviews with more than 20 senior Democratic strategists, donors, or advisers who worked to defeat Trump last year, as well as a review of a trove of previously unreleased Future Forward testing and briefing documents obtained by The Atlantic. Many of the people we spoke with requested anonymity because they typically avoid public comment, were not authorized to speak, or are strategists who want to work for future campaigns. Defenders of Future Forward say the party needs to continue to replace its reliance on all-star campaign gurus and activist groups with cutting-edge data science that can precisely measure what voters want. They believe that Harris's campaign ultimately betrayed her candidacy by drifting away from the central economic narrative of the race—a choice between a Democrat who would make things better for working people and a Republican who would reward his rich friends. "It's pretty clear that there was one path for her, and we saw success there—we had to make it about what voters wanted, not what we thought they should care about,” one person involved in the Future Forward effort told us. Three weeks after the election, Future Forward leaders sent a private memo to their donors. They claimed that Future Forward's television ads had been about twice as successful at persuading people to support Harris as “other Dem” television spending, a category dominated by the Harris campaign. “Our execution,” they concluded, “proved more effective at moving the needle.” “There is an opportunity,” they told donors, “to fundamentally improve how Presidential campaigns work.” “I think our side was completely mismatched when it came to the ecosystem of Trump and his super PACs and ours,” O'Malley Dillon said on Pod Save America, the same day that Future Forward sent its memo. Harris senior adviser David Plouffe, appearing alongside O'Malley Dillon, was even more blunt about the GOP advantage: “I'm just sick and tired of it,” he declared. America's first political campaigns were self-financed by wealthy candidates like George Washington, who used their money to buy voter support with booze. Federal courts pushed back in 2010, over the objection of Democratic Party leaders. Under the new system, major-party presidential candidates need at least one outside operation with deep pockets in their corner, or else they place themselves at an enormous disadvantage. Candidates are barred from privately “coordinating” on some types of spending with these groups, but they can communicate in other ways: Their campaigns can signal their strategic desires by talking to reporters, who print their words, or by way of discreet posts on public websites. This typically involves placing trusted aides at the outside groups, as Trump did at the start of the 2024 campaign cycle with a group called MAGA Inc., or as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did with Priorities USA. Joe Biden decided to go a different direction in July 2023, when his advisers Anita Dunn and O'Malley Dillon gave interviews to The New York Times that strongly implied that Future Forward had received Biden's unofficial super-PAC “blessing.” A top Biden fundraiser, Katie Petrelius, joined the group to encourage donors. McLean and his team quickly incorporated the Times article into the March 2024 pitch deck they showed donors, a copy of which we obtained. But unlike MAGA Inc., Future Forward did not present itself as simply an extension of the Democratic campaign, with Biden himself, and later Harris, as its north star. Internal staff talking points—released just before Election Day and marked “not for distribution”—described the group's power as coming from its impact on the electorate, not from “being anointed or pre-determined” by a candidate. The group's mission had instead been set at its founding, after the 2018 cycle, when strategists who had met during Obama's 2012 reelection campaign concluded that they could bring a new level of mathematical precision to the art of voter influence and apply that wisdom to the spending of dozens of Democratic-aligned groups. During the 2024 campaign, the group granted more than $220 million to 73 organizations, including Emily's List and Somos Votantes, for advertising, issue advocacy, voter mobilization, and registration. Future Forward has never issued a press release, and with the exception of two summer Zoom briefings, where questions were screened, the leadership has mostly avoided larger group conversations about strategy with the other outside operations fighting to defeat Trump. Future Forward's approach infuriated many members of veteran Democratic voter-mobilization and persuasion groups, who felt sidelined from both donors and from the strategy conversation. “Resources were not allocated early enough, or to long-standing organizations that know their audiences,” Danielle Butterfield, the executive director of Priorities USA, told us. But Future Forward believed there was a superior way to run campaigns and allocate money. By March 2024, it was telling donors that it could produce “the absolute best ads that are proven to be effective across platforms” with a voter response rate “55% better than the average ad.” Over the course of 2024, Future Forward conducted hundreds of focus groups and collected more data on American voters than any other political effort in history, including more than 14 million voter surveys in the final 10 months before Election Day. The group created and tested more than 1,000 advertisements to support Harris's presidential bid from dozens of ad firms, using a randomized-controlled-trial method that compared the vote preference of people who had seen an ad against those who had not. The best-testing spots blanketed the airwaves in swing states starting in August and were used to purchase more than 3 billion digital-video ad impressions. Much of that money came from America's wealthiest Democratic supporters, such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. For context, $900 million is more money than the Democratic National Committee raised last cycle and nearly twice as much as Trump's own campaign collected. “Future Forward wasn't started by allies of one candidate or campaign,” the group's talking points declare. The Biden and Harris campaigns operated with a different model. They had a similar data operation, with horse-race polling, focus groups, and randomized-controlled trials of ads, but it was overlaid with a crew of veteran campaign strategists. Biden and one of his top advisers, Mike Donilon, believed from the start of his campaign that big themes about individual freedom, democracy, and Trump's character would shape the outcome. Concerned about Biden's relatively weak position in polling, the campaign launched an ad blitz in late 2023, aiming to reset voters' views of the president. Future Forward, which had long favored advertising close to Election Day, held back, even as MAGA Inc. began going on the air the next year. At the beginning of 2024, the group secretly commissioned 154 ads for Biden and tested them from February to April, according to another internal document. The results suggested that the single worst ad it tested echoed the threat-to-democracy themes that Biden's team had embraced—casting Trump as breaking from presidential norms, seeking revenge on his opponents, and threatening to put them in jail. Biden nevertheless launched ads in June that highlighted Trump's recent felony conviction and questions about his sanity. When the opposite happened, the Biden team made it clear through various channels that they still wanted Future Forward to start spending to shore up Biden's position. Those early ads shared common traits—a tour through Harris's biography, a focus on the economy, and a pitch that she was offering the country something different. “The data continues to point to the benefits of a mostly forward-looking and largely economic campaign,” Future Forward concluded in an August 9 messaging document. "We built a coherent story: This is an economic contrast; she's going to be better for your bottom line than he is,” a Future Forward strategist told us about the group's ads. Harris's advisers knew that economic concerns ranked highest for voters, but they decided that those issues would not be enough to defeat Trump. Harris's campaign believed that no one had set a clear negative frame for Trump. Over hours of internal debates, it came up with a new, triple-negative tagline: “unhinged, unstable, and unchecked.” Expecting that Future Forward would not shift course, it bought advertising to fill what it saw as the gaps left by the super PAC. Harris began to appear at events with Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming representative who was once Republican royalty, and new campaign ads featured former Trump advisers warning of his return to the White House. For Future Forward's number crunchers, the message switch was a disaster. “Make the argument about voters' lives,” declared an October 15 document posted on a website that campaign strategists could read. “Our task remains more about Harris than Trump.” By embracing Cheney and other conservatives, Harris was hewing to the unpopular status quo and defending institutional norms at a time when up-for-grabs voters wanted change. The document noted that ads focused “on Trump's fitness as disqualification alone, without tying to voter impact” were among their worst-testing. The document included polling results that found that 53 percent of voters nationwide said they preferred a “shock to the system,” compared with 37 percent who favored “a return to basic stability.” The differences in approach were so stark that, at one point, a data firm working with Future Forward worried that the campaign was using faulty data. For voters who did not speak English, the group ran ads in eight languages. At the core of these strategy disagreements was a debate over whether ad tests that focused on measuring vote-choice persuasion had limits. Some strategists argued that ads also had to build a sense of political and ethnic identity, and excite people to get more involved in politics or share messages on social media. Trump had proved himself a master of elevating relatively obscure issues—such as government-funded surgeries for transgender people—to change the entire political conversation. “There is an art and a science to persuasion,” Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, a co-founder of the Democratic donor group Way to Win, told us. “It requires striking an emotional chord with people that will stick, and that goes beyond what can be captured in randomized control trials alone.” Anat Shenker-Osorio, a Democratic data strategist who works with Way to Win and has criticized Future Forward's methods, argues that ad testing in online panels creates an artificial environment where people are forced to watch the tested spots. “That does not mirror conditions in real life,” she told us. A Future Forward spokesperson told us that this critique was misguided. “Data can't solve every problem, but it shows what voters really think, not what people who work in politics wish they thought,” the spokesperson said. Others complained that Future Forward's decision making on ads was too secretive. Ad firms got paid for production costs, and then submitted their spots to Future Forward for testing—and they received a commission of the spending, at a rate below industry standard, if their ad was chosen to run. Other ad makers received a larger share, and Future Forward said that it was not unusual for large campaigns to have strategists who work on ads. Since the election, Future Forward has continued to churn out voter-survey data with the aim of shaping how Democrats communicate with voters. The regular “Doppler” emails, which are sent privately to a select group of Democratic officials and strategists, test everything from the social-media posts of lawmakers to podcast appearances by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and excerpts of rallies featuring Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. In these messages, party leaders are still urged to “make criticism of Trump economic and personal,” avoid personal attacks, use specific numbers such as “$880 billion in Medicaid cuts,” and create “vivid contrasts” such as “tax breaks for the wealthy vs. food aid cuts.” Everyone we spoke with for this story agreed on one thing: What the Democrats did in 2024—using two competing camps that deployed conflicting strategies—cannot happen again.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>﻿The tech right saw in Trump what they wanted to see, but it wasn't actually there I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I don't know anyone who says they voted for Donald Trump in 2016 or 2020. I know, on the other hand, quite a few who voted for him in 2024, and quite a few more who — while they didn't vote for Trump because of his many crippling personal foibles, corruption, penchant for destroying the global economy, etc. — have thoroughly soured on the Democratic Party. While tech has generally been very liberal in its political support and giving, the last few years have seen the emergence of a real and influential tech right. Elon Musk, of course, is by far the most famous, but he didn't start the tech right by himself. And while his break with Trump — which Musk now seems to be backpedaling on — might have changed his role within the tech right, I don't think this shift will end with him. The tech world valorizes founders and doers, and everyone knows two or three stories about a company that only succeeded because it was willing to break some city regulations. For a long time, this set of commitments put tech firmly on the political left — and indeed tech employees overwhelmingly vote and donate to the Democratic Party. But over the last 10 years, I think three things changed. The first was what Vox at the time called the Great Awokening — a sweeping adoption of what had been a bunch of niche liberal social justice ideas, from widespread acceptance of trans people to suspicion of any sex or race disparity in hiring to #MeToo awareness of sexual harassment in the workplace. A lot of this shift at tech companies was employee driven; again, tech employees are mostly on the left. But some of it was illiberal — rejecting the idea that we can and should work with people we profoundly disagree with — and identitarian, in that it focused more on what demographic categories we belong to than our commonalities. When I first joined a tech company in 2017, interest rates were low and VC funding was incredibly easy to get. Things started changing when interest rates rose and jobs dried up (relatively speaking). That profoundly changed the dynamics at companies, and I have a suspicion it made a lot of people resentful of immigration levels that they'd been fine with when they, too, were having no trouble getting hired. And in the last few years, the tech world has become convinced that AI is happening very, very soon, and is the biggest economic story of our lives. The third was a deliberate effort by many liberals to go after a tech scene they saw as their enemy. The Biden administration ended up staffed by a lot of people ideologically committed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's view of the world, where big tech was the enemy of liberal democracy and the tools of antitrust should be used to break it up. Lina Khan's Federal Trade Commission acted on those convictions, going after big tech companies like Amazon. So in 2024, some of tech (still not a majority, but a smaller minority than in the past two Trump elections) went right. The answer so far has been no. (Many people on the tech right are still more optimistic than me, and point at a small handful of victories, but my assessment is that they're wearing rose-colored glasses to the point of outright blindness.) DOGE was a complete failure at cutting spending. It blew up basic biosciences research, and is scaring off or outright deporting the best international talent, which is badly needed for AI in particular. It's widely rumored that Stephen Miller is running things at the White House, and his one agenda appears to be turning all federal capacity toward deportations at the expense of every single other government priority. Some deregulation has happened, but any beneficial effects it would have had on investment have been more than canceled out by the tariffs' catastrophic effects on businesses' ability to plan for the future. But it's much easier to complain about Democrats in a way that all of those disparate interest groups find compelling than to govern in a way that keeps them all happy. They took a bad bet — and I think it'd behoove the Democrats to think, as Trump's coalition fractures, about which of those voters can be won back.

And that's not even Apple's biggest problem right now Republicans are gutting the safety net as job-killing mass automation looms.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The Trump administration will soon ensure that its 50% steel tariffs, which have threatened to make everything containing steel more expensive, will apply to your next fridge or dishwasher. The Commerce Department, in a notice set to be published in the federal register Monday, said the recently increased steel tariffs would also apply to consumer appliances that contain steel. Those so-called derivative products will be taxed an additional 50% for the amount of steel they contain, starting on June 23. Those products will include refrigerators, dryers, washing machines, dishwashers, freezers, ovens, garbage disposals and wire racks. President Donald Trump's broader tariffs have increased costs for some American manufacturers. Many parts and components are subject to Trump's tariffs, because they have no American-made alternatives – or the alternatives are more expensive than foreign products. And American appliance makers have griped about how competitors can effectively skirt those same tariffs by shipping completed products that aren't subject to the 50% levies. That's why the administration announced its so-called inclusion process aimed at preventing foreign competitors from getting around those tariffs. In theory, tariffs on imported appliances will make American-made dryers, ovens and other appliances more competitive compared with foreign equivalents, which are often made with relatively inexpensive parts and cheaper labor. At a US Steel facility in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, Trump announced he would set tariffs on steel imported into the United States at 50%, double their previous rate. Trump praised his tariffs for saving the US steel industry, claiming American steelmaking would have disappeared if he hadn't acted to impose tariffs. Although tariffs may have given the moribund American steel business a much-needed boost, they could raise prices on a key ingredient for American construction and manufacturing – two industries Trump has said he wants to support. Spot prices for domestically sourced steel have increased since the announcement of the 25% tariff in March, as American producers haven't had to worry about as much competition from foreign steel. When Trump imposed some steel tariffs in his first term, US production expanded modestly, but it sent costs rising for cars, tools and machines and, in 2021, shrank those industries' output by more than $3 billion, the International Trade Commission found in a 2023 analysis. Trump in his first term placed 20% to 50% tariffs on imported washing machines, a levy that American manufacturer Whirlpool initially praised. But the company lamented Trump's steel tariffs, bemoaning the hundreds of millions of dollars in higher costs to make its products.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>The drone deployment came as retaliation for Israel's Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran's nuclear program in a military airstrike on Thursday. The airstrike was devastating for Iran, which suffered significant casualties among its country's leadership. Iranian nuclear scientists Fereydoon Abbasi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, a theoretical physicist, were also killed in the attack. Iranian state media also reportedly claimed that children were killed in “at least one of the airstrikes.” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, confirmed the deaths and warned that Israel would endure “severe punishment” as a result of the attack in a series of posts on X. “Zionist regime has committed a crime in our dear country today at dawn with its satanic, bloodstained hands,” Khamenei said. “It has revealed its malicious nature even more than before by targeting residential areas.” “With this crime, the Zionist regime has prepared for itself a bitter, painful fate, which it will definitely see.” Gen. Effie Defrin said all of Israel's “defense systems are working to intercept the threats.” Multiple countries reported intercepting Iranian drones overnight, including Jordanian, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, and U.S. Air Forces.</p>
