                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>For the better part of a decade, Amazon has been trying to carve it's way into the U.S. health-care market, through billions of dollars worth of acquisitions, big-name hires and high-profile partnerships. Following a series of executive departures, Amazon is now restructuring its health business, telling CNBC that Amazon Health Services will be divided into six new units, with a goal of creating a simpler structure. "Our leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively," Lindsay said in a video chat. "One of the problems we're trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that's common in healthcare." Amazon said it hasn't conducted broad layoffs as part of the changes. The reorganization comes after Amazon lost several senior health leaders in recent months. Dr. Vin Gupta, who joined in 2020 and served as chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, left in February, followed by Trent Green, whose last day as CEO of Amazon's primary care chain One Medical was in April. Aaron Martin, vice president of health care at Amazon, announced internally last month that he plans to leave his role. Dr. Sunita Mishra, Amazon's chief medical officer, also departed in May. Amazon doesn't plan on naming a new CEO of One Medical following Green's departure. Martin, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a memo to staffers that he'll remain at Amazon "for a while" to help with the transition. "I then plan to take some time off this summer and hang out with my wife and my kids, finally get a cover band going in Nashville, and then possibly do something new," Martin wrote in the memo, which was shared with CNBC. Amazon has for years been on a mission to crack the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care industry, which is notoriously complex and inefficient. While it had long served providers and others in health care with its cloud-based technology, Amazon's first big splash directly into the market came in 2018 with the the acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million. Two years later, it launched its own offering called Amazon Pharmacy. The company then bought One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2023, among its largest acquisitions ever, giving Amazon access to a chain of brick-and-mortar primary care clinics and a robust membership base. The company shuttered its telehealth service, Amazon Care, in 2022. That came a year after it disbanded Haven, the joint health-care venture between Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. In the areas where Amazon continues to operate, competition is fierce and, in the case of primary care, margins are very slim. PillPack founders TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen, who left Amazon in 2022, recently launched a new health-care marketplace called General Medicine that will compete with Amazon. Mishra confirmed to STAT News that she advised the nascent startup. "We're a fast-evolving organization because the opportunity is so big," Lindsay said. Under its new structure, Amazon Health Services will be focused around the six groups, or what the company calls "pillars." Amazon declined to share financial figures for its health business, but Lindsay said it is seeing "very strong growth" across the offerings. One Medical went public in 2020, and it was still losing money when it was bought by Amazon. Amazon said in January of 2024 that its pharmacy business "doubled the number of customers" it served in the past year, though it didn't share specific figures. The company is opening pharmacies in 20 new cities this year, and about 45% of U.S. customers will be eligible for same-day medication delivery. "And if we stack these changes up over time, it'll feel like a reinvention." Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

Middle East Crisis:

The Natanz nuclear facility in Iran in January.

The United Nations atomic watchdog said there's no indication of increased radiation levels at Iran's main uranium-enrichment site, an early sign that Israel's strikes haven't penetrated the containment layers protecting the Islamic Republic's nuclear stockpile.

Iranian authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency they haven't observed higher radiation doses at the Natanz facility, located about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Tehran. No radiological or chemical contamination has spread beyond the site, according to an IAEA statement. </p>

India-Canada Relations:

The governments of Canada and India are set to establish a new structure to share information about cross-border crimes, their latest step toward rebuilding ties nearly two years after Canadian officials accused India of orchestrating the murder of a Sikh activist near Vancouver. 

The new information-sharing arrangement, which includes law enforcement agencies from both countries, will allow them to swap intelligence on transnational crime and syndicates, terrorism and extremist activities, according to officials who asked not to be identified because the discussions are still private. For Canada, this also includes an emphasis on investigating extra-judicial killings.</p>

Middle East Crisis:

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK has âgrave concernsâ about Iran's nuclear program and backed Israel's right to self-defense, while calling for de-escalation in a conflict that risks engulfing the Middle East.

Starmer was speaking after Israel carried out a wave of strikes on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and killing top military commanders. The attacks raised fears of a wider war in the region and caused a spike in the price of oil â though it later pared those gains.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>President Donald Trump on Friday lost his latest effort to overturn a civil jury verdict holding him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and then defaming her when she went public with her claims decades later. A majority of judges on the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York rejected Trump's request for that court's full bench to rehear his challenge to the verdict. It is one of two defamation-related verdicts that Carroll obtained against the president. The denial came six months after a three-judge panel on 2nd Circuit upheld a 2023 Manhattan federal jury's verdict, which ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages. Two judges on the 2nd Circuit â both of whom were nominated by Trump to that bench â  dissented from Friday's decision not to grant him a so-called en banc rehearing of his appeal. Trump could ask the Supreme Court to hear his appeal, but that court is not obligated to do so. A spokesman for Trump's legal team suggested the president would take that step, saying that the "Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax" will "continue to be appealed." "President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he is focusing on his mission to Make America Great Again," the spokesman said in a statement. "Although President Trump continues to try every possible maneuver to challenge the findings of two separate juries, those efforts have failed. He remains liable for sexual assault and defamation," Kaplan said. A panel of 2nd Circuit judges is scheduled to hear oral arguments on June 24 in Trump's appeal of the verdict in that case. Carroll sued Trump again in 2022, for battery and defamation, after New York passed a law that temporarily allowed people to file claims of sexual assault for alleged incidents that occurred outside the normal statute of limitations. Menashi wrote that Manhattan District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the trial of Caroll's lawsuit, excluded key evidence, allowing her attorneys to  more easily argue that Trump's comments met the legal standard for defamation. The dissent also disputed Kaplan's interpretation of legal rules that allowed "stale witness testimony about a brief encounter that allegedly occurred forty-five years earlier." That testimony came from Jessica Leeds,  a woman who told jurors that during an encounter with Trump on an airplane, he "grabbed [her] with his hands, tried to kiss [her], grabbed [her] breasts, and pulled [her] towards him," the dissent noted. Menashi was joined in his dissent by Judge Michael Park. Both judges were appointed to the circuit by Trump in 2019, during his first term in the White House. Four other 2nd Circuit judges pushed back on Menashi and Park, writing that the "dissenting opinion would have us stray far from our proper role as a court of review." Those judges said that an en banc rehearing is almost always granted to resolve "a question of exceptional importance or a conflict between the panel's opinion and appellate precedent." "The dissenting opinion ignores this rule of restraint," they wrote. Those judges, Denny Chin and Susan Carney, responded at length to Menashi's arguments. "Even on his own terms, our dissenting colleague fails to explain why any purported error warrants a retrial or full court review," Chin and Carney wrote.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Consumers in the early part of June took a considerably less pessimistic view about the economy and potential surges in inflation as progress appeared possible in the global trade war, according to a University of Michigan survey Friday. The university's closely watched Surveys of Consumers showed across-the-board rebounds from previously dour readings, while respondents also sharply cut back their outlook for near-term inflation. For the headline index of consumer sentiment, the gauge was at 60.5, well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 54 and a 15.9% increase from a month ago. The moves coincided with a softening in the heated rhetoric that has surrounded President Donald Trump's tariffs. After releasing his April 2 "liberation day" announcement, Trump has eased off the threats and instituted a 90-day negotiation period that appears to be showing progress, particularly with top trade rival China. "However, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy." To be sure, all of the sentiment indexes were still considerably below their year-ago readings as consumers worry about what impact the tariffs will have on prices, along with a host of other geopolitical concerns. On inflation, the one-year outlook tumbled from levels not seen since 1981. The one-year estimate slid to 5.1%, a 1.5 percentage point drop, while the five-year view edged lower to 4.1%, a 0.1 percentage point decrease. "Consumers' fears about the potential impact of tariffs on future inflation have softened somewhat in June," Hsu said. "Still, inflation expectations remain above readings seen throughout the second half of 2024, reflecting widespread beliefs that trade policy may still contribute to an increase in inflation in the year ahead." Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve of New York reported that the one-year view had fallen to 3.2% in May, a 0.4 percentage point drop from the prior month. At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week reported that both producer and consumer prices increased just 0.1% on a monthly basis, pointing toward little upward pressure from the duties. The soft inflation numbers have led Trump and other White House officials to demand the Fed start lowering interest rates again. The central bank is slated to meet next week, with market expectations strongly pointing to no cuts until September. Sign up for free newsletters and get more CNBC delivered to your inbox</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS made their U.S. public market debut on Friday, opening at $13.65 a share. The opening trade values the company at roughly $30 billion, outstripping rival Tyson Foods' market cap of about $19.82 billion. JBS is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "JBS," a day later than initially expected. The company said it couldn't conclude certain operational procedures in time to debut on Thursday. Its stock was delisted from the Sao Paolo Exchange in Brazil a week ago as part of the dual-listing plan. Since its founding more than seven decades ago, JBS has grown to become the world's largest meatpacking company. Last year, the company reported net revenue of $77.2 billion and net income of $2 billion, according to regulatory filings. JBS operates a sprawling business worldwide, with significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S. and Australia. JBS's U.S. listing is more than 15 years in the making. The company's U.S. subsidiary first announced plans to go public in 2009, but the move never came to fruition after two postponements. Then, in late 2016, the company said it would have a U.S. initial public offering as part of a broader reorganization strategy. But months later, the Brazilian government began investigating corruption in the meatpacking company â including among JBS and its top executives. J&F Investimentos, the holding company that owns a controlling stake in JBS, paid a $3.2 billion fine in 2017 to settle bribery charges. Former chair Joesley Batista and his older brother CEO Wesley Batista, the company's top shareholders and the sons of its founder, managed to avoid prison sentences by cooperating with prosecutors. The Batistas and J&F settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 for roughly $27 million. However, they returned to the company's board last year after being acquitted of insider trading charges. The company's history of corruption and bribery allegations led to opposition to its U.S. listing from lawmakers on the both sides of the aisle, making it look unlikely that regulators would grant their approval. After President Donald Trump's reelection, JBS's subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride donated $5 million to his inaugration committee, making it the single largest donor.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Rather than destroy or even delay Iran's emergence as a nuclear power, Israel's war risks bringing it closer. Benjamin Netanyahu's gamble in attacking Iran may backfire without the support of US bunker-busting bombs against its nuclear facilities. There are three immediate questions to answer about the war that Israel has started with Iran, all of which lead to the most important of all: Can this achieve Israel's stated goal of ensuring, once and for all, that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon?If it can, then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to launch Israeli jets against a much larger nation of close to 90 million people would, depending on the nature of the targets struck and level of civilian casualties, be justified on both strategic and moral grounds. There's no doubt, despite denials, that Iran's uranium enrichment program is designed to produce weapons-grade fuel; it's practically there, with a growing stockpile concentrated to 60%, a level far beyond any conceivable civilian use. Both the abandoned 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and any agreement that might realistically have come out of US-Iranian talks that were due to resume on Sunday would do as much â only without loss of life, or the risk to regional stability and global markets.So, in trying to unpick what Israel's military action can achieve, the first of my three questions is: Why now? Yet he chose the early hours of Friday morning to go it alone.One clear reason is that Iranian air defenses have been severely degraded over the past year. So, too, has the potential for retaliation that Iran built up over decades by arming both Hezbollah, in Lebanon, and Hamas, in Gaza, with missiles. And it's an opportunity that won't, as Netanyahu has correctly said, last forever.A second reason is equally clear and much more disturbing: The personal political interests of the Israeli prime minister. The belief that Netanyahu has been dragging out and expanding the war in Gaza for selfish reasons is now widely held within Israel, let alone outside. Conflict keeps him in power by avoiding a government collapse. It also puts off an inevitable post-war inquiry into the extraordinary failures of security and policy that allowed Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist rampage to succeed on his watch.It's unlikely to be a coincidence that Netanyahu's decision to attack has come just days after he and his cabinet narrowly survived a vote of no-confidence in the Knesset, and at a time when the broad popular support he once enjoyed for continuing the fight in Gaza has evaporated. They can drive decisions that otherwise wouldn't be made.Another vital question is whether Netanyahu's plan for success in the war he's started is predicated on drawing in the US. But the consensus among military analysts has long been that Israel can do only limited damage on its own; to succeed, it needs the 15-ton bunker-buster bombs that only America has.These weapons are thought essential because Iran's most advanced centrifuge cascades for enriching uranium are buried 60 to 90 meters (197 to 295 feet) under a mountain at Fordow, about an hour's drive south of Qom, home to the Islamic Republic's most important seminaries. The first priority for any complex bombing campaign would be to neutralize air defenses and reduce Iranian options for retaliation, by hitting missile bases and the commanders who would coordinate their use. The primary targets should come later.Whether Donald Trump allows the US to become the proverbial dog wagged by an Israeli tail may well now rely on Netanyahu's biggest gamble of all, which concerns the third question: How will Ayatollah Ali Khamenei choose â or be able â to respond.As of Friday morning, Iran's Supreme Leader had authorized the launch of about 100 long-range drones against Israel, most if not all of which appear to have been shot down. In a statement, Khamenei pledged revenge against the Jewish State, both now and over a long future, so there's more to come. That was in stark contrast to Iranian warnings before the attack, which had pledged to hit America's personnel and Arab allies in the Gulf should any attack occur.Khamenei no doubt understands that any such action would draw US forces into the fight. So too would a retaliation against Israel that targets civilian centers. So, whether through caution or lack of capacity to do more by conventional military means, Khamenei may not force Trump to involve US forces. That risks leaving Israel to conduct a weeks-long campaign of air strikes against hardened uranium enrichment sites that may not succeed.Out of the same caution, Khamenei may also avoid any dramatic public gesture such as declaring Iran's withdrawal from the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty. So it seems probable that, rather than back down, the regime in Tehran will now seek to build a nuclear arsenal as fast as it can.The risk to Netanyahu is that Khamenei can walk this tightrope between hitting back hard enough that he isn't damaged at home by appearing weak, but not so hard as to draw in the US and its bunker-busting bombs. If he can pull that off, then Israel's attack could backfire spectacularly, even while showing its continued technological and military superiority. Rather than destroy or even delay Iran's emergence as a nuclear power, there's a danger that this war of choice brings it closer.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>An Air India flight bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad on Thursday morning. Amit Shah, India's home minister, said he was being treated in a hospital. "We received the good news that one passenger survived. Videos seen across social media appear to show Ramesh walking away from the wreckage. US President Donald Trump called the crash "one of the worst in aviation history" at a press conference on Thursday. A mayday call was issued, but there was no response from the cockpit to air traffic controllers, India's directorate general of civil aviation said. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was leading a team of US investigators who were traveling to assist Indian authorities with an investigation into the incident. British investigators also said they were sending a team to India. The plane, registered as VT-ANB, was first delivered to Air India in January 2014. It had flown to Ahmedabad from India's capital, New Delhi, earlier in the day, and had flown to Paris, Melbourne, Frankfurt, and Tokyo in the past week. Boeing's CEO Kelly Ortberg said he had been in touch with Air India and that a Boeing team was standing by to support the investigation. "Our deepest condolences go out to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Air India Flight 171, as well as everyone affected in Ahmedabad," he said. Boeing stock fell sharply Thursday, ending the day down almost 5% to trade at $203.75. Air India's CEO, Campbell Wilson, said in a video statement that the airline's teams are "working around the clock" to support passengers, crew, their families, and investigators. He said that while he understands people want to know more information, "anything we report must be accurate and not speculative." "We owe that to everyone involved," he added. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X: "The tragedy in Ahmedabad has stunned and saddened us. In this sad hour, my thoughts are with everyone affected by it. Have been in touch with Ministers and authorities who are working to assist those affected." Images appeared to show the jet's landing gear had not been retracted. Alastair Rosenschen, an aviation consultant and former British Airways pilot, told Sky News: "If the gear was still down, then that would suggest that something is untoward." A year later, it ordered 470 aircraft worth $70 billion at list prices. Alan Tan, an aviation law professor at the National University of Singapore, said in a Thursday LinkedIn post that the crash will likely be the "costliest insurance claim in Indian aviation history." He said India was not a party to international conventions that protect ground victims in plane crashes, so compensation and insurance claims for ground victims in the Air India crash would have to be dealt with under Indian domestic law. Insurance claims for victims on board would be based on the 1999 Montreal Convention, which established that airlines would be liable for the death or injury of passengers. Tan told BI that Air India and Boeing both have their work cut out for them to restore confidence with the public, and there would be an immediate hit to customer perception, particularly for Air India. "But as other leading airlines facing crises have shown, these are not insurmountable. Transparency and accountability in investigations and consistent messaging to the public will hopefully reduce the risks of a media spectacle," he said.</p>

Middle East Crisis:

A damaged building following Israeli airstrikes in Tehran on June 13.

Israel's early-morning strikes against Iran's nuclear program and ballistic-missile sites on Friday prompted the Islamic Republic to vow a âharsh blowâ against both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and the US, which denied any involvement.

The widespread attack across Iran, which sent oil prices surging, targeted nuclear sites and top military commanders. Iranian state television reported that the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, was killed.</p>
