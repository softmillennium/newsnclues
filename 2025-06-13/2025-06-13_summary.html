“The American people do not want another endless war in the Middle East,” said Rep. Rashida Tlaib.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Michigan) is warning President Donald Trump that acting on his threats to take up arms with Israel in its war with Iran would be an unconstitutional circumventing of Congress to start a war that the American public overwhelmingly doesn't want.

Shortly after Israel launched unprompted strikes on numerous sites in Tehran on Friday, President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that “the U.S. will defend itself and Israel if Iran retaliates.” He has since made numerous threats to Iran, insisting that they capitulate with his administration's demands for a nuclear deal “before there is nothing left” of the country.

These and other statements by the president suggest that Trump would dispatch the U.S. military to fight alongside Israel whenever he wants, Tlaib pointed out — the same way that Trump conducted weeks of unauthorized strikes on Yemen earlier this year, causing hundreds of casualties, progressive lawmakers have previously said.

“The president cannot circumvent congressional war powers and unilaterally send U.S. troops to war with Iran,” said Tlaib in a post on social media on Friday.

“This is a violation of Article I of the Constitution which requires congressional approval to declare war. The American people do not want another endless war in the Middle East that will cost lives and tear their families apart,” she went on.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has claimed that the U.S. was not involved in Israel's attacks, which struck numerous residential buildings across Tehran, and said that the strikes were “unilateral.”

However, Trump has seemingly been eager to take credit for involvement in the strikes. On Friday, he suggested that the U.S. had deeper engagement with the strikes than just a notification from Israel.

“Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on,” the president said in comments to The Wall Street Journal.

ABC reports, citing a U.S. source familiar, that the U.S. had provided “exquisite” intelligence for the strikes. The source reportedly said that the U.S. is prepared to fight on behalf of Israel in the war. Some Israeli sources have also reportedly claimed that the U.S. was heavily involved in the attack, and gave the “clear U.S. green light” even as some Trump administration officials had opposed the idea of Israel striking Iran.

Iranian-born analyst Trita Parsi and executive vice president for the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft said that officials' remarks indicate that Israel is attempting to manipulate the U.S. into becoming involved in a war with Iran — a war that has long been a goal of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, numerous analysts and experts have previously noted 

“Trump himself was coordinating this with the Israelis in the hope, apparently, for Trump, thinking that this will actually soften the Iranian negotiating position and enable him to get a deal in which the Iranians capitulate,” Parsi told Democracy Now! on Friday. “I suspect that the Israeli hope, however, is that the Iranians don't capitulate, that they strike back, and, by that, get the U.S. to get more actively involved in the war.”

The U.S. is seemingly making other preparations. Per Politico, the Pentagon has moved two warships capable of defending against ballistic and cruise missiles closer toward Israel as it prepares for retaliatory strikes. The U.S. had provided similar support when Israel and Iran swapped a series of strikes last year.

U.S. involvement in war with Iran is indeed a highly unpopular prospect. A poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs last year found that nearly 6 in 10 Americans oppose using U.S. troops to defend Israel if Iran attacked it. Another poll by the University of Maryland from last month found that 69 percent of Americans — including 64 percent of Republicans — prefer a diplomatic solution to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, while only 14 percent of respondents prefer military action.

Meanwhile, public support for Israel overall is flagging. A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found “all-time low” sympathy for Israelis over Palestinians, marking the continuation of a longtime trend that began even before Israel embarked on its genocide in Gaza.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke separately with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on June 13, amid a sweeping Israeli air assault on Iran that killed top military officials and targeted the country's nuclear infrastructure.

The Israeli strike, described by Tel Aviv as "preemptive," involved 200 aircraft and the release of 330 munitions on over 100 sites. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps confirmed that several senior commanders were killed, including aerospace chief Amir Ali Hajizadeh.

During his call with Pezeshkian, Putin expressed condolences for what the Kremlin described as "numerous civilian casualties" and condemned Israel's actions as violations of the UN Charter and international law. 

The conversations took place just hours after Russia launched its own missile and drone assault on Ukraine. At least four civilians were killed and 24 injured in Russian attacks across multiple regions on June 13, according to Ukrainian officials.

Moscow has killed tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians, and the true extent of the death toll is simply not known. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine was a clear and direct violation of both international law and the UN Charter.

During the conversation with Netanyahu, Putin emphasized "the importance of returning to the negotiation process," and offered to mediate in the conflict.

The Russian leader, who has himself been indicted by the International Criminal Court for war crimes in Ukraine, also pledged Moscow's support in "de-escalating the conflict."

Russia has deepened military and political ties with Tehran since the start of its full-scale war against Ukraine. Iran has supplied Moscow with thousands of Shahed-type attack drones and short-range ballistic missiles used in routine strikes on Ukrainian cities.

Ukraine's Foreign Ministry responded to the Middle East escalation by expressing concern about broader regional instability but reiterated that "the Iranian regime supports Russia in its illegal war of aggression" and provides it with "weapons to kill Ukrainians."

Kyiv warned that the fallout could destabilize international security and trigger economic shocks. Global oil prices soared over 10% after the Israeli operation — a development that could enhance revenues for Russia, whose war budget is largely financed by energy exports.

Among other concerns, the US military parade will produce as much pollution as created to heat 300 homes for a year

Donald Trump's military parade this weekend will bring thousands of troops out to march, while dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers roll down the streets and fighter jets hum overhead.

The event has prompted concern about rising autocracy in the US. It will also produce more than 2m kilograms of planet-heating pollution – equivalent to the amount created by producing of 67m plastic bags or by the energy used to power about 300 homes in one year, according to a review by the progressive thinktank Institute for Policy Studies and the Guardian.

The military parade is meant to celebrate the US army's 250th anniversary on 14 June – which will also coincide with the president's 79th birthday. It will feature 150 military vehicles including 60-ton tanks and armored fighting vehicles, and more than 50 helicopters and aircraft such as a Mustang fighter aircraft and a B-25 Mitchell bomber, which were both used widely during the second world war. These vehicles burn dozens or even hundreds of gallons of fuel per hour.

Institute for Policy studies quantified the emissions that will result from the use of those vehicles, using data from the International Energy Agency and publicly available information. The researchers calculated emissions from not only the parade route itself, but also the transport of the vehicles to the event and the upstream impact of producing fuel for the parade.

The large quantity of emissions this activity is estimated to produce is equivalent to those from flying 4,700 people from North Carolina – where the parade helicopters are based – to the nation's capital in first class.

The calculation is probably an understatement as it does not include pollution from transporting thousands of people, horses and equipment to the parade, or other energy used for the event.

Hanna Homestead, research analyst at the Institute for Policy Studies, noted the same kinds of vehicles deployed for the parade have also been used to transport napalm and other supplies to Vietnam, and are now being used by Israel in its siege on Gaza.

“So we're spending money to glorify a gas-guzzling equipment used for war, genocide and planetary destruction,” she said, “at the same time as critical services for populations at home and around the world are being slashed.”

Reached for comment, a White House spokesperson, Anna Kelley, said the parade “will honor all of the military men and women who have bravely served our country, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom”.

The president reportedly sought to throw a similar tribute during his first term, inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in France, but was thwarted by the then secretary of defense, James Mattis. Trump's parade this year has inspired “No Kings” protests across the country.

Lindsay Koshgarian, program director at the Institute for Policy Studies, said that the parade's emissions were “egregious” and the event itself was a “wake-up call” about Trump's priorities.

“This parade comes alongside proposals for a $1tn Pentagon budget, along with massive cuts to healthcare, food programs, and an ideological attack on climate programs both in the Pentagon and across government,” she said. “The more we spend on sending these fuel-guzzling tanks and helicopters around the world, the less we have to protect our people, communities and the planet.”

The Institute for Policy Studies' National Priorities Project, which focuses on budget analysis and which Koshgarian directs, found that the $45m it will cost to hold the military parade would be enough to fund programs Trump has put on the chopping block, such as the two offices enforcing endangered species protection or the development of an HIV vaccine in South Africa.

Military forces' contribution to global carbon emissions has come under greater scrutiny in recent years. The world's militaries produce at least 5.5% of greenhouse gas emissions – more than the total footprint of Japan – one 2022 estimate found. And the US Department of Defense is the single largest institutional greenhouse gas emitter in the world, using more petroleum than any other institution, research shows.

Discordant US response as president says he was fully aware of plans for what Marco Rubio called a ‘unilateral action'

Middle East crisis – live updates

Donald Trump is walking a tightrope as he claims that he was fully aware of Israel's plans to launch massive airstrikes against Iran while continuing to distance the US from those strikes and deny Washington took any active role in the preparations.

The White House's messaging has shifted quickly from Marco Rubio's arms-length description of the Israeli attack as a “unilateral action”, to Trump claiming on Friday morning that he was fully in the loop on the operation and that it came at the end of a 60-day ultimatum he had given Iran to “make a deal” on its nuclear programme.

“Today is day 61,” he wrote on Truth Social. “I told [Iran] what to do, but they just couldn't get there.”

Trump's framing presents a good cop-bad cop dynamic of his approach with Benjamin Netanyahu, the embattled Israeli leader with whom he has a notoriously combative relationship. The US president has scrambled to now present the Israeli strikes, which he publicly claimed he did not want on Thursday, as a means of continuing his efforts to convince Iran to negotiate.

“They should now come to the table to make a deal before it's too late,” he said.

But the discordant US response from to the strikes, including Rubio's Thursday evening statement, a hasty evacuation of some US personnel from the region and ambiguity over whether the US provided intelligence or would actively take part in Israel's defence from a likely counterattack, has raised questions over whether Israel may have moved ahead of the Trump administration as a way to present Washington with a fait accompli.

“They made a bet on President Trump,” said Elliott Abrams, a former diplomat and senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, suggesting that Israel had pushed harder for strikes while the Trump administration had sought to maintain a diplomatic route. “The Israelis struck and then today Trump called it ‘excellent'.”

While Israel had clearly given the United States advanced warning of the strike, claims that it was fully coordinated in Israeli state media have been subject to speculation: was Trump actually on board or was he repositioning himself on Friday in order to present the strikes as part of a coherent strategy.

On Thursday, in remarks from the White House's East Room, Trump said that strikes on Israel could “blow up” his diplomatic efforts to negotiate with the Iranian leadership and said he “didn't want them going in”. He defended his decision to begin evacuating personnel because a strike “could well happen”.

“The US started evacuating voluntarily non-essential personnel on Wednesday, barely 24 hours ahead of time, not enough time to really get people out of harm's way,” said Rosemary Kelanic, the Middle East director for Defense Priorities, a thinktank that pushes for a more restrained US foreign policy. “So the question for me is what did the president know and when did he know it?”

On Friday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was not caught unaware by the strike: “Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.” And he indicated that he had been apprised of future Israeli plans, writing that the “next already planned attacks” would be “even more brutal”.

Senior Israeli officials also began to brief media that Trump had only pretended to oppose an Israeli attack and that they in fact had a “green light” for the attack. But Kelanic and others noted that Israel may be seeking a means to “entrap” the US into a war.

In either case, it is doubtful that Israel could have prepared the attack in the past week without US knowledge.

Officials at the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies would have seen the preparations for the airstrike – involving more than 200 Israeli fighter jets striking more than 100 targets across Iran – and probably understood that Israel was planning a major attack against Tehran.

Late on Thursday, administration officials told Fox News that the US had replenished missiles for Israel's Iron Dome anti-air batteries in recent weeks in preparation for an expected counterattack.

And the US in recent weeks had deployed B-52 bombers to its airbase on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, where multiple B-2 bombers have also been stationed since late March. B-2s stationed at the base took part in airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen earlier this year, but the base would also serve as a launching point for airstrikes against Iran if the US were to join the conflict.

But there are other explanations for the resupply of anti-air missiles to Iron Dome, particularly following the unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles launched by Iran against Israel last year.

And the US could have employed those B-2s and B-52s to strike the Fordow uranium enrichment centre, which is located deep underground and was not apparently struck in Friday morning's strikes. Still intact, it represents an important element in Iran's nuclear program that was not eliminated – at least in the first round of the Israeli attacks.

Dr. Zheng Zhi, a former Chinese military doctor currently living in exile in Canada, traveled to Taiwan for several screenings of the award-winning documentary “State Organs” from June 4 to 15, which features Zheng's eyewitness account as a resident doctor in a Chinese military hospital.

While at the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region in the 1990s, the Chinese military, known as the People's Liberation Army, outlined a combat plan every year, he said at one screening event.

“Once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Strait, the greatest pressure for them will be on logistics support,” he said.

Millions of troops may be mobilized to the front line of the Taiwan Strait, including possibly 2 million to 3 million logistics personnel, he said.

He said that from the Chinese regime's view, “the most difficult part of the logistics to supply the front is the storage, refrigeration, and transportation of blood, as many soldiers will be bleeding or burned in combat,” and “blood supply will become the biggest pressure.”

The Chinese military solution was to put surrendered or captured Taiwanese soldiers in detention, draw their blood, and use it for wounded Chinese soldiers, according to Zheng.

He said they proposed to take skin from the Taiwanese soldiers and transplant it onto the Chinese soldiers who have burns.

So if Chinese Communist Party (CCP) attacks Taiwan and the Taiwanese military surrenders, “the first thing they might face is having their blood taken because a large blood supply is needed to sustain a war,” Zheng said.

He said that the Chinese military has developed modular blood processing equipment for blood testing and processing.

Using container trucks and airplanes, the blood could be quickly transported to the frontlines to “immediately set up a field hospital,” he added.

There are “no technical barriers,” Zheng told The Epoch Times. And with the advancement in technology and the growth of the organ harvesting industry in China, taking organs from Taiwanese soldiers is no longer a question of possibility, he said.

“It's only a matter of numbers.”

It's hard for someone in a normal country to grasp such a level of cruelty, he said, pointing out that “the CCP has no human moral baseline.”

The Taiwanese soldiers who surrender or are alive, he said, are considered by the Chinese regime as the “best organ and blood bank.”

“State Organs,” directed by Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Raymond Zhang, focuses on two families in search of their missing relatives amid a nationwide persecution of the faith in Falun Gong, which both disappeared individuals practiced.

He told The Epoch Times it pained him to think that he has friends who went to China for liver and heart transplants.

For all such detained Falun Gong practitioners in China, their organs are “state organs,” he said, adding that the regime is “killing on demand.”

IDF says aim is to wipe out nuclear facilities, as new Iranian military chief threatens to open ‘gates of hell' on Israel

Middle East crisis – live updates

Israel has warned that its aerial assault on Iran, bombing nuclear facilities and air defences, killing military commanders and scientists, was “just the beginning” of an operation to smash the country's nuclear programme, leaving the Middle East facing the prospect of a full-scale war.

Iran has vowed revenge, with the new head of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Pakpour, hastily appointed after his predecessor was killed in Friday's attack, threatening to open “the gates of hell” on Israel.

In a recorded message, Iran's Supreme Leader,Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said: “Don't think that they hit and it's over. No. They started the work and started the war. We will not allow them to escape safely from this great crime they committed.”

Late on Friday, air raid sirens wailed in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Iran said that hundreds of missiles had been fired towards Israel. Several explosions were heard in Tel Aviv where columns of smoke rose into the night sky.

The Israeli strikes hit more than 100 major targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities and missile sites, and killed senior military commanders and scientists in what Tehran said was a “declaration of war”.

Iran launched a salvo of 100 drones in its immediate response, which were mostly shot down before reaching Israel, but the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he expected “several waves of Iranian attacks” and warned: “Israeli citizens may have to remain in sheltered areas for lengthy periods of time.”

More explosions were reported in Iran on Friday evening, suggesting a secondary phase of Israeli attacks was already under way, in the early stages of a war that has been brewing for a quarter-century, ever since Iran's secret underground uranium enrichment facilities were first exposed, and the US and Israel insisted the country would not be allowed to build a bomb.

The focus of much of the Israeli munitions on Friday was the mostly subterranean uranium enrichment plant at Natanz. A military spokesperson, Brig Gen Effie Defrin, said the facility was “significantly damaged” and that the operation was “just the beginning”.

Officers of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) made clear that its war aims were to seize the opportunity offered by Iran's flattened air defences, to wreak lasting, crippling damage on Iran's nuclear programme.

“That's the goal, to remove the threat and to make sure they don't have a nuclear bomb and that there is not an active existential threat on the Israeli people,” an IDF officer said.

Among the uncertainties hanging over the region as night fell on Friday was how much of Iran's arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles were still usable, and whether Tehran would take revenge on the US as well as Israel.

The US role in the attack remained murky. In the run-up to the Israeli 200-plane attack, Donald Trump had publicly urged Israel to give diplomacy more of a chance, before US-Iranian talks that were planned for Sunday. On Friday, the US president insisted he had been well informed of Israel's plans, and described the Israeli attack as “excellent”.

Asked by the Wall Street Journal what kind of heads-up the US had been given, Trump responded testily: “Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.”

Speaking separately to ABC News, he praised the attacks and linked the timing to a 60-day ultimatum he had given Tehran in the spring, to negotiate a deal. “I think it's been excellent. We gave them a chance and they didn't take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you're going to get hit. And there's more to come. A lot more,” Trump said.

On his own Truth Social online platform, Trump urged Iran to make a deal or face further planned attacks that would be “even more brutal”.

ABC quoted a “source familiar with the intelligence” as saying the US had provided “exquisite” intelligence and would help defend Israel as needed.

The US website Axios quoted two Israeli officials as suggesting the apparent disagreement with Israel had been a ploy, aimed at convincing Iran that no attack was imminent so the generals and scientists on the target list would not move to new locations. “We had a clear US green light,” one of the officials said.

Israel's first wave of airstrikes took place soon after 8am Iranian time. About 200 Israeli warplanes hit 100 wide-ranging targets.

In a televised address recorded in English for the benefit of foreign audiences, Netanyahu declared: “We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment programme. We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponisation programme. We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile programme.”

The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that the Natanz enrichment plant had been hit but no increase in radiation had been detected outside the facility.

Iranian state media said the head of the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), Gen Hossein Salami, the army chief of staff, Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, and the commander of the Khatam al-Anbia joint forces headquarters, Maj Gen Gholam Ali Rashid, were killed in the strikes, as well as six nuclear scientists, including Fereydoun Abbasi, the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization from 2011 to 2013.

Israel said its assault had killed most of the senior leadership of the IRGC's air force.

IDF officers said that operation, codenamed Rising Lion, had involved the infiltration of Mossad commandos before the strikes, as well as drones, to target air defences and Iran's ballistic missiles.

Later in the day, the Mossad released grainy footage that it said showed agents on Iranian soil. Another video showed what the agency said was an attack on an Iranian defence system, while a third appeared to show an Iranian long-range missile being targeted.

Iranian civilians described a night of terrifying explosions. Golnar, a resident of Saadat Abad, in northern Tehran, said she woke to loud explosions just after 3am.

“I woke up to the first explosion and rushed to the windows to check. Then, minutes later, back to back I heard four explosions. The windows were shaking and people in the building started screaming,” she said. “Everything happened so quickly. We were scrambling for information on whether this was an attack or a natural disaster. This morning there's debris all over the explosion site and surrounding streets.”

Ahmad Moadi, 62, said: “How much longer are we going to live in fear? As an Iranian, I believe there must be an overwhelming response, a scathing response.”

• Israel attacks Iran: Israel has launched unprecedented strikes on Iran, targeting its nuclear program and military leaders. The attacks have continued across multiple cities across the nation, and Iranian state media reports that fresh strikes are hitting Tehran. Iran's foreign minister said that Israel will “deeply regret” its attack.
    


• Trump warns Iran: President Donald Trump told CNN that the US “of course” supports Israel in its actions. Trump warned Iran earlier today to agree to a nuclear deal “before there is nothing left.” It's unclear if scheduled nuclear talks between the US and Iran will go ahead this weekend.
    


• Military leaders killed: Gen. Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and one of the country's most powerful figures, was killed in the attack. Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, Iran's highest-ranking military officer, was also killed.
    


• Nuclear targets: Netanyahu said “Operation Rising Lion” struck Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz, nuclear scientists, and what he called “the heart of Iran's ballistic missiles program.”
    


            Israeli authorities discussed “the price we'll have to pay” before launching their overnight attack on Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
    


            “There were doubts, people were asking questions, mostly about two things: in regards to our capabilities and in regards to the price we'll have to pay,” Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video.
    


                    “Regarding the price — I said there will be a price, and we are trying to reduce it in various ways I will not elaborate on. But it is important for me that you citizens will help reduce it by, not being euphoric … and simply obey the instructions (of the Home Front Command) and stay next to safe spaces, because we and you want to minimize harm to life as much as possible,” he said.
                





            Discussing the possibility of a counterstrike from Iran, Netanyahu said: “I tell you there will be. We have hit a considerable part of the Iranian military leadership. We hit a considerable part of the nuclear scientists leading their nuclear program. We are also acted against their air defense. … This came as surprise to them.”
    


                    “I told (US President Donald) Trump surprise is the element of success,” he added. “It created, of course, chaos in Iran but we all need to assume there will be a counterattack against us. It can come in waves and can be very hard.”
                





            Israel's decision to strike Iran in the early hours of Friday morning was “not made lightly,” Israel's UN envoy Danny Doron said a news conference on Friday.
    


            “The decision to act last night was not made lightly. It followed repeated violations by the Iranian regime, continued deception and an absence of meaningful international consequences,” Doron said
    


            Doron claimed that his country had “uncovered clear evidence” that Iran was “planning a surprise attack” on Israel.
    


            “Israel could not and would not wait for that moment to arrive,” he said.
    


            Doron said that his country has “nothing against” the people of Iran, telling journalists:
    


                    “I'm telling to the Iranian people very directly that we have nothing against them. We know that they are suffering. We have seen the conditions where they live… Our fight is not against the people of Iran. The attack was taking (place) at the time when people were not in the streets, and we did everything we can to minimize civilian casualties,” he said.
                





            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Friday that Israel coordinated with the United States “in advance” of the attack on Iran, and the Trump administration “knew about the strike.”
    


                    “We have told them in advance, they knew about the strike,” Netanyahu said in a pre-recorded video released Friday afternoon. “What they will do now, I leave it to President Trump, he makes his own decisions independently.”
                





            “I will not speak for him. He speaks very persuasively and very firmly and said Iran should not have nuclear weapons, they should not have enrichment capabilities,” Netanyahu added.
    


Keep in mind: Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Thursday that there was no US involvement or assistance in the strikes.
    


            Iranian air defenses shot down an Israeli drone in the vicinity of Iran's Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant (FFEP), an underground nuclear facility located some 20 miles northeast of the city of Qom, Iranian state media Press TV reported Friday evening local time.
    


            This was reported around the same time that Press TV said the Hamedan Airbase in western Iran was hit by Israeli airstrikes. Fardiz, a city in north-central Iran, was also targeted by Israeli strikes, Press TV reported.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment
    


            The Israeli military has said that it is working to intercept a missile launched “from Yemen toward Israeli territory” on Friday evening.
    


            Sirens sounded in several areas across Israel, the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement.
    


            “Aerial defense systems are operating to intercept the threat,” it said.
    


            President Donald Trump told Reuters it's uncertain whether Iran's nuclear program exists following Israel's strikes and that US talks with Iran are still planned for Sunday, although he isn't sure they'll happen.
    


                    “We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out. They can still work out a deal however, it's not too late,” Trump told Reuters in a phone interview.
                





            In another phone interview with NBC News, Trump reiterated that Iran “may have another opportunity” to strike a nuclear deal and implied that Iranians are reaching out to him.
    


            “Now, they may have another opportunity. We'll see,” Trump told NBC.
    


                    “They're calling me to speak,” Trump added without specifying who is calling him. “The same people we worked with the last time … Many of them are dead now.”
                





            Air defenses across Iran were activated as fresh air strikes targeted Tehran Friday evening local time, Iranian state media reported.
    


            Press TV reported that missiles were intercepted south of Tehran, as the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) reported that west Tehran was being hit by new strikes. Karaj, a city near Tehran, was also targeted, IRIB wrote.
    


            CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment.
    


            Israel is committed to guaranteeing that there is no nuclear weapons program left in Iran, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Yechiel Leiter, told CNN.
    


            “Those who are going to challenge our will to live in peace are going to have to be challenged by us, and that's what we're in the process of doing now,” Leiter told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.
    


                    “Maybe now the Iranians will be in a better position to actually succumb and give up on their nuclear program. But if not, we are committed to seeing this operation through to the point where there is no nuclear weapons program left in Iran,” he continued.
                





            “Iran will not have a nuclear path to a nuclear bomb,” he said.
    


            Israel deployed reservist troops throughout the country before attacking Iran overnight, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Friday.
    


                    “As part of the IDF's preparations for defense and offense across all arenas and with the start of operation ‘Rising Lion,' the IDF began to deploy reservists from different units to all combat arenas throughout the country,” the statement said.
                





            Iraq's foreign minister and deputy prime minister, Fuad Hussein, urged Iran to continue talks with the United States after Israel's attacks on Iran, according to a statement released by Iraq's foreign ministry.
    


            “Minister Hussein expressed Iraq's strong condemnation of the military aggression targeting the Islamic Republic of Iran, affirming Iraq's solidarity with the Iranian government and people in facing this dangerous escalation,” the statement said.
    


                    Hussein also “urged the Iranian side to continue pursuing dialogue with the United States through Omani mediation, in order to reach solutions that would help de-escalate tensions and enhance security and stability in the region.”
                





Nuclear talks: Iran and the US have recently held several rounds of nuclear talks, most recently meeting in Rome in late May. A sixth round of nuclear deal talks was scheduled to take place in Oman on Sunday.
    


            Iraq has submitted an official complaint to the United Nations Security Council regarding the strikes, it continued, adding that “Iran reserves the right to respond and defend its sovereignty in proportion to the scale of the threat.”
    


            Radiation levels at Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz remain “unchanged,” according to the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
    


            “Radiation levels outside the Natanz facility remained unchanged. The type of radioactive contamination present inside the facility, mainly alpha particles, can be managed with appropriate protective measures,” IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said in a statement on X.



            The United Nations' nuclear watchdog confirmed that Natanz had been hit amid Israel's attack on Iran, but said earlier it had not observed an increase in radiation levels in the area.
    


            Iran summoned the Swiss ambassador in Tehran to deliver a warning to the United States, accusing Washington of complicity in Israel's attack.
    


                    “It is unthinkable that the Zionist regime's aggressive actions against Iran were carried out without cooperation, coordination, and at least a green light from the US, and in this regard, the US must be held accountable for its illegal behavior in this regard,” the Iranian representative told Nadine Lozano, the Swiss Ambassador to Tehran, according to a statement published on state run IRNA.
                





            Iran also warned against any US support for Israel during Tehran's response, “including by preventing Iran from exercising its right to legitimate defense,” the statement said.
    


Some context: The US and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and Switzerland serves as the official representative of US interests in the country.
    


            Israel's foreign minister said that Iran's “war against Israel” began with the Hamas-led October 7 attacks in 2023.
    


            “Already on October 8, 2023, the day after the terrible massacre, I wrote: Yesterday was the first day of Iran's war against Israel,” Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar wrote on Facebook.
    


            He said the attack on Iran was necessary to “remove from Israel the threat of annihilation.”
    


                    “In such situations, decision-makers must ask themselves not only what the gains and costs of military action will be, but also what the cost of inaction would be. In this case: placing Israel in danger of annihilation,” he continued.
                





For context: Iran, which has supported Hamas, has denied that it had any role in the October 7 attacks. Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser at the time, said days after the attack that the Biden administration didn't have direct evidence linking Tehran to the planning and execution of the assault. And multiple intelligence, military and congressional officials with access to classified intelligence told CNN that no direct evidence was found indicating Iran was directly involved.
    


            Sa'ar added that he has spoken to a number of his international counterparts, including foreign ministers from India, Germany, France, Italy, Hungary, Paraguay, Panama, and Cyprus, as well as the European Union.
    


                    “We already have significant achievements in the bold and impressive IDF operation in Iran. These must be deepened,” he wrote.
                





            President Donald Trump spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu several times on Thursday, including prior to Israel launching unprecedented strikes on Iran, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
    


            The source would not divulge the substance of the calls but reiterated that Trump believes the attack was a result of Iran failing to strike an agreement on a new nuclear deal before his 60-day deadline expired.
    


            Trump is set to speak to Netanyahu later today, according a US and an Israeli official.
    


            White House officials continue to argue that the president is committed to salvaging the ongoing nuclear talks with Iran. The source said special envoy Steve Witkoff is “ready” to meet Iranian officials when they are — whether it be in Oman on Sunday as previously scheduled or at some date thereafter.
    


            Iran's paralysis following Israel's massive strike against its nuclear facilities is unlikely to last, Iran experts say, warning that Tehran will imminently retaliate as a “Rubicon has been crossed.”
    


            “Iran's leadership is likely reeling, but that paralysis is unlikely to last,” Sina Toossi, senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, said in a statement to CNN.
    


                    “A large-scale retaliation, likely involving drone and missile strikes into Israeli territory, appears imminent,” Toossi said, adding that “rather than crippling Iran's military and nuclear capabilities, Israel's escalation risks fueling nationalist sentiment, solidifying internal cohesion and triggering a dangerous cycle of retaliation, all while increasing the likelihood of American entanglement.”
                





            Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, told CNN that it would be difficult for Iran not to retaliate, adding that Iran's response is likely to be bigger than its attack in October, which saw Iranian missiles attack Israeli military sites.
    


            It is unclear how long it will take Iran to recover from Israel's blows, however, Parsi said.
    


                    In its attack, Israel has “tried to kill off several of the norms around the use of force and international law, to essentially bring it down to a situation where it is law of the jungle,” Parsi said.
                





            Toossi added that Trump has warned Israel not to strike. “Whether that was a strategic ruse or genuine restraint is now irrelevant. The Rubicon has been crossed,” he said.
    


            The State Department stood up a task force to track developments and coordinate efforts in the need of any US evacuations from the Middle East on Thursday, before Israel carried out strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, two State Department officials said.
    


Why this matters: The task force serves as a convening mechanism for the department's wide intake of information and is standard practice when there is heightened security concerns.
    


            As of Friday, multiple embassies in the region were actively reviewing their posture, but officials said there had been no decision to further draw down personnel. One senior US diplomat saying that would only come if there was the expectation that US facilities and personnel in the country were going to be targeted in Iran's retaliation.
    


            The leaders of the United Kingdom, France and Germany spoke this morning following Israel's attack on Iran overnight, according to a spokesperson from the British Prime Minister's Office.
    


                    “The leaders discussed the long-held grave concerns about Iran's nuclear program, and called on all sides to refrain from further escalation that could further destabilize the region,” the statement said.
                





            “The leaders reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense, and agreed that a diplomatic resolution, rather than military action, was the way forward,” it added.
    


            President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal that Israel's attacks on Iran are “great for the market” because it means Iran won't have a nuclear weapon.
    


            “I think ultimately, it would be great for the market because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. It will be great for the market — should be the greatest thing ever for the market. Iran won't have a nuclear weapon that was a great threat to humanity,” he told the newspaper in a brief phone call.
    


            The Wall Street Journal also reported that Trump told the newspaper he had spoken with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday, plans to speak again today, and that his team was aware of Israel's plan to attack.
    


            When asked how much advance notice the United States had received, Trump said: “Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on.”
    


            Trump described the Israeli operation as “a very successful attack, to put it mildly.”
    


Remember: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there was no US involvement or assistance in the strikes.
    


            Iran has no choice but to retaliate against Israel's attack, US foreign policy expert and former US State Department adviser Vali Nasr told CNN's Becky Anderson, adding that it may take the shape of a prolonged war of attrition.
    


            Nasr added that if this attack was a tactic to bring Iran to the negotiating table, it is unlikely to work.
    


            Washington has long sought to limit Tehran's nuclear capacity, with the most recent negotiations in Rome last month ending with no agreement. A sixth round of US-Iran talks had been scheduled for Sunday in Oman — and it's not clear if it will go ahead.
    


            “Trump misunderstood Iran,” Nasr said, and now, “instead of talking, we're going to see use of weapons as a tool in the negotiations.”
    


                    “This regime's back is put to the wall. If it doesn't respond, it will lose all credibility, it will be weak and the Israelis are not going to stop,” Nasr said.
                





            Israel will “come to deeply regret” its “reckless aggression” in attacking Iran, the Iranian foreign minister said in a letter to the United Nations Security Council on Friday.
    


            Abbas Araghchi called for an urgent UN Security Council meeting, calling on the body to “strongly condemn this act of aggression” and “take urgent and concrete measures to hold this Israeli regime fully accountable for its crimes.”
    


            The attack on Iran was a “brazen and unlawful act,” as well as a “reckless and deliberate escalation that flagrantly violated the charter of the United Nations and the most fundamental norms of international law,” Araghchi wrote.
    


            “Israel, the most terrorist regime in the world, has now crossed every red line, and the international community must not allow these crimes to go unpunished,” the letter read.
    


            Iran will respond “decisively and proportionately to these unlawful and cowardly acts. The Islamic Republic of Iran will act with full resolve to protect its sovereignty, its people and its national security,” Araghchi said.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has held phone conversations with his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss the escalation in the Middle East following the Israeli strike against Iran.

Israel launched a major attack on Iran overnight targeting nuclear facilities and various military installations. The strikes continued into the day, inflicting considerable material damage and casualties on Iran's top military leadership and, reportedly, high-profile nuclear scientists.

“The Russian president expressed his condolences to the leadership and people of the Islamic Republic of Iran in connection with the numerous human casualties, including civilians, resulting from the Israeli strikes,” the Kremlin press service said in a statement on Friday.

Russia “condemns Israel's actions, which violate the UN Charter and international law,” Putin stressed, according to the statement. At the same time, the Russian leader expressed a readiness to mediate and to “continue to contribute to the de-escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel.”

Putin also underscored the importance of “returning to the negotiation process and resolving all issues related to the Iranian nuclear program exclusively through political and diplomatic means.” The ongoing escalation “is fraught with the most disastrous consequences for the entire region,” he warned.

The Israeli attack comes after five rounds of US-Iranian talks about Tehran's nuclear program that effectively stalled and failed to produce any tangible result. The sixth round of negotiations was expected to take place in Oman on Sunday.

Iran has vowed to retaliate for the attack, insisting that it “cannot have been carried out without the coordination and authorization of the United States.” US President Donald Trump claimed he knew about the impending strikes beforehand, describing them as “very successful.” Trump also suggested Tehran brought the attack upon itself through its alleged reluctance to strike a nuclear deal.

“We gave them a chance and they didn't take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you're going to get hit. And there's more to come. A lot more,” he said, commenting on the attack.

Immigrants are only the first target of a rapidly expanding digital dragnet that can track our individual movements.

Immigrants are only the first target of a rapidly expanding digital dragnet that can track our individual movements.

President Donald Trump's deployment of the National Guard and military against protesters in Los Angeles is widely being interpreted as a display of intimidation and state power ahead of his birthday, when Trump will oversee a military parade in Washington, D.C. in the style of a dictator. The president has warned that protesters in D.C. will be “met with very heavy force.” Democrats and civil rights groups say the president is inflaming tensions to justify further repression, crossing the line into blatant authoritarianism as demonstrations against his administration spread across the country.

However, perhaps the greatest consolidation of state power is not happening in the streets, but quietly being hammered out in courtrooms and behind closed doors, where Trump's campaign of mass deportation is being used to justify a rapid expansion and centralization of the surveillance state.

“The idea that this is something that just affects immigrants is wholly untrue,” said Matthew Guariglia, a senior policy analyst and digital rights watchdog at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an interview with Truthout. “I think immigrants are the first target; it is a permission structure, and if they can get away with doing these things to immigrants, what are the legal barriers from moving on to the next undesirable group?”

This reality became brutally apparent on June 8 as law enforcement attempted to quell a protest through intimidation in downtown Los Angeles. A booming voice from a police helicopter hovering above the crowd announced, “I have all of you on camera. I'm going to come to your house.” As Truthout has reported, law enforcement across the country have embraced facial recognition technology despite numerous studies showing such software is racist and results in false arrests. Pro-Israel extremists used facial recognition to dox campus activists during protests against the genocide in Gaza, including international students targeted by the Trump administration for deportation.

Meanwhile, Trump announced that wearing face masks would not be allowed at protests. The president does not have authority to outlaw masking by decree, but he doubled down on Monday with a social media post declaring, “REMEMBER, No Masks!”

In a blog post this week, Guariglia and his Electronic Frontier Foundation colleague Adam Schwartz argued that wearing a mask at a protest is a perfectly legitimate form of self-defense — and not just from airborne viruses. Forcing people to unmask in public is a violation of privacy.

“There has been a massive proliferation of surveillance camera networks, face recognition technology, and databases of personal information,” they wrote. “There also is a long law enforcement's history of harassing and surveilling people for publicly criticizing or opposing law enforcement practices and other government policies.”

In response to the crackdown in Los Angeles, some protesters attacked self-driving Waymo vehicles, which have cameras that law enforcement have used to collect data on the public. Without a human driver inside, the autonomous vehicles have become a potent symbol of the rapidly growing, high-tech surveillance state, according to Emerald Tse, an associate researcher at the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown University.

“More people are seeing these technologies deployed in even more contexts, and that's why people are paying more attention to this issue now,” Tse said in an interview with Truthout. “People were tagging and burning Waymos, which suggests that they viewed the vehicles as an extension of the surveillance state. Those autonomous cars are a way to watch everyone, and that information is going to the government.”

While mainstream media has framed the issue in terms of surveillance of immigrants, data on all Americans is being sucked into a growing digital dragnet. Guariglia and other privacy advocates are sounding the alarm over efforts by the Trump administration and its Silicon Alley partners to consolidate personal data on millions of people at the Social Security Administration and other federal agencies. As law enforcement increasingly turns to private companies to buy data instead of asking courts for search warrants, a data broker owned by major airlines has sold customer flight records and personal information to Customs and Border Patrol, according to an investigation by 404 Media.

“You are seeing that federal agents working under this current administration are very openly using surveillance technologies to trump our free speech, to completely violate our privacy, and not even giving personal privacy consideration anymore,” Tse said. “That is the thing that I am seeing that is new.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is in charge of Trump's mass deportation effort, has worked with local police departments to turn networks of traffic cameras and automated license plate readers into a nationwide surveillance system that by 2022 was operating in cities home to an estimated 75 percent of the adult population, according to the Center on Privacy & Technology. ICE — which has collected at least 1.5 million DNA samples from incarcerated immigrants for nationwide policing database — recently inked a $30 million contract for system that can track people's movements with “near real-time visibility” with Palantir, the controversial data fusion firm co-founded by right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel.

And even as Elon Musk, the audacious tech bro and Thiel's Silicon Valley rival, makes an unglamorous exit from the White House, the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (DOGE) “cost-cutting” project he started after Trump took office continues to dig deeper into our personal information. On Friday, the Supreme Court overturned lower court orders limiting DOGE's access to sensitive Social Security data, allowing Musk's colleagues unfettered access to personal information on millions of people while legal challenges wind through the courts.

The bolstering of the surveillance state goes all the way to the top. On March 20, as part of a flurry of moves meant to expand executive power before courts or Congress can intervene, Trump has issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to make all their digital data available to his political appointees. The order aims at “eliminating information silos,” which may sound innocuous in the digital age, but Guariglia said in many cases these silos were intentionally created by policy makers and Congress to protect personal data and maintain public trust.

“We like to envision government surveillance looking like hidden microphones in our houses, or the FBI looking through webcams, but we should also think about what happens when our bureaucratic information gets weaponized,” Guariglia said, adding that people will be reluctant to share personal information in order to file taxes or receive health benefits if they worry it could be used against them.

Real danger arises when government agencies use data for reasons other than why it was collected in the first place. Guariglia pointed to World War II, when authorities used census data to locate and force Japanese Americans into internment camps, a gross abuse of human rights that became one of the nation's darkest memories from that era. Census data is critical for maintaining government operations, but the system only works if people can trust that their data won't be used against them.

“A lot of these ‘silos' existed for specific purposes,” Guariglia said. “The 1929 Census Act was supposed to protect census data, and then the war thwarted that, and census data was used for Japanese internment.”

On May 30, The New York Times reported that the Trump administration is deploying Palantir's software to implement an executive order on information silos and share data across at least four federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (which includes ICE and Border Patrol) and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees health coverage for millions of people. The effort raises questions about whether the president is building a “master list” of U.S. citizens that would give him unprecedented surveillance powers, according to the report.

The report is based on public records and interviews with unnamed administration officials, and Palantir issued a statement denying that its software is being used to create a “master list” and accusing The New York Times of faulty reporting. Still, the news sparked angry protests on social media, with even hardcore Trump supporters expressing dismay that their leader had “flipped” and fell in line with the so-called Deep State, a bogeyman at the center of various conspiracy theories that Trump promoted on the campaign trail.

“Surveillance technology companies are the ones that are profiting off our taxpayer dollars, and they are doing it at the expense of our privacy free speech and human rights,” Tse said. “Palantir is just one of them. The current Trump administration is continuing to try to invest more in surveillance technology, and they have said that openly.”

Tse said government surveillance accelerated after 9/11 and continued to grow as technology advanced under Republican and Democratic administrations. In 2022, the Center on Privacy & Technology released an investigation into the sweeping surveillance powers deployed by ICE to deport immigrants, which includes accessing datasets containing detailed personal records of the vast majority of the people in the United States. By 2022, ICE had access to the driver's license data of 75 percent of adults in the U.S. and had scanned license photos for one-third of all adults, according to the report.

The Center on Privacy & Technology rereleased the report with an updated forward in May. The original report documented surveillance infrastructure that could one day be used by an authoritarian president to “coerce and control” the U.S. population at scale. “We did not anticipate that this day would come within three years,” the authors wrote in the updated version.

On May 27, the tech reporters at 404 Media released a report and a trove of government records showing that ICE is accessing data from automated license plate readers that are powered by AI and installed by local police in communities across the country. These devices scan license plates, allowing police to pull up information on drivers and track their movements. ICE does not have a contract to use the license plate readers or the data they collect, but records show ICE agencies lodged at least 4,000 requests with local police to access data on drivers as part of criminal and immigration investigations.

“Automated license plate readers, I think pound for pound is probably the surveillance system in America that most captures people and most affects people at this current moment,” Guariglia said. “It is possible months later, years later, to fully recreate people's daily routes in their cars just by accessing this data at intersections and cameras on the street.”

Guariglia said privacy advocates are constantly on the lookout for policing that involves gathering large amounts of random data that have nothing to do with specific crimes they are investigating, as such practices can be violations of privacy and civil liberties. Another 404 Media investigation recently revealed that a local sheriff's office in Texas searched data from 83,000 license plate readers and more than 6,000 cameras across multiple states in an attempt to track down a women suspected of seeking abortion care in the state. Abortion is banned in Texas, but the sheriff's office was able to search cameras located in Washington and Illinois where access to abortion remains protected.

“Once all that data is just collected and sitting on computers and collected by police departments, there are no rules dictating what they can do with it, and who they can give it to,” Guariglia said.

The cuts have already caused some 300,000 deaths and could lead to more than 3 million preventable deaths per year.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ordered the termination of all remaining overseas employees of USAID to complete the dismantling of the six-decade-old agency. USAID was an early target of Elon Musk and DOGE. We look at the dismantling of USAID and what it means for people around the world to lose this lifeline, as detailed in a new Amnesty International report. “We talked to somebody who actually saw IVs being ripped out of arms when the stop-work order came down,” says Amnesty's Amanda Klasing, who describes the consequences of the U.S.'s retraction of critical aid to countries in the Global South and refutes the Trump administration's claims that no deaths can be traced to the cuts. Now, lacking funding from the wealthiest country in the world, aid workers like Jan Egeland of the Norwegian Refugee Council are turning to other countries' governments to bridge the gap. Egeland says, “The U.S. is leaving international solidarity and compassion completely,” even though, as Klasing notes, “It's been the leader of humanitarian aid, and it should remain so.”

Vishwash Kumar Ramesh must have acted fast to seize his unlikely chance to escape, say experts in crashes and safety

‘I saw people dying in front of my eyes': British survivor describes Air India crash

Tony Cable, a former senior air crash investigator, has one piece of advice for Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the Air India plane disaster: “Buy a lottery ticket straight away.”

The 40-year-old Briton walked away from the wreckage of flight AI171 after it crashed less than a minute after takeoff from Ahmedabad to London on Thursday, killing 241 other passengers and crew and dozens more on the ground.

Surviving with minor physical injuries seemed miraculous, but the focus on how Ramesh may have stayed alive turned to his seat on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner – 11A, an emergency exit seat near the front of the plane and close to one of the strongest parts of the fuselage known as the “wing box”.

After the plane slammed into buildings about 30 seconds after takeoff, Ramesh thought he was dead, but when he realised he was alive he saw an opening in the fuselage. “I managed to unbuckle myself, used my leg to push through that opening, and crawled out,” he said. It was not clear whether this opening was the door or a rupture in the fuselage.

“The aircraft was pretty nose up when it hit the buildings,” said Cable, a former senior inspector of air accidents at the UK Air Accidents Investigations Branch. “It has presumably broken open in an area of the fuselage adjacent to this guy and fortuitously he has popped out without major injury.”

Ramesh's seat had space, rather than seats, immediately in front of it, which may have given him more room for escape than many of his fellow passengers. It may also have meant that while the passengers in front of him may have been crushed together on impact, he avoided that fate, Prof John McDermid, Lloyd's Register chair of safety at the University of York, said.

“My suspicion is that because of the nature of the impact, he was in a strong part of the airplane at the front edge of the wing,” he added. “There is not just the fuselage, but the extra structure of the wing to protect from the compression of the fuselage.”

“It's possible that the impact loosened the door and he could kick it out and get out,” McDermid said. “The external door was only just in front of him so he didn't have far to go.”

But before Ramesh could even consider an escape, he had to have the luck to survive the impact of the crash.

“If you've got an accident like this, where you've got an aircraft full of fuel and it's making a crash landing off the airport into the built environment, that's unlikely to be a survivable accident,” said Prof Ed Galea, an expert in fire safety and evacuation at the University of Greenwich. “The fact that anyone has survived is miraculous.

“He seems to have been lucky in that: a) he survived the trauma of the impact, b) he wasn't severely injured in that crash, and c) he was sitting right by the No 2 exit. Whether he used that or exited via a rupture that was close by, is not clear. But he was very close to an exit point.”

Galea has previously carried out research on plane crashes which found that, in less devastating crashes, people sitting within five rows of a serviceable exit have a greater chance of surviving than dying while those more than five rows away were more likely to perish. He said he always tries to reserve a seat within five rows of an emergency exit.

Galea said other passengers may have also survived the impact but were too injured to evacuate or were not close enough to an exit point. Passengers who did not adopt the brace position may have struck their heads on the seats in front of them knocking them unconscious, but there were no seats immediately in front of Ramesh.

While the structure of the plane may have given him a chance at survival, Ramesh still needed to move fast to take that chance, said McDermid. “If he hadn't got out in a very few seconds, he would have been unlikely to make it out because of the fireball,” he added.

The plane had enough fuel on board to carry it to London Gatwick and this appeared to ignite upon impact.

Galea said Ramesh may have found himself exiting in front of the fireball if the aviation fuel had been pouring from the ruptured tanks in a rearward direction.

“He was a very, very unlucky man being on that airplane, but he was also a very, very lucky man being able to get out,” McDermid concluded.

People who use Medicaid make up half of the total patient volume nationwide for the clinics' health care services.

If the budget reconciliation package before the U.S. Senate becomes law in the coming weeks, reproductive health advocates say the provision that would cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood clinics could serve as a backdoor nationwide abortion ban, eliminating access to 1 in 4 abortion providers.

The Republican-led bill, which already passed the House by a slim margin, is more than 1,000 pages and includes sweeping tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy coupled with steep spending cuts to social services, including Medicaid.

On page 339 of the bill, Republicans included a provision prohibiting Medicaid funding from going to any sexual and reproductive health clinics that provide abortions and received more than $1 million in federal and state Medicaid funding in fiscal year 2024. While there may be a few independent clinics with operating budgets that high, it effectively singles out Planned Parenthood clinics.

Planned Parenthood clinics rely heavily on Medicaid funding, not to provide abortions, which is not permitted by federal law (except in cases of rape, incest or life-threatening health emergencies), but to provide standard reproductive health care at little to no cost, including treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, as well as contraception. Planned Parenthood provides services for about 2 million patients every year, and 64% of its clinics are in rural areas or places with health care provider shortages.

A Planned Parenthood spokesperson said people who use Medicaid make up half of the total patient volume nationwide for essential health care services provided by their clinics. Even though those patients aren't seeking abortion care, funding cuts would affect the financial sustainability of those clinics, the spokesperson said.

The organization already identified that 200 of its clinics in 24 states are at risk of closure with the cuts but told States Newsroom on Thursday that further analysis revealed nearly all of those clinics — 90% — are in states where abortion is legal, and in 12 states, approximately 75% of abortion-providing Planned Parenthood health centers could close. The entire organization has about 600 clinics in 48 states.

The “One Big Beautiful Bill” would result in nearly 11 million people losing access to health insurance by 2034, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and add $2.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next 10 years.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told States Newsroom she and other advocates have been meeting with senators to lobby against the bill's passage, emphasizing that it will have an outsized negative effect on rural clinics and hospitals.

“We are encouraging everyone to reach out to their representatives about this,” McGill Johnson said. “They know that they're doing this under a watchful eye, and we want to make sure their constituents know about it.”

The defunding effort would be a win for several prominent anti-abortion organizations that have long lobbied for this change and nearly achieved it in 2017 with a similar budget bill. Americans United for Life sent a fundraising email to its supporters Thursday saying this is a “crossroads” for abortion in America. 

“So far in 2025 more than a dozen Planned Parenthood clinics have closed, their taxpayer funding is hanging by a thread, and the highest-ranking federal health officials are undertaking a ‘top-to-bottom review' on the abortion pill,” the email attributed to CEO John Mize said. “It's possible that very soon, mail-order abortion could be walked back, and more Planned Parenthood locations could be closing their doors for good.”

Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, another anti-abortion organization that helped draft the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint for the next Republican president, told States Newsroom in an emailed statement that the budget provision should be no surprise, and there are better uses for the funding, like community health centers.

“Republicans have identified budgetary concerns with funding Big Abortion since 2015, and the bill language to do so has remained substantially the same,” said SBA President Marjorie Dannenfelser.

Planned Parenthood has already closed some clinics around the country, including eight clinics across Iowa and Minnesota at the end of May. Dr. Sarah Traxler, chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood North Central States, which includes Iowa and Minnesota, said the U.S. Health and Human Services' decision to freeze Title X family planning funding to many reproductive health clinics at the beginning of May contributed to the decision to close those clinics. The North Central States affiliates serve more than 93,000 patients each year, about 20,000 of which use telehealth services.

About 30% of those patients use Medicaid to access care, she said.

“When Planned Parenthood isn't able to provide services to patients as an essential safety net provider, it has ripple effects across the health care system at large,” Traxler said. “We are already sitting in a time in our country, and have for several decades, where we have patients who can't access care.”

Clare Coleman, president and CEO of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association, told States Newsroom that 865 Title X clinics in 23 states are impacted by the federal freeze. She said there are no Title X services in eight states: California, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Tennessee and Utah. She said the funding freeze affects one-quarter of all Title X funding grantees, translating to about 842,000 patients who have lost access to care.

“In the two months since HHS withheld federal funding for nearly two dozen Title X family planning grants, affected grantees have been struggling with the unknown of whether they will ever receive the vital funds,” Coleman said in an email. “Some have had to close clinics, lay off staff, and reduce essential contraceptive and sexual health care services. … On top of the Title X funding freeze, proposed Medicaid cuts will be devastating for Title X grantees. Rates of unintended pregnancies and STIs will increase, cancer screenings and diagnoses will be delayed, and decades of public health progress will be reversed.”

After the Iowa Legislature axed Planned Parenthood from its family planning program, Traxler said, the rates of sexually transmitted infections increased considerably across the state — an outcome verified by a 2022 medical study. She expects similar effects from these cuts.

People already travel long distances for abortion care, she said, and that will only get worse if more cuts come to pass. But she also expects to see patients start traveling long distances for routine gynecological care.

Like many independent abortion clinics, the all-trimester Maryland abortion clinic Partners in Abortion Care does not receive Title X funding. But because Maryland is one of 17 states whose Medicaid program covers abortions, they do see a lot of patients who are on Medicaid, at a significant cost to the clinic. Certified nurse-midwife and Partners co-founder Morgan Nuzzo said the clinic did not receive more than $1 million in federal or state Medicaid dollars in fiscal year 2024, and in fact loses about $1 million annually for seeing Medicaid patients.

Nuzzo said Maryland's Medicaid program reimburses first-trimester abortions at a “decent rate,” but at a very low rate for later abortion cases, which are more medically complex.

“After about 15 to 16 weeks [gestation], we're losing money on these cases,” Nuzzo said. “We've been billing now for almost a year through the state. In second and third-trimester abortion care, we're losing about 85% of what we would charge for a cash pay fee. So that comes out to about $250,000 a quarter that we are losing just by the under-reimbursement from Maryland Medicaid.”

For that reason, Nuzzo is hopeful about Maryland's new $25 million Public Health Abortion Grant Program, recently approved by Gov. Wes Moore. The program will be open to clinics like Partners and abortion funds like the Baltimore Abortion Fund, but Nuzzo said it could be a while before that funding is available. Right now she is uncertain and concerned about how the federal reconciliation bill could potentially impact Maryland's Medicaid program. 

Because Partners provides abortions for all trimesters, they see patients from all over the country, and even the world, and the vast majority need financial assistance, Nuzzo said.

“People are traveling further for their procedures, just like they were before,” she said. “The landscape is constantly changing, almost week to week, about where you can access abortion, which is confusing and chaotic to patients. Changes to Medicaid and insurance coverage of abortion only adds to the chaos.”

            Shortly before sunrise in Iran on Friday, Israel launched the first strikes of its operation against the regime's nuclear program.
    


            That operation, called “Rising Lion,” had two prongs: Heavy airstrikes against at least one of Iran's enrichment sites, and more targeted strikes in Tehran to decapitate the regime's military leadership. It aimed to halt what Israel said was Tehran's rapid progress in developing nuclear weapons.
    


            Israel's attack came after years of threats and days of heightened speculation – but without the United States' blessing. The Trump administration stressed that Israel acted unilaterally and that Washington was “not involved.”
    


            Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the operation would continue “for as many days as it takes” to eliminate Iran's nuclear threat. Tehran, which insists its nuclear program is peaceful, says it has “no option but to respond.”
    


            Here's what you need to know.
    


            Iran has not seen such a widespread assault in a single day since the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s. Israel targeted locations all across the capital city, Tehran, and around the country.
    


            The first explosions tore through Tehran at around 3.30 a.m. Friday (8 p.m. ET Thursday). Videos geolocated by CNN showed flames and smoke billowing from buildings across the city.
    


            Residents of Tehran were blindsided. Many did not expect Israel to strike so swiftly. “I didn't know what was happening. It was really scary,” a 17-year-old Iranian told CNN, requesting anonymity due to safety concerns.
    


            Shortly after explosions rocked Tehran, Israel also struck elsewhere in the country. Israel's military said it used jets to strike “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”
    


            An explosion was reported at Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Tehran.
    


            The United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), confirmed that Natanz had been hit, but said it had not observed an increase in radiation levels in the area.
    


            Rafael Grossi, the head of the IAEA, said other nuclear facilities in Iran – Isfahan, Bushehr and Fordow – were not impacted. The Fordow site is buried under a mountain, and is considered a much harder target for Israel.
    


            In a televised address, Netanyahu said Israel had taken action to “roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,” and said it would continue its operation for as long as it takes “to remove these threats.”
    


            Netanyahu claimed that Iran had in recent years produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine nuclear weapons.
    


            “Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time. It could be a year, it could be within a few months,” he said. “This is a clear and present danger to Israel's survival.”
    


            The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also said it had destroyed Iran's ballistic missile launch sites and stockpiles.
    


            Several of the most important men in Iran's military and its nuclear program were killed in Israel's strikes.
    


            Maj. Gen. Hossein Salami, head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was the highest-profile of those killed.
    


            Israel also said it killed Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran's armed forces; Ali Shamkhani, a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei; and Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC's air force.
    


            Iran retaliated almost immediately. The IDF said Tehran fired more than 100 drones toward Israel on Friday morning. But most appear to have been intercepted.
    


            Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian urged the Iranian people to remain unified and trust Iran's leadership.
    


            “The nation needs unity… more than ever,” he added.
    


            After a series of lethal and embarrassing Israeli blows against the Iranian regime, it is not clear how Tehran might attempt to exact retribution.
    


            Following previous Israeli attacks against Iran and its proxies in the region, Tehran fired back with huge salvos of ballistic missiles.
    


            The Institute for the Study of War, a think tank in Washington DC, said this time it was “possible that Israel somehow disrupted Iran's response by targeting Iran's ballistic missile launch sites and stockpiles.”
    


            The Trump administration – which has been pursuing a diplomatic path with Iran in recent weeks – sought to distance itself from Israel's attack.
    


            Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel's actions were “unilateral.” Although Israel notified the US ahead of its strikes, Rubio said the US was “not involved” in the attack.
    


            “Our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” he added. Earlier this week, the US had made efforts to arrange the departure of non-essential personnel from various countries in the Middle East, leading to speculation that an Israeli attack on Iran could be imminent.
    


            US President Donald Trump urged Iran to agree to a new nuclear deal “before there is nothing left,” suggesting that follow-up Israeli attacks on the country would be “even more brutal.”
    


            Trump said he had given Iran “chance after chance” to make a deal. “JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform.
    


            Under a 2015 nuclear deal struck by former US President Barack Obama, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed to drastically limit its number of centrifuges and cap uranium enrichment at levels far below those required to make weapons, in exchange for sanctions relief.
    


            But during his first term as president in 2018, Trump withdrew from the JCPOA, saying the “rotten structure” of the agreement was not enough to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb. He ramped up sanctions on Iran and threatened to sanction any country that helped the regime to obtain nuclear weapons.
    


            In his second term, Trump has revived efforts to strike a new nuclear deal with Iran. Just hours before Israel's strikes, the president cautioned Israel against launching an attack while US-Iran talks are ongoing.
    


            “As long as I think there is an agreement, I don't want them going in because that would blow it. Might help it, actually, but also could blow it,” Trump said.

Israel has launched unprecedented strikes on Iran, targeting its nuclear program and military leaders. Israel's spy agency, Mossad, released video of operatives inside Iran before the strikes.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha warned on June 13 that Russia has begun preparing strategic military reserves, signaling plans for military operations that may extend beyond Ukraine.

"According to our intelligence, Russia has started to prepare strategic reserves, which indicates plans for combat operations not only in Ukraine," Sybiha said during the Globsec conference in Prague, calling for urgent diplomatic and economic pressure. 

"Allies need full diplomatic mobilization to stop this war. This is not just a question for Ukraine. (Russian President Vladimir) Putin only understands strength, and right now it's crucial to apply sanctions in a timely manner, using them as economic weapons to pressure Russia," Sybiha said.

The comments come as Russia intensifies its military offensives and missile strikes across Ukraine, despite participating in two recent rounds of peace talks in Istanbul. The first talks were held on May 16, followed by a second meeting on June 2. While both rounds produced agreements on prisoner exchanges, they failed to secure a ceasefire.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said in a June 12 interview with Germany's Bild newspaper that Russia is using the talks to delay tougher U.S. sanctions, while continuing to escalate attacks on Ukrainian cities.

Russia also continues to issue nuclear threats to Western countries. Putin claimed on June 11 that Russia possesses the world's most advanced nuclear systems, with 95% of its strategic nuclear forces reportedly made up of modern equipment. 

Putin emphasized the need to significantly strengthen Russia's ground forces. Russian defense spending has surged to 6.3% of GDP, the highest level since the Cold War, as Moscow continues to ramp up its military investment amid the ongoing war.

Kyiv on June 13 expressed concern over the security situation in the Middle East after Israeli air strikes against Iran, but stressed that Tehran remains a "source of problems" in the region "and beyond."

The statement follows what Israel called a "preemptive" strike against Iran overnight on June 13, targeting the country's nuclear program and reportedly killing top military officials.

"We would like to remind you that the Iranian regime supports Russia in its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine and provides Moscow with weapons to kill Ukrainians," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

Along with North Korea, Iran has been a key ally to Russia during its full-scale war against Ukraine, providing thousands of Shahed strike drones and short-range ballistic missiles.

Ukraine has called upon the international community "to take joint and decisive action" and deter a "group of aggressive regimes — Russia, Iran, and North Korea."

Kyiv nevertheless also warned that further hostilities could destabilize the region with "negative consequences for international security and global financial stability, especially in oil markets."

Israeli strikes were quickly followed by a surge in oil prices, Russia's key export commodity, with Brent and Nymex crude prices jumping by more than 10%.

"We are convinced that restoring peace and stability in the Middle East will serve the interests not only of the region but also of the entire international community," the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.

Iran has pledged a response to Israeli air strikes and accused the United States of "also being responsible for the dangerous consequences of this reckless escalation." The Trump administration has acknowledged it knew about the operation in advance but denied any involvement.

According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Tehran has already launched over 100 drones against Israel in response.

The attacks took place amid escalating tensions in the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump's push to find a diplomatic solution to Iran's nuclear aspirations. A round of indirect U.S.-Iranian negotiations in Oman was scheduled for June 15.

Russia has condemned Israel's attacks as "unprovoked aggression" and a violation of the U.N. Charter.

The G7 summit is being held in Kananaskis, Alta., next week amid a burgeoning trade war sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs.Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press

The four European members of the G7 face a delicate summit in Kananaskis, Alta. They know that U.S. President Donald Trump is in attack-dog mode on tariffs, defence spending and other issues and that lashing out against him could backfire. 

Ian Lesser, distinguished fellow of the German Marshall Fund of the United States and executive director of the public policy think tank's Brussels office, believes the G7 will focus on Mr. Trump – but the goal will be to avoid antagonizing him. 

“They aren't looking for a fight with Trump,” he said. “Part of their victory would be just having him there and engaged without any overt conflict with him.”

The non-American members of the G7 – Canada, Japan, Italy, France, Germany and Britain – know from experience that Mr. Trump can be a force of disruption at the summits, as he was in 2017 in Taormina, Sicily. There, he berated the other six for skimpy defence spending, threatened to leave the Paris climate agreement (which he later did) and shunned the traditional closing news conference. 

Ditto at the 2018 summit in La Malbaie, Que. Mr. Trump left it early after a spat about trade with then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The U.S. did not appear in the final G7 communiqué.

The two-day summit in Kananaskis begins June 15, and the non-U.S. members no doubt have spent months plotting strategies. One option is to present a united front against Mr. Trump on tariffs, China, defence spending, support for Ukraine – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend – and other issues. Another option is to go soft on demands for fear of triggering Mr. Trump's wrath, which could see him unleash another round of tariffs.

Carney should ignore any antics from Trump at G7 and focus on business, Chrétien says

Certainly, the six have plenty of reasons to be wary of Mr. Trump – and furious with him – for the turmoil he has inflicted on global trade. Since taking office in January, he has imposed double- and triple-digit tariffs on America's trading partners, reversed or lowered them several times, then threatened to reimpose them, as he did in May with his vow to hit the EU with a 50-per-cent trade tax (now suspended until July 9). Today there is a baseline tariff of 10 per cent on most countries, though not Canada and Mexico, plus a 25-per-cent levy on autos. Early this month, Mr. Trump doubled the tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 per cent, a level high enough to cripple Canadian exports of both products. 

A Reuters analysis says the tariffs have cost the biggest companies in the U.S., Europe and Asia – among them Porsche, Apple and Sony – more than US$34-billion in lost sales and higher expenses. The analysis did not include the damage inflicted on the thousands of smaller companies that are not listed on the leading stock market indexes such as the S&P 500 or Europe's Stoxx 600.

Since all the non-U.S. G7 members, plus the European Union itself (whose leaders will also be in Kananaskis), are in various stages of negotiating new trade deals with the White House, they will be wary of jeopardizing any progress they have made so far by angering Mr. Trump. For instance, if the EU fails to negotiate a trade deal by the July deadline, the threatened 50-per-cent levy may come into effect. If it does, the EU would almost certainly plunge into recession. 

“Tariffs are the keystone of his approach to the world, and no international meeting is going to change this,” said trade lawyer Lawrence Herman of Toronto's Herman & Associates. “Until the Trump ascendancy, G7 leaders tended to find consensus on major issues. It's hard to see that happening in Kananaskis, especially given Trump's unpredictability as well as the adversarial relationship between the U.S. and the Europeans and Canada.”

Since convincing Mr. Trump to back down on tariffs seems like a long shot, progress elsewhere may be pursued. Bulking up militaries will almost certainly be included. In principle, all the G7 countries agree that spending has to rise, especially among the EU countries, which face the prospect of the U.S. winding down its commitment to NATO, leaving Europe less able to confront a revanchist Russia. 

Carney lays out defence boost, says era of U.S. dominance over

NATO's current defence spending target for its 32 member states is 2 per cent of GDP. Mr. Trump wants to see it rise to 5 per cent. NATO, whose own summit will be held June 24-26 in the Dutch city of The Hague, is set to embrace that figure, though it could be fudged by allowing 3.5 per cent in hard military spending and the rest for infrastructure, cybersecurity and other outlays not directly related to weapons or military headcounts.

Defence spending in much of Western Europe, especially Germany, is surging. In March, the German parliament ripped up the government's “debt brake,” which will allow Chancellor Friedrich Merz to spend essentially unlimited amounts to rebuild the country's military and infrastructure. 

Still, some countries will resist doubling their military budgets. They will have to consider their positions carefully ahead of the G7 and NATO summits, since Mr. Trump has been insistent since his first term as president that the U.S. will no longer support a NATO full of cheapskates. Italy will almost certainly argue that it already has one of the biggest militaries in Europe, including two aircraft carriers and an order for 115 Lockheed Martin F-35s, the most advanced fighter jets in the NATO arsenal, suggesting that its relatively small military budget in no way means it is an inefficient spender.

With agreements on tariffs and defence bound to be hard work at the G7, easier victories will likely be sought. Mr. Lesser said they might strive for a common front on the relationship with China in areas such as intellectual property, investment screening and disapproval of Beijing's support for Moscow as the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues.

What is known is that Mr. Trump will be the wild card at the Canadian G7, as he was at previous G7s.

Editor's note: A previous version of of this article incorrectly stated that the G7 summit in Kananaskis begins June 17. It begins June 15 and ends June 17.

U.S. President Donald Trump on June 12 praised Russia's role in World War II, saying Russian President Vladimir Putin is "confused" why everyone "hates" Moscow.

Speaking at a White House press conference, Trump recounted a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron about World War II commemorations. 

"I said, 'You're celebrating our victory?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, "Your victory?'" Trump said. 

"And then I spoke to President Putin at the time. He lost 51 million people. He (sic!) fought with us in World War II. Russia did fight. It's interesting, isn't it? It fought with us in World War II, and everyone hates it.

"And now everybody hates Russia and loves Germany and Japan. It's a strange world."

Trump said Putin had expressed confusion over the West's treatment of Russia post-war, citing the Soviet Union's wartime alliance with the U.S. and U.K. 

"We were your ally," Putin allegedly told Trump. "Now everybody hates Russia."

Trump's remarks align with a Kremlin propaganda narrative that downplays the Soviet Union's World War II non-Russian casualties. According to Ukraine's Institute of National Remembrance, Ukraine alone lost more than 10 million people during the war and suffered immense destruction on its territory — a fact often overlooked in Kremlin-led historical revisionism.

Russia has frequently weaponized its version of World War II history to justify present-day aggression. The Kremlin has invoked anti-Nazi rhetoric and Soviet-era heroism to rationalize its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, launched in February 2022 — a war that has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the displacement of millions.

Trump has positioned himself as the only leader capable of ending the Russia-Ukraine war, but his reluctance to apply real pressure on Moscow has left Kyiv and its allies doubtful. The U.S. president has softened his tone on Russia while repeatedly threatening sanctions over its attacks on Ukraine — yet no new measures have been imposed.

Talking at the press conference about the war and the stalled peace efforts, Trump said he was "disappointed" with both Russia and Ukraine, adding that "deals could have been made."

Trump has previously said that he refrained from imposing additional sanctions in hopes of securing a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. 

"If I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that," he said on May 28, adding that a decision would come "in about two weeks."

Despite failed peace efforts in Istanbul and Russia's continued refusal to agree to a ceasefire, Trump reportedly asked Senate Republicans to delay voting on a bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose a 500% tariff on imports from countries buying Russian oil. 

The legislation, introduced in April, has broad bipartisan support, including backing from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

Meanwhile, Russia continues its offensive in Ukraine and has shown no signs of seeking peace. It continues escalating its attacks on Ukrainian cities, causing numerous civilian casualties.

When a black Jeep rolled into the Home Depot car park just after 8.30am on Friday morning, Abraham sprung into action.

As Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents dressed in vests and helmets climbed out of their blacked-out vehicle, he did his best to warn his fellow illegal migrants camped outside the hardware store in search of work.

“La migra! La migra!” he screamed, before sprinting away from the scene. Dozens of people tried to follow him.

“I felt very scared when I saw them coming but I ran like a flash and they didn't get me,” he says.

Like the 100 or so men who gather daily outside the DIY shop in Westlake, Los Angeles, that morning Abraham had been hoping to pick up a day's work from customers in need of help for their home improvements.

Most of those he was standing with are undocumented.

Nicaragua-born Abraham managed to escape but not everyone was so lucky.

At least 40 men, some of whom had lived in the US for decades, were handcuffed and detained by ICE agents who had raided a string of workplaces and Home Depot locations that morning, sparking a wave of volatile protests which have gripped Los Angeles and spread to more than 35 other cities.

Despite the pervasive threat of deportation, Abraham was back at the Home Depot parking lot on Wednesday morning to resume his search for work.

The targeting of day labourers in Home Depots, workers at car washes and clothing manufacturers marks a gear change in the administration's attempts to ramp up its deportation efforts in order to fulfil Donald Trump's “largest deportation program” in US history.

While officials had initially focused their efforts on those with criminal records, Stephen Miller, the architect of Mr Trump's hardline immigration policy, instructed ICE field officers to begin widening their nets.

Mr Miller has set a target of “at least” 3,000 arrests a day, a steep jump from the roughly 660 daily arrests during Mr Trump's first 100 days in office. He is understood to have directed ICE chiefs to start targeting spots where migrants congregate, specifically naming Home Depot.

It is a move that has drawn fierce opposition from not only Mr Trump's political opponents such as Gavin Newsom, the Democrat governor, but also from some of the Republican leader's supporters, with Florida State Senator Ileana Garcia, the co-founder of Latinas for Trump, saying the move was “not what we voted for”.

While demonstrations have brought parts of the state to a standstill, the ICE raids have continued at pace, with uniformed officers chasing farmworkers through fields and turning up at churches to arrest migrants.

While the majority of migrants have stayed home amid the ongoing threat, Abraham, a father-of-two, who crossed the El Paso border with Ciudad Juarez three years ago, says he has no choice but to take the risk and continue his search for work at Home Depot.

“I'm not afraid to come... I have to work because if I don't work I can't eat,” he tells The Telegraph as he cools himself from the California sun with a pink plastic portable fan.

Obdulio, another undocumented worker who managed to flee the Home Depot raid on Friday, had also returned on Wednesday despite seeing at least a dozen people “grabbed” by ICE agents.

The Guatemalan, who has lived in the US for 20 years, was frustrated he could not do anything to help his friends.

“You can't confront them because they're going to take you away, so what we did was shout at people to run and we kept running,” he says.

Obdulio, 48, who did not want to give his last name, told The Telegraph: “We are still in fear because we've heard ICE is still roaming here.”

“We're not criminals, we come to work honestly without harming anyone,” he adds.

Standing on the other side of the Westlake Home Depot car park, Edwin Cuadra, who is from Guatemala and has a green card, recounted how he saw ICE agents arriving on Friday morning in his car's wing mirror.

“Those who don't have papers had to escape, they started running,” he says.

The number of people out looking for work has since dwindled, he says, because migrants are terrified they will be caught.

“It's very bad,” he adds, becoming tearful. “They are my brothers, like my family. They need the money to pay rent, to pay bills.”

On the sixth day of demonstrations in Los Angeles, a largely peaceful protest of around 1,000 protesters briefly became chaotic when police on horseback charged at protesters and hit them with wooden rods before the area's 8pm curfew came into effect.

Officers fired rubber bullets and pepper balls into the crowd before carrying out dozens of arrests and packing protesters into police vans, but the streets downtown were mostly quiet by 9pm.

In recent days demonstrations across the city at times became violent, with some agitators setting fire to cars and throwing Molotov cocktails, fireworks and rocks at police.

Some of the thousands of National Guard troops controversially deployed by Mr Trump despite governor Gavin Newsom insisting they were not needed have been assisting ICE officers as they round up illegal migrants on raids, standing by with their rifles as agents arrest and detain people.

The 700 Marines sent into Los Angeles by Mr Trump will also accompany ICE agents on missions, officials have said, sparking fears that the administration could further intensify the pace of its raids.

Mr Newsom has warned the unprecedented militarisation of the state would spread further.

“Democracy is under assault right before our eyes,” he said on Tuesday. “California may be first, but it clearly won't end here.”

The Department of Homeland Security released an Uncle Sam style poster on social media on Wednesday urging members of the public to report “foreign invaders”.

As ICE raids continued in spite of the protests, on Monday morning a Home Depot in Huntington Park, around eight miles away from the Westlake branch, was targeted.

Eduardo Baz, 45, who illegally crossed into the US from Honduras 20 years ago, was lucky to have escaped. He had been a safe distance away when he saw federal agents starting to detain migrants in the car park at around 7.30am.

The only saving grace, he says, was that it was early so not many people had arrived at the shop. On Wednesday morning he was one of a handful of migrants who had returned to the car park hoping to pick up work.

“Of course we're all afraid,” he says. “All these years later, they can send you home in one swoop.”

“You're never calm, you're always afraid they might catch you at any moment.”

MOSCOW, June 12. /TASS/. Operators of fiber-optic drones of the Bars-27 detachment of the Volunteer corps as part of Battlegroup South have hit a Ukrainian UAV control point and a camouflaged mortar in the Kramatorsk direction, the press service of the corps told TASS.

"Bars-27 detachment fighters in the Kramatorsk direction first shot down the enemy's DJI Matrice 30 reconnaissance drone, after which they exposed the launch point and hit it with a fiber-optic drone," the press service said.

The detachment fighters also attacked the Ukrainian army's camouflaged mortar position with drones as it was detected by the air when the crew was camouflaging the position.

Canada's main stock index declined on Friday, dragged down by losses in technology shares, as Israel's wide-scale strikes on Iran dampened global risk appetite.

The S&P/TSX composite index was down 0.5 per cent at 26,490.64 points.

Israel has warned that the strikes were the start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon. Iran has promised a harsh response.

However, U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program, saying there was still time for the country to prevent further conflict with Israel.

The downturn in the TSX was limited as investors shifted to safe-haven assets, boosting metal mining shares. The materials sector gained 0.6 per cent.

The energy sector rose 1.7 per cent to be the top gainer as the tensions in the Middle East sparked worries about supply disruptions, boosting crude prices.

“I don't think it's any surprise that Toronto Stock Exchange is going to hold up greater than New York, which is more based on technology or multinational corporations,” said Allan Small, senior investment advisor at Allan Small Financial Group with iA Private Wealth.

“Gold and oil make up a big chunk of our market and anything commodities-based is relatively going to do well.”

The technology sector fell 1.5 per cent, while the heavyweight financial stocks were down nearly 1 per cent.

The benchmark index achieved a second consecutive record high on Thursday and appears poised to secure its third straight weekly gain, provided losses remain contained.

As of midmorning south of the border, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 659.45 points, or 1.52 per cent, to 42,313.10, the S&P 500 lost 60.38 points, or 1.00 per cent, to 5,984.88 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 227.71 points, or 1.16 per cent, to 19,435.01.

Oil prices surged nearly 7 per cent on fears the conflict could disrupt crude supply from the Middle East. U.S. energy stocks rose in tandem, with Exxon up 1.7 per cent.

Airline stocks dropped as fuel costs could surge if supply bottlenecks materialize. Delta Air Lines was down 3.7 per cent, United Airlines dropped 4.4 per cent, and American Airlines declined 4.7 per cent.

Defense stocks climbed, with Lockheed Martin, RTX Corporation, Northrop Grumman gaining between 2.2 per cent and 3.2 per cent.

“We have major domestic policy uncertainty and now on top of that, you have geopolitical unrest, which not only is impacting oil markets, but the broader risk premium,” said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at Comerica Wealth Management.

Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 sub-sectors fell, with only energy stocks gaining 1.2 per cent. Financials declined the most, with a 2.1 per cent fall. Information technology lost 1.3 per cent, weighed down by Adobe's shares.

Adobe fell 6.6 per cent despite the Photoshop maker raising its full-year results forecast.

Most megacap and growth stocks declined. Nvidia was down 2.1 per cent, Apple fell 1.5 per cent and Amazon lost 1.3 per cent.

Visa shares hit an over four-week low and were last down 5.9 per cent.

U.S.-listed shares of gold miners rose tracking a rise in bullion prices. Newmont gained 2.2 per cent, while AngloGold Ashanti rose 2.1 per cent.

The S&P 500 remains 2.6 per cent below its record high reached earlier this year, following stellar monthly gains in May driven by upbeat corporate earnings and a softening in Trump's trade stance.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq is about 3.8 per cent off its record closing high reached in December last year.

A tame consumer price report, softer-than-expected producer price data and largely unchanged initial jobless claims earlier this week helped calm investor jitters around tariff-driven price pressures. However, Federal Reserve policymakers are widely expected to keep rates unchanged at their meeting next week.

A University of Michigan survey showed consumer sentiment increased to 60.5 for June from the previous month, according to a preliminary estimate.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3.88-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 4.4-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.

The S&P 500 posted 8 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 18 new highs and 70 new lows.

The Japan Newspaper Publishers & Editors Association released Thursday a statement on the internet and election reporting, saying member companies will push accurate information on elections as fears grow that inaccurate posts on social media could influence elections.

The statement adds that members will review how they have reported elections and reference the fact-checking methods that have been deployed overseas.

The internet plays host to much information that is either false or of uncertain veracity, including on social media. The news media group expressed concern that by significantly influencing elections, such information “could lead to the self-destruction of democracy.”

According to the statement, member companies “will review from the ground up how they report on elections, and proactively report in a way that provides information voters can rely on in decision-making, by making reference to international fact-checking methods and taking other measures.”

In 1966, the group issued a statement saying that there were no restrictions on election coverage so long as it was not false and did not distort the facts. The latest statement asserts that this perspective is “something that should be maintained even today, in the year 2025.”

Additionally, the group announced Thursday that it would create an account on X, where it will publish articles from member companies that verify the accuracy of election-related information.

TEL AVIV, June 13. /TASS/. Nuclear and military facilities were among the targets for Israeli strike on Iran, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Effie Defrin said.

"A short while ago, following the directive of the political echelon, the IDF launched a preemptive, precise, combined offensive based on high-quality intelligence to strike Iran's nuclear program, and in response to the Iranian regime's ongoing aggression against Israel," he said.

"A short while, dozens of IAF jets completed the first stage that included strikes on dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran," the spokesman added.

He said that Iran has been involved in direct and indirect actions against Israel.

"Today, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and a significant threat to the wider world. The State of Israel will not allow a regime whose objective is to destroy the State of Israel to obtain weapons of mass destruction," Defrin said.

In his words, the IDF has conducted a process of preparations for a campaign on the frontline and on the home front. "The resilience of Israel's citizens will be an important factor of the campaign," the spokesman added.

DUBAI, June 13. /TASS/. An Israeli strike on Iran's capital Tehran targeted a residential districts where senior military officials reside, Al Jazeera reported.

According to the report, the attack targeted the Mahallati district in the northeastern part of the city.

Earlier, Al Masirah said that residential buildings in Tehran were among targets of the Israeli strike.

Iran's state television said the strike on Tehran left a number of civilians killed and wounded, including women and children.

BRUSSELS, June 14. /TASS/. The United States has analyzed and combined Moscow and Kiev's proposals on peaceful settlement of the Ukrainian conflict, US Special Envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg said.

"We came up to what we call ‘term sheets.' Term sheets are the outline, this is what it looks like," he said. "And we took the Ukrainian term sheet. Then we got what's called the Russian term sheet, they call it memorandum, and we put them together. And we said: "Okay, how can you melt these two documents together to get to an end state. And we are pretty comfortable right now. We know what it looks like. We know what an end state could look like, should look like. And if we can just get to that point, we think it's winnable. Winnable meaning you can get to a peace agreement, and that's where you really want to get to," Kellogg said during an event, organized by the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

The special envoy was asked how this "end state" looks like.

"When we talk about it, the term sheet, we talk about <…> a comprehensive ceasefire," he said.

He added that he participated in numerous peace meetings, held in Jeddah, Riyadh, Paris, London and Istanbul.

The second round of resumed direct talks between Russia and Ukraine was held in Istanbul on June 2. The meeting lasted just over an hour, and the delegations communicated in Russian. The parties exchanged documents with their views on various aspects of conflict resolution. Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, head of Moscow's delegation, said that Russia had submitted a two-part memorandum to Ukraine. According to him, the second part suggests several ways to implement a cease fire. He also said that Russia would unilaterally transfer the remains of 6,000 dead Ukrainian servicemen. Russia and Ukraine also agreed to carry out an "all for all" exchange of seriously ill prisoners of war and those under 25 years - at least 1,000 people on each side. Russia also suggested declaring a ceasefire for 2-3 days in some sectors of the front. Also, according to Medinsky, Ukraine handed over a list of 339 children who had lost contact with their parents. The head of the Ukrainian delegation, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, proposed to hold the next meeting between June 20 and 30.

Gen. Hossein Salami was appointed as head of the Revolutionary Guard in 2019.Vahid Salemi/The Associated Press

Iranian state television confirmed the head of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard was killed in Israel's strikes Friday morning.

Gen. Hossein Salami was the chief of one of the country's most powerful centers, and his death was a tough blow to Iran's embattled leadership, which has had a series of setbacks in the past 20 months of Middle Eastern war and unrest.

Salami rose to power six years ago and had a history of threatening the U.S. and Israel.

Here's a closer look.

Israel launched widescale strikes against Iran on Friday.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard was created after its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Since it was established, it's evolved from a paramilitary, domestic security force to a transnational force that has come to the aid of Tehran's allies in the Mideast, from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq.

It operates in parallel to the country's existing armed forces and controls Iran's arsenal of ballistic missiles, which it has used to attack Israel twice during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Salami, 65, was appointed as head of the guard in 2019 by the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

What we know so far about Israel's attack on Iran

The appointment followed U.S. President Donald Trump's decision during his first term to withdraw the U.S. from the international nuclear deal with Iran and restore crippling sanctions. It also followed Trump's designation of the Guard as a terrorist organization.

Salami joined the guard at the outbreak of the bloody 1980s Iran-Iraq war. He later rose to head its air forces and was serving as a deputy commander in the guard when he was appointed.

Like other guard leaders, Salami routinely delivered speeches with harsh rhetoric towards Israel. In a 2016 speech he said there was “fertile ground” for the “annihilation, the wiping out, and the collapse of the Zionist regime”.

He also threatened the United States.

After the U.S. killed the powerful head of the guard's Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike outside Baghdad's airport in 2020, Salami threatened to retaliate against American and Israeli commanders. The Quds, or Jerusalem, Force is an elite wing of the Guard that oversees foreign operations.

Explainer: What to know about Iran's nuclear sites

Five days later, Iran launched ballistic missiles at two bases in Iraq housing American troops, causing injuries but no fatalities among soldiers there.

After Soleimani was killed, Salami said that both the U.S. and Israel should know that “if they threaten our commanders, none of their commanders will find a safe place” to live.

Israel and Iran have run a shadow war for years, but last year the two attacked each other directly.

When an Israeli strike killed seven guard members, including two Iranian generals at an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria, Salami vowed to retaliate.

Weeks later, Salami ordered an operation that launched more than 300 drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles in an unprecedented revenge mission that pushed the Middle East closer to a regionwide war.

Israel said that 99 per cent were intercepted with several ballistic missiles reaching Israeli territory, causing minor damage to an air base.

In October, Israel pounded Iran with a series of airstrikes in response to missile attacks into Israel from Iran earlier in the month.

Israel's military said it targeted “missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the state of Israel over the last year.” Israel also weakened the country's air defenses, which helped clear the way for Friday's attacks.

On the evening of June 12, Israel launched a series of major strikes against Iran. The targets included Iranian nuclear facilities, missile sites, and multiple senior military and political officials. In a televised speech, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared success. Iranian officials, meanwhile, swore revenge. Leaders across the region braced for unrest.

To better understand what Israel's strikes might mean, Foreign Affairs senior editor Daniel Block spoke with Daniel B. Shapiro. Shapiro served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East until January—charged with, among other things, considering scenarios in which tensions between Israel and Iran escalated into all-out war and preparing U.S. options for responding. Now a Distinguished Fellow at the Atlantic Council, Shapiro has also served as U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Senior Director for the Middle East and North Africa on the National Security Council. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity.



Just how big a deal are these attacks? How much more serious are they than were the Israeli attacks on Iran in April and October of last year?

The full extent of Israel's strikes on Iran has not yet been revealed. But they are orders of magnitude beyond what Israel achieved in its April and October 2024 attacks. It is already clear that Israel was able to strike key nuclear sites, such as the Natanz enrichment facility, locations associated with possible weaponization research, ballistic missile launch sites, and numerous senior regime leaders and figures involved in Iran's nuclear program. That is far more extensive than almost anyone forecast.

As the details emerge, the degree of Israel's penetration of Iran's system will further embarrass the regime. Iran will be highly motivated to respond, but its ability to do so meaningfully in the near term will be hampered by the leadership chaos the strikes have sown. What's still unclear is the extent of the damage to nonofficial sites, or the civilian casualties. But Iran will probably try to match any losses they suffered in the civilian sphere, in addition to attacking Israeli military, intelligence, and leadership targets.

So far, the Trump administration has firmly distanced itself from these strikes. Why do you think that is?

Trump had sought additional time from Netanyahu for nuclear talks, and Netanyahu did not give it to him. By distancing himself from Netanyahu's decision, Trump is seeking to deter Iran from directing any response against the United States. Trump may also hope that he can keep nuclear negotiations alive. But his dream of a diplomatic resolution which ends Iranian nuclear enrichment appears dead. Iran is now far more likely to try to sprint to a nuclear breakout, leaving Trump with the dilemma of whether he will need to act militarily to prevent it.



What do you make of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's statement promising to protect Americans, but notably omitting Israel?

Rubio's statement was intended to signal to Iran that the United States was not involved, and that Israel acted unilaterally. The omission of Israel is a further indication that Washington does not want to be seen as having endorsed the Israeli action. But it is inconceivable that U.S. officials did not have prior knowledge.

Rubio's statement does not mean the United States won't assist in Israel's defense. It will.

Why did Israel decide to strike now, despite Trump's apparent wishes?

Netanyahu has long promised Israelis that he won't let Iran develop a nuclear weapon. It has been central to his political career. And I think he sensed that Israel might never have a better opportunity to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Israel decimated Iran's Lebanese proxy, Hezbollah, in September 2024. It then destroyed Iran's Russian-provided S-300 air defense batteries—Tehran's most sophisticated—in October. Those two successes, combined with the fall of Iran's key regional ally, the Assad regime in Syria, have left Iran with far less ability to defend its nuclear sites or retaliate.

How can we expect the Iranian response to unfold? And how will Israel's defense play out?

Iran may try to launch as many as several hundred ballistic missiles at Israel. This is in keeping with how it responded to past Israeli actions. After Israel killed a key Iranian leader in Damascus in April 2024, Iran lobbed over 300 munitions, including over 100 medium range ballistic missiles, at Israel. In October, after Israel decimated Hezbollah in Lebanon, Iran launched double the number of ballistic missiles. In April, Israel was able to avoid serious damage thanks to both its own air defenses and those of a U.S.-led coalition. But the October attack scored a few dozen hits that caused relatively minor damage. And earlier in June, Iran specifically pledged to strike Israel's own nuclear facilities in response to this kind of attack.

By concentrating its defenses on certain sensitive sites and civilian populations, Israel, with U.S. support, will probably attempt to prevent its air defenses from being saturated and minimize damage, as it did against Iran's two previous attacks. The United States has positioned two THAAD (Theater High-Altitude Area Defense) batteries in Israel to help. This system supplements Israel's Arrow missile defense, as well as nearby U.S. naval vessels with missile defense capability.



Israel will also almost certainly face additional attacks from the Houthis in Yemen. Hezbollah, even in its weakened state, might be called upon to retaliate as well. But the Houthis are unlikely to be able to generate a major barrage. And Hezbollah's reduced capabilities will limit its impact, as might pressure from the new Lebanese government.

Will Israel respond to Iran's retaliation with more strikes?

Netanyahu said Israeli strikes would continue until Israel is satisfied that the threat of a nuclear Iran is gone. So we may be looking at something more like a campaign, rather than a one-off attack. Whether Israel will then feel the need to respond to Iran's attempts at retaliation is going to depend very much on the level of damage and casualties it sustains. So a successful defense against Iranian missiles could have a deescalatory effect, whereas significant casualties will almost certainly lead Israel to seek to strike Iran again.

Last October, Israel sought to coordinate its response to an Iranian attack with Washington, which gave U.S. President Joe Biden opportunities to shape and limit the Israeli response. But Israel showed little interest in such coordination this time, and Trump may also find it is not worthwhile. This could mean Iran finds it more difficult to move down the escalation ladder.

The conflict is also unlikely to be over even if the Iranian military quickly backs down. Israel should expect an ongoing series of asymmetric attacks, such as cyber operations and terrorist attacks against its embassies, travelers, and businesses.

What is the likelihood that Iran attacks U.S. forces?

Much depends on messaging from the United States. Trump has made clear that Washington was not involved in the Israeli strikes and warned Iran not to target U.S. forces. If Iranian leaders understand that by engaging the United States or others in the region, it faces the risk of a direct U.S. attack that would compound the damage Israel has already caused, it is more likely to limit its response to attacks against Israel. It may well downgrade its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and try to rebuild and further bury and harden its remaining nuclear infrastructure. But Iran may choose not to attack actors other than Israel, in order to keep them out of the war.

Let's say that Iran does attack the United States, prompting U.S. retaliation, or that Washington decides to get directly involved to prevent an Iranian nuclear breakout. How might an American attack on Iran play out?

Some of the assets that would facilitate an American strike are already available. The USS Carl Vinson carrier strike group continues to be deployed to the region. Before a strike, a second carrier strike group might sail toward the area. Additional aircraft, such as fighter squadrons, tankers, and search and rescue helicopters, would likely also be deployed to bases in the region. The United States also has unique capabilities it could employ if it intended to target Iran's deeply buried enrichment facility at Fordow.

How would Iran handle direct United States involvement?

Iran would not absorb American strikes without retaliating. Iran possesses an arsenal of thousands of close-range ballistic missiles and drones that it could launch at American bases in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. It used such missiles to attack U.S. forces following Washington's assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force, in 2020.



Shiite militia groups in Iraq and Syria, armed with Iranian drones, could fire at U.S. bases as they did for several months following October 7, 2023. They might also target the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Troops and personnel at these locations may need to spend significant periods in shelters. Air defense assets at specific locations could be outnumbered by incoming munitions. There would be a risk of American casualties. The United States would need to press the Iraqi government to prevent Shiite militias from joining the fight, which it has done successfully since mid-2024. American forces would have to be prepared to strike militias that attack them, as they did several times last year. And the United States and regional governments would need to push the Houthis not to resume attacks in the Red Sea. They would need to be prepared to resume strikes if the Houthis resume them. Washington would also need to prepare for asymmetric attacks both in the region and in the United States itself.

Could Iran or its partners decide to attack Arab states, as they have in the past?

The Gulf states will likely condemn the Israeli attack in order to dissuade Iran from hitting their territory and assets. But if the United States gets involved, Iran might well fire close-range ballistic missiles at civilian locations or energy infrastructure in the Gulf states, in order to exact a price for what they would see as complicity with a U.S. attack.

Iran would also consider an effort to shut down the Strait of Hormuz to oil and gas tankers using a naval blockade, sea mines, limpet mines deployed by fast boats, or some combination thereof. Saudi Arabia and the UAE possess significant air defense assets, but all of these countries would still be vulnerable to strikes.

What does this war mean for the future of Iran's nuclear program?

Most estimates suggested Israel, on its own, could set back the Iranian nuclear program by several months. Public reports have estimated that U.S. strikes, meanwhile, could set the Iranian nuclear program back by up to a year. But those timelines assume Iran immediately starts rebuilding, and they do not take into account additional delays that could occur based on economic or political factors. Those estimates also do not account for the impact of deterrence or potential restrikes.

But it is likely that Iran will now make a desperate run to nuclear breakout. Trump, in turn, will be faced with a decision about whether to intervene militarily to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon. That decision will split his advisers and political base, given his long-stated determination to keep the United States out of Middle East wars.

Last night, the government of Israel decided to roll the dice on a military solution to Iran's decades-long pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. Given the remarkable capabilities of the Israel Defense Forces, the operation could do tremendous damage to the Iranian nuclear program. But then comes the hard part.

Iran has limited options to respond directly. The danger, however, is that Israel has opened a Pandora's box: the worst Iranian response might also be the most likely—a decision to withdraw from its arms control commitments and build nuclear weapons in earnest. Containing those furies over the long term is likely to be the real challenge for both Israel and the United States. If the two parties fail, the Israeli gamble could ensure a nuclear-armed Iran rather than prevent one.

It's very early in this latest battle between Israel and Iran, too soon to know how long the fighting will last or how much damage the Israelis will do. Still, Iran now faces some significant constraints on its ability to fight back, end, or even retaliate against the Israeli campaign.

Iran's first problem is distance, and its second problem is Israel's defenses. Because of both, Tehran has little ability to use its air force against Israel. What's more, with roughly 700 miles of Iraq, Syria, and Jordan separating them, Iran cannot mount a ground attack against Israel—which would be suicidal against the far more competent Israeli army in any event. Consequently, if there is going to be a direct Iranian military retaliation, it will almost certainly be shouldered by Iran's missile and drone forces, which have proved to be of limited capability against Israeli defenses.

Iran's leaders might have learned from the embarrassing fizzles of attempted retaliations against Israel in April and October of last year that another such response will just make them look weaker. But both of those exchanges suggest the opposite: that Iran will feel compelled to respond against Israel, even if only for the sake of honor and to try to impose some cost on Israel for its attack. The Iranians have been working hard to improve their missile and drone capabilities in the intervening months, and there are reports that they have had help from Russia, which might make them believe that they can do better than before. Accordingly, a retaliation using missiles and drones is a very real possibility, although whether it will be one big salvo, several smaller ones, or constant, staggered attacks is hard to say. Israel may have its own aircraft and drones looking for Iranian launchers to try to prevent such attacks and could also be striking known Iranian storage sites.

Whatever the exact approach, it seems unlikely that another missile or drone attack would have much impact on Israel. Israel still has formidable missile defenses, its population is well sheltered, and Iranian munitions have small payloads and are relatively few in number. Even if more Iranian missiles and drones manage to penetrate Israeli defenses this time, they probably would not do much damage or kill many people, especially compared with what the Israeli strikes are likely to do to Iran.



Another option would be a cyber-strike. Iran has worked hard on its cyber-capabilities in recent years and mounted some potent attacks, including against Israel. In the summer of 2023, Iran began shutting down electricity to Israeli hospitals—that is, until Israel began shutting down much larger numbers of Iranian gas stations.

This back-and-forth illustrates the uncertainties on both sides. It's not entirely clear what cyberweapons Iran has up its sleeve or what vulnerabilities it may have discovered in Israel's infrastructure. But the Iranian leadership doesn't know what cyberweapons Israel has up its sleeve or what vulnerabilities it has discovered in Iran's infrastructure. Moreover, Israel has tended to trump Iran in the cyber-realm, and Iran's populace is more unhappy and prone to revolt than Israel's, which could add to Iran's caution.

Although Iran is routinely ranked as a leading state sponsor of terrorism, a terror attack on Israel, especially in the short run, would be equally hard. Israel's counterterror defenses are formidable, and terror attacks, especially large damaging ones, can't be conjured up overnight. They take months of planning, reconnaissance, preparation, and infiltration. Unless Iran has a long-planned terrorist operation that it has been holding in reserve, this, too, would be difficult to implement as a response to the Israeli campaign.

Then there is the prospect of a long-threatened and long-feared Iranian attack on oil exports in the Gulf, or even an effort to close the Strait of Hormuz. This also seems of low likelihood. First, this move would have such an enormous effect on oil prices and the global economy—and through them, on every national economy—that Iran would quickly go from being a sympathetic victim to a dangerous nemesis in the eyes of most other countries. Moreover, despite the fact that the Trump administration did nothing to protect Gulf oil exports from Iranian attack in its first term, closing the Strait of Hormuz would be such a severe threat to oil exports that the U.S. and other Western powers (and conceivably even China) would be virtually certain to use force to reopen the export routes. Although it might take the American military a number of bloody weeks to crush Iran's military forces and reopen the straits, the Iranians do not seem to be under any illusion regarding the ultimate outcome. And Tehran would have to worry that such a reckless threat to the world's economies would convince Washington that the Iranian regime had to be removed. That fear is surely greater with U.S. President Donald Trump—who ordered the death of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020—back in office.

The most threatening possible response from Iran is one that would play out not in the coming hours or days, but over the long term. Tehran could withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) of 1968, which is the legal basis for the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (or JCPOA), announce that it will build nuclear weapons as the only way to deter such “unprovoked” attacks on Iran, and then dare Israel, the United States, and other countries to stop it from doing so.

Iran already has enough highly enriched uranium to build several nuclear weapons. This is containerized and believed to be stored at three different locations, and it is unclear whether Israel will be able to destroy all of it in the ongoing military strikes. Iran also has large quantities of uranium feedstock (called “yellow cake”) that could be enriched to weapons grade. The Israelis (and the U.S. government) believe that they know about all of Iran's functional centrifuge cascades, but the International Atomic Energy Agency believes that Iran has built many more centrifuges, the whereabouts of which are unknown. Even if they are not part of operational cascades, they could be integrated into them fairly easily, and Iran can build still more. Without IAEA inspectors in country to enforce the terms of the NPT and the JCPOA, Israeli and other Western intelligence services may have a very hard time finding new, secret Iranian nuclear sites. It may also have trouble destroying those sites even if they are identified, since Iran will likely harden them even beyond the level of its current facilities.

Discussions of Israeli options for stopping Iran's nuclear program often refer to the 1981 Israeli strike on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor. The mythology of that strike holds that the operation critically set back Baghdad's nuclear program, saving the world from having to deal with a nuclear-armed Saddam Hussein. But in reality, as analysts learned from Iraqi documents and scientists after the 1991 and 2003 wars, Saddam responded by pouring additional resources into his nuclear program, making it many times more dangerous than it had been before the Israeli operation. He likely would have produced an Iraqi bomb sometime between 1992 and 1995 had the Gulf War and the subsequent inspection regime not ended his program.

Accordingly, the real challenge—for Israel, the United States, and any other government intent on preventing nuclear proliferation in the Middle East—is to find ways to prevent Iran from following the path that Iraq did following the Osirak strike. If anything, the situation is more dangerous now than it was then, since Iran's nuclear program is so much more advanced, its scientists so much more knowledgeable, and its nuclear infrastructure so much more capable than Iraq's was in 1981. This creates the Catch-22, in which the best way to prevent Iranian reconstitution would be an aggressive pursuit of a new nuclear deal with Tehran, at precisely the moment when Iran's leadership will be least interested in one given their likely outrage at the Israeli attack. And without such a new deal, Israel may have succeeded in setting the Iranian nuclear program back in the short term—perhaps for a year or two—only to ensure the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran not long thereafter.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a June 12 press release that the Israeli government acted unilaterally in its decision to strike Iran, and the United States provided no direct assistance in the attack.

“We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio said.

Israel attacked Iran's capital early Friday in strikes that targeted the country's nuclear program and killed at least two top military officers. In response, Iran fired more than 100 drones at Israel.

The new Israeli military operation against Iran is giving President Donald Trump a fresh test of his campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts. 

It lands as he's dealing with domestic turmoil: Opponents of his administration are set to rally in hundreds of cities on Saturday during the military parade in Washington to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, which coincides with Trump's birthday.

Other news we're following today:



A U.S. official, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the conversation took place.

It comes after protests erupted last week over immigration raids.

Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 who's overseeing the 4,700 troops deployed by President Trump, said the Marines finished training on civil disturbance and are starting their operations by replacing National Guard troops.

The National Guard soldiers can then be assigned to protect more law enforcement agents on raids, Sherman said. About 200 Marines out of the 700 deployed to the protests are in the city, Sherman said. They have all undergone civil disturbance training.

The U.S. has been moving assets nearer to Israel to assist in missile intercepts and to provide better protection of U.S. bases in the region.

While the official didn't say how the U.S. provided assistance, both U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft and destroyer-based missile defenses have intercepted missiles in previous attacks.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing operations.

But she said in the Friday statement that violence will not be tolerated.

“I strongly urge protestors to remain peaceful and calm as they exercise their First Amendment right to make their voices heard,” the Democratic governor said.

Trump's meeting with National Security Council principals to discuss Israel's operations has finished, according to the White House.

Officials did not provide details on any specific aspects of Trump's talks with top aides in the White House Situation Room or how long it went.

Friday's ruling says the commissioners can resume their duties because their dismissals were unlawful. The ruling will likely be appealed. 

The five-member commission helps protect consumers from dangerous products by issuing recalls, suing errant companies and more. 

The three Democrats who were fired last month were serving seven-year terms after being nominated by President Joe Biden.

Attorneys for the Trump administration have argued that any restrictions on the president's removal power violate his constitutional authority.

Attorneys for the fired commissioners noted that federal statute says the president can fire commissioners “for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but for no other cause” — allegations that have not been made.

Energy, shipping, travel and consumer goods are among sectors that could face an outsized impact from the escalation in the Middle East.

Americans are already leery about the economy this year due to Trump's sweeping tariffs, though the impact so far has been muted. 

Government data this week revealed that Trump's tariffs have yet to cause a broader rise in inflation. Still, many companies have announced price hikes due to the tariffs.

On Friday, the strongest reaction was in the oil market, where prices jumped.

It's the latest sign that Americans' views of the economy have improved as inflation has stayed tame and the Trump administration has reached a truce in its trade fight with China. 

The preliminary reading of the University of Michigan's closely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, jumped 16% to 60.5.

 The large increase followed steady drops that left the preliminary number last month at the second-lowest level in the nearly 75-year history of the survey. Consumer sentiment is still down 20% compared with December 2024.

The Met sold 72% of capacity, matching 2023-24 and down from its 75% projection.

“We were on track to continue to improve,” Met general manager Peter Gelb said Friday. “We were disappointed by the sales in the last two months of the season — our projections were much higher and I attribute the fact that we didn't achieve our sales goals to a significant drop in tourism.”

New York City Tourism & Conventions last month reduced its 2025 international visitor projection by 17%, the Met said.

International buyers accounted for 11% of sales, down from the Met's projection of 16% and from about 20% before the pandemic.

Authorities are looking for four detainees who escaped from an immigration detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

More “law enforcement partners” have been brought in to find the detainees missing from Delaney Hall, according to an emailed statement attributed to a senior DHS official whom the department did not identify. The statement also didn't specify which law enforcement agencies are involved.

Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 who is overseeing the 4,700 troops deployed in Los Angeles, said Friday that 200 Marines have finished training on civil disturbance. 

Sherman said the Marines will take over operations at noon local time in downtown Los Angeles. He says they will be protecting federal property and personnel.

 The Marines will join some 2,000 National Guard troops that have been on the streets of the city since last week when immigration raids set off protests.

The meeting in the Situation Room, which was scheduled to begin at 11 a.m., is the only item listed on Trump's public schedule for Friday. There are currently no plans for him to appear before reporters.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia‘s plea was the first chance the Maryland construction worker has had in a U.S. courtroom to answer the Trump administration's allegations against him since he was mistakenly deported in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. 

The Republican administration returned Abrego Garcia to the U.S. last week to face a new indictment charging him with human smuggling for transported immigrants inside the United States. Abrego Garcia was driving a vehicle with nine passengers during a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee.

“There's no way a jury is going to see the evidence and agree that this sheet metal worker is the leader of an international MS-13 smuggling conspiracy,” his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said last week.

U.S. attorneys have asked U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes to keep Abrego Garcia in jail, describing him as a danger to the community and a flight risk. 

Most of the sprawling city has been spared as protests continue downtown, near City Hall and a federal detention center where some immigrants are being held.

On the third night of an 8 p.m. curfew, Los Angeles police arrested several demonstrators who refused to leave a downtown street, and Homeland Security officers deployed flash bangs to disperse a crowd near the jail. 

Those incidents were outliers. As with the previous two nights, the hourslong demonstrations remained peaceful and upbeat, drawing a few hundred attendees who were chanting, dancing and poking fun at the Trump administration's characterization of the city as a “war zone.”

The LAPD said there have been about 470 arrests since Saturday, the vast majority for failing to leave the downtown area at the request of law enforcement. A handful of more serious charges include assault against officers and possession of a Molotov cocktail and a gun. Nine officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injuries.

The letter lawyers for Mahmoud Khalil sent Friday to U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz in New Jersey says Khalil has satisfied all the court's requirements for his release, including posting a $1 bond, while lawyers for the government missed the judge's Friday's 9:30 a.m. deadline. In response, the judge gave the government until 1:30 p.m. Friday.

Khalil's lawyers say the government hasn't shown any grounds to keep detaining him, other than reasons the judge already dismissed.

“The deadline has come and gone and Mahmoud Khalil must be released immediately,” his lawyers said in a statement provided by the American Civil Liberties Union. “Anything further is an attempt to prolong his unconstitutional, arbitrary, and cruel detention.”

Spokespeople for the Justice Department and Homeland Security didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment.

Gavin Newsom's office expressed concern that the data will be used for immigration raids supported by the National Guard troops and Marines Trump deployed in Los Angeles. 

“We deeply value the privacy of all Californians,” the statement said. “This potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.”

Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the data was shared legally, “to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.”

Nixon wouldn't answer questions about how DHS would use it, and DHS officials did not respond to requests for comment.

The data includes the immigration status of millions of Medicaid enrollees, which could facilitate locating people to deport as part of his sweeping immigration crackdown.

An internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press show that Medicaid officials unsuccessfully sought to block the data transfer, citing legal and ethical concerns. Nevertheless, two top advisers to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the dataset handed over to the Department of Homeland Security, the emails show. 

The dataset includes people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that use only state taxpayer dollars.

Elon Musk's image has lost some of its luster with Republicans since the tech billionaire's messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.

The tech billionaire has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with the president last week.

Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog “very favorably” compared with April, according to the new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation — and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts — may have cost him.

About half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla — far more than other car companies. Tesla has dropped in value and amid protests in the U.S. and Europe.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose mistaken deportation has become a symbol of Trump's immigration crackdown, will stand before a Tennessee judge on Friday for a court hearing to determine whether he can be released from jail pending trial on human smuggling charges. His lawyers have called the charges filed last week “preposterous.”

Before the hearing began in Nashville, Abrego Garcia's wife told a crowd outside a church that Thursday marked exactly three months since the Trump administration “abducted and disappeared my husband and separated him from our family.”

Her voice choked with emotion, Jennifer Vasquez Sura said she saw her husband for the first time on Thursday. 

She said, “Kilmar wants you to have faith,” and that he wanted his supporters and family to know that “I will be victorious because God is with us.” 

“If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform Friday. 

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order directing Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California, and set an appellate hearing for Tuesday.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom had asked for an emergency intervention to stop troops from supporting immigration raids. “Today was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test,” Newsom said before the appeals court decision.

“The district court has no authority to usurp the President's authority as Commander in Chief,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said.

The U.S. president said Friday morning that “we know what's going on” when asked what sort of advance warning he got from Israel about its attack on Iran.

“Heads-up? It wasn't a heads-up. It was, we know what's going on,” he told the Wall Street Journal.

Trump again cited the Israel attack as a warning to Iran to make a nuclear deal.

The United States is shifting ships and other military resources in the Middle East in response to Israel's strikes on Iran and a possible retaliatory attack by Tehran, two U.S. officials said Friday.

The Navy has directed the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner to begin sailing toward the Eastern Mediterranean and also has directed a second destroyer to begin moving forward, so it can be available if requested by the White House.

The president is meeting with his National Security Council principals, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Friday morning to discuss the situation, one of the officials said.

The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public.

Exactly what happened at the 1,000-bed Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility Thursday night remains unclear. 

Newark Mayor Ras Baraka expressed concern Friday “about reports of what has transpired at Delaney Hall this evening, ranging from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees.” The Democrat called for an end to the “chaos.” 

Protesters outside the detention center locked arms and pushed against barricades as vehicles passed through gates and inmates inside relayed word that their meals had been delayed. Amy Torres, executive director of New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said some officers sprayed pepper spray and tackled and dragged protesters away. 

It's unclear whether there have been any escapes. Messages seeking comment were left with ICE, the Department of Homeland Security and local police.

The Republican president's March 25 executive order sought to overhaul elections nationwide by compelling officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections, accepting only mailed ballots received by Election Day and conditioning federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline.

The White House has defended the order as “standing up for free, fair and honest elections” and called proof of citizenship a “commonsense” requirement.

The judge sided with a group of Democratic state attorneys general who challenged the effort as unconstitutional.

The attorneys general said the directive “usurps the States' constitutional power and seeks to amend election law by fiat.” 

Israel told the Trump administration that large-scale attacks were coming and expected Iranian retaliation would be severe and that's why the United States ordered the evacuations of some nonessential embassy staffers and authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents in the region, U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity to describe private diplomatic discussions. 

Special envoy Steve Witkoff still plans to go to Oman this weekend for talks on Tehran's nuclear program, but it's not clear if the Iranians would participate, officials said.

In an interview with ABC News on Friday morning, Trump said the Israeli attack on Iran was “excellent” and again previewed more attacks to come.

“We gave them a chance and they didn't take it,” Trump told ABC's Jon Karl. “They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you're going to get hit. And there's more to come. A lot more.”

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California after he deployed them there following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.

The court said it would hold a hearing on the matter on Tuesday. The ruling came only hours after a federal judge's order was to take effect at noon Friday.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth appeared to acknowledge that the Pentagon has developed plans to take over Greenland and Panama by force if necessary but refused to answer repeated questions during a hotly combative congressional hearing Thursday about his use of Signal chats to discuss military operations.

Just hours before Israel launched strikes on Iran early Friday, President Donald Trump was still holding onto tattered threads of hope that a long-simmering dispute over Tehran's nuclear program could be resolved without military action.

But with the Israeli military operation called “Rising Lion” now underway — something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says will go on for “as many days as it takes” — Trump will be tested anew on his ability to make good on a campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts.

“I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal,” Trump said in a Friday morning social media post. “I told them, in the strongest of words, to ‘just do it,' but no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get it done.”

Air raid sirens have sounded across Israel and interceptions were visible overhead in Tel Aviv following an Iranian missile attack on the country. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Columns of smoke rose Friday over Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility at Natanz after Israeli strikes on the country. Footage aired by Iran's state media showed what looked like an immediate aftermath of several explosions on the horizon at the nuclear facility, a fireball and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky.

Israel attacked Iran's capital early Friday in strikes that targeted the country's nuclear program and killed at least two top military officers. In response, Iran fired more than 100 drones at Israel.

Israel attacked Iran's capital early Friday, with explosions booming across Tehran as Israel said it targeted nuclear and military sites.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says it launched operation “rising lion”, to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's survival.

Black smoke rose Friday from Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz following Israeli attacks on the country, though it wasn't clear how bad the damage was.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Israel launched blistering attacks on the heart of Iran's nuclear and military structure Friday, deploying warplanes and drones previously smuggled into the country to attack key facilities and kill top generals and scientists -- a barrage it said was necessary before its adversary got any closer to building an atomic weapon.

Iran retaliated late Friday by unleashing scores of ballistic missiles on Israel, where explosions flared in the skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and shook the buildings below.

“We will not allow them to escape safely from this great crime they committed,” Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a recorded message in which he vowed revenge. 

An Associated Press reporter saw smoke rising in Tel Aviv after an apparent missile strike. A Tel Aviv area hospital said it was treating 15 injured civilians. U.S. ground-based air defense systems in the region are helping to shoot down Iranian missiles, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the measures.

Israel's ongoing airstrikes and intelligence operation and Iran's retaliation raised concerns about all-out war between the countries and propelled the region, already on edge, into even greater upheaval. 









Israel had long threatened such a strike, and successive American administrations had sought to prevent it, fearing it would ignite a wider conflict across the Middle East and possibly be ineffective at destroying Iran's dispersed and hardened nuclear program.

But a confluence of developments triggered by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack — plus the reelection of U.S. President Donald Trump — created the conditions that allowed Israel to finally follow through on its threats. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the U.S. was informed in advance of the attack.

On Thursday, Iran had been censured by the U.N.'s atomic watchdog for not complying with obligations meant to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon.

Countries in the region condemned Israel's attack, while leaders around the globe called for immediate deescalation from both sides.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Friday afternoon at Iran's request. In a letter to the council, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi called the killing of its officials and scientists “state terrorism” and affirmed his country's right to self-defense. 

Israel's military said about 200 aircraft were involved in the initial attack on about 100 targets. Its Mossad spy agency positioned explosive drones and precision weapons inside Iran ahead of time, and used them to target Iranian air defenses and missile launchers near Tehran, according to two security officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.

It was not possible to independently confirm the officials' claims.

Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southest of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.

Israel said it struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, too, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.

Israel military spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said the Natanz facility was “significantly damaged” and that the operation was “still in the beginning.”

The first wave of strikes had given Israel “significant freedom of movement” in Iran's skies, clearing the way for further attacks, according to an Israeli military official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss details of the attack with the media. 

The official said Israel is prepared for an operation that could last up to two weeks, but that there was no firm timeline.

Among those killed were three of Iran's top military leaders: one who oversaw the entire armed forces, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri; one who led the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Hossein Salami; and the head of the Guard's ballistic missile program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh. 

Iran confirmed all three deaths, significant blows its governing theocracy that will complicate efforts to retaliate. Khamenei said other top military officials and scientists were also killed. 

Netanyahu said the attack had been months in the making. In a video statement sent to journalists Friday, he said he ordered plans for the attack last November, soon after the killing of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon, one of Iran's strongest proxies. Netanyahu said the attack was planned for April but was postponed.

In its first response Friday, Iran fired more than 100 drones at Israel. Israel said the drones were being intercepted outside its airspace, and it was not immediately clear whether any got through.

Israel's military said it called up reservists and began stationing troops throughout the country as it braced for further retaliation from Iran or Iranian proxy groups.

Trump urged Iran on Friday to reach a deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, warning on his Truth Social platform that Israel's attacks “will only get worse.”

“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire,” he wrote. 

On Wednesday, the U.S. pulled some American diplomats from Iraq's capital and offered voluntary evacuations for the families of U.S. troops in the wider Middle East. On Friday, the U.S. began shifting military resources in the region, including ships, as Israel prepared for more retaliation, two U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Officials in Washington had cautioned Israel against an attack earlier in the week, so as not to disrupt U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear enrichment program. They stressed Friday that the U.S. had not been involved in the attack, and warned against any retaliation targeting U.S. interests or personnel.

Israeli leaders cast the attack as necessary to head off an imminent threat that Iran would build nuclear bombs, though it remains unclear how close the country is to achieving that or whether Iran had actually been planning a strike. Iran maintains its nuclear program is for civilian purposes only. 

“This is a clear and present danger to Israel's very survival,” Netanyahu claimed as he vowed to pursue the attack for as long as necessary to “remove this threat.”

Israel is widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East but has never acknowledged having such weapons.

Over the past year, Israel has been targeting Iran's air defenses, hitting a radar system for a Russian-made air defense battery in April 2024 and surface-to-air missile sites and missile manufacturing facilities in October.

On Friday, Israelis rushed to supermarkets in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and elsewhere to buy bottled water and other supplies. But, otherwise, streets and parks were mostly deserted.

For Netanyahu, the operation distracts attention from Israel's ongoing and increasingly devastating war in Gaza, which is now over 20 months old. 

There is a broad consensus in the Israeli public that Iran is a major threat, and Israel's opposition leader, Yair Lapid, a staunch critic of Netanyahu, offered his “full support” for the mission against Iran. But if Iranian reprisals cause heavy Israeli casualties or major disruptions to daily life, public opinion could shift quickly. 

The Iran-backed Lebanese militant group Hezbollah issued a statement that offered condolences and condemned the attack, but did not threaten to join Iran in its retaliation. Hezbollah's latest war with Israel — which killed much of the group's senior leadership — ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in November.

Khamenei, the Iranian Supreme Leader, said in a statement that Israel “opened its wicked and blood-stained hand to a crime in our beloved country, revealing its malicious nature more than ever by striking residential centers.” 

Netanyahu expressed hope the attacks would trigger the downfall of Iran's theocracy, saying his message to the Iranian people was that the fight was not with them, but with the “brutal dictatorship that has oppressed you for 46 years.”

Israel has long been determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, a concern laid bare on Thursday when the International Atomic Energy Agency for the first time in 20 years censured Iran over its refusal to work with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site and install more advanced centrifuges. 

Even so, there are multiple assessments on how many nuclear weapons Iran could conceivably build, should it choose to do so. Iran would need months to assemble, test and field any weapon, which it so far has said it has no desire to do. U.S. intelligence agencies also assess Iran does not have a weapons program at this time.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Israel took “unilateral action against Iran” and that it believed the strikes were necessary for its self-defense.

The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was closely monitoring radiation levels.

Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin has the latest on the foreign policy ramifications after Israel's strikes on Iran on ‘America Reports.'

EXCLUSIVE: A senior lawmaker in the U.S. House of Representatives said the current conflict with Israel and Iran could be a singular opportunity for Iranians to overthrow their authoritarian Islamic government.

"Now that their top leadership has been taken out, if there's ever a time for the people to rise up against this theocracy, I would think the conditions are set," Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, told Fox News Digital on Friday.

McCaul was part of a group of lawmakers in the Middle East late last month. Part of that trip was in Israel, where the congressional delegation met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others.

"I think this is the perfect opportunity – it would have been better if, I don't know what level of coordination took place, but I mean, when an event like this happens – to have this theocracy that's in power, out of power, and liberate the people of Iran," McCaul said. "The majority do not like the Ayatollah. There's a real opportunity for that to just end."

Israel unleashed a barrage of airstrikes in and around Tehran beginning Thursday night Eastern Time. The Israeli government said the strikes were pre-emptive, and that Tehran was approaching nuclear weapon capabilities. 

"They were very close to a nuclear bomb," McCaul said.

Israel said it hit Iranian nuclear sites, and that its strikes killed multiple senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists. Iran responded by launching missiles toward Israeli territory on Friday afternoon.

McCaul said it was a "major setback" for Iran but that he was sure that officials in Tehran would respond.

"When we were in the region, they felt certain that Iran would strike our military sites in Saudi, Jordan and the UAE," he said.

"The big talk also at that time was, give CENTCOM time to get prepared in the region to get all of its strategic assets in place for a response. And my understanding is … all of our bases and military sites and embassies are on high alert."

The Texas Republican also recalled what he now believes were telling signs that some kind of military operation was imminent.

While in Israel last month, McCaul said he asked Netanyahu about reports that Iran was preparing a nuclear strike.

"And he said, ‘If you don't fight, you die,' He said that several times in the context of striking Iran," McCaul said. "He said that, ‘I will strike Iran with or without you.'"

"I said, ‘Well, sir, we need you to coordinate with us. Whether or not the president decides to do this with you, you need to coordinate with the United States, our allies and partners in the region.'"

Indeed, President Donald Trump told Fox News Channel's chief political anchor Bret Baier on Thursday he had prior knowledge that Israel was going to conduct pre-emptive strikes on Iran.

"Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb, and we are hoping to get back to the negotiating table. We will see. There are several people in leadership in Iran that will not be coming back," Trump said.

Trump said the strike happened on Day 61 after Iran had a 60-day window to make a deal with the U.S. to contain its nuclear enrichment. He also said he hoped Iran would come back to the negotiating table after the attack.

But McCaul was not optimistic Tehran would agree to sufficient standards.

"I just, I have little faith in the negotiations, to be honest with you," he said.

It's not clear as of now whether those talks will resume. 

But if they were to fall through again, McCaul said, Iranians would have incentive to push for a new government "once and for all."

Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has promised a "legitimate and powerful response" to Israel's strikes.

John Friedman, former US ambassador to Israel, discusses the newly issued IDF safety warning and the significance of the missile strike for both the U.S. and Israel on ‘America Reports.'

EXCLUSIVE: More Americans support rather than oppose Israeli airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, according to a new national poll conducted before Israel's Friday attack on Iran.

But the survey, released by the Ronald Reagan Institute, indicates that most Democrats and Republicans don't see eye-to-eye on the issue.

According to the poll, which was first shared with Fox News on Friday, 45% of those questioned said they would support Israel conducting targeted airstrikes against Iran's nuclear facilities if diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Iran fail.

Thirty-seven percent said they opposed Israeli airstrikes, with 18% unsure.

But the poll indicates a partisan divide.

Six in 10 Republicans said they support the airstrikes, but that backing dropped to 35% among independents and 32% among Democrats.

Twenty-seven percent of Republicans opposed the Israeli airstrikes, with a third of independents and just over half of Democrats opposed.

The poll of adult Americans was conducted, May 22-June 2, before Israel's unprecedented attack on Iran, named "Operation Rising Lion," which included strikes on both the Islamic State's nuclear program and military leaders.

LOS ANGELES – The U.S. Secret Service confirmed Thursday that it is "aware" of threatening "Kill Trump" graffiti messages spray-painted around the city of Los Angeles during this week's riots. 

A spokesman for the protective agency would not confirm whether an investigation is underway but did say that it knows of the violent messaging directed at both President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance. 

The messaging was seen in the city's downtown area amid civil unrest following Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests of criminal illegal immigrants. 

"Burn it all down," one said, with "Kill Trump" graffitied below it.

"Kill Trump," the other said, with "JD Vance" spray-painted below. 

Last weekend, clashes between rioters and police erupted in Paramount, California, after ICE conducted arrest operations targeting illegal immigrants with criminal records. 

The riots quickly spread to Los Angeles, where the Los Angeles Police Department faced down bad actors of their own. Vehicles were set ablaze, property was covered with anti-ICE and anti-Trump graffiti, and stores were broken into and looted during the unrest.

Trump activated the California National Guard and U.S. Marines. He has been in a legal battle with Gov. Gavin Newsom over control of the National Guard.

Other federal law enforcement agencies have also turned their attention to the city amid the tension. 

FBI Director Kash Patel warned those who commit violence against police, saying "if you assault a law enforcement officer, you're going to jail—period."

"It doesn't matter where you came from, how you got here, or what cause you claim to represent," Patel told Fox News Digital. "If local jurisdictions won't stand behind the men and women who wear the badge, the FBI will."

Hundreds have been arrested since the riots began last weekend. 

The Trump administration, which says it has arrested criminal illegal immigrants who have been convicted of murder, sex crimes against children and battery, is continuing its ICE operations. 

"Murderers, pedophiles, and drug traffickers. These are the types of criminal illegal aliens that rioters are fighting to protect. How much longer will Governor Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass continue to prioritize these criminal illegal aliens over their own citizens?" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement on Wednesday.

"Secretary Noem has a message to the LA rioters: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law and arrest criminal illegal aliens," McLaughlin added.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Marines were seen standing guard outside a federal building in Los Angeles on Friday as they started operations after protests erupted last week over immigration raids. 

Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51 who is overseeing the 4,700 troops deployed by President Donald Trump, said the Marines finished training on civil disturbance and are starting their operations by replacing National Guard troops. Guard soldiers can then be assigned to protect more law enforcement agents on raids, Sherman said. 

About 200 Marines out of the 700 deployed to the protests are in the city, Sherman said. 

At 12:30 p.m., two Marines were seen standing at the entrance to the 17-story Wilshire Federal Building, which houses several federal offices, including Veterans Affairs and the FBI. 

They wore combat gear and carried rifles as they mingled with the National Guard, who have been checking IDs of those entering the parking lot. Both Guard members and Marines were then seen loading boxes onto a military transport truck.

The development comes a day after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that had directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California, shortly after a federal judge had ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the Tenth Amendment and exceeded Trump's statutory authority.

Some 2,000 National Guard troops have been in the city since last week when immigration raids set off protests. Some have provided protection to immigration agents making arrests. Another 2,000 Guard members were notified of deployment earlier this week.




The 200 Marines will be replacing soldiers protecting the federal building, which will allow more Guard members to be assigned to protecting federal agents on their operations, Sherman said. 

None of the military troops will be detaining anyone, he added. 

“I would like to emphasize that the soldiers will not participate in law enforcement activities. Rather, they'll be focused on protecting federal law enforcement personnel,” Sherman said.

Roughly 500 National Guard members have been used to provide security on immigration raids after undergoing expanded instruction, legal training and rehearsals with the agents doing the enforcement before they go on those missions.

It's unclear if the Marines will eventually provide security on raids. A total of 700 Marines have been trained to work in LA.

The movement of Marines into LA comes as a curfew has been in place in downtown and protests have ended after a few hours with arrests this week largely for failure to disperse. On the third night of the 8 p.m. curfew, officers with the Department of Homeland Security deployed flash bangs to disperse a crowd that had gathered near the jail, sending protesters sprinting away. 

As with the past two nights, the hourslong demonstrations remained peaceful and upbeat, drawing a few hundred attendees who marched through downtown chanting, dancing and poking fun at the Trump administration's characterization of the city as a “war zone.”

The protests began Friday after federal immigration raids arrested dozens of workers in Los Angeles. Protesters blocked a major freeway and set cars on fire over the weekend, and police responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.

Elsewhere, demonstrations have picked up across the U.S., emerging in more than a dozen major cities. Some have led to clashes with police and hundreds have been arrested. 

The movement of Marines into LA also comes ahead of demonstrations expected over the weekend in cities across the United States, and the possibility that Trump could send troops to other states for immigration enforcement as governors weigh what to do.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom has called the troop deployment a “serious breach of state sovereignty” and a power grab by Trump, and he has gone to court to stop it. The president has cited a legal provision that allows him to mobilize federal service members when there is “a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.”

Under the Posse Comitatus Act, active-duty forces are prohibited by law from conducting law enforcement. 

Sherman said the U.S. Marine Corps is responsible for guarding U.S. embassies overseas so they are well-trained on how to defend a federal building.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, has put 5,000 National Guard members on standby in cities where demonstrations are planned. In other Republican-controlled states, governors have not said when or how they may deploy troops.

A group of Democratic governors earlier signed a statement this week calling Trump's deployments “an alarming abuse of power.”

In Los Angeles, troops work in shifts and the public is likely to only see a few hundred out, Sherman said. 

The Trump administration has argued the troops are necessary to protect federal officers and quell unrest. 

So far, the protests have been centered mostly in downtown near City Hall and a federal detention center where some immigrants are being held. Much of the sprawling city has been spared from the protests.

There have been about 500 arrests since Saturday, the vast majority of which were for failing to leave the area at the request of law enforcement, according to the police department.

There have been a handful of more serious charges, including for assault against officers and for possession of a Molotov cocktail and a gun. Nine officers have been hurt, mostly with minor injuries.

Follow:


            Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from the US three months ago, has pleaded not guilty to federal human trafficking charges.
    


            Abrego Garcia is in court Friday morning wearing a red detention uniform.
    


            He faces counts of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.
    


            The allegations relate to a traffic stop when Abrego Garcia drove a Chevrolet Suburban with nine Hispanic male passengers through Tennessee in 2022. Prosecutors allege he transported undocumented people in the US on more than 100 trips between Texas, Maryland and other states.
    


            Prosecutors allege that over several years, Abrego Garcia “operated in the illicit world of an international smuggling ring.”
    


            His attorneys, in filings arguing for his release, question the severity of the allegations Abrego Garcia faces. They argue the law shouldn't even prompt the court to consider detaining him and holding a hearing like Friday's, let alone decide he should stay behind bars awaiting trial.

            “The Court cannot find that Mr. Abrego Garcia poses a serious risk of international flight simply because he's charged with a crime that the government finds distasteful,” his lawyers wrote to the Tennessee court this week.
    


            For months, the Trump administration has been locked in an intense standoff with the federal judiciary over court orders for the government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador, which experts, members of Congress and judges have perceived as a Constitutional crisis between the branches of government.
    


            The Tennessee indictment, approved under seal by a grand jury in late May, and accompanying arrest warrant are what enabled the US government to ask the Salvadoran government to return him, officials have said.
    


            Ahead of his arraignment Friday, Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, shared his gratitude for those who are fighting for his release at a news conference. She said Kilmar urges anyone who, like him, remains in immigration custody to “have faith.”
    


            “He says to continue fighting and (we) will be victorious because God is with us,” she said.
    


            Vasquez Sura, who is a US citizen, also stressed that her family should have never been put in this situation.
    


            “Our son, Kilmar Jr., is right now at his kindergarten graduation,” she said through tears. “My son is alone on his big day … and I'm here fighting for my husband – for his Dad – to come back home.”
    


            Attorney General Pam Bondi held a news conference touting Abrego Garcia's indictment last week, calling an aspect of the conspiracy, where children allegedly were transported for profit, “disturbing.” The indictment also alleges he trafficked drugs and firearms.
    


            “These facts demonstrate Abrego Garcia is a danger to our community,” Bondi said.
    


            While Bondi and the indictment emphasized the danger of human smuggling operations and suspected ties to the gang MS-13 – a focus of law enforcement as the Trump administration bears down on undocumented immigrants in the US – the grand jury indictment stopped short of alleging he was a mastermind in the conspiracy.
    


            In a filing last week, the prosecutors told the judge they believe Abrego Garcia also has a history of violence, linked to gangs in El Salvador before he came to the US.
    


            Abrego Garcia's lawyers contest the allegations linking him to infractions against minors can't be used to keep him detained. They also say children he is alleged to have transported aren't victims or at risk of harm because they were riding on the floorboard of his SUV, meaning some of the Justice Department's arguments to keep Abrego Garcia detained may not be enough for the judge to agree.
    


            He is not charged with any violent crimes or crimes against children.
    


            In a separate federal court proceeding in Maryland, Abrego Garcia's attorneys are arguing for Trump administration officials to be sanctioned because of their handling of his deportation situation, and the lack of information they provided to his legal team following multiple court orders, while Abrego Garcia was in El Salvador this year.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Friday urged Iran to quickly reach an agreement on curbing its nuclear program as Israel vowed to continue its bombardment of the country.

Trumped framed the volatile moment in the Middle East as a possible “second chance” for Iran's leadership to avoid further destruction “before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire.” 

The Republican president pressed on Iran as he met his national security team in the Situation Room to discuss the tricky path forward following Israel's devastating strikes, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to keep up for “as many days as it takes” to decapitate Iran's nuclear program.

The White House said it had no involvement in the strikes, but Trump highlighted that Israel used its deep arsenal of weaponry provided by the U.S. to target Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz and the country's ballistic missile program, as well as top nuclear scientists and officials.

Trump said on his Truth Social platform that he had warned Iran's leaders that “it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated, or were told, that the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it.”

Just hours before Israel launched its strikes on Iran early Friday, Trump was still holding onto tattered threads of hope that the long-simmering dispute could be resolved without military action. Now, he'll be tested anew on his ability to make good on a campaign promise to disentangle the U.S. from foreign conflicts.




In the aftermath of the Israeli strikes, the U.S. is shifting its military resources, including ships, in the Middle East as it looks to guard against possible retaliatory attacks by Tehran, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.

The Navy has directed the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner to begin sailing toward the Eastern Mediterranean and has directed a second destroyer to begin moving forward, so it can be available if requested by the White House.

As Israel stepped up planning for strikes in recent weeks, Iran had signaled the United States would be held responsible in the event of an Israeli attack. The warning was issued by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi even as he engaged in talks with Trump special envoy Steve Witkoff over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.

Friday's strikes came as Trump planned to dispatch Witkoff to Oman on Sunday for the next round of talks with the Iranian foreign minister. 

Witkoff still plans to go to Oman this weekend for talks on Tehran's nuclear program, but it's unclear if the Iranians will participate, according to U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private diplomatic discussions. 

The president made a series of phone calls Friday to U.S. television news anchors to renew his calls on Iran to curb its nuclear program.

CNN's Dana Bash said Trump told her the Iranians “should now come to the table” and get a deal done. And Trump told NBC News that Iranian officials are “calling me to speak” but didn't provide further detail.

Trump also spoke Friday with French President Emmanuel Macron about the evolving situation, and he was expected to call Netanyahu later in the day.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., offered rare words of Democratic praise for the Trump administration after the attack “for prioritizing diplomacy” and “refraining from participating” in the military strikes. But he also expressed deep concern about what the Israeli strikes could mean for U.S. personnel in the region. 

Iran has already fired more than 100 drones at Israel, with both Iraq and Jordan confirming they had flown over their airspace. Israel said the drones were being intercepted outside its airspace, and it was unclear whether any got through.

Trump in the hours before the attack still appeared hopeful in public comments that there would be more time for diplomacy.

But it was clear to the administration that Israel was edging toward taking military action against Iran. The State Department and U.S. military on Wednesday directed a voluntary evacuation of nonessential personnel and their loved ones from some U.S. diplomatic outposts in the Middle East.

Before Israel launched the strikes, some of Trump's strongest supporters were raising concerns about what another expansive conflict in the Mideast could mean for the Republican president, who ran on a promise to quickly end the brutal wars in Gaza and Ukraine. 

Trump has struggled to find an endgame to either of those conflicts and to make good on two of his biggest foreign policy campaign promises. 

And after criticizing President Joe Biden during last year's campaign for preventing Israel from carrying out strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Trump found himself making the case to the Israelis to give diplomacy a chance.

The push by the Trump administration to persuade Tehran to give up its nuclear program came after the U.S. and other world powers in 2015 reached a long-term, comprehensive nuclear agreement that limited Tehran's enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. 

But Trump unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-administration brokered agreement in 2018, calling it the “worst deal ever.”

The way forward is even more clouded now.

“No issue currently divides the right as much as foreign policy,” Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and an ally of the Trump White House, posted on X on Thursday. “I'm very concerned based on (everything) I've seen in the grassroots the last few months that this will cause a massive schism in MAGA and potentially disrupt our momentum and our insanely successful Presidency.”

Rosemary Kelanic, director of the Middle East program at Defense Priorities, said the job ahead for Trump and his team is to protect U.S. forces who are highly vulnerable to Iranian retaliation.

“Israel's strike on Iran,” Kelanic said, “must not become the United States' war.”

A crowd of anti-ICE protesters gathered outside the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark on Thursday night.

Four migrants escaped from the Delaney Hall ICE detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, on Thursday evening following an apparent disturbance inside the building, a senior Homeland Security official confirmed to Fox News.

"Additional law enforcement partners have been brought in to find these escapees and a BOLO has been disseminated," the official said. 

Immigration attorney Mustafa Cetin told NJ.com that around 50 detainees at the private facility pushed down a dormitory wall after becoming agitated when meals were delayed. 

"It's about the food, and some of the detainees were getting aggressive and it turned violent," Cetin said. 

He added that his client reported the wall was "not very strong" and described detainees hanging bedsheets in what may have been an escape attempt. The client also said he smelled gas during the incident.

By 6 p.m., dozens of officers from the Essex County Sheriff's Office and Newark Police were present, according to Rutgers University-Newark professor Whitney Strub, who posted images of the police presence and said he and others outside the jail "were all coughing at the same time," after being exposed to what they believed was "some kind of gas," NJ.com reported.

At approximately 9 p.m., a group of protesters blocked an SUV from exiting an ancillary gate at Delaney Hall, forcing it to back into the facility.

PIX11 News reported that the escapees were seen running near Turnpike 78 and Delancey Street.

Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka said his office was "concerned about reports of what has transpired at Delaney Hall this evening, ranging from withholding food and poor treatment, to uprising and escaped detainees." 

"This entire situation lacks sufficient oversight of every basic detail — including local zoning laws and fundamental constitutional rights. This is why city officials and our congressional delegation need to be allowed entry to observe and monitor, any why private prisons pose a very real problem to our state and its constitution," Baraka said in a statement. "We demand immediate answers and clear communication with the GEO Group and the Department of Homeland Security. We must put an end to this chaos and not allow this operation to continue unchecked."

The incident comes just two days after Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., was indicted on three federal charges stemming from a previous visit to Delaney Hall on May 9. 

McIver was with Newark Mayor Ras J. Baraka and others during what was described as an oversight visit. Baraka was initially charged with trespassing, but the charge was later dropped.

Israel launched an unprecedented decapitation strike of head Iranian figures as part of its wider strikes against Iran, taking out the country's top nuclear scientists and military leaders.

Beginning at around 3:30 a.m. Tehran time, Israel launched a series of strikes targeting Iranian missile sites, nuclear facilities, military command and control centers, and the apartments of military leaders and nuclear scientists. The latter part of this aimed to paralyze Iran's command structure, leaving it unable to effectively respond. The three most powerful military commanders were killed.

The IDF said its strikes hit “over 100 targets, including senior figures of the Iranian General Staff and leaders of the nuclear program.”

An Israeli security source told Fox News that over 20 sites, including apartments and offices, were hit in less than 15 minutes.

Here are the major figures killed in Friday's decapitation strikes:

Gen. Hossein Salami was the commander in chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a central power broker in the country.

Like most senior Iranian commanders, Salami made a name for himself during the Iran-Iraq War of 1980-1988. He became deputy commander of the IRGC in 2009 before assuming full control in 2019.

Salami was known for his hard-line rhetoric and boasting of Iran's military capabilities, even claiming that the country was “on the verge of becoming a world power,” the BBC reported.

One day before his death on Friday, he said Iran was “fully ready for any scenarios, situations, and circumstances.”

“The enemy thinks it can fight Iran the same way it fights defenceless Palestinians who are under an Israeli siege,” he said. “We are war-tested and experienced.”

The IRGC was established after the 1979 Islamic Revolution as a counterweight to the armed forces, viewed with distrust due to its previous loyalty to the Shah. It has since morphed into one of the biggest stakeholders of Iranian power, with some analysts believing it controls roughly one-third of the Iranian economy.

Salami's death was confirmed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who appointed Major Gen. Mohammad Pakpour as his replacement.

Major Gen. Mohammad Bagheri was the chief of staff of the Iranian armed forces, the second most powerful man in the country behind Khameini.

He made a name for himself during the Iran-Iraq War, serving in a military intelligence unit. His brother, Hassan, reportedly founded the IRGC's military intelligence unit during the war and served with distinction as a division commander, ultimately being killed by Iraqi forces. Bagheri took over the branch in 1983 after his brother's death, according to Iranian media cited by Al Jazeera.

Like most Iranian military figures, Mohammad Bagheri kept a secretive persona but was closely involved in IRGC operations. He was promoted to chief of staff of the armed forces in 2016.

As head of the armed forces, Bagheri commanded 500,000 active personnel.

His death was confirmed by Khameini, who appointed Maj. Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi as his replacement.

Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh was head of the IRGC Aerospace Forces, which oversaw Iran's ballistic missile forces. He was tapped as responsible for Iran's ballistic missile strikes against Israel last year, and a 2019 drone and missile strike against Saudi oil facilities.

The Israel Defense Forces said he was killed in an airstrike against an underground command center.

“Hajizadeh publicly pledged allegiance to the idea of destroying Israel on multiple occasions in recent years and played a central role in formulating the plan to destroy Israel,” a statement from the IDF read.

Gholamali Rashid served as Deputy Chief of the General Staff of Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran, putting him high up in the chain of command behind Bagheri. He was a major commander during the Iran-Iraq War.

Khameini confirmed his death and appointed Major General Ali Shadmani as his replacement.

Ali Shamkhani was head of Iran's Expediency Discernment Council of the System, one of the country's most senior advisory bodies. He was also known as a key diplomat and close adviser to Khameini.

Shamkhani represented Iran in high-level China-brokered peace talks with Saudi Arabia, leading to the two re-establishing diplomatic ties after a long-running cold war. Most recently, he took part in nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.

He was mortally wounded in an Israeli airstrike, dying shortly after in the hospital.

ISRAEL LAUNCHES MAJOR ATTACK ON IRAN OVER ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM: WHAT TO KNOW

Iranian state media confirmed the death of six nuclear scientists. 

Among them were Fereydoon Abbasi, former head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization; Mohammad Mahdi Tehranchi, president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran and a major figure in Iran's nuclear weapons program; Abdulhamid Minouchehr, head of nuclear engineering at Shahid Beheshti University; Ahmad Reza Zolfaghari, nuclear engineering professor at Shahid Beheshti University; Amirhossein Feqhi, a nuclear professor at the university; and a nuclear scientist who was identified only as Motallebzadeh, who was allegedly killed along with his wife.

Abbasi had survived an assassination attempt in 2010, which killed fellow nuclear scientist Majid Shahriari. The attempt was widely believed to be the doing of Israel.

A federal appeals court on Friday denied President Donald Trump‘s bid to rehear his appeal of a jury's verdict that he was liable for sexually assaulting E. Jean Carroll and defaming her.

A divided full bench of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit denied Trump's appeal, upholding the $5 million judgment against him. The appeal to the full court came months after a three-judge panel on the appeals court denied Trump's bid, meaning the final avenue through which the president may appeal the decision is the Supreme Court.

A New York jury found in May 2023 that Trump was liable for sexually assaulting Carroll in a Bergdorf Goodman dressing room in the mid-1990s and defaming her in 2022 by denying the accusation, awarding her $5 million in damages. The jury did not find him liable for rape, and Trump has maintained that the encounter never occurred.

The petition to the full appeals court alleged that the jury trial was tainted by improper evidence and that it improperly influenced the jury. Trump's lawyers further alleged that the judgment could set a dangerous precedent if allowed to stand.

A concurring opinion filed by Judge Myrna Perez, and joined by Judges Eunice Lee, Beth Robinson, and Sarah Merriam, said there was “no manifest error by the district court” and that Trump's lawyers failed to show “the standard for en banc review” was met.

“Simply relitigating a case is not an appropriate use of the en banc procedure. In those rare instances in which a case warrants our collective consideration, it is almost always because it involves a question of exceptional importance or a conflict between the panel's opinion and appellate precedent,” Perez said.

“The dissenting opinion ignores this rule of restraint. It points to no exceptionally important issues, nocases that actually conflict with the panel's decision, and no persuasive justification for review of this case by the full Court,” Perez added.

Judge Steven Menashi filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Judge Michael Park, expressing concern over the admission of character evidence in the trial against Trump.

“The result was a jury verdict based on impermissible character evidence and few reliable facts. No one can have any confidence that the jury would have returned the same verdict if the normal rules of evidence had been applied,” said Menashi, a Trump appointee.

APPEALS COURT UPHOLDS VERDICT FINDING TRUMP LIABLE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT

“Because I would apply the same rules in every case regardless of the identity of the defendant, I dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc,” Menashi added.

Trump also appealed a separate defamation ruling against him won by Carroll over the sexual assault claims, in which she won an additional $83.3 million in damages for a denial of the claim Trump made in 2019.

The Tennessee Highway Patrol released body camera video of its 2022 encounter with illegal immigrant Abrego-Garcia, who was deported to El Salvador's Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT).

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadorian migrant who was erroneously deported to El Salvador before being returned to the U.S. to face federal prosecution last week, pleaded not guilty on Friday to charges of human trafficking and conspiracy charges.

Garcia's legal team told U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes on Friday that they have had time to review the indictment, and Garcia understands what he is accused of, before he formally entered the plea, which stems from a 2022 traffic stop.

Abrego Garcia is charged with the trafficking of undocumented migrants, and conspiring with others to do so. 

The criminal case against Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 member, comes after a high-profile, protracted legal fight over his deportation and the Trump administration's efforts to delay his return to the U.S., even after the Supreme Court ordered the administration to "facilitate" his release earlier this year.

US JUDGE BLASTS TRUMP LAWYERS FOR 11TH-HOUR TACTICS IN MS-13 DEPORTATION CASE

The indictment alleges that Abrego Garica was part of a smuggling ring that helped bring immigrants to the U.S. illegally and smuggle them across the country. According to the indictment, Abrego Garcia and his co-conspirators made at least 100 trips between Texas and Maryland between 2016 and 2025, when he was deported.

Special Agent Peter T. Joseph told prosecutors on Friday that he was first assigned to Abrego Garcia's case in April 2025, when he was still detained in El Salvador.

Since then, Joseph said, he has reviewed footage from Abrego Garcia's 2022 traffic stop, which has emerged as the basis of the human smuggling charges.

At the time, Joseph told prosecutors, Abrego Garcia had been driving a vehicle with nine passengers and was pulled over while driving from St. Louis to Maryland with an expired license.

Six of the nine passengers in the vehicle have since been identified as being in the U.S. illegally, Joseph said, adding that one passenger in the van told officers that he was born in 2007, which would have made him just 15 at the time.

Abrego Garcia's legal team has vehemently disputed his alleged status as an MS-13 member, and are expected to contest the effort by U.S. prosecutors to have him detained pending trial.

His case has become a national flashpoint in the broader fight over Trump's hard-line immigration policies in his second White House term.

In a court filing Wednesday night, lawyers for Abrego Garcia urged U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee to release their client from custody while awaiting trial, arguing that the government's grounds for a detention hearing – and his alleged status as an MS-13 gang member – are meritless.

"Mr. Abrego Garcia asks the Court for what he has been denied the past several months – due process," his lawyers said, adding that there is no evidence their client is a flight risk, or that he has "systematically engaged in international travel in the recent past."

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have also disputed his status as a member of MS-13, which was based on allegations made by a confidential informant, according to court documents. The informant had alleged Abrego Garcia belonged to an MS-13 chapter in New York, where he had never lived.

Speaking at a press conference in Nashville before the arraignment, Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, told reporters that yesterday marked three months since her husband was "abducted and disappeared" by the Trump administration. 

She said the two were able to speak for the first time on Thursday. 

"Kilmar wants you to have faith," Sura said. "He says to continue fighting, and I will be victorious because God is with us.'"

Sura noted that their son, Kilmar Jr., was currently attending his kindergarten graduation ceremony in Maryland. "My heart is in Maryland with my kids," she said, her voice breaking with emotion. "But I'm here fighting for my husband, for his dad to come back home."

Federal prosecutors disputed that and have urged the judge to keep him in custody, saying in a filing of their own that Abrego Garcia "would have enormous reason to flee" if he were not immediately detained by ICE.

Court documents show the Justice Department filed the charges against Abrego Garcia on May 21 – prompting a flurry of questions as to when the investigation and impaneling of a grand jury would have taken place. 

Abrego Garcia's arraignment in Tennessee comes after his legal team asked a federal judge in Maryland late Wednesday to impose sanctions on the Trump administration for the administration's "egregious" and "repeated violations" of discovery obligations, according to the filing. 

"The Government's defiance has not been subtle," his attorneys told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who had been presiding over a civil case to determine whether the Trump administration complied with her order to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return from El Salvador.  "It has been vocal and sustained and flagrant."

In the filing, Abrego Garica's legal team asked Xinis to impose fines based on a finding of civil contempt, and to compel the government to compel the production of information that they say the administration has improperly withheld, as well as "investigate the extent of the government's willful noncompliance."

Xinis has yet to rule on the motion.

Earlier this week, lawyers for the Trump administration told the court that they planned to file a motion to dismiss the case by Monday on "mootness grounds," since Abrego Garcia is now on U.S. soil.

"The lengths the government has gone to resist discovery relating to these core questions raises a strong inference that the government is trying to hide its conduct from the scrutiny of this court, the plaintiffs, and the public," Abrego Garcia's team told Xinis on Wednesday. 

"What the government improperly seeks to hide must be exposed for all to see."

Abrego Garcia's family sued the Trump administration in March after the Salvadoran man, who entered the country illegally around 2012 and was living in Maryland, was abruptly deported to El Salvador in March. An immigration judge ruled in 2019 that he could be deported, just not to El Salvador.

Upon being returned to the U.S. last week, Abrego Garcia was immediately sent to Tennessee to face federal charges related to transporting undocumented immigrants.

            Iran's highest-ranking military officer, the head of its elite Revolutionary Guards Corps and its air force and a former national security chief have all been killed in Israel's unprecedented Operation Rising Lion.
    


            Their deaths will send shockwaves through the nation's military establishment and could seriously hamper the Islamic Republic's ability to respond to Israel's attacks. Here's what you need to know about them.
    


            As the head of the secretive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) Major General Hossein Salami, was one of the most powerful men in Iran, overseeing its most potent military arm and reporting directly to its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
    


            Born in 1960, according to a US sanctions docket, Salami had headed the secretive and IRGC since 2019.
    


            The position saw him helming one of the most powerful tools wielded by the Iranian state, which has been instrumental in crushing dissent at home and projecting Iran's power abroad.
    


            Analysts say the IRGC funds and supports a vast network of militias across the region which it uses to strike at US and other military personnel across the Middle East.
    


            The IRGC is also believed to provide materials and support to Yemen's Houthis, enabling the group to strike international shipping in the Red Sea and launch missiles and drones at Israel.
    


            Salami was at the helm of the IRGC when Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel in April and October last year, in the first direct strikes by Iran on Israeli territory.
    


            In footage released by Iranian state media in January, Salami was seen inspecting what the media said was an underground military facility that had played a role in those attacks.
    


            Wearing a green military uniform and short beard, Salami took the salute of soldiers in the cavernous underground complex and walked over the United States and Israel flags on the ground.
    


            The site was now manufacturing “new special missiles,” semi-official Iranian media outlet Mehr News reported.
    


            Salami was head of the IRGC when it shot down a Ukrainian passenger jet shortly after it took off from Tehran's international airport, killing all 176 people on board.
    


            An unnamed IRGC commander of the Tor M1 surface-to-air missile defense system that shot down the plane was sentenced to 13 years in prison, according to Iran's Mehr news outlet.
    


            CNN's security analyst Beth Sanner said that removing Salami is akin to taking out the US chairman of the joint chiefs of staff: “You can imagine what Americans would do,” she said.
    


            Since 2016 Mohammad Bagheri had served as the chief of staff of Iran's armed forces, which IISS estimated could call on more than 500,000 active personnel.
    


            The General Staff is “the most senior military body in Iran, which implements policy and monitors and coordinates activities within the armed forces”, according to a US Treasury document laying out sanctions against Bagheri in 2019.
    


            Bagheri was sanctioned along with nine others close to Ayatollah Khamenei “who have for decades oppressed the Iranian people, exported terrorism, and advanced destabilizing policies around the world,” the document said.
    


            Photos published by Iran's Tasnim news outlet showed him allegedly meeting with Iranian troops fighting on the ground alongside government forces in Syria in 2017.
    


            In April Bagheri met Saudi Defense Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman Al Saud in Tehran, in a rare visit by a senior Saudi royal to the Islamic Republic.
    


            The next month Reuters reported that during the meeting the Saudi defense minister had delivered a warning to Bagheri: take President Donald Trump's offer to negotiate a nuclear agreement seriously because it presents a way to avoid the risk of war with Israel.
    


            Ali Shamkhani was a close aide to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and represented Tehran at talks which sealed a landmark agreement to restore diplomatic ties with foe Saudi Arabia.
    


            Iranian state TV network IRINN confirmed his death following Israel's unprecedented strikes on Friday.
    


            Shamkhani served as the country's top national security official for a decade from 2013, and before that served in a number of important roles, including in the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and the ministry of defense.
    


            He had been a rising star of Iranian diplomacy, well known in foreign-policy circles in Washington and Europe.
    


            Shamkhani represented Iran in China-brokered talks with Saudi officials that led to the two countries agreeing to re-establish diplomatic ties after years of hostility.
    


            But he was abruptly replaced in mid-2023.
    


            The former national security chief was ambitious, experts say, and had an extensive portfolio. He ran for president in 2001 to held key posts in the IRGC and the defense ministry. Some analysts suggested at the time that Khamenei may have thought him too ambitious.
    


            Still, he remained a close aide to the supreme leader, and gave advice as Iran re-entered nuclear talks with the administration of US President Donald Trump.
    


            In April, days before talks with the US, he warned Tehran could expel UN nuclear inspectors and cease cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) if it feels under threat.
    


            The death of Amir Ali Hajizadeh, commander of the IRGC's Air Force, is a major blow to Tehran.
    


            Hajizadeh headed the country's missile program, which was involved in defending the country's air space and carrying out attacks overseas.
    


            Hajizadeh was the mastermind of Iran's previous attack on Israel in April 2024 as well as the missile attack on a US base in Iraq in 2020.
    


            The Israeli military said Hajizadeh was killed alongside other senior air force leaders in a strike as they gathered at an underground command center.

In the weeks before Election Day, it seemed like the candidate had two campaigns.

Listen to more stories on the  Noa app.

Kamala Harris's campaign thought it knew exactly how to beat Donald Trump. With just weeks left before Election Day, it warned over and over that he was “unhinged, unstable, and unchecked.” But instead of amplifying that message, Future Forward—the $900 million super PAC that the campaign was counting on for a flood of ads—had a different plan. The campaign leader Jen O'Malley Dillon grumbled in private meetings that the group had gone rogue, threatening Harris's chances of winning. O'Malley Dillon told her team that she had never seen anything else like this.

Usually super PACs follow the lead of the candidates they support, while taking on less savory tasks, such as viciously attacking their opponents. But Future Forward had built a bigger internal research program than the campaign had, and its leaders saw only one clear path to victory. Harris had to stay laser-focused on the economy. She had to present herself as a disrupter, not as a protector of the status quo.

The Harris team liked Future Forward's economic ads, but they believed that Trump's approval ratings were dangerously high. There needed to be a sustained, direct attack on him. They also argued that the super PAC had delayed its advertising for too long, had not targeted those ads enough to different groups of voters, and had failed to properly distribute money for get-out-the-vote efforts. So Harris's team shifted strategy to do some of that themselves. Harris told reporters that she saw Trump as a fascist, and recruited some of his former advisers as her spokespeople.

Future Forward's team scoffed. “People might not mind ‘unhinged' if their fingers are caught in the door,” one Future Forward strategist started telling colleagues inside the organization. They did not believe that there was evidence in the voter data to justify a switch back to the politics of protecting democratic norms.

Listen: A former Republican strategist on why Harris lost

Campaigns and groups such as super PACs are not allowed to directly coordinate on many ad-spending decisions, but there are legal ways for them to signal their desires. Future Forward began quietly raising alarms in private polling memos that it knew the campaign would read. O'Malley Dillon publicly suggested in September that top donors give to other groups in addition to Future Forward.

“They are very driven by ad testing, which is spot by spot—a lot of trees. But the way I see it, the presidential campaign is a forest,” a top Harris-campaign adviser told us about their objections to Future Forward's approach. “The candidate is the candidate, for good or bad. You have to follow their lead.”

Neither side would change course. When Harris eventually lost, she did so with the backing of two different efforts that sometimes worked at cross-purposes, an error that both sides still believe may have cost Democrats the election. “We should have been one streamlined engine whose true mission was to elect Kamala Harris and defeat Donald Trump,” Rufus Gifford, a veteran Democratic fundraiser who worked for the Harris campaign, told us. “And it is clear that that was not always what happened.”

Once the election was decided, the remaining restrictions on communication and coordination were lifted. But seven months after the loss to Trump, there has been little meaningful discussion of what happened between the fighting factions of the Democratic Party—although O'Malley Dillon and Chauncey McLean, a co-founder of Future Forward, did meet on Wednesday to talk through their post-election views.

Anger has continued to fester as Future Forward positions itself to play a major role in the 2028 presidential election. One strategist involved in the controversy has taken to calling it “the largest fight for the soul of the Democratic Party that no one is talking about.”

The unusual circumstances of the 2024 presidential election—a brash, prototypical, seemingly Teflon candidate on the Republican side, and a last-minute candidate switch on the Democratic one—set the stage for the collapse of the traditional super PAC–campaign dynamic. But the resulting conflict also revealed a fundamental flaw in the multibillion-dollar architecture that Democrats had built to defeat Trump, raising questions about who controlled the Democratic Party in 2024, and who will steer it into the future.

“Is Future Forward meant to be the group that determines the strategy for the presidential candidate? I'm not sure,” one major donor to the group told us.

This story is based on interviews with more than 20 senior Democratic strategists, donors, or advisers who worked to defeat Trump last year, as well as a review of a trove of previously unreleased Future Forward testing and briefing documents obtained by The Atlantic. Many of the people we spoke with requested anonymity because they typically avoid public comment, were not authorized to speak, or are strategists who want to work for future campaigns.

Defenders of Future Forward say the party needs to continue to replace its reliance on all-star campaign gurus and activist groups with cutting-edge data science that can precisely measure what voters want. They believe that Harris's campaign ultimately betrayed her candidacy by drifting away from the central economic narrative of the race—a choice between a Democrat who would make things better for working people and a Republican who would reward his rich friends. "It's pretty clear that there was one path for her, and we saw success there—we had to make it about what voters wanted, not what we thought they should care about,” one person involved in the Future Forward effort told us. “We will never know if it would have been enough, but it is the question going forward.”

Three weeks after the election, Future Forward leaders sent a private memo to their donors. They claimed that Future Forward's television ads had been about twice as successful at persuading people to support Harris as “other Dem” television spending, a category dominated by the Harris campaign. “Our execution,” they concluded, “proved more effective at moving the needle.”

The next step, they told donors, was to expand Future Forward's preparations for the 2028 campaign. They plan to provide “testing for the individual would-be candidates so they can learn—early—what works and does not work for them and with the general electorate,” the memo said.

“There is an opportunity,” they told donors, “to fundamentally improve how Presidential campaigns work.”

Veterans of the Harris campaign and members of other outside groups, however, have argued against an expansion of Future Forward's role and pushed for a rethinking of how super PACs are used. “I think our side was completely mismatched when it came to the ecosystem of Trump and his super PACs and ours,” O'Malley Dillon said on Pod Save America, the same day that Future Forward sent its memo. Harris senior adviser David Plouffe, appearing alongside O'Malley Dillon, was even more blunt about the GOP advantage: “I'm just sick and tired of it,” he declared.

“One group making the decisions for the entire ecosystem and thinking they were making better decisions than the campaign and the candidate should not be how we move forward,” another senior Harris-campaign adviser told us. “They don't have the experience. They don't have the understanding of the nuance of this. They didn't know better.”

America's first political campaigns were self-financed by wealthy candidates like George Washington, who used their money to buy voter support with booze. In the second half of the 20th century, Congress decided to limit the amount of money any single person or company other than the candidate could use to influence American elections and to outlaw vote purchases. Federal courts pushed back in 2010, over the objection of Democratic Party leaders. Some of the laws meant to limit corruption, they decided, violated the First Amendment rights of the rich.

Whiskey can no longer be traded for votes, although donors can throw alcohol-soaked parties to celebrate the general notion of voting. The wealthiest Americans, companies, and unions get to spend unlimited amounts to influence elections' outcomes, but those funds cannot go directly to the candidates' campaigns or to their political parties, which have strict contribution limits. The really big checks go to “independent” nonprofits, which often do not report their donors, or to so-called super PACs, which disclose their activity to the Federal Election Commission. Future Forward raised money both ways.

Under the new system, major-party presidential candidates need at least one outside operation with deep pockets in their corner, or else they place themselves at an enormous disadvantage. Candidates are barred from privately “coordinating” on some types of spending with these groups, but they can communicate in other ways: Their campaigns can signal their strategic desires by talking to reporters, who print their words, or by way of discreet posts on public websites. Super PACs can do the same or speak directly to the campaigns through “one-way” conversations, often Zoom briefings where the campaign team does not speak or turn on their cameras.

Candidates also have the ability to signal donors to support the “independent” groups of their choosing before the start of a campaign. This typically involves placing trusted aides at the outside groups, as Trump did at the start of the 2024 campaign cycle with a group called MAGA Inc., or as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton did with Priorities USA. Joe Biden decided to go a different direction in July 2023, when his advisers Anita Dunn and O'Malley Dillon gave interviews to The New York Times that strongly implied that Future Forward had received Biden's unofficial super-PAC “blessing.” A top Biden fundraiser, Katie Petrelius, joined the group to encourage donors.

McLean and his team quickly incorporated the Times article into the March 2024 pitch deck they showed donors, a copy of which we obtained. But unlike MAGA Inc., Future Forward did not present itself as simply an extension of the Democratic campaign, with Biden himself, and later Harris, as its north star. Internal staff talking points—released just before Election Day and marked “not for distribution”—described the group's power as coming from its impact on the electorate, not from “being anointed or pre-determined” by a candidate.

The group's mission had instead been set at its founding, after the 2018 cycle, when strategists who had met during Obama's 2012 reelection campaign concluded that they could bring a new level of mathematical precision to the art of voter influence and apply that wisdom to the spending of dozens of Democratic-aligned groups. During the 2024 campaign, the group granted more than $220 million to 73 organizations, including Emily's List and Somos Votantes, for advertising, issue advocacy, voter mobilization, and registration. Future Forward has never issued a press release, and with the exception of two summer Zoom briefings, where questions were screened, the leadership has mostly avoided larger group conversations about strategy with the other outside operations fighting to defeat Trump.

Future Forward's approach infuriated many members of veteran Democratic voter-mobilization and persuasion groups, who felt sidelined from both donors and from the strategy conversation. “Resources were not allocated early enough, or to long-standing organizations that know their audiences,” Danielle Butterfield, the executive director of Priorities USA, told us.

But Future Forward believed there was a superior way to run campaigns and allocate money. By March 2024, it was telling donors that it could produce “the absolute best ads that are proven to be effective across platforms” with a voter response rate “55% better than the average ad.” Over the course of 2024, Future Forward conducted hundreds of focus groups and collected more data on American voters than any other political effort in history, including more than 14 million voter surveys in the final 10 months before Election Day. The group created and tested more than 1,000 advertisements to support Harris's presidential bid from dozens of ad firms, using a randomized-controlled-trial method that compared the vote preference of people who had seen an ad against those who had not. The best-testing spots blanketed the airwaves in swing states starting in August and were used to purchase more than 3 billion digital-video ad impressions.

As a matter of fundraising, the pitch was a massive success, attracting more than 69 percent of all Democratic presidential super-PAC dollars—more than three times the share of the top super PAC in 2020, according to an analysis by the independent journalist Kyle Tharp. Much of that money came from America's wealthiest Democratic supporters, such as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz. (Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder of Emerson Collective, which is the majority owner of The Atlantic, gave to a part of the Future Forward effort that does not disclose its donors, according to The New York Times.) For context, $900 million is more money than the Democratic National Committee raised last cycle and nearly twice as much as Trump's own campaign collected. The Biden and Harris operation ultimately raised $1.2 billion.

“Future Forward wasn't started by allies of one candidate or campaign,” the group's talking points declare. “While it can upset (or even upend) the status quo in politics, no decision is made that isn't in the best interests of impacting the outcome of the election.”

The Biden and Harris campaigns operated with a different model. They had a similar data operation, with horse-race polling, focus groups, and randomized-controlled trials of ads, but it was overlaid with a crew of veteran campaign strategists. Biden and one of his top advisers, Mike Donilon, believed from the start of his campaign that big themes about individual freedom, democracy, and Trump's character would shape the outcome. Their goal was to use the data from ad testing to inform the judgment of the senior advisers, not to determine what they would do. Future Forward had a different approach.

“I think they thought that if we were doing something different from what they were doing, we were stupid,” a third Harris-campaign strategist told us. “The reality is we just believed in the strength of our strategy and disagreed with theirs.”

Tensions between the two approaches surfaced early. Concerned about Biden's relatively weak position in polling, the campaign launched an ad blitz in late 2023, aiming to reset voters' views of the president. The campaign specifically targeted Latino and Asian audiences. Future Forward, which had long favored advertising close to Election Day, held back, even as MAGA Inc. began going on the air the next year. The first Future Forward super-PAC spot did not run until after Trump's indictments, felony convictions, and assasination attempt; the Republican convention; and the switch to Harris. The election's exit polls showed that 80 percent of voters had made up their minds before the end of August, when the full force of the group's spending hit the airwaves.

From the start, there were doubts inside the operation about Biden's view of the race. At the beginning of 2024, the group secretly commissioned 154 ads for Biden and tested them from February to April, according to another internal document. The results suggested that the single worst ad it tested echoed the threat-to-democracy themes that Biden's team had embraced—casting Trump as breaking from presidential norms, seeking revenge on his opponents, and threatening to put them in jail.

Biden nevertheless launched ads in June that highlighted Trump's recent felony conviction and questions about his sanity. “Something's snapped,” Biden started saying of Trump. Future Forward insiders told us that they'd planned to start airing ads after the first debate, in June, hoping that the face-to-face meeting between Biden and Trump would mute concerns about the president's age. When the opposite happened, the Biden team made it clear through various channels that they still wanted Future Forward to start spending to shore up Biden's position. After all, they had blessed the group, and many of Biden's top donors had made contributions.

Dunn, the closest of Biden's advisers to Future Forward, informed the campaign that the group did not think ads defending Biden at that point were a good investment, according to people familiar with the conversation. McLean later described the decision to refuse Biden's call for help as the hardest choice he had ever made. Biden, the group concluded, was the only one who could prove to voters that he was up for the job, even if donors were not withholding checks to try to force him out of the race. No outside group, no matter how well funded, could cause voters to unsee what they'd witnessed.

After Biden left the debate stage, nothing about the Democratic bid proceeded as planned. Despite the chaos, both sides of the $2 billion effort to defeat Trump found themselves working from the same playbook in early August, when Harris hit the campaign trail backed by a massive introductory advertising push by her campaign and Future Forward. Those early ads shared common traits—a tour through Harris's biography, a focus on the economy, and a pitch that she was offering the country something different. “The data continues to point to the benefits of a mostly forward-looking and largely economic campaign,” Future Forward concluded in an August 9 messaging document.

"We built a coherent story: This is an economic contrast; she's going to be better for your bottom line than he is,” a Future Forward strategist told us about the group's ads. “We weren't just taking the top-testing ads off the spreadsheet, because then you would have gotten gobbledygook.”

But the agreement broke down in September. Harris's advisers knew that economic concerns ranked highest for voters, but they decided that those issues would not be enough to defeat Trump. Trump's approval ratings increased after the July assassination attempt and the Republican convention, as the “something snapped” argument faded away. Harris's campaign believed that no one had set a clear negative frame for Trump. Over hours of internal debates, it came up with a new, triple-negative tagline: “unhinged, unstable, and unchecked.” Expecting that Future Forward would not shift course, it bought advertising to fill what it saw as the gaps left by the super PAC.

Harris began to appear at events with Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming representative who was once Republican royalty, and new campaign ads featured former Trump advisers warning of his return to the White House. The campaign believed that it could improve margins among moderates and the college-educated conservatives who had long been concerned about Trump's behavior. For Future Forward's number crunchers, the message switch was a disaster.

The group sent up a warning flare. “Make the argument about voters' lives,” declared an October 15 document posted on a website that campaign strategists could read. “Our task remains more about Harris than Trump.” By embracing Cheney and other conservatives, Harris was hewing to the unpopular status quo and defending institutional norms at a time when up-for-grabs voters wanted change. The document noted that ads focused “on Trump's fitness as disqualification alone, without tying to voter impact” were among their worst-testing. The document included polling results that found that 53 percent of voters nationwide said they preferred a “shock to the system,” compared with 37 percent who favored “a return to basic stability.”

The differences in approach were so stark that, at one point, a data firm working with Future Forward worried that the campaign was using faulty data. In fact, both the campaign and the super PAC were using highly sophisticated methodologies for their testing, and the main issue was interpretation. “Future Forward's theory of the case didn't change when the case—when the race—changed quite a bit,” a Democratic strategist working with the campaign told us.

The Harris strategists were not the only ones concerned about Future Forward's conclusions. Inside the super PAC, people focused on outreach to Latino and Asian American audiences were worried about the group's decision to turn away from creating targeted ads, after Future Forward's testing showed that those populations were best moved by the same ads as the rest of the country, according to people familiar with the discussions. For voters who did not speak English, the group ran ads in eight languages.

At the core of these strategy disagreements was a debate over whether ad tests that focused on measuring vote-choice persuasion had limits. Some strategists argued that ads also had to build a sense of political and ethnic identity, and excite people to get more involved in politics or share messages on social media. Rather than just respond to public opinion, they wanted to try to drive it in new directions. Trump had proved himself a master of elevating relatively obscure issues—such as government-funded surgeries for transgender people—to change the entire political conversation.

“There is an art and a science to persuasion,” Jenifer Fernandez Ancona, a co-founder of the Democratic donor group Way to Win, told us. “It requires striking an emotional chord with people that will stick, and that goes beyond what can be captured in randomized control trials alone.”

Anat Shenker-Osorio, a Democratic data strategist who works with Way to Win and has criticized Future Forward's methods, argues that ad testing in online panels creates an artificial environment where people are forced to watch the tested spots. “That does not mirror conditions in real life,” she told us. “This testing cannot tell us what would cause people to pay attention and what would cause your base to want to repeat the message. What would cause your base to wear the equivalent of the red hats?”

A Future Forward spokesperson told us that this critique was misguided. “Data can't solve every problem, but it shows what voters really think, not what people who work in politics wish they thought,” the spokesperson said.

Others complained that Future Forward's decision making on ads was too secretive. Ad firms got paid for production costs, and then submitted their spots to Future Forward for testing—and they received a commission of the spending, at a rate below industry standard, if their ad was chosen to run. About 25 firms got paid for ads that aired. But about 12 percent of the group's ads were made byaffiliates of Blue Sky, a firm partly owned by McLean and Jon Fromowitz, two leaders of the group, who were making the decisions. Other ad makers received a larger share, and Future Forward said that it was not unusual for large campaigns to have strategists who work on ads.

“Who watches the watchmen?” one person familiar with the operation told us, explaining the risk of self-dealing.

Since the election, Future Forward has continued to churn out voter-survey data with the aim of shaping how Democrats communicate with voters. The regular “Doppler” emails, which are sent privately to a select group of Democratic officials and strategists, test everything from the social-media posts of lawmakers to podcast appearances by former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and excerpts of rallies featuring Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.

In these messages, party leaders are still urged to “make criticism of Trump economic and personal,” avoid personal attacks, use specific numbers such as “$880 billion in Medicaid cuts,” and create “vivid contrasts” such as “tax breaks for the wealthy vs. food aid cuts.”

The Democratic National Committee, which is working on an audit of the 2024 campaign due this summer, is expected to look at the campaign's relationship with Future Forward, say people familiar with the plan. But there's still no clarity on how the party and its top candidates, donors, strategists, and data wonks will choose to structure the 2028 effort to win back the White House.

Everyone we spoke with for this story agreed on one thing: What the Democrats did in 2024—using two competing camps that deployed conflicting strategies—cannot happen again.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States is shifting military resources, including ships, in the Middle East in response to Israel's strikes on Iran and a possible retaliatory attack by Tehran, U.S. officials said Friday.

The Navy has directed the destroyer USS Thomas Hudner, which is capable of defending against ballistic missiles, to begin sailing from the western Mediterranean Sea toward the eastern Mediterranean and has directed a second destroyer to begin moving forward so it can be available if requested by the White House.

American fighter jets also are patrolling the sky in the Middle East to protect personnel and installations, an official said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public or to discuss ongoing operations.

President Donald Trump was meeting with his National Security Council principals Friday to discuss the situation. 

The forces in the region have been taking precautionary measures for days, including having military dependents voluntarily depart regional bases, in anticipation of the strikes and to protect those personnel in case of a large-scale response from Tehran.

Typically around 30,000 troops are based in the Middle East, and about 40,000 troops are in the region now, according to a U.S. official. That number surged as high as 43,000 last October amid the ongoing tensions between Israel and Iran as well as continuous attacks on commercial and military ships in the Red Sea by the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen.




The Navy has additional assets that it could surge to the Middle East if needed, particularly its aircraft carriers and the warships that sail with them. The USS Carl Vinson is in the Arabian Sea — the only aircraft carrier in the region.

The carrier USS Nimitz is in the Indo-Pacific and could be directed toward the Middle East if needed, and the USS George Washington just left its port in Japan and could be directed to the region if so ordered, one of the officials said. 

Then-President Joe Biden initially surged ships to protect Israel following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas that launched the war in Gaza. It was seen as a deterrent against Hezbollah and Iran at the time.

On Oct. 1, 2024, U.S. Navy destroyers fired about a dozen interceptors in defense of Israel as the country came under attack by more than 200 missiles fired by Iran.

WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's administration this week provided deportation officials with personal data -- including the immigration status -- on millions of Medicaid enrollees, a move that could make it easier to locate people as part of his sweeping immigration crackdown.

An internal memo and emails obtained by The Associated Press show that Medicaid officials unsuccessfully sought to block the data transfer, citing legal and ethical concerns. 

Nevertheless, two top advisers to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the dataset handed over to the Department of Homeland Security, the emails show. Officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were given just 54 minutes on Tuesday to comply with the directive.

The dataset includes the information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. CMS transferred the information just as the Trump administration was ramping up its enforcement efforts in Southern California. 

California Gov. Gavin Newsom 's office said in a statement that it was concerned about how deportation officials might utilize the data, especially as federal authorities conduct immigration raids with the assistance of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles.

“We deeply value the privacy of all Californians,” the statement said. “This potential data transfer brought to our attention by the AP is extremely concerning, and if true, potentially unlawful, particularly given numerous headlines highlighting potential improper federal use of personal information and federal actions to target the personal information of Americans.” 




U.S. Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said the data sharing was legal. He declined to answer questions about why the data was shared with DHS and how it would be used.

“With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon said. 

DHS officials did not respond to requests for comment. 

Besides helping authorities locate migrants, experts said, the government could also use the information to scuttle the hopes of migrants seeking green cards, permanent residency or citizenship if they had ever obtained Medicaid benefits funded by the federal government. 

CMS announced late last month that it was reviewing some state's Medicaid enrollees to ensure federal funds have not been used to pay for coverage for people with “unsatisfactory immigration status.” In a letter sent to state Medicaid officials, CMS said that the effort was part of Trump's Feb. 19 executive order titled “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders.” 

As part of the review, California, Washington and Illinois shared details about non-U.S. citizens who have enrolled in their state's Medicaid program, according to a June 6 memo signed by Medicaid Deputy Director Sara Vitolo that was obtained by the AP. The memo was written by several CMS officials under Vitolo's supervision, according to sources familiar with the process.

The data includes addresses, names, social security numbers and claims data for enrollees in those states, according to the memo and two people familiar with what the states sent to CMS. Both individuals spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share details about the data exchange.

CMS officials attempted to fight the data sharing request from Homeland Security, saying that to do so would violate federal laws, including the Social Security Act and the Privacy Act of 1974, according to Vitolo's memo. 

“Multiple federal statutory and regulatory authorities do not permit CMS to share this information with entities outside of CMS,” Vitolo wrote, further explaining that the sharing of such personal data is only allowed for directly administering the Medicaid program. 

Sharing information about Medicaid applicants or enrollees with DHS officials would violate a “longstanding policy,” wrote Vitolo, a career employee, to Trump appointee Kim Brandt, deputy administrator and chief operating officer of CMS .

Vitolo and Brandt could not be reached for comment.

The legal arguments outlined in the memo were not persuasive to Trump appointees at HHS, which oversees the Medicaid agency.

Four days after the memo was sent, on June 10, HHS officials directed the transfer of “the data to DHS by 5:30 ET today,” according to email exchanges obtained by AP.

Former government officials said the move was unusual because CMS, which has access to personal health data for nearly half of the country, does not typically share such sensitive information with other departments. 

“DHS has no role in anything related to Medicaid,” said Jeffrey Grant, a former career employee at CMS. 

Beyond her legal arguments, Vitolo said sharing the information with DHS could have a chilling effect on states, perhaps prompting them to withhold information. States, she added needed to guard against the “legal risk” they were taking by giving federal officials data that could be shared with deportation officials. 

All states must legally provide emergency Medicaid services to non-U.S. citizens, including to those who are lawfully present but have not yet met a five-year wait to apply for Medicaid. 

Seven states, along with the District, allow immigrants who are not living legally in the country to enroll — with full benefits — in their state's Medicaid program. The states launched these programs during the Biden administration and said they would not bill the federal government to cover those immigrants' health care costs. 

The Trump administration has raised doubts about that pledge. 

Nixon, the HHS spokesman, said that the state's Medicaid programs for immigrants “opened the floodgates for illegal immigrants to exploit Medicaid – and forced hardworking Americans to foot the bill.” 

All of the states — California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado — have Democratic governors. Due to his state's budget woes, Newsom announced earlier this year he would freeze enrollment into the program; Illinois will also shut down its program for roughly 30,000 non-U.S. citizens in July. 

The remaining states — New York, Oregon, Minnesota and Colorado — have not yet submitted the identifiable data to CMS as part of the review, according to a public health official who has reviewed CMS' requests to the states. 

State health officials from the District, Washington and Illinois did not respond to requests for comment. 

Newsom's office said in its statement that the data sharing has “implications for all Californians, but it is especially concerning for vulnerable communities.”

Former assistant U.S. attorney Andy McCarthy joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss another Chinese national being arrested for allegedly smuggling bio weapons in the country and California Governor Gavin Newsom suing President Donald Trump. 

A Russian-born scientist and Harvard University cancer researcher accused of smuggling frog embryos into the United States has been released following four months in federal custody Thursday. 

Kseniia Petrova, 30, was arrested in February after returning from a vacation in France, where she had obtained a package of superfine sections of frog embryos from a laboratory for research. Upon arriving at Boston Logan International Airport, Petrova was questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection regarding the materials. 

"I just want to thank everybody," Petrova said on the steps of the federal courthouse in Boston following her release. "A lot of people started contacting me and sending me letters, and it was a huge support without which I won't be able to survive."

Following the interview, the researcher was informed her visa was being canceled. 

The Department of Homeland Security previously said in a statement posted on social media that Petrova was arrested for "lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country," adding that messages on her phone "revealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them." 

The Department of Homeland Security and Harvard University did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

In an April interview with The Associated Press, Petrova said she was unaware the samples needed to be declared upon her return and insisted she was not trying to smuggle anything into the country.

Petrova was initially detained by immigration officials in Vermont before being sent to a facility in Louisiana. In May, she was formally charged with smuggling in Massachusetts, with a federal judge in Vermont setting a hearing date on her petition seeking release. 

The federal judge in Vermont later ruled that the actions of the immigration officers were unlawful and that Petrova "posed a threat to no one." She was subsequently released from ICE custody but remained in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service due to the smuggling charge. 

On Thursday, Magistrate Judge Judith Dein approved an agreement between federal prosecutors and Petrova's immigration attorney, effectively releasing the researcher but limiting her ability to travel while maintaining custody of her passport. 

"I hear it's sunny," Dein told Petrova after her release. "Goodbye."

Petrova's colleagues have previously testified on her behalf, telling the court she is conducting valuable research that aids in searching for a cure for cancer. 

Greg Romanovsky, the immigration attorney representing Petrova, said his client has not "decided whether she wants to stay in the United States yet." 

"She has offers from different countries around the world, countries that are eager to support the important research that she's doing," he said. "She's weighing her options at the moment, and she's very grateful to be out." 

Romanovsky did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Under the conditions of her release, Petrova must report any contact with law enforcement – including ICE – to her supervising officer within 24 hours, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. 

Petrova is scheduled to return to court next week for a probable cause hearing regarding the smuggling charge.

Chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin reports the latest on Israel's attack on Iran from the Pentagon. 

Far-left House Democrats are hammering Israel for its Thursday night strikes on Iran.

Members of the House's progressive "Squad," already critical of Israel's war on Gaza, are denouncing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a "war criminal" after his government launched attacks on Tehran and surrounding areas.

"Israel has once again bombed Iran, a dangerous & reckless escalation. The war criminal Netanyahu wants to ignite an endless regional war & drag the US into it," Rep. Summer Lee, D-Pa., wrote on X. "Any politician who tries to help him betrays us all. The American people do not want this."

Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., claimed Israel would drag the U.S. into war in the Middle East.

"The Israeli government bombing Iran is a dangerous escalation that could lead to regional war. War Criminal Netanyahu will do anything to maintain his grip on power," Tlaib wrote.

"We cannot let him drag our country into a war with Iran. Our government must stop funding and supporting this rogue genocidal regime."

Omar said, "Regardless of what [President Donald Trump] thinks, Israel knows America will do whatever they want and feels confident about their ability to get into war and have the American government back them up. Israel also knows they can always rely on getting America to protect and serve its needs."

"Everyone in America should prepare themselves to either see their tax dollars being spent on weapon supplies to Israel or be dragged into war with Iran if this escalates," Omar said.

Washington and Tehran have been engaged in talks about a new Iran nuclear deal aimed at reining in the Islamic republic's uranium enrichment.

Trump posted on Truth Social Friday morning that Iran now had a "second chance" to come to the table after Israel's strikes.

Democrats, meanwhile, were more concerned.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" that he thought Israel's strikes, which it called preemptive, were a bid to scuttle those talks.

"It appears as if this was an attempt by Israel to scuttle Donald Trump's negotiations with Iran. Of course, our preferred pathway here to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is diplomacy," Murphy said.

U.S. officials have been warning Iran not to respond to what Israel has said will be a multi-strike operation.

﻿The tech right saw in Trump what they wanted to see, but it wasn't actually there

I live and work in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I don't know anyone who says they voted for Donald Trump in 2016 or 2020. I know, on the other hand, quite a few who voted for him in 2024, and quite a few more who — while they didn't vote for Trump because of his many crippling personal foibles, corruption, penchant for destroying the global economy, etc. — have thoroughly soured on the Democratic Party.

Explore the big, complicated problems the world faces and the most efficient ways to solve them. Sent twice a week.

It's not just my professional networks. While tech has generally been very liberal in its political support and giving, the last few years have seen the emergence of a real and influential tech right. 

Elon Musk, of course, is by far the most famous, but he didn't start the tech right by himself. And while his break with Trump — which Musk now seems to be backpedaling on — might have changed his role within the tech right, I don't think this shift will end with him. 

The Bay Area tech scene has always to my mind been best understood as left-libertarian — socially liberal, but suspicious of big government and excited about new things from cryptocurrency to charter cities to mosquito gene drives to genetically engineered superbabies to tooth bacteria. That array of attitudes sometimes puts them at odds with governments (and much of the public, which tends to be much less welcoming of new technology). 

The tech world valorizes founders and doers, and everyone knows two or three stories about a company that only succeeded because it was willing to break some city regulations. Lots of founders are immigrants; lots are LGBTQ+. For a long time, this set of commitments put tech firmly on the political left — and indeed tech employees overwhelmingly vote and donate to the Democratic Party. 

But over the last 10 years, I think three things changed. 

The first was what Vox at the time called the Great Awokening — a sweeping adoption of what had been a bunch of niche liberal social justice ideas, from widespread acceptance of trans people to suspicion of any sex or race disparity in hiring to #MeToo awareness of sexual harassment in the workplace. 

A lot of this shift at tech companies was employee driven; again, tech employees are mostly on the left. And some of it was good! But some of it was illiberal — rejecting the idea that we can and should work with people we profoundly disagree with — and identitarian, in that it focused more on what demographic categories we belong to than our commonalities. We're now in the middle of a backlash, which I think is all the more intense in tech because the original woke movement was all the more intense in tech. 

The second thing that changed was the macroeconomic environment. When I first joined a tech company in 2017, interest rates were low and VC funding was incredibly easy to get. Startups were everywhere, and companies were desperately competing to hire employees. As a result, employees had a lot of power; CEOs were often scared of them. 

Things started changing when interest rates rose and jobs dried up (relatively speaking). That profoundly changed the dynamics at companies, and I have a suspicion it made a lot of people resentful of immigration levels that they'd been fine with when they, too, were having no trouble getting hired. And in the last few years, the tech world has become convinced that AI is happening very, very soon, and is the biggest economic story of our lives. If you wanted to prevent AI regulation, Silicon Valley reasoned, you should vote Republican.

The third was a deliberate effort by many liberals to go after a tech scene they saw as their enemy. The Biden administration ended up staffed by a lot of people ideologically committed to Sen. Elizabeth Warren's view of the world, where big tech was the enemy of liberal democracy and the tools of antitrust should be used to break it up. Lina Khan's Federal Trade Commission acted on those convictions, going after big tech companies like Amazon. Whether you think this was the right call in economic terms — I mostly think it was not — it was decidedly self-destructive in political terms.

So in 2024, some of tech (still not a majority, but a smaller minority than in the past two Trump elections) went right. The tech world watched with bated breath as Musk announced DOGE: Would the administration bring about the deregulation, tax cuts, and anti-woke wish list they believed that only the administration could?

The answer so far has been no. (Many people on the tech right are still more optimistic than me, and point at a small handful of victories, but my assessment is that they're wearing rose-colored glasses to the point of outright blindness.) 

DOGE was a complete failure at cutting spending. The administration did not actually break from Khan's populist approach to the FTC. It blew up basic biosciences research, and is scaring off or outright deporting the best international talent, which is badly needed for AI in particular. 

It's killing nuclear energy (which is also important to AI boosters) and killing exciting next-gen vaccine research. Musk is out — so is his pick to run NASA. It's widely rumored that Stephen Miller is running things at the White House, and his one agenda appears to be turning all federal capacity toward deportations at the expense of every single other government priority. 

Some deregulation has happened, but any beneficial effects it would have had on investment have been more than canceled out by the tariffs' catastrophic effects on businesses' ability to plan for the future. They did at least get the tax cuts for the rich, if the “big, beautiful bill” passes, but that's about all they got — and the ultra-rich will be poorer this year anyway thanks to the unsteady stock market. 

The Republicans, when out of power, had a critique of the Democrats which spoke to the tech right, the populist right, the white supremacists and moderate Black and Latino voters alike. But it's much easier to complain about Democrats in a way that all of those disparate interest groups find compelling than to govern in a way that keeps them all happy. 

Once the Trump administration actually had to choose, it chose basically none of the tech right's priorities. They took a bad bet — and I think it'd behoove the Democrats to think, as Trump's coalition fractures, about which of those voters can be won back.

USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt was grilled by the DOGE subcommittee after Stephanie Turner was punished for refusing to face a trans competitor.

USA Fencing's board of directors voted to amend its current policy that prioritized states with LGBTQ-friendly laws for host sites for competitions and a policy that may have prevented the playing of the national anthem at some events. 

The decision comes after months of criticism for punishing a woman fencer who refused to fence a trans opponent, which included scrutiny from federal lawmakers at a congressional hearing in early May. 

The changes were voted into effect at a board of directors meeting on Saturday. 

An official announcement states that USA Fencing "adopted a streamlined policy that applies criteria prioritizing cost, safety and convenience to every national-event bid across all 50 states." The new policy "ensures host cities meet stringent member-safety and cost-efficiency standards."

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) holds up maps of the U.S. in front of an alleged screenshot from USA Fencing Board Director Damien Lehfeldt's Instagram during the hearing on "Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" held by the Department of Government Efficiency Subcommittee at the U.S. Capitol on May 7, 2025 in Washington, D.C. 

Meanwhile, the board's new national anthem policy will go into effect at the 2025 Summer Nationals and will be reviewed annually by the tournament committee.

"On recommendation of the tournament committee, the board adopted a uniform national anthem policy governing all USA Fencing national events," the announcement said, adding that the new policy will "provide consistent, respectful minimum guidance for honoring the flag and anthem across nine annual tournaments."

Back in December, the board held a vote to play the national anthem at the start of tournaments before "all NACs and National Championships," but it was voted against 8-2 with one abstention.

USA Fencing has provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the new anthem policy. 

"The anthem has always been played at the start of every national tournament. The Board simply wrote that long‑standing practice into policy and added that it will also be played on any U.S. holiday that occurs during an event, such as Independence Day, which falls during our upcoming Summer Nationals," the statement red. 

The previous host site policy, which was announced in November 2022, gave preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that "harm members of LGBTQ communities" and states that do not "have laws undermining the reproductive health of women." 

That policy went into effect in the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released a list of states that it intended to "avoid where possible" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events.

The states on the "do not allow" list were Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas. 

The states on its "avoid where possible" list included Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah, West Virginia, Wyoming, Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.

The organization now claims it will have events in several of those states over the next year. 

"We merged several overlapping documents into one policy that scores every bid — regardless of state — on cost, safety, and travel convenience. Using this rubric, next season's national events will span nine states including Texas, Missouri, Florida, Utah, Ohio, Virginia, Oregon, Tennessee and Nevada," read a statement to Fox News Digital.

The previous policy became one of the organization's biggest points of criticism after fencer Stephanie Turner ignited global backlash against the organization when she recorded a video of her kneeling in protest of a trans opponent during a competition in Maryland in late March. 

USA GYMNASTICS ASSESSING TRANSGENDER INCLUSION POLICY

The footage went viral amid news that Turner was disqualified from the event and dealt a black card for refusing to fence. 

The controversy was then the subject of a federal hearing on May 7. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Subcommittee's "Unfair Play: Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" saw Turner testify against USA Fencing chair Damien Lehfeldt. 

Lehfeldt took harsh criticism from Republican lawmakers for the organization's transgender inclusion and host site selection policies. 

DOGE Subcommittee Chairwoman Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., called out the organization for its host city policy. 

"In selecting sites for its national fencing events, for instance, the board policy is to avoid states whose laws and policies on LGBTQ rights and abortion it opposes. It uses ‘Equality Maps' to determine which states to blacklist from its competitions, and which to favor," Greene said. 

"This ends up favoring a lot of blue states and harming a lot of red ones. So, it creates politically-determined winners and losers — but it has absolutely nothing to do with fencing. And it contradicts USA Fencing's statutory duty as an NGB to 'develop interest and participation throughout the United States' in fencing." 

USA Fencing also announced that it is preparing to change its current policy that allows trans athletes to compete in the women's category back in April.

"In the event that USA Fencing is forced to change its current stance in accordance with oversight bodies or federal legislation, the new policy states athletes competing in USA Fencing-sanctioned tournaments must compete according to their biological sex," the announcement read. 

The proposed updated policy ensures that the women's category "will be open exclusively to athletes of the female sex." The men's category "will be open to all other athletes who are otherwise eligible for competition."

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Michael Madigan's stunning political collapse is expected to culminate Friday when the longest-serving legislative leader in U.S. history is sentenced on federal bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud convictions tied to a scheme to push legislation in exchange for jobs and contracts for his associates.

The former Illinois House speaker was convicted in February on 10 of 23 counts in a remarkable corruption trial that lasted four months. The case churned through 60 witnesses and mountains of documents, photographs and taped conversations. 

Madigan will appear in U.S. District Court Friday in Chicago, where Judge John Robert Blakey will determine his sentence. 

Federal prosecutors are seeking a 12 1/2-year prison term. Madigan's attorneys are seeking probation, contending the government's sentence would “condemn an 83-year-old man to die behind bars for crimes that enriched him not one penny.”

During a legislative career that spanned a half-century, Madigan served nearly four decades as speaker, the longest on record for a U.S. legislator. Combined with more than 20 years as chairperson of the Illinois Democratic Party, he set much of the state's political agenda while handpicking candidates for political office. More often than not, he also controlled political mapmaking, drawing lines to favor his party.

Meanwhile, prosecutors said, the Chicago Democrat built a private legal career that allowed him to amass a net worth of $40 million.




Madigan was convicted on 10 counts of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and other charges for ensuring approval of legislation favorable to utility giant ComEd in exchange for kickbacks and jobs and contracts for loyalists, including a Chicago alderman seeking a paid job on a state board after retiring from government. 

The jury deadlocked on six counts, including an overarching racketeering conspiracy charge, and acquitted him on seven others.

“Madigan's criminal activity spanned nearly a decade and was particularly egregious because it involved efforts to enrich himself — both by maintaining his political power by securing do-nothing jobs for his political allies and by attempting to line his own pockets with legal business,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing. “In so doing, Madigan served his own personal interests and not the interests of Illinoisans.”

Defense lawyers called the government's recommended sentence “draconian” and, given Madigan's age, a life sentence. They asked Blakey to consider the totality of Madigan's life and work and the need to care for his wife in requesting a sentence of five years' probation, with one year of home confinement, a requirement to perform community service and a “reasonable fine.”

In a video submitted to the court, Madigan's wife, Shirley, asks for a sentence of probation, explaining that Madigan is her caregiver and she would have to seek outside help if he is imprisoned. And, she says, “I'm a part of him.”

“There's some days I keep him going,” Shirley Madigan says on the video. “He keeps me going sometimes, too, but I think that the impact that I have on him has been much, much larger.”

The court received more than 200 letters of support for Madigan, many from constituents, friends, leaders of nonprofits and other organizations that interact with the state. Some noted asking him for help just once. Most lauded him for dedication, integrity or a personal touch. 

“Mike Madigan is a good man who has selflessly done an exceptional amount of good for others,” his lawyers wrote in a separate filing. “He is widely respected for his dedication to honesty and integrity.”

Tried alongside Madigan was his former legislative colleague and longtime confidant, Michael McClain. The jury couldn't reach a decision on any of the six counts against McClain. He was convicted, though, in a separate trial over the ComEd conspiracy last year.

            The Trump administration will soon ensure that its 50% steel tariffs, which have threatened to make everything containing steel more expensive, will apply to your next fridge or dishwasher.
    


            The Commerce Department, in a notice set to be published in the federal register Monday, said the recently increased steel tariffs would also apply to consumer appliances that contain steel. Those so-called derivative products will be taxed an additional 50% for the amount of steel they contain, starting on June 23.
    


            Those products will include refrigerators, dryers, washing machines, dishwashers, freezers, ovens, garbage disposals and wire racks.
    


            President Donald Trump's broader tariffs have increased costs for some American manufacturers. Many parts and components are subject to Trump's tariffs, because they have no American-made alternatives – or the alternatives are more expensive than foreign products. And American appliance makers have griped about how competitors can effectively skirt those same tariffs by shipping completed products that aren't subject to the 50% levies.
    


            That's why the administration announced its so-called inclusion process aimed at preventing foreign competitors from getting around those tariffs. In theory, tariffs on imported appliances will make American-made dryers, ovens and other appliances more competitive compared with foreign equivalents, which are often made with relatively inexpensive parts and cheaper labor.
    


            At a US Steel facility in Pennsylvania two weeks ago, Trump announced he would set tariffs on steel imported into the United States at 50%, double their previous rate. He said some companies were skirting the tariffs when they were set at 25%, but he doubted anyone would be able to avoid them after he doubled the rate.
    


            Trump praised his tariffs for saving the US steel industry, claiming American steelmaking would have disappeared if he hadn't acted to impose tariffs. He said all steel would have been foreign-made and factories would have closed.
    


            Although tariffs may have given the moribund American steel business a much-needed boost, they could raise prices on a key ingredient for American construction and manufacturing – two industries Trump has said he wants to support. Spot prices for domestically sourced steel have increased since the announcement of the 25% tariff in March, as American producers haven't had to worry about as much competition from foreign steel.
    


            When Trump imposed some steel tariffs in his first term, US production expanded modestly, but it sent costs rising for cars, tools and machines and, in 2021, shrank those industries' output by more than $3 billion, the International Trade Commission found in a 2023 analysis.
    


            Trump in his first term placed 20% to 50% tariffs on imported washing machines, a levy that American manufacturer Whirlpool initially praised. But the company lamented Trump's steel tariffs, bemoaning the hundreds of millions of dollars in higher costs to make its products. That ultimately hiked the price of an average washing machines by around $90 and created just 1,800 American jobs, total, according to the Federal Reserve and the University of Chicago.

Elon Musk's image has lost some of its luster with Republicans since the tech billionaire's messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds. 

Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog “very favorably” compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 




Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation — and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts — may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party. 

“Some things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,” said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to “somewhat favorable.” 

“I liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he's kind of hurting,” said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. “I also don't feel like he matters that much. He's not actually part of the government. He's just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.”

Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between “very” and “somewhat” strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.

Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans' feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump's 2024 election effort. 

After decrying the GOP's massive tax and budget policy bill as “a disgusting abomination,” Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, “In November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.” 

The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as “very favorable” has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April. 

Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.

Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla “somewhat unfavorable” because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company's owner with the president's agenda.

“I don't favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don't care too much for Tesla,” said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.

While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.

The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority. 

Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort. 

“Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” Musk wrote. “Such ingratitude.” 

Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they “went too far.”

Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world's leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers — notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors. 




Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a “very” or “somewhat” favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands. 

Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business. 

And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021. 

“My government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,” Mills said. “I do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.”

            A federal appeals court late Thursday paused a ruling that required President Donald Trump to return control of members of California's National Guard to the state.
    


            Senior US District Judge Charles Breyer had ruled that Trump unlawfully federalized thousands of members of California's National Guard and must return control of the troops to the state by mid-day Friday. But the order from the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals puts that on pause.
    


            Breyer's ruling, nevertheless, is a significant win for Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who sued Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth earlier this week after the president called the troops into federal service in the wake of protests in the Los Angeles area over Trump's hardline immigration policies.
    


            “His actions were illegal – both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith,” the judge wrote in his 36-page ruling.
    


            Breyer, of the federal district court in San Francisco, said Trump had not satisfied any of the requirements that must be met in order to call up members of a state's National Guard and that the president had not complied with a procedural aspect of federal law that requires presidents to issue an order “through the governor” when they want to federalize state troops.
    


            “Regardless of whether Defendants gave Governor Newsom an opportunity to consult with them or consent to the federalization of California's National Guard, they did not issue their orders through him, and thus failed to comply with” federal law, he wrote.
    


            The panel of three judges from the 9th Circuit – two Trump appointees and an appointee of former President Joe Biden – said it will hold a hearing Tuesday on the issue.
    


            Trump on Friday morning thanked the federal appeals court.
    


            “If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now. We saved L.A. Thank you for the Decision!!!” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.



            In federalizing the guardsmen, Trump pointed to a provision of federal law that says he can call up a state's troops to suppress a “rebellion.” But Breyer said in his ruling that “the protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion.'”
    


            “Violence is necessary for a rebellion, but it is not sufficient,” Breyer wrote. “Even accepting the questionable premise that people armed with fireworks, rocks, mangoes, concrete, chairs, or bottles of liquid are ‘armed' in a 1903 sense – the Court is aware of no evidence in the record of actual firearms – there is little evidence of whether the violent protesters' actions were ‘open or avowed.'”
    


            The judge added: “Nor is there evidence that any of the violent protesters were attempting to overthrow the government as a whole; the evidence is overwhelming that protesters gathered to protest a single issue – the immigration raids.”
    


            And he was extremely critical of arguments pushed by DOJ that the protests in and around Los Angeles against Trump's immigration policies constituted a rebellion.
    


            “(T)he Court is troubled by the implication inherent in Defendants' argument that protest against the federal government, a core civil liberty protected by the First Amendment, can justify a finding of rebellion,” he wrote.

            “In short, individuals' right to protest the government is one of the fundamental rights protected by the First Amendment, and just because some stray bad actors go too far does not wipe out that right for everyone,” Breyer said. “The idea that protesters can so quickly cross the line between protected conduct and ‘rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States' is untenable and dangerous.”
    


            The judge also said Trump had violated California's rights under the 10th Amendment, writing that “it is not the federal government's place in our constitutional system to take over a state's police power whenever it is dissatisfied with how vigorously or quickly the state is enforcing its own laws.”
    


            “The federalization of 4,000 members of California's National Guard necessarily prevents Governor Newsom, as the commander-in-chief of his state's National Guard, from deploying them as needed,” Breyer wrote.
    


            Breyer also suggested that having too much firepower on the ground may be making things worse.
    


            “Federal agents and property may actually well be served by de-militarization and a concurring de-escalation of the situation,” the judge wrote.
    


            “Regardless, Plaintiffs and the citizens of Los Angeles face a greater harm from the continued unlawful militarization of their city, which not only inflames tensions with protesters, threatening increased hostilities and loss of life, but deprives the state for two months of its own use of thousands of National Guard members to fight fires, combat the fentanyl trade, and perform other critical functions,” he added.
    


            Attorneys from DOJ had argued during a hearing earlier Thursday that Trump's actions were lawful, pushing back on claims by the state that the president had violated federal law because he didn't involve Newsom in the process of federalizing the troops.
    


            Importantly, Breyer on Thursday did temporarily bar Trump from using Marines for law enforcement activities in California, as the state had requested. He noted that there was dispute between each side over whether both the federalized guardsmen and several hundred Marines deployed to LA would be engaged in such activities.
    


            “The Court does not at this point reach any conclusion on this issue,” he wrote.

            As a military parade rolls through Washington, DC, on Saturday – President Donald Trump's birthday – millions of Americans are expected to protest in what organizers predict will be the strongest display of opposition to Trump's administration since he took office in January.
    


            More than 1,900 protests across all 50 states are planned through the No Kings movement, which organizers say seeks to reject “authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
    


            The mobilization is a direct response to Trump's military parade in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the US Army – which coincides with his 79th birthday.
    


            In recent days, all eyes have been on Los Angeles, where Trump has deployed the National Guard and Marines, in response to massive protests decrying immigration sweeps – an extraordinary move that protest organizers say has only served to mobilize participants to speak out against authoritarianism.
    


            Demonstrators have since been protesting controversial raids and deportations in cities across the nation, including New York, Seattle, Chicago, Austin, Las Vegas and Washington, DC, while the administration has doubled down on its display of military force against its own citizens.
    


America's migrant workers are terrified to work but unable to stay home



            Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has suggested that the order used to federalize the National Guard to Los Angeles could make way for a similar response to protests in other states. And Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed the state's National Guard this week ahead of planned protests, including a No Kings event in San Antonio on Saturday.
    


            In Missouri, Gov. Mike Kehoe activated his state's National Guard on Thursday “as a precautionary measure in reaction to recent instances of civil unrest across the country.”
    


            “We respect, and will defend, the right to peacefully protest, but we will not tolerate violence or lawlessness in our state,” the Republican governor said in a statement.
    


            Following the Hands Off! and 50501 protests this spring, Saturday's demonstrations won't be the first nationwide rejection of Trump's policies. But organizers expect them to be the largest.
    


            “Even conservative estimates say that 3.5 million people turned out for the Hands Off mobilization in April. That's already 1% of the population of the US,” Ezra Levin, co-executive director of Indivisible, the organization backing the No Kings movement, told CNN in a statement. “No Kings is on track to exceed that by millions more. This is historic.”
    


            Officials have estimated Saturday's parade, which will flaunt 7 million pounds of machines and weaponry through the nation's capital on the president's birthday, could cost up to $45 million. Protest organizers are keeping the planned rallies out of Washington, DC, hoping to pull focus away from the spectacle.
    


            Instead, a flagship rally will be held in Philadelphia – with 60,000 to 80,000 protesters expected to attend Saturday, CNN affiliate KYW said. The Philadelphia Police Department said it is ready for crowds at LOVE Park, the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and Arch Street.
    


            Across the country, No Kings events will take place in all 50 states – including some with dozens of local events planned. More than 200 protest events are expected in California. And organizers expect especially big turnouts in Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, Charlotte and Chicago, according to the No Kings website.
    


How Trump got the military parade he's always wanted



            Other groups are planning additional protests across the US, meaning the turnout against the Trump administration could be even larger than projected.
    


            On Wednesday evening, No Kings organizers spoke to more than 4,000 people on a Zoom call – many of them local hosts for Saturday's protests – preparing them for the intense weekend ahead.
    


            “If you show up on site, and you feel completely overwhelmed by the numbers – first of all, congratulations,” one organizer said.
    


            The leaders gave advice for the hosts and those serving as “marshals” – people designated to help address safety concerns and keep the peace on Saturday.
    


            Attendees emphasized safety and non-violence while role-playing scenarios with hypothetical characters – for example, a participant frustrated that not enough action is being taken to get the group's message out and a right-wing protestor there to harass attendees.
    


            Among their tips for Saturday: deescalate, empathize, listen, never touch a police officer.
    


            With political tensions rising after controversial ICE raids and the deployment of National Guard members to demonstration sites, many cities are already seeing protest activity ahead of Saturday.
    


ICE scrambles to meet Trump's immigration arrest quotas



            Meanwhile, local and state authorities have been doing their own prep work  – with officials warning violence by protesters this weekend will not be tolerated.
    


            South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who characterized the expected protesters as “radical anti-American groups,” warned that those who attack law enforcement or destroy property will be prosecuted.
    


            In Florida, Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey said peaceful protests are part of democracy, and people are invited to express their opinions. But he said anyone who breaks the law will face consequences.
    


            “If you throw a brick, a firebomb, or point a gun at one of our deputies, we will be notifying your family where to collect your remains because we will kill you,” Ivey said, according to CNN affiliate WESH.

            And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said drivers who are threatened won't be held responsible if they hit protesters, CNN affiliate WJXT reported.
    


            “If you're driving on one of those streets and a mob comes and surrounds your vehicle and threatens you, you have a right to flee for your safety,” DeSantis told podcaster Dave Rubin, according to WJXT. “So, if you drive off and you hit one of these people, that's their fault for impinging on you.”
    


            In Chicago, Democratic Mayor Brandon Johnson has said his city will protect people's right to assemble while ensuring residents' day-to-day lives aren't disrupted.
    


            In New York City, “The right to protest peacefully is central to our democracy, and the NYPD is committed to ensuring that people can always exercise that right safely,” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch posted on X this week as demonstrators in the city protested the Trump administration's immigration actions.
    


            Protest organizers say they have been in touch with local officials ahead of Saturday's events, in an effort to make sure the gatherings run safely and smoothly. The aim, they emphasize, is not violence, but rather to send a clear message to the president on his birthday: “In America, we don't do kings.”

Iran responded to Israel's airstrike by launching over 100 drones toward Israel on Friday morning.

The drone deployment came as retaliation for Israel's Operation Rising Lion, which targeted Iran's nuclear program in a military airstrike on Thursday. The preemptive attack centered on “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”

The airstrike was devastating for Iran, which suffered significant casualties among its country's leadership. Several prominent military heads were killed in the strike, including Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and Gholam Ali Rashid, a senior Guard commander. Iranian nuclear scientists Fereydoon Abbasi, head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, a theoretical physicist, were also killed in the attack. 

Iranian state media also reportedly claimed that children were killed in “at least one of the airstrikes.”

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, confirmed the deaths and warned that Israel would endure “severe punishment” as a result of the attack in a series of posts on X. 

“Zionist regime has committed a crime in our dear country today at dawn with its satanic, bloodstained hands,” Khamenei said. “It has revealed its malicious nature even more than before by targeting residential areas.”

“That [Zionist] regime should anticipate a severe punishment. By God's grace, the powerful arm of the Islamic Republic's Armed Forces won't let them go unpunished,” he added. “With this crime, the Zionist regime has prepared for itself a bitter, painful fate, which it will definitely see.”

Israel Defense Forces confirmed the launch of Iran's drones on Friday. It announced it had already begun to intercept some of them and shoot them down. Drones fired from Iran must travel a great distance and take several hours to get to Israel, according to multiple reports.

“The IDF has begun intercepting UAVs fired from Iran, outside of Israeli territory,” an IDF official told CNN.

IDF Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said all of Israel's “defense systems are working to intercept the threats.”

Multiple countries reported intercepting Iranian drones overnight, including Jordanian, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, and U.S. Air Forces.

Follow:


            America seems headed to an angry and ugly place.
    


            Inflammatory incidents, rhetoric and dissent unleashed by President Donald Trump's tough immigration crackdown are inexorably building political pressure as a polarized nation barrels into the heat of summer.
    


            Stunning scenes in Los Angeles on Thursday, when Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was manhandled out of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's news conference and handcuffed, epitomized a dark turn taken this week in California.
    


            But there's no sign yet of a path back from the brink before cascading confrontations and protests turn violent or even tragic.
    


            If anything, the crisis is deepening.
    


            The administration, led by a president determined to use every instrument of power — including a tamed Justice Department and the military — to enforce his will, is vowing to go harder, stronger and faster to target undocumented migrants. Even those here legally are not immune. The White House on Thursday told half a million Venezuelans, Haitians, Cubans and Nicaraguans here on humanitarian parole they must return to their unstable, poverty-stricken home countries.
    


            Trump's extremism is now stirring a counter-reaction ahead of a weekend that will see hundreds of “No Kings” demonstrations in cities and towns, and after he warned against protests at a US Army 250th anniversary parade Saturday that will bolster his dictator's schtick on his 79th birthday. A president who pledged to use the military on “the enemy from within” said this week he wants troops “everywhere.”
    


            The political battle is also finally being joined by Democrats, stung into finding a voice and cause after their so far desultory efforts to rebuild after their 2024 election fiasco.
    


            California was already on edge after Trump defied Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom and ordered National Guard troops to the city amid protests and then added a contingent of active-duty US Marines. But the television pictures of government security agents restraining Padilla and pushing him to the ground on Thursday afternoon created an instantly iconic snapshot of the national moment.
    


            Some caveats should be noted.  Any time a Cabinet official is in public, especially amid heightened political feeling, there is a concern for their safety. The horrific scenes after Trump survived his first assassination attempt last year remain a fresh national trauma. In the light of such experience, security details often act first and without waiting to establish the full context of a situation. It's perfectly possible Noem's agents didn't immediately recognize Padilla, even though he's one of the state's senators.
    


            “I was there peacefully,” Padilla said later amid fierce dispute over his conduct. “At one point I had a question, and so I began to ask a question. I was almost immediately forcibly removed from the room. I was forced to the ground, and I was handcuffed. I was not arrested. I was not detained.”
    


            Initially, Noem seemed to realize the incident could become a political liability. She explained that the Secret Service had feared Padilla could be an attacker, so they pushed him away. She said his behavior was “not appropriate” but said they'd spoken afterward in what sounded like a civil conversation, even swapping phone numbers.
    


            But the Trump White House never admits fault and always seeks political vengeance. Noem toughened here message when she headed onto Fox News. “This man burst into a room, started advancing towards the podium … he … continued to lunge towards the podium,” she said.
    


            The Homeland Security secretary's comments were quickly backed up by House Speaker Mike Johnson as the GOP launched a full court-press. “When they storm cabinet secretaries in a press conference, I think it's wildly inappropriate behavior, and I think it sends a terrible message in tone for the rest of the country,” said a speaker who helped Trump expunge the record of the January 6, 2021, assault by MAGA supporters on the US Capitol.
    


            White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who has this week accused Democrats of supporting criminals and rioters and demonized undocumented migrants as pedophiles, wrote on X that Padilla should be “ashamed of his childish behavior.”
    


            In a less fraught time, Padilla might have acted with more discretion and the White House would have worked to mitigate the incident's impact on America's fragile psyche. But this is 2025, five months into Trump's second term.
    


            Whatever precipitated the incident in Los Angeles, Padilla's treatment — after he identified himself, when he was shoved out of the room as he tried to ask a question and then shoved face-first to the ground and handcuffed — was unheard-of.
    


            The racial overtones of California's first Latino senator being put under such duress will become a metaphor for Trump's ruthless deportation policy.
    


            “They use words like ‘lunge' and ‘charge.' He is not an animal; he's a US senator,” California's Attorney General Rob Bonta told CNN's Kasie Hunt.
    


            In Washington, Democratic senators rushed to the chamber to exploit the moment. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz warned that his colleague's removal from Noem's briefing was “the stuff of dictatorships.”
    


            Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, who has condemned Trump's use of the military in California, warned in a statement: “This is America.  Dissent should not be met with violence.”
    


            Across the Capitol, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Padilla suffered an “assault.” She added, “It's a federal offense to attack a member of Congress. … It shouldn't be anybody in our country to be treated this way.”
    


            Padilla was the latest official to face harsh action for perceived dissent. Trump administration prosecutors have already indicted a Wisconsin judge and a New Jersey Democratic congresswoman in cases arising from the immigration blitz. But the fact his roughing-up was on camera means it could be a powerful political launching pad for Democrats as they step up resistance to the president.
    


            In the initial reaction to Padilla's manhandling, there was just a hint that Democratic senators — part of an always self-reverential body — were most offended that the collective dignity of their august chamber had been affronted.
    


            But the quick and unified effort to frame the incident as an example of an encroaching Trump dictatorship suggests that the party might have found an opening at last.
    


            In some ways, the spectacle was not that different from the kind of on-camera stunt with viral social media potential that Trump has made a signature and that now dominates the populist Republican Party. A televised speech by Newsom this week finally satisfied the cravings of some Democrats for someone, anyone to take the fight to the president. His Senate colleague will never now be forgotten by Democrats after he introduced himself to the rest of the nation with the Thursday afternoon debacle that lit up cable news.
    


            But making a splash is only one of the Democrats' problems.
    


            Padilla's show of force does not necessarily point a way out of the conundrum Trump has set for them, namely that their public condemnations of his deportation plan allow the White House to portray them as soft on securing the border. Perhaps more evidence of administration thuggery could hurt Trump — and convince voters he is overreaching and inhumane. But the White House is still sure it's got the winning political hand on immigration.
    


            Democrats are also no nearer to producing a coherent policy and electoral position that addresses the public's desire to stem illegal immigration while reconciling liberal constituencies within their own political base. The Biden administration's obliviousness to a long-building crisis and public sentiment has given Trump plenty of political cover.
    


            But Thursday's drama poses an even more profound question: Do most Americans — notwithstanding their stark ideological divides — really want to live in a country plagued by ever-worsening conflict and disharmony?
    


            If not, Trump could be vulnerable and his iron-fist approach to immigration could end up serving as a microcosm of a destructive presidency.
    


            For sure, Trump's base responds to his outlandish rhetoric and strongman vibe. But no one would describe the White House's approach as a modulated effort to solve an immigration issue that has been haunting the nation for years. The crisis has confounded every president since at least Ronald Reagan. But while some commanders in chief have tried to solve it, Trump has been deliberately escalating the confrontation at every opportunity, seemingly to incite maximum discord and political stress.
    


            The president and his team argue with some justification that voters chose Trump last November because they were despairing over Biden's negligence at the border. The White House insists that protests cannot be allowed to stop deportations that are needed to keep Americans safe and to deter new waves of migrants that could strain the country's resources, unity and character.
    


            But they are also using the language of tyrants and demagogues as they seek to use the deportations to grab more and more power, to repress their political adversaries and even to threaten the choices of Democratic voters.
    


            During the news conference that was interrupted by Padilla, Noem warned that the federal government was not “going away” from Los Angeles. “We are staying here to liberate this city from the socialist and burdensome leadership that this Governor Newsom and this mayor placed on this country and what they have tried to insert into this city.”
    


            Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass are the democratically elected representatives chosen by Californians and the citizens of Los Angeles. Noem's comments only reinforced an impression that Trump and his team view Democratic leaders as illegitimate and blue states as enemies within the US.
    


            Trump's top domestic policy adviser Stephen Miller has spent the week portraying his boss's political opponents as supporting invasions and rebellions by forces outside the United States. “America voted for mass deportations,” Miller wrote in one X post this week. “Violent insurrectionists, and the politicians who enable them, are trying to overthrow the results of the election.”
    


            The country needs no reminder that incitement and extreme political language can provoke violence and threaten the rule of law and the foundational democratic principles of the republic. It happened at the end of Trump's first term.
    


            Historically, presidents have felt a moral imperative to cool political agitation when it threatens to splinter the nation and to heal such estrangements before they provoke strife and threaten life.
    


            Trump's entire political method seems designed to do the opposite.

Three blue state governors were on defense for hours on Thursday during a marathon House Oversight Committee hearing where Republicans accused them of reckless immigration policies in their states.

Govs. Tim Walz (D-MN), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Kathy Hochul (D-NY) testified at the high-profile hearing that ran from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. with a few breaks. There were many fireworks as Republicans grilled their home state governors and even some fireworks between members themselves.

Afterward, Pritzker, who is considered a possible 2028 presidential contender, dismissed the hearing as a waste of time because lawmakers weren't really interested in solutions such as immigration reform.

“This hearing was a demonstration of just how bad this Republican-controlled Congress really is,” Pritzker said. “Again, nothing accomplished. An entire day of just harping on something that, frankly, most of which was false. … I think this entire Republican-controlled Congress is a waste.”

Here are the top takeaways from the hearing. 

Many members, who are eyeing higher offices such as a Senate or gubernatorial run, questioned the witnesses with Republicans laying into the governors and Democrats condemning the Trump administration and the hearing as “unserious.”

Reps. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and Mike Lawler (R-NY) grilled Hochul as both House Republicans eye a run for governor in the state where they would seek to unseat Hochul.

“We deserve a governor who stands up for law-abiding New Yorkers,” Stefanik said before an increasingly frustrated Hochul, who repeatedly attempted to condemn the crimes by illegal immigrants.

“These crimes are horrific, I condemn them,” Hochul stated.

“Because of your sanctuary state policies,” Stefanik quipped back. 

Lawler told Hochul after a heated exchange, “New York is better off with you down here and not in the state.” 

“I don't think it's better off with you here,” she responded.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), a top contender for the open Illinois Senate seat, attacked President Donald Trump, saying, “he may not like state law, as we are seeing in California.” 

This hearing comes as protests continue to sweep Los Angeles following Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids that happened last week.

Trump has called up the National Guard and activated U.S. Marines to deal with the protests in California, against Gov. Gavin Newsom's (D-CA) wishes. Protests against Trump's mass deportation operation carried out by ICE have turned violent at times.

The governors defended Newsom's position that Trump sending in the National Guard to control anti-ICE demonstrations in Los Angeles undermined local law enforcement. Trump also expressed support for Newsom's arrest earlier this week after the governor dared the border czar Tom Homan to arrest him following the National Guard coming in.

The governors said Trump's border czar can “try” to come and arrest them, too.

“If Tom Homan comes to Albany to arrest me, I'll say go for it,” Hochul said.

“I have the highest duty to protect the people of my state, and indeed, if Tom Homan were to come to try to arrest us, me, rather, I can say first of all that he can try,” Pritzker added.

During the hearing, Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) was shoved out of a Department of Homeland Security press conference in California after he interrupted Secretary Kristi Noem and approached her podium with questions. Security officials, possibly not knowing he was a senator, treated his approach and physical resistance as a threat to the secretary and acted to remove and restrain him. 

Members added the headlines of stories about Padilla into the hearing's official record.

Rep. Yassamin Ansari (D-AZ) showed a printout photo of the post on X showing the senator being shoved out and reading the news that he was “forcefully removed from the news conference being held by DHS Kristi Noem.”

Rep. Delia Ramirez (D-IL) showed the video of Padilla, where Comer then argued that they should show the portion where he approached Noem.

House Oversight acting ranking member Stephen Lynch (D-MA) asked for an investigation into the incident to take place in House Oversight.

Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said, “Mr. Chairman, for the record, he rushed the podium. He was being disruptive.”

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) told reporters that “sitting members of Congress” were “lying about what happened” with Padilla.

Rep. Maxwell Frost (D-FL) got into a screaming match involving House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-KY) and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) when he asked for a point of order to subpoena Noem. Comer told Frost to “shut up,” and Greene then accused Frost of being a “former antifa member.”

“He has been out of order six times, he's trying to get on MSNBC,” Comer said of Frost.

While the hearing was largely focused on immigration, Comer grilled Walz on his vice presidential run with former Vice President Kamala Harris, asking what he knew about former President Joe Biden's cognitive decline. 

“Did you ever ask Vice President Harris about former President Biden's … cognitive decline?” Comer asked.

“No, not that I can recall,” Walz said.

Comer pressed Walz on why he wouldn't have asked Harris about Biden's health after the disastrous debate performance against Trump that ultimately led to Biden dropping out of the race.

“I was probably more concerned with my own debate performance than President Biden's, so no,” Walz insisted.

The House Oversight Committee is investigating Biden's health decline and whether his White House aides not only shielded him from the public but also used an autopen to carry out official business without his knowledge. Autopen usage is not uncommon in modern White Houses, and Biden has insisted he was the ultimate decision maker on executive actions and pardons.

Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) also grilled Walz on the mental decline of Biden while in office and whether Harris talked to him about it. “Not that I can recall,” he said.

BIDEN AIDES LINED UP TO APPEAR BEFORE HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE IN AUTOPEN INVESTIGATION 

Rep. Brandon Gill (R-TX) questioned Pritzker on an X post made by the governor back in 2017, calling on people to protest against Trump by using the other gender's bathroom. 

As a protest against Trump's rescinding protections for trans kids, everyone should use the other gender's bathroom today! #protecttranskids

“Have you ever considered that women don't want you in their bathrooms?” Gill asked.

Walz was on defense throughout the hearing for previously calling ICE agents “Donald Trump's modern-day Gestapo” during a commencement speech at the University of Minnesota Law School, claiming agents were “scooping folks up off the streets” who were being “disappeared.”

Asked to apologize or recant for comparing U.S law enforcement to Nazi's treatment of Jews, Walz refused. But he got an ally in Lynch, the top Democrat at the hearing, who condemned how ICE agents were abducting “peaceful” illegal immigrants from their communities.

“When you compare the old films of the Gestapo grabbing people off the streets of Poland, and you compare them to those nondescript thugs … it does look like a Gestapo operation,” Lynch said.

Israel unilaterally conducted a significant military operation targeting Iran's nuclear program on Thursday, hours after President Donald Trump cautioned Israel against one in favor of continuing their diplomatic efforts.Details of the damage Israel inflicted are still being assessed, though an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson called it a “preemptive, precise, combined offensive” and warned Israeli civilians to be prepared for a retaliatory attack.

“Following the State of Israel's preemptive strike against Iran, a missile and drone attack against the state of Israel and its civilian population is expected in the immediate future,” Israel Katz, the defense minister, said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised address, “Moments ago, Israel launched operation Rising Lion, a targeted military operation to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel's very survival,” adding, “This operation will continue for as many days as it takes to remove this threat.”

Dozens of Israeli fighter jets were involved in what the spokesperson described as “the first stage” of the operation targeting “dozens of military targets, including nuclear targets in different areas of Iran.”

Iranian state media reported that Gen. Hossein Salami, the chief commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, senior IRGC commander Gholamali Rashid, and nuclear scientists Fereydoun Abbasi and Mohammad-Mehdi Tehranchi were killed in the strikes.

The United States was not involved in the attack, though Israel warned them ahead of time, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. He also told Tehran not to attack U.S. troops or bases in the Middle East.

Fearing a possible retaliatory attack, on Wednesday, the State Department evacuated personnel from Iraq, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth approved the evacuation of military families from undisclosed bases across the region.

On Thursday, before the Israeli strike, Trump warned that an Israeli military operation could happen but held out optimism that the U.S. and Iran could come to a diplomatic solution to capping Iran's nuclear program.

“We remain committed to a Diplomatic Resolution to the Iran Nuclear Issue! My entire Administration has been directed to negotiate with Iran. They could be a Great Country, but they first must completely give up hopes of obtaining a Nuclear Weapon,” he posted on Truth Social.

Republican reactions to the attacks were supportive of the strikes. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) wrote minutes after the strikes, “Game on. Pray for Israel,” while Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said, “Israel is acting to defend themselves … and we should stand unequivocally with the state of Israel.”

Democratic reactions were less enthusiastic, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) saying in a television appearance, “This is deeply disturbing. This has the possibility of spinning entirely out of control,” adding, “We need the administration to negotiate.”

Trump didn't want a strike to compromise a deal. “As long as I think there is agreement, I don't want them going in because I think that would blow it,” Trump said during an event at the White House. “It might help it, actually, but it also could blow it.”

The U.S. and Iran were set to meet this weekend for the sixth iteration of their nuclear negotiations.

Israeli leaders have long sought an opportunity to take out Iran's nuclear program, and viewed it as an existential threat. This was what they viewed as their opportunity to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.

The IDF spokesperson said, “Today, Iran is closer than ever to obtaining a nuclear weapon,” and that “weapons of mass destruction in the hands of the Iranian regime are an existential threat to the State of Israel and a significant threat to the wider world.”

Hegseth told lawmakers on Wednesday that there “are plenty of indications that they have been moving their way towards something that would look a lot like a nuclear weapon.”

Earlier on Thursday, the Iran's foreign ministry said it would launch a “new uranium enrichment facility in a secure location” and install advanced centrifuges at another enrichment center in response to the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors vote in favor of a resolution declaring Tehran was not in compliance with its nonproliferation requirements.

The Iranians have rapidly increased the amount of enriched uranium in their possession, according to a recent report from the IAEA. As of May 17, Iran had amassed about 900 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of almost 50% from their last report issued in February. Getting the uranium from 60% enrichment to 90% enrichment, which the IAEA uses as the benchmark for weapons-grade uranium, would only require “mere steps,” according to Gen. Michael Kurilla, the head of U.S. Central Command.

It only takes about 55 pounds of 90% enriched uranium to construct a simple nuclear weapon.

“Should the Regime decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it is estimated that current stockpiles and the available centrifuges across several enrichment plants are sufficient to produce its first 25kg of weapons grade material in roughly one week and enough for up to ten nuclear weapons in three weeks,” Kurilla said in his written testimony to Congress this week.

Israel and Iran are enemies, though they have rarely engaged in direct military operations against one another, instead mostly pursuing covert espionage operations. However, that changed in the aftermath of Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack that prompted the current instability in the region.

Israel has fought many of Iran's proxies in the region since then, destroying much of Hamas and Hezbollah in Gaza and Lebanon, respectively. The Israelis have also fought against the Houthis in Yemen in a tit-for-tat aerial campaign.

US WARNS ALLIES NOT TO ATTEND TWO-STATE SOLUTION CONFERENCE

Amid the wider conflict, there were two instances in which Iran retaliated directly at Israel, once in April and again in October 2024. Tehran fired dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles at Israel in both cases, the vast majority of which were intercepted. Israel had the help of the U.S. and other allies.

Israel has a multilayered air defense system in place that protects it from a wide range of missiles, but an Iranian response that mirrors the size and scope of the last two attacks poses significant risks for Israel.

For the better part of a decade, Amazon has been trying to carve it's way into the U.S. health-care market, through billions of dollars worth of acquisitions, big-name hires and high-profile partnerships. It's been a slog at times, and the company's long-term strategy hasn't always been clear.

Following a series of executive departures, Amazon is now restructuring its health business, telling CNBC that Amazon Health Services will be divided into six new units, with a goal of creating a simpler structure.

As part of the effort, the company has tapped a number of longtime Amazon leaders and elevated some One Medical executives to oversee the divisions. Neil Lindsay, senior vice president of Amazon Health Services told CNBC in an interview that the company has been working on the overhaul for the past several months. 

"Our leadership team has been focused on simplifying our structure to move faster and continue to innovate effectively," Lindsay said in a video chat. "One of the problems we're trying to solve is the fragmented experience for patients and customers that's common in healthcare." 

Amazon said it hasn't conducted broad layoffs as part of the changes.

The reorganization comes after Amazon lost several senior health leaders in recent months. Dr. Vin Gupta, who joined in 2020 and served as chief medical officer of Amazon Pharmacy, left in February, followed by Trent Green, whose last day as CEO of Amazon's primary care chain One Medical was in April.

Aaron Martin, vice president of health care at Amazon, announced internally last month that he plans to leave his role. Dr. Sunita Mishra, Amazon's chief medical officer, also departed in May. 

Mishra and Martin's departures have not been previously reported, and neither responded to requests for comment. Amazon doesn't plan on naming a new CEO of One Medical following Green's departure.

Martin, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, said in a memo to staffers that he'll remain at Amazon "for a while" to help with the transition.

"I then plan to take some time off this summer and hang out with my wife and my kids, finally get a cover band going in Nashville, and then possibly do something new," Martin wrote in the memo, which was shared with CNBC.

Amazon has for years been on a mission to crack the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care industry, which is notoriously complex and inefficient.

While it had long served providers and others in health care with its cloud-based technology, Amazon's first big splash directly into the market came in 2018 with the the acquisition of online pharmacy PillPack for about $750 million. Two years later, it launched its own offering called Amazon Pharmacy.

The company then bought One Medical for $3.9 billion in 2023, among its largest acquisitions ever, giving Amazon access to a chain of brick-and-mortar primary care clinics and a robust membership base.

There have been some major setbacks. The company shuttered its telehealth service, Amazon Care, in 2022. That came a year after it disbanded Haven, the joint health-care venture between Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase. The announcement of Haven in 2018 sent shockwaves through the medical world, pushing down shares of health-care companies on fears about how the combined muscle of leaders in technology and finance could wring costs out of the system.

In the areas where Amazon continues to operate, competition is fierce and, in the case of primary care, margins are very slim.

PillPack founders TJ Parker and Elliot Cohen, who left Amazon in 2022, recently launched a new health-care marketplace called General Medicine that will compete with Amazon. Mishra confirmed to STAT News that she advised the nascent startup. Amazon declined to comment on whether Mishra's involvement with General Medicine was related to her departure. 

Lindsay characterized the recent departures as part of the natural evolution of Amazon's health business. He added that there's "no shortage of depth of talent" within his organization.

"We're a fast-evolving organization because the opportunity is so big," Lindsay said.

Under its new structure, Amazon Health Services will be focused around the six groups, or what the company calls "pillars." 

Amazon declined to share financial figures for its health business, but Lindsay said it is seeing "very strong growth" across the offerings.

One Medical went public in 2020, and it was still losing money when it was bought by Amazon. At the end of 2022 in its last quarter as a standalone entity, it reported a net loss of $101.1 million on revenue of $272.4 million.

Since joining Amazon, One Medical has been working to open new offices in states including New Jersey, New York and Ohio. 

Amazon said in January of 2024 that its pharmacy business "doubled the number of customers" it served in the past year, though it didn't share specific figures. The company is opening pharmacies in 20 new cities this year, and about 45% of U.S. customers will be eligible for same-day medication delivery.

"If we can make one thing a little bit easier for a lot of people, we'll save them a lot of time, a lot of money, and some lives," Lindsay said. "And if we stack these changes up over time, it'll feel like a reinvention."

Middle East Crisis:

The Natanz nuclear facility in Iran in January.

The United Nations atomic watchdog said there's no indication of increased radiation levels at Iran's main uranium-enrichment site, an early sign that Israel's strikes haven't penetrated the containment layers protecting the Islamic Republic's nuclear stockpile.

Iranian authorities told the International Atomic Energy Agency they haven't observed higher radiation doses at the Natanz facility, located about 300 kilometers (186 miles) south of Tehran. No radiological or chemical contamination has spread beyond the site, according to an IAEA statement.

India-Canada Relations:

The governments of Canada and India are set to establish a new structure to share information about cross-border crimes, their latest step toward rebuilding ties nearly two years after Canadian officials accused India of orchestrating the murder of a Sikh activist near Vancouver. 

The new information-sharing arrangement, which includes law enforcement agencies from both countries, will allow them to swap intelligence on transnational crime and syndicates, terrorism and extremist activities, according to officials who asked not to be identified because the discussions are still private. For Canada, this also includes an emphasis on investigating extra-judicial killings.

Middle East Crisis:

Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK has “grave concerns” about Iran's nuclear program and backed Israel's right to self-defense, while calling for de-escalation in a conflict that risks engulfing the Middle East.

Starmer was speaking after Israel carried out a wave of strikes on Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and killing top military commanders. The attacks raised fears of a wider war in the region and caused a spike in the price of oil — though it later pared those gains.

President Donald Trump on Friday lost his latest effort to overturn a civil jury verdict holding him liable for sexually abusing writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and then defaming her when she went public with her claims decades later.

A majority of judges on the 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in New York rejected Trump's request for that court's full bench to rehear his challenge to the verdict. It is one of two defamation-related verdicts that Carroll obtained against the president.

The denial came six months after a three-judge panel on 2nd Circuit upheld a 2023 Manhattan federal jury's verdict, which ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages.

Two judges on the 2nd Circuit — both of whom were nominated by Trump to that bench —  dissented from Friday's decision not to grant him a so-called en banc rehearing of his appeal.

Trump could ask the Supreme Court to hear his appeal, but that court is not obligated to do so.

A spokesman for Trump's legal team suggested the president would take that step, saying that the "Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax" will "continue to be appealed."

"President Trump will keep winning against Liberal Lawfare, as he is focusing on his mission to Make America Great Again," the spokesman said in a statement.

Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, said, "E. Jean Carroll is very pleased with today's decision."

"Although President Trump continues to try every possible maneuver to challenge the findings of two separate juries, those efforts have failed. He remains liable for sexual assault and defamation," Kaplan said.

Both this lawsuit and the other suit filed by Carroll relate to her claim that Trump defamed her in statements denying her 2019 allegation that he sexually assaulted her in a dressing room in the Bergdorf Goodman department store in Manhattan in the 1990s.

Carroll's first suit in Manhattan federal court, which related to comments that Trump made about her in 2019, ended with a January 2024 verdict in her favor. Jurors in that case awarded her $83.3 million in damages from Trump for defaming her.

A panel of 2nd Circuit judges is scheduled to hear oral arguments on June 24 in Trump's appeal of the verdict in that case.

On Wednesday, the appeals court denied a request from Trump's attorneys to delay those arguments until the court decides whether the United States can replace Trump as the defendant in that case on the grounds that he is president.

Carroll sued Trump again in 2022, for battery and defamation, after New York passed a law that temporarily allowed people to file claims of sexual assault for alleged incidents that occurred outside the normal statute of limitations.

That case, which was the subject of Friday's decision by the 2nd Circuit, included claims about the incident in the store and Trump's statements about the writer in 2022.

In his written dissent arguing that the full 2nd Circuit should have reheard the appeal, Judge Steven Menashi said the three-judge appeals panel that upheld the jury's verdict "sanctioned striking departures" from legal precedent "to justify the irregular judgment in this case."

Menashi wrote that Manhattan District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan, who presided over the trial of Caroll's lawsuit, excluded key evidence, allowing her attorneys to  more easily argue that Trump's comments met the legal standard for defamation.

The dissent also disputed Kaplan's interpretation of legal rules that allowed "stale witness testimony about a brief encounter that allegedly occurred forty-five years earlier." 

That testimony came from Jessica Leeds,  a woman who told jurors that during an encounter with Trump on an airplane, he "grabbed [her] with his hands, tried to kiss [her], grabbed [her] breasts, and pulled [her] towards him," the dissent noted.

Menashi was joined in his dissent by Judge Michael Park. Both judges were appointed to the circuit by Trump in 2019, during his first term in the White House.

Four other 2nd Circuit judges pushed back on Menashi and Park, writing that the "dissenting opinion would have us stray far from our proper role as a court of review."

Those judges said that an en banc rehearing is almost always granted to resolve "a question of exceptional importance or a conflict between the panel's opinion and appellate precedent."

"The dissenting opinion ignores this rule of restraint," they wrote.

Two of the three circuit court judges who rejected Trump's effort to overturn the verdict in December filed a separate statement endorsing the majority's view that "the criteria for en banc rehearing have not been met."

Those judges, Denny Chin and Susan Carney, responded at length to Menashi's arguments.

"Even on his own terms, our dissenting colleague fails to explain why any purported error warrants a retrial or full court review," Chin and Carney wrote.

Consumers in the early part of June took a considerably less pessimistic view about the economy and potential surges in inflation as progress appeared possible in the global trade war, according to a University of Michigan survey Friday.

The university's closely watched Surveys of Consumers showed across-the-board rebounds from previously dour readings, while respondents also sharply cut back their outlook for near-term inflation.

For the headline index of consumer sentiment, the gauge was at 60.5, well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 54 and a 15.9% increase from a month ago. The current conditions index jumped 8.1%, while the future expectations measure soared 21.9%.

The moves coincided with a softening in the heated rhetoric that has surrounded President Donald Trump's tariffs. After releasing his April 2 "liberation day" announcement, Trump has eased off the threats and instituted a 90-day negotiation period that appears to be showing progress, particularly with top trade rival China.

"Consumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the extremely high tariffs announced in April and the policy volatility seen in the weeks that followed," Joanne Hsu, survey director, said in a statement. "However, consumers still perceive wide-ranging downside risks to the economy."

To be sure, all of the sentiment indexes were still considerably below their year-ago readings as consumers worry about what impact the tariffs will have on prices, along with a host of other geopolitical concerns.

On inflation, the one-year outlook tumbled from levels not seen since 1981.

The one-year estimate slid to 5.1%, a 1.5 percentage point drop, while the five-year view edged lower to 4.1%, a 0.1 percentage point decrease.

"Consumers' fears about the potential impact of tariffs on future inflation have softened somewhat in June," Hsu said. "Still, inflation expectations remain above readings seen throughout the second half of 2024, reflecting widespread beliefs that trade policy may still contribute to an increase in inflation in the year ahead."

The Michigan survey, which will be updated at the end of the month, had been an outlier on inflation fears, with other sentiment and market indicators showing the outlook was fairly contained despite the tariff tensions. Earlier this week, the Federal Reserve of New York reported that the one-year view had fallen to 3.2% in May, a 0.4 percentage point drop from the prior month.

At the same time, the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week reported that both producer and consumer prices increased just 0.1% on a monthly basis, pointing toward little upward pressure from the duties. Economists still largely expect the tariffs to show an impact in the coming months.

The soft inflation numbers have led Trump and other White House officials to demand the Fed start lowering interest rates again. The central bank is slated to meet next week, with market expectations strongly pointing to no cuts until September.

Shares of Brazilian meat giant JBS made their U.S. public market debut on Friday, opening at $13.65 a share.

The opening trade values the company at roughly $30 billion, outstripping rival Tyson Foods' market cap of about $19.82 billion.

JBS is now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "JBS," a day later than initially expected. The company said it couldn't conclude certain operational procedures in time to debut on Thursday. Its stock was delisted from the Sao Paolo Exchange in Brazil a week ago as part of the dual-listing plan.

Since its founding more than seven decades ago, JBS has grown to become the world's largest meatpacking company. Last year, the company reported net revenue of $77.2 billion and net income of $2 billion, according to regulatory filings.

JBS operates a sprawling business worldwide, with significant divisions in Brazil, the U.S. and Australia. The company also owns more than 80% of Pilgrim's Pride, the U.S. poultry giant.

JBS's U.S. listing is more than 15 years in the making. The company's U.S. subsidiary first announced plans to go public in 2009, but the move never came to fruition after two postponements. Then, in late 2016, the company said it would have a U.S. initial public offering as part of a broader reorganization strategy. But months later, the Brazilian government began investigating corruption in the meatpacking company — including among JBS and its top executives.

J&F Investimentos, the holding company that owns a controlling stake in JBS, paid a $3.2 billion fine in 2017 to settle bribery charges. Former chair Joesley Batista and his older brother CEO Wesley Batista, the company's top shareholders and the sons of its founder, managed to avoid prison sentences by cooperating with prosecutors. The Batistas and J&F settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in 2020 for roughly $27 million.

The Batistas exited J&F in the wake of the scandal. However, they returned to the company's board last year after being acquitted of insider trading charges.

More recently, in October, the Brazilian government fined JBS for buying cattle that were allegedly illegally raised in protected land in the Amazon.

The company's history of corruption and bribery allegations led to opposition to its U.S. listing from lawmakers on the both sides of the aisle, making it look unlikely that regulators would grant their approval.

After President Donald Trump's reelection, JBS's subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride donated $5 million to his inaugration committee, making it the single largest donor. In a statement to CNBC at the time, the company said it had a "long bipartisan history participating in the civic process" and looked forward to working with the new administration.

The SEC approved JBS's request to list on the New York Stock Exchange in April. JBS shareholders approved the move by a narrow margin the following month.

This was CNBC's live blog covering European financial markets.

European stock markets closed in the red after Israel launched air strikes on Iran.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index provisionally closed 1% lower. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 also fell a little more than 1.1%. The U.K.'s FTSE 100, which had initially rallied, also ended the day lower by 0.5%.

Brent crude was trading up 6% by the end of the equity market trading day.

Europe's auto stocks led losses on Friday afternoon, down around 2.2% for the session. It comes as automotive industry groups have warned of growing production threats over a rare earth shortage. 

Milan-listed shares of Stellantis, which owns household names including Jeep, Dodge, Fiat, Chrysler and Peugeot, fell 3.3%. 

Italian luxury carmaker Ferrari, Germany's Porsche and French car parts supplier Valeo all fell more than 2%.

Around one in four flights set to depart or arrive into Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport on Friday have been cancelled, according to data from airplane tracker FlightRadar24.

Both Wizz Air and Air France KLM confirmed on Friday that they had suspended flights to and from the city in the wake of escalating military action between Israel and Iran.

Greek carrier Aegean Airlines cancelled a flight into Tel Aviv from Larnaca in Cyprus, according to FlightRadar24, while a cargo flight from Frankfurt operated by Lufthansa Cargo was also cancelled.

A number of global airlines had already suspended flights to Israel amid the country's strikes on the Gaza strip, and rising tensions in the Middle East.

We're around halfway through the final session of the week, and the pan-European Stoxx 600 is still down by around 0.9%.

Every sector barring oil and gas remains in the red, with travel and leisure stocks leading losses on a 2.6% decline.

Major bourses are all firmly in negative territory, with Germany's DAX taking the biggest hit with a 1.5% fall.

Looking at individual stocks, British Airways owner IAG has shed 4.8% to tumble toward the bottom of the Stoxx 600 index, while cruise operator Carnival's London-listed shares were down 4.2% and digital car sales firm Auto1 Group shed 6%.

At the top of the pan-European index is oil tanker giant Frontline, which was last seen trading 8.2% higher as oil prices surge.

"Given the significant rally in oil prices due to the heightened geopolitical risk in the Middle East after the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, airline shares have one direction to go, which is down as jet fuel prices are rising in tandem with crude oil," Tamas Varga, analyst at PVM, told CNBC on Friday.

Oil prices surged on Friday, as Israel's airstrikes on Iran sparked concerns about possible supply constraints.

Charles Myers, founder and chairman of Signum Global Advisors, has warned that the U.S. will enter the conflict between Israel and Iran if any U.S. military bases are hit.

"Israel did go somewhat rogue and against President Trump by launching this strike," he told CNBC's "Squawk Box Europe" on Friday.

"From here, I think what really matters is the response from Iran. The ball is in their court, if it is as limited as it has been in the last two times, hit just on Israel, this will deescalate very quickly. If they hit one U.S. base, the United States will enter the war."

The dollar index — which measures the U.S. dollar against a basket of major rivals — was up 0.2% by 4 a.m. ET on Friday, as investors fled risk-on assets and sought safety.



The greenback notched gains against several major currencies. Against the euro and the British pound, it was up 0.4%. Against safe haven currencies, the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen, the dollar rose 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.

That came after Israel launched deadly airstrikes against Iran, which the latter swore to avenge.

— Chloe Taylor

Shares of Air France KLM were last seen trading 4.6% lower. 

The airline on Friday suspended its flights to and from Tel Aviv, amid escalating military action between Israel and Iran. 

"Following the closure of Israeli airspace, the airline has suspended its flights to/from Tel Aviv until further notice," a spokesperson for the airline said in a statement translated by Google. 

"Commercial measures are in place, allowing customers with reservations for flights to/from Tel Aviv scheduled between June 13 and June 17 inclusive to postpone or cancel their trip free of charge ... The airline is constantly monitoring the evolving geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft to ensure the highest level of flight safety and security."

Airline stocks are selling off this morning.

Shares of Wizz Air were last seen 4.8% lower, after the company suspended its flights to and from Tel Aviv, and said it would reroute planes set to cross the airspace involved in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.

"Due to the escalating situation in the Middle East, and several closed airspaces in the region, Wizz Air has decided to suspend its operations to Tel Aviv as of this morning and reroute all of its flights (where possible) that were due to overfly the affected airspaces for the next 72 hours," a spokesperson for the Hungarian budget carrier said in a statement on Friday.

Norway's Norse Atlantic, down 4.2%, British Airways owner IAG, down 3.8%, and Finnair, down 3.7%, are also among those experiencing the biggest losses in the sector.

European airline stocks are also still reeling from Thursday's fatal Air India crash, which sent the sector 3.4% lower in yesterday's session.

Iran launched more than 100 drones toward Israeli territory Friday morning after Israel's overnight missile strike on the country killed at least three of its senior military leaders.

"We can now confirm that the Chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Commander of the IRGC and the Commander of Iran's Emergency Command were all eliminated in the Israeli strikes across Iran," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said.

"Iran launched approximately 100 UAVs towards Israeli territory, which we are working to intercept."

It's about 20 minutes since the opening bell, and European shares are selling off as investors react to Israel's strikes on Iran in the early hours of Friday morning.

The pan-European Stoxx 600 was last seen trading 1% lower, with all sectors except oil and gas in negative territory.

Germany's DAX was down 1.4% in early trade, while the French CAC 40 was 1.1% lower and London's FTSE 100 — coming off of a record high — was down 0.5%.

Investors fled to safe-haven assets Friday after a series of Israeli airstrikes on Iran marked a major escalation of conflict in the region.

The scale of the attack, which Israel said was targeting Iran's nuclear program, took markets by surprise, pushing up prices of assets thought to offer protection in times of heightened volatility.

"The news has led to significant fears about an escalation and a wider regional conflict," Deutsche Bank strategists said in a note early Friday. "The effects of the attack have cascaded across global markets, with a strong risk-off move for several asset classes."

Good morning from London.

The FTSE 100, which closed at a record high on Thursday, also looks set to move lower, with futures tied to the index down by 0.5%.

A court battle over the late singer Jimmy Buffett's $275 million estate has highlighted the growing litigation over the trillions of dollars in wealth being passed down to spouses and families, experts said.

Jimmy Buffett's widow, Jane Buffett, filed a petition last week in a Los Angeles court to remove her co-trustee, Richard Mozenter, from the marital trust created to support her after the singer's death in 2023. Jane Buffett, who married Jimmy in 1977, alleged that Mozenter has been "openly hostile and adversarial" toward her and has refused to give her details on the trust and its financials. She alleged Mozenter is collecting "excessive fees" of $1.7 million a year and that he's mismanaging the trust assets, projecting income of only $2 million, implying annual returns of less than 1%.

Mozenter has filed his own lawsuit in Palm Beach County, Florida, alleging that Jane has been "completely uncooperative" in his efforts to manage the trust. He said Jane has interfered in business decisions, refused to meet with Mozenter and breached her fiduciary duties by "acting in her own interest."

The case has put a spotlight on the estate plans and business empire left by Jimmy Buffett, the singer famous for hits like "Margaritaville," "Cheeseburger in Paradise" and other breezy, beach-vibe hits. Along with his song catalogue, Buffett left homes, cars, planes and a multimillion-dollar stake in his brand business.

Buffett planned carefully for the afterlife. His will, first written more than 30 years ago and amended in 2017 and again in 2023, directed that most of his assets be placed in a marital trust for Jane. The trust was created "for the wife's sole benefit of her lifetime," according to legal filings. The three children they shared — Savannah, Delaney and Cameron — are the so-called remainder beneficiaries of the marital trust, which means they will receive any remaining assets left after Jane's death.

Jimmy Buffett also called for a co-trustee to manage the trust with Jane. He appointed Mozenter, an accountant who had also been his business manager and financial advisors for 30 years, as co-trustee.

The assets Buffett left were substantial. A successful businessman and entrepreneur, Buffett built a brand empire and merchandising business that far surpassed his song rights and touring. According to the filings, the assets in the estate included $34.5 million of real property; $15 million of equity in a company called Strange Bird Inc., which held Buffett's interest in various planes; $2 million in musical equipment; $5 million in vehicles; and $12 million in other investments.

One of the largest assets is Buffett's stake in Margaritaville, the chain of restaurants, bars, hotels and merchandising that commercialized the Buffett lifestyle. According to the filings, Buffett's equity in Margaritaville was estimated at $85 million, held though JB Beta. Margaritaville currently has 30 restaurants and bars, 20 hotels, and vacation clubs, casinos, cruise ships and merchandise.

Soon after Jimmy's death, however, the relationship between two co-trustees soured. In her complaint, Jane Buffett said Mozenter refused to provide her with basic financial information about the trust. He "belittled, disrespected, and condescended Mrs. Buffett" in response to her request for information, she said. She said his fees of $1.7 million a year to manage the trust were "enormous." When she asked for her projected income from the trust, Mozenter continued to delay. Finally, after she enlisted the help of her friend Jeff Bewkes, the former Time Warner chief, Mozenter provide her with an estimate of $2 million a year.

According to Jane's complaint, Mozenter acknowledged that Margaritaville had paid distributions of $14 million over the previous 18 months. Yet he declined to make future projections. "Based on that analysis, Mr. Mozenter told Mrs. Buffett that the Marital Trust's income would not cover her annual expenses and advised that she could 'consider adjustments,'" according to her complaint.

Trust lawyers said the case is part of a growing wave of lawsuits related to inheritances and trusts. Over $100 trillion of wealth is expected to be passed down from older generations to spouses and families over the next 25 years, according to Cerulli Associates. More wealth being passed down means more litigation, since families often fight over who gets what.

The Buffett case has reflected a different, but equally common, source of disputes: dueling trustees. Estate attorneys said Buffett could have made Jane the sole beneficiary as well as the sole trustee. Yet he chose to have Mozenter as co-trustee to help manage and direct the trust.

Mozenter said that during his lifetime, Jimmy "repeatedly expressed his concerns regarding Jane's ability to manage and control his assets" and was "very careful to create the trust in a manner that precluded Jane from having actual control over the trust." He added, "This fact has made Jane very angry."

Attorneys said appointing a co-trustee is common. Sometimes the inheritor is ill-equipped to handle the wealth or asset. Sometimes they'd rather leave the details to someone else. Whatever the reason, tensions between the beneficiary and co-trustee often erupt into full-blown hostility.

"These cases almost all turn on the exact same issue," said Keith A. Davidson, with Albertson & Davidson LLP. "You've got a beneficiary who doesn't feel like they're getting enough information and doesn't feel like they have any say. And you have a trustee who is being too paternalistic, and they feel like they can give out information what they want. That's a recipe for disaster."

Emotions run especially high when one of the trustees is a spouse.

"Imagine you're married to Jimmy Buffett for 47 years, you have a say in how you're spending your money and what you're doing and all that goes away overnight," said Stewart Albertson, also with Albertson & Davidson LLP.

Since the lawsuits were filed in different states, courts will first have to decide where the case will be heard. After that, a judge will start arguments and ultimately decide a path forward. Attorneys said judges have typically sided with the outside trustee (in this case Mozenter). Yet increasingly, they have been siding with spouses — which could mean Mozenter is removed.

More likely, attorneys said, a judge will determine that the relationship between Mozenter and Jane is unworkable and name a new, professional or corporate trustee from a trust company or bank to replace them both.

"My guess is a judge is likely to put in someone as a professional fiduciary," said Alex Weingarten, managing partner of Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP's Los Angeles office and chair of its entertainment litigation practice. "That would allow the fiduciary to get in and figure out what's going on. It's not what she wants, but it would give credence to her argument."

Attorneys said Mozenter's $1.7 million fee isn't necessarily excessive, since trustee fees can sometimes be as high as 1% or more of the assets each year. As for the return of $2 million a year on $275 million being proof of mismanagement, attorneys say many of the assets in the trust, like real estate, planes and cars, don't produce income and cost money to maintain. So the actual returns on income-producing assets could be higher.

Still, attorneys said the Buffett case offers two important lessons for families planning wealth transfers. First, they said wealth holders should communicate the plans for their estates before they die so no one is surprised. If Buffett had explained the co-trustee roles to both Jane and Mozenter, perhaps tensions would have been minimized.

"Jimmy did good planning, in that he set these trusts up," Davidson said. "But he didn't think about how this was actually going to play out." He also could have added a "removal right" in the trust to allow Jane to more easily remove Mozenter if she wished.

The second lesson is that friends or business associates don't always make good trustees. While today's wealthy often name a trusted friend to a family trust, the trustee may have a different relationship with the beneficiary and can see themselves as carrying out the wishes of the descendant — which is not the job of a trustee.

"In terms of problem cases, the ones we see, they rarely involve professional trustees," Albertson said. "It's almost always somebody who's a friend. That tends to be the worst. Your role is to follow the trust terms."

Rather than destroy or even delay Iran's emergence as a nuclear power, Israel's war risks bringing it closer.

Benjamin Netanyahu's gamble in attacking Iran may backfire without the support of US bunker-busting bombs against its nuclear facilities.

There are three immediate questions to answer about the war that Israel has started with Iran, all of which lead to the most important of all: Can this achieve Israel's stated goal of ensuring, once and for all, that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon?If it can, then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to launch Israeli jets against a much larger nation of close to 90 million people would, depending on the nature of the targets struck and level of civilian casualties, be justified on both strategic and moral grounds. The destruction of Israel is a declared policy of the regime in Tehran and one it's been acting on for decades. There's no doubt, despite denials, that Iran's uranium enrichment program is designed to produce weapons-grade fuel; it's practically there, with a growing stockpile concentrated to 60%, a level far beyond any conceivable civilian use. So, even though Israel has a nuclear deterrent of its own, as a tiny “one-bomb” country it can't take the risk of allowing such a hostile power to also have one.But whether the air strikes can indeed succeed is a very big “if.” It's more likely that Israel can do no more than delay Iran's nuclear program by a few years. And if that's the case, it becomes impossible to justify the certain bloodshed and unknowable consequences of starting this war, because it would at best gain no more than the diplomacy it displaced. Both the abandoned 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and any agreement that might realistically have come out of US-Iranian talks that were due to resume on Sunday would do as much — only without loss of life, or the risk to regional stability and global markets.So, in trying to unpick what Israel's military action can achieve, the first of my three questions is: Why now? Netanyahu has for years been trying to persuade the US to help him take out Iranian nuclear fuel enrichment sites. Yet he chose the early hours of Friday morning to go it alone.One clear reason is that Iranian air defenses have been severely degraded over the past year. So, too, has the potential for retaliation that Iran built up over decades by arming both Hezbollah, in Lebanon, and Hamas, in Gaza, with missiles. Those changes in the strategic environment have created a window to attack at much lower risk to both the Jewish state and its pilots than in the past. And it's an opportunity that won't, as Netanyahu has correctly said, last forever.A second reason is equally clear and much more disturbing: The personal political interests of the Israeli prime minister. The belief that Netanyahu has been dragging out and expanding the war in Gaza for selfish reasons is now widely held within Israel, let alone outside. Conflict keeps him in power by avoiding a government collapse. It also puts off an inevitable post-war inquiry into the extraordinary failures of security and policy that allowed Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist rampage to succeed on his watch.It's unlikely to be a coincidence that Netanyahu's decision to attack has come just days after he and his cabinet narrowly survived a vote of no-confidence in the Knesset, and at a time when the broad popular support he once enjoyed for continuing the fight in Gaza has evaporated. A conflict with Iran promises to again rally Israelis around the flag in ways that his policies in Gaza no longer do. Motives matter. They can drive decisions that otherwise wouldn't be made.Another vital question is whether Netanyahu's plan for success in the war he's started is predicated on drawing in the US. I don't have access to classified information, or a direct line to the Israeli prime minister's calculations. But the consensus among military analysts has long been that Israel can do only limited damage on its own; to succeed, it needs the 15-ton bunker-buster bombs that only America has.These weapons are thought essential because Iran's most advanced centrifuge cascades for enriching uranium are buried 60 to 90 meters (197 to 295 feet) under a mountain at Fordow, about an hour's drive south of Qom, home to the Islamic Republic's most important seminaries. Iran has been building an even deeper facility to replace the surface one at Natanz, an hour further south.

We know from the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the Vienna-based IAEA, that neither Fordow nor an above-ground Iranian nuclear center at Isfahan were among the 100 initial targets attacked by 200 Israeli jets on Friday. Nor was there any sign of radiation leaks at the Bushehr nuclear power plant or the largest enrichment site, at Natanz. This makes sense. The first priority for any complex bombing campaign would be to neutralize air defenses and reduce Iranian options for retaliation, by hitting missile bases and the commanders who would coordinate their use. The primary targets should come later.Whether Donald Trump allows the US to become the proverbial dog wagged by an Israeli tail may well now rely on Netanyahu's biggest gamble of all, which concerns the third question: How will Ayatollah Ali Khamenei choose — or be able — to respond.As of Friday morning, Iran's Supreme Leader had authorized the launch of about 100 long-range drones against Israel, most if not all of which appear to have been shot down. In a statement, Khamenei pledged revenge against the Jewish State, both now and over a long future, so there's more to come. He didn't, however, mention the US. That was in stark contrast to Iranian warnings before the attack, which had pledged to hit America's personnel and Arab allies in the Gulf should any attack occur.Khamenei no doubt understands that any such action would draw US forces into the fight. So too would a retaliation against Israel that targets civilian centers. So, whether through caution or lack of capacity to do more by conventional military means, Khamenei may not force Trump to involve US forces. That risks leaving Israel to conduct a weeks-long campaign of air strikes against hardened uranium enrichment sites that may not succeed.Out of the same caution, Khamenei may also avoid any dramatic public gesture such as declaring Iran's withdrawal from the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Either way, the stakes are now extraordinarily high and the outcome for Israel is uncertain. Iran already announced an acceleration to its enrichment program in response to a mere vote of censure by the IAEA last week. So it seems probable that, rather than back down, the regime in Tehran will now seek to build a nuclear arsenal as fast as it can.The risk to Netanyahu is that Khamenei can walk this tightrope between hitting back hard enough that he isn't damaged at home by appearing weak, but not so hard as to draw in the US and its bunker-busting bombs. If he can pull that off, then Israel's attack could backfire spectacularly, even while showing its continued technological and military superiority. Rather than destroy or even delay Iran's emergence as a nuclear power, there's a danger that this war of choice brings it closer.

Iran will not participate in the sixth round of nuclear negotiations with the United States scheduled for this weekend, Iranian state television said Friday on the heels of Israeli airstrikes against Iran.

The talks were expected to take place on Sunday in Muscat, Oman.

"We are still hoping for talks," a U.S. official said Friday morning.

But the Times of Oman reported that the Oman News Agency and Iranian state television have said the talks were suspended until further notice.

U.S. President Donald Trump earlier Friday urged Tehran to reach a nuclear deal "before there is nothing left," hours after Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Iran.

The Jewish state says its offensive targeted Tehran's nuclear program. 

Close Israeli ally and weapons supplier Washington says it was briefed on the hostilities but did not participate.

Iranian media reported the airstrikes hit Tehran and Natanz, which houses a key nuclear facility. As of Friday morning, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was not impacted, and "no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site."

"I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal," Trump said on his Truth Social media platform.

He added that he warned Tehran that "the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it."

The commander in chief of Iran's Revolutionary Guard (IRGC), Hossein Salam, was killed during the onslaught, Iranian state media reported. Israel's Defense Ministry said most of the top brass of the IRGC died in the attack. CNBC could not independently verify this report.

Circumstances "will only get worse," but further bloodshed could still be prevented, Trump said. "Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire."

Trump pulled the U.S. out of the first Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal during his first presidential mandate, imposing a spate of wide-spanning and economically debilitating sanctions against Tehran at the time.

The U.S. president has been steadfast in pursuing a new deal over Iran's nuclear program since returning to the White House, stressing he favored an agreement. Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran have yet to bear fruit on this count, however, with Tehran accusing Washington of not respecting Iran's right to enrich uranium for what it says are peaceful purposes.

A fresh round of U.S.-Iran nuclear deal negotiations were scheduled for Sunday in Oman. Iranian officials have been cited by state media saying they will not be attending.

Other world leaders have broadly urged restraint as Iran and Israel navigate the conflict, amid Tehran's pledge to retaliate.

Markets are currently watching whether the rekindled hostilities between archrivals Iran and Israel, which have been simmering since direct fire was last exchanged in 2024, will embroil the broader oil-rich Middle East region.

The United States military is helping to shoot down Iranian missiles and projectiles being launched at Israel, three American officials told NBC News on Friday.

The U.S. took the defensive actions after Tehran targeted Israel in retaliation for Tel Aviv's continued attacks on more than 200 targets in Iran, including nuclear sites, according to Israel Defense Forces.

The Pentagon had recently moved military assets into the region ahead of Israel's preemptive strike, another U.S. official told NBC.

The assets include U.S. Navy destroyers that were positioned off the coast of Israel in order to intercept aerial counterattacks from Iran, that official said. The U.S. also used ground-based interceptors, including THAAD and Patriot batteries, two U.S. officials told NBC.

The U.S. has insisted that the American military was not involved in Israel's "unilateral action."

But President Donald Trump told The Wall Street Journal on Friday that the U.S. was aware of Tel Aviv's plan. And in a call with NBC, he seemed pleased with Israel's performance, saying, "They had the finest equipment in the world, which is American equipment." 

Trump and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke earlier Friday, a U.S. official told NBC.

Iran's official state news agency said after launching its counterattacks, "The Hard Retaliation operation has begun."

"Iran has launched a powerful and decisive response to the Zionist regime's recent brutal attack," the agency said. "Just moments ago, Iran began firing hundreds of ballistic missiles toward the occupied territories."

Video showed missiles striking Tel Aviv.

Israeli defense systems are operating to intercept the missiles, according to IDF, which instructed the public to enter protected spaces and remain there until further notice.

U.S. stock markets closed lower Friday, as Iran's retaliatory strikes fueled fears of a broader regional conflict. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 700 points, or nearly 2%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each dropped more than 1%.

Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in a statement, said, "The Zionist regime will not remain unscathed from the consequences of its crime."

"The Iranian nation must be guaranteed that our response will not be half-measured," Khamenei said.

Iran will not participate in the sixth round of nuclear negotiations with the United States scheduled for this weekend, Iranian state television reported earlier.

The talks were expected to take place on Sunday in Muscat, Oman.

"We are still hoping for talks," a U.S. official said Friday morning, hours after Israel launched its Operation Rising Lion assault on Iran.

But the Times of Oman reported that the Oman News Agency and Iranian state television said the talks were suspended until further notice.

Israel said it had struck Iranian nuclear sites in Isfahan and Natanz, along with many other targets.

Israeli Army Spokesperson Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the attacks, dubbed Operation Rising Lion, in addition to targeting Iran's nuclear program, are intended to degrade the nation's long-range missile capabilities, NBC reported.

Defrin said Israel is aware of Iran's intention to launch missiles and drones in retaliation.

Meanwhile, two Iranian news agencies reported that two explosions were heard near the nation's Fordo nuclear enrichment site, according to NBC. That site is buried deep underground.

Air defense systems were activated in central Tehran.

Trump earlier Friday urged Tehran to reach a nuclear deal "before there is nothing left," hours after Israel launched a wave of airstrikes against Iran.

"I gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal," Trump said on his Truth Social media platform.

He added that he warned Tehran that "the United States makes the best and most lethal military equipment anywhere in the World, BY FAR, and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it."

Circumstances "will only get worse," but further bloodshed could still be prevented, Trump said.

"Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left, and save what was once known as the Iranian Empire," he wrote.

The U.S. said it was briefed by Israel on the attacks, which were launched early Friday local time, but did not participate in them.

The International Atomic Energy Agency had said that as of Friday morning, Iran's Isfahan nuclear site was not impacted, and "no increase in radiation levels has been observed at the Natanz site."

The first wave of airstrikes killed Iran's Revolutionary Guard Commander-in-Chief Hossein Salam, Iranian state media reported.

Israel's Defense Ministry said most of the top brass of the IRGC died in the attack. CNBC could not independently verify this report.

Trump pulled the U.S. out of the first Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action nuclear deal during his first term in the White House, and imposed wide-ranging and economically debilitating sanctions against Tehran.

But Trump has been steadfast in pursuing a new deal over Iran's nuclear program since returning to the White House earlier this year.

However, negotiations between the U.S. and Iran have yet to bear fruit.

Tehran has accused Washington of not respecting Iran's right to enrich uranium for what it says are peaceful purposes.

World leaders are calling for restraint after Israel launched a series of airstrikes on Iran early Friday morning, in an escalation of regional tensions.

Israel has said that the strikes were targeting Iran's nuclear program. Leading nuclear scientists and high-ranking military officials were killed in the strikes, according to Iranian media.

While the U.S. did not partake in the strikes, President Donald Trump was briefed on them beforehand.

"We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement. Washington, which has been carrying out negotiations to reach a new nuclear agreement with Tehran, has previously said it would prefer a brokered deal to an armed offensive.

As of the latest, Iran has launched around 100 drones toward Israeli territory that the Jewish state was working to intercept, according to an Israeli military spokesperson. A state of emergency was declared in Israel.

The attacks raised concerns about the potential for broader clashes and hostilities in the region that is already facing instability and conflict along the embattled Gaza Strip.

On Friday, Trump said on the Truth Social media platform that he had previously warned Iran of the strength of U.S. military equipment "and that Israel has a lot of it, with much more to come - And they know how to use it."

He also urged Iran to make a nuclear deal "before there is nothing left," suggesting that future strikes could be more intense.

Elsewhere, U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer said that the reports of strikes were "concerning" and called on those involved to "step back and reduce tensions urgently."

"Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate. Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy," he said in a post on X.

British Foreign Minister David Lammy also said that any further escalation was "a serious threat to peace & stability in the region and in no one's interest."

The French Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs, Jean-Noël Barrot, struck a similar tone on Friday, also calling for "all parties to exercise restraint and to avoid any escalation likely to compromise regional stability."

In a social media post, Barrot also noted that France had previously shared concerns about Iran's nuclear program.

"We reaffirm Israel's right to defend itself against any attack," he said according to a CNBC translation. Barrot added that it was essential to ease tensions through diplomatic channels, and that France was committed to contributing to this.

German chancellor Friedrich Merz echoed this sentiment in a series posts on social media platform X, saying Germany was ready to influence the conflicting parties with all available diplomatic tools.

"We affirm that Israel has the right to defend its existence and the safety of its citizens. We call on both sides to refrain from steps that could lead to a further escalation and could destabilize the entire region," he said, according to a CNBC translation.

"The goal has to remain that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons," Merz added.

In Asia, Malaysia's Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said he condemned Israel's attack, warning that it could further destabilize the region.

"Malaysia calls on Israel's partners – especially those with influence and leverage – to apply maximum pressure to halt further aggression," he said in a post on social media platform X.

China's ministry of foreign affairs also called for de-escalation efforts and offered to help with any such efforts, according to a CNBC translation of a state media report.

Meanwhile, Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement that it condemned Israel's strikes and that unprovoked attacks of sovereign United Nations members were "categorically unacceptable," according to a Google translation.

Elsewhere, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said that "the situation in the Middle East is dangerous."

"Diplomacy remains the best path forward, and I stand ready to support any diplomatic efforts toward de-escalation," she added in a post on social media platform X.

A spokesperson for United Nations General-Secretary António Guterres meanwhile said that the U.N. chief condemned "any military escalation in the Middle East" and called for "maximum restraint."

"He is particularly concerned by Israeli attacks on nuclear installations in Iran while talks between Iran and the United States on the status of Iran's nuclear programme are underway," the spokesperson said in a statement.

Numerous leaders from the Middle East region also shared reactions, as markets watch on for the possibility of a widening conflict.

Saudia Arabia's foreign ministry said it denounced "the blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran, which undermine its sovereignty and security and constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms."

Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran have repeatedly been strained over geopolitical issues and rivalry around oil, but the two countries re-established ties in 2023.

The United Arab Emirates also condemned Israel's strikes "and expressed its deep concern over the ongoing escalation and its repercussions on regional security and stability," according to a statement by the country's foreign ministry.

"The UAE emphasized the need to resolve disputes through diplomatic means rather than confrontation and escalation, and called on the United Nations Security Council to take urgent and necessary measures to achieve a ceasefire, and to reinforce international peace and security," it said.

The UAE is one of a handful of Arab nations to have established partial of full diplomatic relations with Israel.

Elsewhere, the Qatari foreign ministry called the attacks "a blatant violation of Iran's sovereignty and security, as well as a clear breach of international law and its established principles."

Turkey meanwhile said that "Israel must immediately cease its aggressive actions that could lead to broader conflicts." In a statement from its foreign ministry, Ankara, which has been vocally critical about the Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu in the past, reiterated that it did "not want to see any more bloodshed and destruction in the Middle East."

As tensions surge following Israeli strikes on Iran, fears have resurfaced that the Tehran could retaliate by targeting one of the world's most vital oil arteries — the Strait of Hormuz. 

The Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Any move to block it would ripple through energy markets.

However, market watchers believe a full-scale disruption of global oil flows by closing the waterway is unlikely, and might even be physically impossible.

There really is "no net benefit" that comes with impeding the passage of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, especially given how Iranian oil infrastructure has not been directly targeted, said Ellen Wald, President of Transversal Consulting. She added that any such action would likely trigger further retaliation.

She also warned that any major spike in oil prices caused by a closure could draw backlash from Iran's largest oil customer: China.

"China does not want the flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf to be disrupted in any way, and China does not want the price of oil to rise. So they're going to bring the full weight of their economic power to bear on Iran," Wald explained.

China is the number one importer of Iranian oil, reportedly accounting for over three-quarters of its oil exports. The world's second-largest economy is also Iran's largest trade partner.

"Their friends will suffer more than their enemies … So it's very hard to see that happening," said Anas Alhajji, managing partner at Energy Outlook Advisors, adding that disrupting the channel could be more of a bane than a boon for Tehran, given how most of Iran's daily consumption goods come via that route.

"It's not in their interest to cause problems because they will suffer first."

Iran in 2018 threatened to shut the Strait of Hormuz when tensions spiked following the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the reimposition of sanctions. Prior to that, another major threat reportedly came in 2011 and 2012, when Iranian officials, including then–Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi, warned of a potential closure if the West slapped further sanctions on its oil exports over its nuclear program.

The Strait of Hormuz, which is 35 to 60 miles (55 to 95 kilometers) wide, connects the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.

The idea of shutting the Hormuz waterway has been a recurring rhetorical tool but never been acted upon, with analysts saying that it's simply not possible.

"Let's be real about the Strait of Hormuz. First of all, most of it is in Oman, not in Iran. Number two, it's wide enough that the Iranians cannot close it," said Alhajji.

Similarly, Transversal Consulting's Wald noted that although many ships pass through Iranian waters, vessels can still traverse alternative routes via the United Arab Emirates and Oman.

"Any blockade of the Strait of Hormuz will be a 'last resort' option for Iran and likely contingent on a military engagement between U.S. and Iran," said  Vivek Dhar, Commonwealth Bank of Australia's director of mining and energy commodities research.

RBC Capital Markets' Helima Croft suggested that while there could be some disruption, a full-scale blockade was unlikely.

"It is our understanding that it would be extremely difficult for Iran to close the strait for an extended period given the presence of the US Fifth Fleet in Bahrain. Nevertheless, Iran could still launch attacks on tankers and mine the strait to disrupt maritime traffic," said Croft, head of global commodity strategy and MENA research at RBC.

U.S. President Trump has warned of possible military action if negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program break down, but it is uncertain whether these threats are meant to raise the stakes of U.S.-Iran talks or simply to increase pressure at the negotiating table, said Dhar. 

Israel carried out a wave of airstrikes on Iran early Friday morning local time, claiming the attacks were aimed at facilities linked to Tehran's nuclear program.

According to Iranian state media, the strikes killed Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, along with Hossein Salami, the commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

While a closure of the strait remains highly unlikely, the escalating conflict has prompted some to consider even the faint possibility.

"[Closing the strait] is kind of an extreme scenario, although we are in an extreme situation," said Amena Bakr, head of Middle East and OPEC+ insights at Kpler.

"So that's why I'm not putting that option completely off the table. We need to consider it."

Crude futures jumped as much as 13% after Israel launched airstrikes against Iran early Friday. Global benchmark Brent futures were up 6.5% at $73.88 per barrel as of 4.30 p.m. Singapore time, while the U.S. West Texas Intermediate was trading 6.7% higher at $72.57 per barrel.

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran launched more than 100 drones toward Israeli territory Friday morning after Israel's overnight missile strike on the country killed at least three of its senior military leaders.

"We can now confirm that the Chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Commander of the IRGC and the Commander of Iran's Emergency Command were all eliminated in the Israeli strikes across Iran," Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Effie Defrin said.

"Iran launched approximately 100 UAVs towards Israeli territory, which we are working to intercept."

Rocket sirens sounded in northern Jordan as Jordan's state media reported the country intercepted several Iranian drones in its airspace.

Israel's attack on Iran, which it said was targeted at nuclear enrichment facilities, came just days before U.S. and Iranian officials were set to attend a sixth round of nuclear deal talks. It was the largest attack on the Islamic Republic since the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s.

Iranian state news agency Tasnim on Friday afternoon local time reported a fresh wave of Israeli strikes on a military airport in the northwestern city of Tabriz. Around the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump made his first comments on the attacks in a post on Truth Social, urging Iran to reach a deal "before it's too late."

"I gave Iran the opportunity to make a deal. I told them, in the strongest terms, 'Just do it.' But no matter how hard they tried, and how close they got, they just couldn't do it," Trump wrote.

He added: "Now everyone is dead, and it's only going to get worse but there is still time to stop this slaughter – before the next attacks, which are expected to be even more brutal. Iran must reach a deal. Just do it, before it's too late. God bless you all!"

News of the strikes sent oil prices surging as much as 13% before paring gains, with global benchmark Brent crude surpassing $78 a barrel at one point.

Asian and European stocks fell, as investors rushed into safe havens amid fear of a wider war in a region that accounts for one-third of the world's oil supply. Dow futures were down around 500 points at 6:35 a.m. ET.

Brent crude was last trading around $75.38 per barrel at 6:35 a.m. ET, up 8.5%, with U.S. WTI trading at $74.11 per barrel, up about 9%.

In televised remarks Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the opening strikes on dozens of Iranian sites as "very successful," saying "we struck the senior command, we struck senior scientists that advance development of nuclear weapons, we struck nuclear installations."

He also made it clear that his country will continue to attack Iran "until the threat is removed," and said that Israelis may have to spend "far longer periods in shelters than we were accustomed to until now."

All eyes are now on the next moves by Iran and the United States, particularly whether the U.S. will get involved in this conflict. The U.S. State Department has stated it was not involved in Israel's overnight strikes on Iran, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio calling the actions unilateral and urging Iran not to target U.S. interests or personnel in the region.

Tehran does not see it that way. Iran's Foreign Ministry warned it would hold Washington responsible for the consequences of Israel's actions.

Trump is expected to attend a meeting of the National Security Council scheduled for 11 a.m. Eastern time.

Friday's strikes and the Iranian response are likely just the beginning in a rapid cycle of escalation, according to regional analysts.

"My sense is, from what we can tell in this early hour — and the assessment of the damage is going to have to go on for days — is that this is probably still the opening salvo," Firas Maksad, managing director for the Middle East and North Africa practice at Eurasia Group, told CNBC.

A fresh round of U.S.-Iran nuclear deal negotiations was scheduled for Sunday in Oman. Iranian officials have been cited by state media saying they will not be attending.

"If Iran does not come back to the negotiating table, as the U.S. has already called on it to do ... then I think, and I fear, that Israel will have to take successive rounds of action to take out what's left of Iran's nuclear program," Maksad said.

The strikes took place just one day after the IAEA Board of Governors — the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog — passed a resolution declaring Iran in noncompliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations for the first time in nearly 20 years.

In posts on social media platform X, Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed a heavy response to Israel's attacks.

"That [Zionist] regime should anticipate a severe punishment. By God's grace, the powerful arm of the Islamic Republic's Armed Forces won't let them go unpunished."

He wrote in a separate post: "In the enemy's attacks, several commanders and scientists have been martyred. God willing, their successors and colleagues will carry on with their duties without delay."

It is not yet known how and to what extent Iran will be able to deploy its arsenal of ballistic missiles and network of regional armed proxies in its efforts at retaliation.

India, like many countries, is grappling with Beijing's restrictions on rare earth element (REE) exports — and it wants to develop its own domestic supplies. Experts say it could become an important alternative to China in the sector, but will require much more public and private investment.

In recent weeks, the world has been facing a rare earths shortage in light of curbs from China. Auto manufacturers across India, the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Germany have been affected. 

In response, Indian officials are evaluating how Indian Rare Earths (IREL), a government-owned company, can be leveraged to increase REE production, sources told CNBC-TV18.

The report comes just days after India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports of rare earth elements a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative. 

Geoffrey Pyatt, senior managing director of critical minerals at McLarty Associates and former U.S. assistant secretary of state for energy resources from 2022 to 2025, echoed the commerce minister's statements. 

"This is both a wake-up call and an opportunity for us to deepen U.S.-India collaboration on an issue important to future economic competitiveness," he told CNBC. 

Beijing recently signaled plans to ease controls, and U.S. President Donald Trump has said that a trade deal with China that includes a resolution on rare earths is "done." But China's control of rare earth exports was not a new policy, with gradual restrictions of international sales occurring over the past two years. 

The recent shortage has further highlighted the country's dominant position in REEs: It produces roughly 60% of the world's supply and processes almost 90%, which includes materials imported from other countries. 

That gives Beijing considerable leverage over a supply of minerals crucial for various modern technologies, including robotics, clean energy, batteries and military equipment.

It's important to note, however, that rare earths are not rare in nature. While China has the largest deposits of REEs at 44 million tons, India also has a substantial amount at 6.9 million tons, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. That gives it the world's third-largest share of reserves behind that of Brazil, as per the agency's records.

India also has nearly 35% of the world's beach and sand mineral deposits, which are significant sources of important rare earths, according to a recent report from EY.

Given those considerable reserves, India is "poised to play a key role in building a more diversified global rare earths supply chain," Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC. 

However, in order to use REE reserves, countries need the ability to mine and extract raw materials, as well as the capacity and technology to process and refine them for final use.

So far, India is lacking in advanced separation and refining technology, especially compared with China, the U.S. and Japan, said Abhijit Kulkarni, partner at EY Parthenon, noting that India so far contributes less than 1% of global REE production.

Other challenges India faces is a lack of specialized technical expertise in REE mining and processing as well as poor infrastructure in India's mining regions, he added.

As part of efforts to change that, India launched the National Critical Mineral Mission in 2025. The initiative aims to develop an effective framework for REE self-reliance in the face of China's restrictions and other threats posed to the geographically concentrated supply chain.

Sources told CNBC-TV18 the Indian government is also considering private sector collaboration with IREL. Among the options being considered are government incentive schemes and capital subsidies aimed at encouraging local mining and processing.

According to Kulkarni, a lack of private sector participation in India's REE space, in particular, has stifled innovation and scalability. Working in its favor, however, is booming domestic demand across technology sectors including electric vehicles, electronics and defense.

"This dual factor makes India both a potential supplier and consumer, which encourages government and industry investment into building domestic capabilities," he said.

India is already in the process of completing several domestic REE projects, including a IREL rare earths magnet plant.

"India will not be able to replace China's position in the market, but it can certainly play an important role in providing a new source of rare earths," CSIS' Baskaran said. 

In the meantime, Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said India is also searching for alternative REE sources outside China. 

A delegation of Indian auto industry representatives is also gearing up for a China visit in an attempt to expedite their imports of rare earth magnets, according to local reports citing industry sources.

An Air India flight bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad on Thursday morning.

241 people on the plane were killed in the crash, with one passenger surviving, Air India said.

The Associated Press reported that a doctor identified the survivor as Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national from Leicester.

Amit Shah, India's home minister, said he was being treated in a hospital.

"We received the good news that one passenger survived. I have personally met this survivor."

Videos seen across social media appear to show Ramesh walking away from the wreckage.

Ramesh's brother, Nayan Kumar Ramesh, told BBC News that he "has no idea how he survived."

US President Donald Trump called the crash "one of the worst in aviation history" at a press conference on Thursday.

Data from Flightradar24 showed the Boeing 787 Dreamliner reaching an altitude of 625 feet before the signal ended. It crashed into a medical college about a mile south of the runway.

Minakshi Parikh, the dean of the college, said at least five of its students were killed after the plane hit a dining facility during lunchtime, The New York Times reported.

A mayday call was issued, but there was no response from the cockpit to air traffic controllers, India's directorate general of civil aviation said. Officials are still investigating the cause of the crash.

There were 169 Indian citizens, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese nationals, and one Canadian on Flight 171, the airline said. The DGCA said there were also 10 cabin crew and two pilots on the flight.

The National Transportation Safety Board said it was leading a team of US investigators who were traveling to assist Indian authorities with an investigation into the incident. British investigators also said they were sending a team to India.

The Hindustan Times reported that one of the aircraft's two black boxes, which records data relating to the flight, was recovered from the wreckage.

The plane, registered as VT-ANB, was first delivered to Air India in January 2014. It had flown to Ahmedabad from India's capital, New Delhi, earlier in the day, and had flown to Paris, Melbourne, Frankfurt, and Tokyo in the past week.

Thursday's incident is the first total loss of a 787 since the model entered service in 2011.

Boeing's CEO Kelly Ortberg said he had been in touch with Air India and that a Boeing team was standing by to support the investigation.

"Our deepest condolences go out to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board Air India Flight 171, as well as everyone affected in Ahmedabad," he said.

The tragedy marks the first fatal crash of Boeing's Dreamliner aircraft.

Boeing stock fell sharply Thursday, ending the day down almost 5% to trade at $203.75.

Morgan Stanley analysts said the event "derails the positive momentum on Boeing's stock," which had gained about 25% this year.

Air India's CEO, Campbell Wilson, said in a video statement that the airline's teams are "working around the clock" to support passengers, crew, their families, and investigators.

He said that while he understands people want to know more information, "anything we report must be accurate and not speculative."

"We owe that to everyone involved," he added.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on X: "The tragedy in Ahmedabad has stunned and saddened us. It is heartbreaking beyond words. In this sad hour, my thoughts are with everyone affected by it. Have been in touch with Ministers and authorities who are working to assist those affected."

Images appeared to show the jet's landing gear had not been retracted.

Alastair Rosenschen, an aviation consultant and former British Airways pilot, told Sky News: "If the gear was still down, then that would suggest that something is untoward."

The crash comes at a testing time for Air India, which has been overhauling its operations since the Tata Group acquired the formerly state-owned carrier in 2022.

A year later, it ordered 470 aircraft worth $70 billion at list prices. The new jets, with much more modern seats, are a distinct upgrade from the older planes that make up the bulk of its fleet — although supply-chain constraints have hindered deliveries.

Alan Tan, an aviation law professor at the National University of Singapore, said in a Thursday LinkedIn post that the crash will likely be the "costliest insurance claim in Indian aviation history."

He said India was not a party to international conventions that protect ground victims in plane crashes, so compensation and insurance claims for ground victims in the Air India crash would have to be dealt with under Indian domestic law.

Insurance claims for victims on board would be based on the 1999 Montreal Convention, which established that airlines would be liable for the death or injury of passengers.

Tan told BI that Air India and Boeing both have their work cut out for them to restore confidence with the public, and there would be an immediate hit to customer perception, particularly for Air India.

"But as other leading airlines facing crises have shown, these are not insurmountable. Transparency and accountability in investigations and consistent messaging to the public will hopefully reduce the risks of a media spectacle," he said.

Middle East Crisis:

A damaged building following Israeli airstrikes in Tehran on June 13.

Israel's early-morning strikes against Iran's nuclear program and ballistic-missile sites on Friday prompted the Islamic Republic to vow a “harsh blow” against both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government and the US, which denied any involvement.

The widespread attack across Iran, which sent oil prices surging, targeted nuclear sites and top military commanders. Iranian state television reported that the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, was killed.

In this article

Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang told employees in a memo on Thursday that he's leaving for Meta, confirming reports from earlier in the week about his departure and a large investment from the social networking company. 

Meta is pumping $14.3 billion into Scale AI as part of the deal, and will have a 49% stake in the artificial intelligence startup, but will not have any voting power, a Scale AI spokesperson said.

"As you've probably gathered from recent news, opportunities of this magnitude often come at a cost," Wang wrote in the memo that he shared on X. "In this instance, that cost is my departure. It has been the absolute greatest pleasure of my life to serve as your CEO."

Scale AI is promoting Jason Droege, the chief strategy officer, to the CEO role. Droege was previously a venture partner at Benchmark and an Uber vice president.  

A small number of Scale AI employees will also join Meta as part of the agreement, Wang wrote.

A Meta spokesperson confirmed that the company has finalized its "strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI.

"As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts," the spokesperson said. "We will share more about this effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks."

Meta's big bet on Wang fits into CEO Mark Zuckerberg's plans to bolster his company's AI efforts amid fierce competition from OpenAI and Google-parent Alphabet. Zuckerberg has made AI his company's top priority for 2025, but has grown increasingly frustrated with his team, particularly as Meta's latest version of its flagship Llama AI models received a tepid response from developers, CNBC reported earlier this week.

Although Zuckerberg has traditionally placed long-standing employees into high-ranking position, he decided that the outsider Wang would be better suited to oversee AI initiatives deemed crucial for the company.

Scale AI counts a number of Meta rivals as customers, including Google, Microsoft and OpenAI. Meta is one of Scale AI's biggest clients.

The Scale AI spokesperson said that Meta's investment and hiring of Wang will not impact the startup's customers, and that Meta will not be privy to any of its business information or data. 

WATCH: Meta's one of AI's leaders, not a laggard.

 Bitcoin's flash crash could be followed by a 64% rally if historical data rings true again. 

Key takeaways:

Bitcoin returns after major downside catalysts have exceeded 64.6% since 2010, suggesting that the recent escalation of tensions in the Middle East could be a BTC purchasing opportunity.

Despite trading near all-time highs, Bitcoin's Puell Multiple remains in the discount zone, indicating institutional accumulation and undervalued market conditions.

Bitcoin (BTC) price fell to $102,650 on Binance on Friday, following Israel's airstrikes on Iran. As the tensions culminated, oil prices rose by 5%, and historical data suggests the BTC dip could be a buying opportunity. Amid rising global tensions, Bitcoin's past performance during geopolitical crises offers a compelling investment case.

Head of research at Bitwise Europe, André Dragosch, highlighted this potential in an X post, citing data from across the top 20 geopolitical risk events since 2010. The analyst said that Bitcoin has averaged a 64.6% price increase within 50 days, with a median gain of 17.3%.

The chart shows Bitcoin's geopolitical event performance on a logarithmic factor scale. The mean performance (green line) remains relatively stable around 100 before a risk event, but it surges after the event, peaking around 30-40 days later within the min-to-max range (shaded area). This pattern suggests that the current dip could be a temporary market reaction, with historical precedent pointing to substantial gains in the weeks ahead.

Blockstream CEO Adam Back reinforced this trend, countering gold advocate Peter Schiff's skepticism with data from 10 major events since 2020. Back's chart mirrors Bitwise's, showing Bitcoin's 20% gain after the U.S.-Iran escalation in January 2020, often outpacing gold and the S&P 500.  

An October 2020 study also complements these findings. Using Granger causality tests on Bitcoin price and geopolitical risk indexes from 2010-2019, the study identified bidirectional influences, indicating that Bitcoin not only reacts to geopolitical events but also serves as a stabilizing asset during global uncertainty.

Data from CryptoQuant also suggests that Bitcoin is in buy territory. The Puell Multiple, which tracks miners' daily revenue against the annual average, lingers near the discount zone below 1.40, despite Bitcoin's recent peak above $108,000. 

This rare divergence, intensified by the April 2024 halving's reduced block rewards, signals undervaluation and suggests the market is driven by institutional demand or tightening supply, not miner selling pressure. 

Historically, a Puell Multiple below 1.0 marks accumulation phases, indicating Bitcoin's current rally may be far from its euphoric peak. The post added,

Additionally, Glassnode data shows Bitcoin is currently trading between key short-term cost basis (CB) with its 1-week CB at $106,200, 1-month at $105,200, 3-month at $98,300 and 6-month at $97,000. The BTC cost basis represents the average price at which investors acquired their Bitcoin over a specific period. With most holders in profit, the risk of panic selling remains low, but it could change over the next few weeks. 

These metrics— a discounted Puell Multiple and resilient cost basis—highlight a robust foundation for recovery, suggesting that the current dip could be a prime opportunity for investors eyeing Bitcoin's next upward move.

Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse reportedly said Wednesday (June 11) that the company's XRP cryptocurrency could account for 14% of the cross-border payment volume currently handled by SWIFT within five years.

Noting that SWIFT handles messaging while banks handle liquidity, Garlinghouse said, “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,” Seeking Alpha reported Friday (June 13).

“If you're driving all the liquidity, it is good for XRP … so I'll say five years, 14%,” Garlinghouse said while speaking at the XRP APEX 2025 event in Singapore, per the report.

XRP serves as a bridge currency, facilitating instant exchanges between currencies and reducing the need for traditional banks to park money abroad, according to the report.

Enterprises are warming up to alternative cross-border money movement vehicles, including blockchain-based solutions that offer streamlined cross-border flows while freeing up capital previously trapped in correspondent accounts across multiple countries, PYMNTS reported in June 2024.

These enterprises are doing so because cross-border payments are fraught with inefficiencies, high fees and delayed transactions, largely due to the ongoing limitations of traditional methods and legacy infrastructure.

Blockchain technology offers transformative potential to address these issues by streamlining processes and reducing costs, according to the PYMNTS Intelligence report “Can Blockchain Solve the Cross-Border Payments Puzzle?”

The report found that by using distributed ledger technology to enable direct transactions without intermediaries, blockchain technology reduces costs and speeds up settlement times, with transactions potentially completed in seconds rather than days.

It added that permissioned decentralized finance could lower transaction costs by up to 80% compared to traditional methods.

When Shopify announced Thursday (June 12) that is rolling out a feature that enables merchants to accept USDC stablecoins, the company said the new capability will allow merchants to “sell to a customer on the other side of the world as easily as their next-door neighbor.”

On June 5, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said the company is considering using stablecoins to transfer money among different countries because they can help reduce the cost of moving money.

“That's super interesting to us, and we're definitely going to take a look,” Khosrowshahi said.

The crypto market is slightly bouncing back from early Friday's jitters on escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.

After slumping to the $102,600 mark, bitcoin BTC$105,226.34 rebounded to around $106,000 before fading lower in the U.S. afternoon hours with reports about a fresh wave of airstrikes targeting Iran. The top cryptocurrency was down 1.6% in the last 24 hours, changing hands at $105,200 and still less than 6% shy of its all-time high price.

Meanwhile, the CoinDesk 20 — an index of the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, excluding memecoins, stablecoins and exchange coins — has lost 4.4% in the same period of time. Tokens such as ether ETH$2,534.82, avalanche AVAX$19.06 and toncoin TON$2.98 were the hardest hit, slumping between 6% and 8%.

Crypto stocks, however, aren't doing too hot. Most equities are in the red, especially bitcoin miners MARA Holdings (MARA) and Riot Platforms (RIOT), down 5% and 4% respectively. A notable exception is stablecoin issuer Circle (CIRCL), which is still benefiting from the windfall of its recent IPO; the stock is up 13% today, with news of retail giants Amazon and Walmart reportedly exploring stablecoins adding to the momentum.

Traditional markets don't seem overwhelmingly concerned by the war. While gold is up 1.3%, potentially gearing up for new all-time highs, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq are only down 0.4% each.

"Nice bounce thus far and lack of follow-through lower," well-followed crypto trader Skew said in a Friday X post. Market participants will likely remain cautious through the weekend with BTC tightly correlated with traditional markets amid heightened geopolitical risks, Skew added.

On the longer timeframe, some analysts see risks of a deeper pullback.

10x Research founder Markus Thielen noted that BTC's drop below $106,000 translates to a failed breakout, and traders should wait for more favorable setups before rushing to buy the dip.

He highlighted the $100,000-$101,000 zone as key support, warning that a break below could mark a return to the broader consolidation phase similar to last summer.

John Glover, chief investment officer at bitcoin lender Ledn, argued that bitcoin entered a corrective phase from its record highs that could see the largest digital asset drop to $88,000-$93,000.

He said the $90,000 level could offer a favorable entry for opportunistic investors before BTC resumes its uptrend.

"Once this pattern has played out, the next move higher to the $130,000 area is expected to begin," he said.

A strategic Bitcoin reserve is a step in the right direction for Pakistan, but only mass adoption will truly unlock the immense potential Bitcoin can offer.

Pakistan's relationship with Bitcoin has been marked by inconsistency and confusion over the past few years. Initially, the country outright banned bitcoin trading in 2018, citing concerns over fraud, money laundering and lack of regulation. However, over time, their stance softened and regulators began exploring the technology behind Bitcoin with courts even questioning the legality of the ban. Eventually, citizens were allowed to hold bitcoin, though trading remained murky and unregulated. This back-and-forth approach has created a confusing environment, where Bitcoin exists in a legal gray area. It is technically allowed, yet not fully embraced or regulated, reflecting the state's struggle to balance innovation with control.

🇵🇰 PAKISTAN TO ESTABLISH NATIONAL STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE Honored to have had the Pakistan Minister Bilal  Bin Saqib at the Bitcoin Conference 🚀 pic.twitter.com/7WunP5fuZm

This muddled relationship with Bitcoin seems to have turned a corner in recent weeks as Bilal Bin Saqib, head of the Pakistan Crypto Council, at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas announced that the country is moving to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Furthermore, he announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of excess energy to Bitcoin mining and high-performance computer data centers. The Ministry of Finance has also commissioned the establishment of an entirely new agency to oversee digital asset regulation which could lead to a less opaque legal framework around bitcoin ownership and usage in everyday transactions.

Critics have argued that this is merely an attempt by Pakistan to cozy up to Trump in the aftermath of the recent skirmish with India. After all, Saqib did state that Pakistan was inspired by the Trump administration when he spoke at the recent Las Vegas Bitcoin conference. Others have asserted that Pakistan is merely seeking to build resistance to possible sanctions in the future over its support for terrorist groups. I believe that such a geopolitically focused critique overlooks a deeper economic reality that has been staring Pakistan in the face for many years. 

I wrote an article for a Pakistani newspaper about a year ago in which I argued that the country is uniquely situated, in economic terms, to take advantage of Bitcoin and unlock the benefits that come with adoption. Pakistan suffers from rampant inflation, stagnant capital formation, depleted foreign reserves, an inefficient bureaucracy and an overreliance on remittances from abroad. These systemic issues have eroded citizens' faith in traditional financial systems, leaving many Pakistanis disillusioned and seeking alternative means to safeguard their wealth and economic autonomy. 

Thus, nurturing a culture of Bitcoin adoption could go a long way toward alleviating much of these economic ills and empowering citizens to take control of their financial future. By earning and trading a form of currency that is deflationary in nature, Pakistanis can protect themselves from the downsides of the macroeconomic trends that have decimated the living standards of this once proud nation. Bitcoin adoption could transform the country's lively remittance sector, with receivers keeping more of the money they are sent. It could also emancipate people from the inefficient banking system that is such a drain on the people. Permissionless transactions could also empower the beleaguered minorities who often struggle to achieve financial freedom. 

The announcement of a strategic Bitcoin reserve, as well as promises to introduce pro-Bitcoin regulation and a mining strategy, are steps in the right direction. They show that the mood is shifting and the country is starting to take a serious look at the only real digital currency in town. These steps also point to a much broader, global shift in attitudes toward Bitcoin — especially in nations where hyperinflation is a daily reality and the banking system struggles to meet citizens' needs. 

However, real change will only come when Pakistan fully legalizes bitcoin as a digital currency and takes steps toward mass adoption. Only then will ordinary Pakistani citizens be free to trade with people from all over the world without the need to rely on the local banking system. Only then will financial autonomy become an achievable goal for those living far away from the big cities where banks are based. Only then will women be free to earn, store and transact in a digital currency that is resistant to cultural barriers. 

Creating a national strategic reserve merely signals that a nation believes in bitcoin as an asset with the potential to offer a reliable return. It does not signal that a nation has adopted the digital currency as a means to overcome the obstacles imposed by fiat. Strategic national reserves also hoard bitcoin and bring it too close to the state, even though the digital currency was designed to be a hedge against state-controlled money. As such, a reserve does not unlock the true potential of bitcoin to act as a buffer against domestic inflation, currency devaluation and a cumbersome banking system. 

A strategic Bitcoin reserve is a step in the right direction for Pakistan, as it would be for any nation that suffers from hyperinflation. But only mass adoption will truly unlock the immense potential Bitcoin can offer to a nation such as Pakistan and we have a long way to go before that becomes a reality. 

In my view, strategic reserves are not what bitcoin is all about, but let's hope this is merely the first step in a long and prosperous journey toward orange-pilling a nation.

              Highlights            



                        Stablecoins are evolving from niche crypto tools into digital payment infrastructure, with major players like Amazon, Walmart, Shopify, Visa, Stripe and more exploring their integration to streamline settlement.                      


                        Stablecoins promise efficiency, speed and reduced costs, particularly in underserved or high-inflation markets, but they raise regulatory and operational concerns, such as the lack of standardized dispute resolution, chargebacks and liability protections.                      


                        Trends point toward a future hybrid model, where stablecoins complement existing financial rails rather than fully replace them — especially in cross-border, digital-first and decentralized commerce environments.                      

Whoever owns the rails of digital payments might just own the next phase of commerce.

Stablecoins, once dismissed as niche instruments for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, could be poised to mature into legitimate infrastructure for commerce by challenging legacy roles in the issuer-merchant-acquirer stack.

Walmart and Amazon, for example, are reportedly interested in launching their own stablecoins. Shopify began rolling out a feature this week that enables merchants to accept USDC stablecoins within their existing payment and order fulfillment flows. Visa and Bridge, a stablecoin orchestration platform, partnered in April to launch a stablecoin credit card.

Stripe, meanwhile, acquired digital wallet firm Privy Wednesday (June 11). By integrating Privy into its stack, Stripe aims to reduce the complexity of crypto onboarding for merchants and consumers.

Yet for all the momentum, confusion remains. While stablecoins offer new efficiencies, their right-now reality may threaten to expose existing gaps in oversight, standards and risk controls.

Several questions remain unanswered. Are stablecoins simply a faster, more programmable way to settle payments? Or are they quietly positioning themselves as new forms of issuers, (e.g., digital-native alternatives to traditional bank networks)? And what happens to time-honored pillars of the card ecosystem like chargebacks, fraud management and liability coverage if stablecoins upend how value moves?

The traditional issuer-acquirer-merchant landscape is one where every transaction is a dance of communication and trust, usually routed through multiple intermediaries and settlement layers — each adding time, cost and complexity. Stablecoins can promise to rewrite that choreography.

In their most immediate and least controversial use case, stablecoins serve as a settlement layer, or a way to move money between parties more quickly and at lower cost than existing bank rails.

This settlement use case has clear appeal, including speed, traceability and reduced counterparty risk. However, it also raises a fundamental question: If a stablecoin moves money, who is responsible when something goes wrong?

Things get more complex when stablecoins are used not just to settle funds, but as the actual medium of consumer payments at checkout.

Take a stablecoin wallet like Circle's or a Web3-enabled debit card that draws from a USDC balance. In that case, the stablecoin provider starts to resemble a neo-issuer — not offering credit or revolving balances but enabling stored-value payments outside of the traditional card stack.

Unlike traditional card networks, where dispute resolution is standardized and liability is contractually shared, stablecoin rails often lack defined rulesets. Some protocols are exploring decentralized identity and escrow layers, but these are nascent at best.

This ambiguity has strategic implications. If stablecoins can bypass banks and card networks for issuance and settlement, they don't just streamline the stack — they potentially collapse it.

One of the most underappreciated functions of the traditional stack is how it handles reversibility and responsibility.

In the current model, if a consumer disputes a charge, the issuer initiates a chargeback, and the network adjudicates the outcome. There are defined timelines, evidence requirements and chargeback codes. Consumers enjoy protection under laws like Regulation Z (credit cards) or Regulation E (debit cards).

Stablecoins, by contrast, are final by design. Once a USDC transfer is confirmed on-chain, it is practically irreversible. That may be ideal for automation and fraud resistance, but it's problematic when errors or disputes arise.

At the same time, while it's tempting to view stablecoins through a Western lens — as faster, cheaper versions of existing tools — in markets like Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Southeast Asia, stablecoins are filling different gaps.

In Argentina, where annual inflation has topped 100%, stablecoins like USDC and USDT offer dollar-denominated stability in ways the local banking system cannot. In Nigeria, stablecoins provide a workaround to strict capital controls and limited international payment access.

In these contexts, the stablecoin is not a settlement layer — it's the payment method itself. The wallet becomes the issuer, the protocol replaces the network, and local FinTechs play hybrid roles as acquirers, remittance agents and custodians.

Here, the question isn't whether stablecoins fit into the existing stack. It's whether the stack itself is still relevant.

Ultimately, despite the disruptive potential, stablecoins are unlikely to fully displace the issuer-acquirer model anytime soon. More likely is a hybrid future, where stablecoin-based payments coexist alongside fiat rails, particularly in cross-border commerce, digital marketplaces and creator economies.

The Middle East is again at war, with rising tensions between Israel and Iran spooking markets and sending prices for both traditional and crypto assets, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, tumbling to weekly lows. Is it time to panic for Bitcoin investors? The data currently doesn't support that view.

Bitcoin dropped 4.5% in the past 24 hours to trade at $104,343, while Ethereum crashed 8.2% to $2,552 as escalating Middle East tensions sparked a massive risk-off move across cryptocurrency markets. The selloff, which began during Asia trading hours on June 13, wiped out over $420 billion from the total crypto market cap and triggered $1.2 billion in leveraged liquidations.

Following news that Israel had launched a major military operation against Iran, digital assets indeed tumbled sharply. The pre-dawn airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities sent shockwaves through global financial markets, with cryptocurrencies bearing the brunt of the selling pressure as investors fled to traditional safe havens.

The odds of such dramatic escalation seemed remote just days ago. The probability of Israel attacking Iran was trading at less than 20% throughout the week on the prediction market Polymarket, dipping as low as 11% at various points. And this is something markets don't like—not war, but uncertainty. Currently, on Myriad Markets—a prediction market developed by Decrypt's parent company Dastan—the odds of a US-Iran nuclear deal before the end of the week has dropped to just 4.7%.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 dropped 0.66% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.17% as investors fled to traditional safe havens. Gold surged 1.8% to $3,445 per ounce, approaching its record high of $3,500.05, while Brent crude oil prices jumped as much as 9.21% during Asia hours before settling around 7% higher at $72.6 per barrel.

The sharp moves in commodities reflected genuine supply concerns. Iran, as OPEC's third-largest producer, controls critical oil infrastructure, and any prolonged conflict could severely disrupt global energy markets. Defense stocks predictably surged. Just for context, Lockheed Martin and Palantir jumped about 3% as investors positioned for potential military escalation

The crypto Fear & Greed Index, which measures investors' appetite for these risk assets, retreated from 65 to 54, moving from "greed" to "neutral"—an arguably healthy reset rather than the extreme fear readings typically associated with major market bottoms. This measured shift in sentiment, combined with continued ETF inflows of $86.31 million into Bitcoin despite the price decline, suggests institutional conviction remains intact.

Against this backdrop of panic in traditional markets, Bitcoin's 2.4% decline to $104,343 appears remarkably contained. Yes, the leading cryptocurrency triggered $1.2 billion in leveraged liquidations as it broke below the psychologically important $106,000 level. But considering the magnitude of the geopolitical shock, the selloff lacks the hallmarks of genuine panic.

The technical picture supports this thesis. Bitcoin's Relative Strength Index, or RSI, on the daily chart sits at 47—down from overbought levels near 80 last week but still firmly in neutral territory. This suggests profit-taking rather than capitulation. The Average Directional Index (ADX), which measures the strength of a trend regardless of direction, is now at 17, which indicates weak directional momentum. That means the current move lacks the conviction typically seen during crisis-driven crashes, which tracks with the coin's recent lateralization.

Bitcoin's Exponential Moving Average, or EMA, is even more telling. EMA measures the average price of an asset, in this case Bitcoin, over a given period of time. Bitcoin's 50-day EMA at $102,513 provided initial resistance on the bounce attempt, suggesting technical levels still matter—a sign that algorithmic trading rather than emotional panic is driving price action. The 200-day EMA sits much lower at $92,687, showing the longer-term uptrend remains intact.

For Bitcoin, the immediate test lies at reclaiming the $105,757 level (50/200-day EMA confluence). Failure to break back above this level would target: $100,000 as psychological support, and $95,000 as visible support, based on the charts.

Upside resistance stands at $110,000, with the recent all-time high near $111,891 remaining the key level for bulls to reconquer.

Ethereum's steeper 7% drop to a daily low of $2,439 before bouncing to its current $2,552.30 reflects the typical risk-off rotation from altcoins to Bitcoin during market stress. Despite recording 19 consecutive days of ETF inflows, ETH couldn't maintain support above $2,700 as traders de-risked portfolios.

The second-largest cryptocurrency's technical indicators paint a more bearish picture than Bitcoin's. With RSI at 50.6 and the ADX at 22 showing that the bullish bounce is now very, very weak, and the longer bearish trend is still in play, Ethereum shows stronger directional movement to the downside. The price is currently hovering near the 200-day EMA ($2,473), having broken below it during the selloff. The 50-day EMA sits at $2,417, and a break below would signal a more significant trend change.

Ethereum bulls, then, must defend the current $2,552 level to avoid a deeper correction. The key levels to watch are the resistances at $2,738 and an immediate support hear the psychological levels of $2,417.

Meme coins suffered disproportionate losses, with Fartcoin—this week's epitome of meme coin bullishness for absolutely no meaningful reason—plummeting 12% to $1.1968. The token's breakdown from its ascending wedge pattern, combined with strong selling pressure, exemplifies how speculative positions unwind rapidly during times of uncertainty. The RSI at 50 shows neutral momentum after falling from overbought conditions, while the ADX at 22 confirms the switch from bullish to neutral move.

And even with all that said, the chart still paints an overall bullish picture for Fartcoin, and meme coins tend to do weird things. As a general rule, though, you can expect meme coins and other altcoins to mirror Bitcoin's moves, but with a lot more volatility.

GUEST COLUMN					        	                        by

We've had smart contracts for a long time. Ethereum, the OG smart contract blockchain, is more than a decade old, but the intelligence in smart contracts has always been rather rudimentary. If this, then that.

It works and, when carefully deployed, has created a lot of value. But what has long passed for “smart” in assets and contracts in the world of blockchain cannot compare with the accelerating intelligence of artificial intelligence systems.

In the coming years, we can expect to see both ecosystems continue to mature and accelerate, but they are also going to cross-pollinate. And the result is going to be an era of very smart contracts, assets and data.

Let's start with the intelligence that is rapidly spreading across the world of business. We're increasingly seeing that AI systems lack moats, and their performance can be dramatically improved over time in ever smaller computational footprints. This may not be great for AI model makers, but it is a bonanza for everyone else since it means that we can increasingly deploy intelligence to the most remote corners of the business ecosystem.

Supply chain operations are an excellent example of where deploying intelligence can supercharge performance. Historically, most replenishment planning in retail stores is formula-driven. As stock falls below a required minimum, orders are placed. These formulas control minimums, maximums and economic order quantities. Sophisticated users are able to push extra stock for major promotions and events. It's basic stuff, but it scales up nicely since no retail chain can afford to have an inventory analyst work on each product every week in every location for a customized forecast and plan.

Now they can. Winter storm forecast? Order extra hot chocolate. Summer heatwave? Extra cold drinks. News of a flu epidemic? More cold medicine. Local supplier out? Source from another store. Now do that for 31,000 offerings every week — the average number of items stocked in a U.S. grocery store. Impossible today. Routine tomorrow.

Pervasive intelligence requires quality data and it's all useless without the ability to action. The tamper-proof and universally synchronized nature of blockchain data means that we can build good outcomes on reliable information. And the smart contracts that reside on chain can be given the authority to do things like autonomously restock product based on AI-developed market plans.

Autonomous commerce means that assets can be smart on their own, deciding how to maximize their value and return on investment. Information itself can know where it is most valuable — and ask to be paid for access. And all of this can be executed at scale and with low costs.

The payoff for this future is not hard to grasp: stores that rarely run out of stock, supply chains that don't clog up, and contracts that always get the best price. Individually each one of these is valuable, and together they can have an impressive multiplier effect. It's not just about avoiding running out of product; it's also about not spending on expediting logistics or having overstock sales. Profits that used to get lost at the margin can now be kept, all without raising prices.

Getting to this future will not be quick or easy. Economic research shows that though new technologies can become pervasive very quickly, average levels of utilization are not very sophisticated. Robert Solow famously remarked in 1987 that he could see evidence of computers everywhere in the economy except the productivity statistics. The same happened with electricity.

It takes a long time for most firms to absorb technology and transform themselves. Tyler Cowen, a professor of economics at George Mason University, has similarly speculated that like early computers and electricity, the overall productivity takeoff for artificial intelligence will be relatively slow as firms and people take time to truly understand how to use it.

What economists don't spend much time talking about, however, is that you don't have to be the average person or the average firm. Even as some firms are struggling to absorb new technology, there is tremendous advantage to be had for the pioneers. Nor is it a short-lived advantage. Early leaders in e-commerce, cloud computing, desktop operating systems and mobile devices have held on to their market leading positions for decades.

The era of pervasive intelligence and operations, where AI systems create smart assets, contracts and data, and execute at scale over blockchain networks, is coming. It may take decades to be fully realized, but you can choose to go first or not.

                    Multi-utility NFTs expand on the functionality of collectible NFTs serving as rewards, security access and UX interfaces. Learn more. 
                

We all watched: most of us with slight disbelief, some even jumped in, when the NFT market exploded with profile pictures (PFPs) of apes, punks and pixel art. For a brief moment, to a select group, they represented status, access and identity in the digital world. But the hype faded pretty fast, begging the question: What's next for NFTs?

A solid answer emerged, and I think we can all agree that NFT utility is a meaningful proposition.

Multi-utility NFTs expand on the function of early NFT releases. NFTs now have the capability to be community tools operating as a security token that offers future governance rights and early access to integrations, in addition to revenue sharing. NFTs are also being used as the user experience layer of Web3.    

Communities quickly tired of speculative assets that do little more than decorate a wallet or signal membership. The next generation of NFTs isn't about flexing — it's about function. People want tokens that do something. They should unlock real value for the holder.

NFTs are not dying — they're maturing. As the space evolves, tokens that do nothing are being replaced by those that unlock something.

 

The nascent NFTs generally offered three main features:

Because NFTs use blockchain technology, this creates a tamper-proof record of who owns the asset. This ensures the provenance and authenticity of items. Yes, someone could copy/paste your JPEG, but only one Web3 wallet can demonstrate ownership. From digital art to collectibles, or, if backed by a solid audit layer, even real-world goods, can be verified, helping to combat counterfeiting and fraud.

NFTs are often issued in limited quantities, introducing scarcity. By controlling supply, creators can make assets more desirable and potentially more valuable, similar to how limited-edition physical items are prized by collectors.

From the outset, it was clear that NFT projects were focused on fostering active communities by offering holders exclusive benefits, such as access to special events, private groups, or unique experiences. This sense of belonging and direct engagement with creators or brands is a major draw for many NFT-as-JPEG enthusiasts.

Over time, more and more utility has been added to these on-chain JPEGs to the point they bear little resemblance to their distant ancestors. 

Pudgy Penguins is a great example of a community-based project that went beyond the flex. Holders of the Pudgy NFT received significant airdrops, most notably the PENGU token. For example, in December 2024, each holder was given 1.7 million PENGU tokens, which at peak resale value could be worth over $100,000 per NFT. 

Pudgy Penguins embraced a multi-utility approach evolving beyond being a collectible-plus gang, blending financial rewards, community engagement, physical goods and gaming — all within a single NFT ecosystem.

And that's only the start. More NFTs have emerged offering meaningful utility. What's particularly interesting is that when revenue share becomes part of the utility set, then NFTs start to look a lot more like shares.

For example, NodeOps recently launched UNO, a utility NFT designed to unlock rewards, perks and access to decentralized compute infrastructure. UNO holders didn't just buy a JPEG, they invested in a security token. This means that, should the cloud compute business continue to be revenue-positive, they will extract a revenue share every quarter. Furthermore, given that this is a multi-utility NFT, the holders get boosted incentives, future governance rights, and early access to integrations across partner protocols — those perks common to the old guard NFTs.

This initiative is now closed, with the NFT no longer available to buy, but the community response was enthusiastic. It's clear that developers, compute providers, and compute consumers weren't in it for another collectible. They need credentials and benefits they can use in the real (and virtual) work they do every day.

Most importantly for NodeOps, fundraising by selling an NFT side-stepped having to publicly list a token in the troubled market conditions they faced (those being a 21 percent drop in the crypto market cap over the previous quarter. And by locking the NFT to the minting wallet for a year, the NFT's price was protected from the current economic headwinds to gamble on a brighter future.

Utility NFTs are more than just functional tokens. They blur the line between front-end UX and back-end logic, acting as both identity, access, and reward mechanisms in one portable object. Utility NFTs are evolving into smart, user-centric interfaces — they're becoming the user experience layer of Web3. 

More on BlockchainIs Crypto Finally Headed in the Right Direction?

 

Over the next year, I believe we'll see more and more projects releasing NFTs that offer real-world value, not just loyalty points and early access, but access to revenue. NFTs are starting to look a lot more like owning a share than a JPEG.

PFPs had their moment, and they will always have their fans, but the dominant narrative is shifting. Utility is no longer a “nice to have.” It's the default expectation. More than that, I think the era of defining what “type” of utility an NFT offers may already be over: here's to a new era of the multi-utility NFT.

Walmart and Amazon are actively exploring the issuance of their own stablecoins, a move that could upend the traditional payments ecosystem and potentially save these retail giants billions in transaction fees, according to a report from The Wall Street Journal. Sources familiar with the matter indicate that other large multinationals, including Expedia Group and major airlines, are also considering similar initiatives, signaling a potential shift in how high-volume merchants handle payments in the U.S.

Stablecoins — digital tokens pegged one-to-one to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar — have gained traction as a means of storing value and facilitating crypto transactions. For merchants, the appeal is clear: bypassing legacy card networks could reduce interchange fees and accelerate settlement times, especially for cross-border transactions.

The timing of these deliberations is closely tied to the legislative progress of the GENIUS Act, which is poised to become the nation's first comprehensive stablecoin law. The bill, which recently cleared a key Senate procedural vote by a 68-30 margin, aims to establish clear rules for dollar-backed stablecoins, requiring them to be fully reserved and subject to oversight by federal or state regulators. Proponents, including bill sponsor Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-TN), argue that the GENIUS Act will protect consumers, spur innovation, and strengthen the U.S. dollar's global standing.

However, the bill has become a flashpoint for broader debates over financial regulation. More than 120 amendments have been proposed, including provisions unrelated to stablecoins, such as credit card fee caps and presidential trade powers. Those additions could turn the legislation into a battleground for the future of payments. Notably, Walmart has lobbied for an amendment to introduce more competition in the credit card sector, reflecting merchants' longstanding frustration with card network fees.

PYMNTS coverage highlights that the GENIUS Act would require stablecoin issuers to maintain robust capital and liquidity buffers, comply with anti-money laundering standards, and submit regular reserve attestations. The GENIUS Act's fate remains uncertain, with a final Senate vote expected soon and House consideration to follow. Meanwhile, the digital asset sector is closely watching whether regulatory clarity will unleash a new wave of merchant-led innovation — or introduce fresh systemic risks.

As the regulatory landscape evolves, the prospect of Walmart, Amazon, and other major retailers launching stablecoins underscores the urgency for banks, FinTechs and payment providers to adapt to a rapidly changing digital economy.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has made a significant and surprising decision to publicly drop some crypto-related rule recommendations that were made when Gary Gensler was Chair. The news has sparked a range of heated reactions in the cryptocurrency world. Many people see it as a step towards a regulatory climate that is more open to new ideas and creativity.

The SEC's withdrawal includes several well-known measures that have raised concerns in the digital asset market. One of the rules that was thrown out was Exchange Act Rule 3b-16, which tried to modify the meaning of the word “exchange” to encompass a wide range of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, such as front-end interfaces, automated market makers, and even certain blockchain-based chat groups.

Another proposal that was pulled back focused on crypto custody. It originally said that investment advisers had to employ “qualified custodians,” who are regular banks or other financial organizations. Critics stated that this restriction would have kept many crypto-native companies from offering custody services, which could have limited investor choice and innovation.

Also taken out were ideas like cybersecurity disclosures and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) risk management. These would have made it harder for investment firms and tech-driven platforms in the crypto area to follow the rules.

These changes to the rules show that more people realize that the current regulatory framework, when applied to decentralized technology without discrimination, might hinder innovation and push crypto development to other countries.

The withdrawal aligns with the SEC's changing position under its new leadership. The Commission seems to be taking a more balanced approach since Gary Gensler left. This approach takes into account the distinctive structure and function of crypto technology. 

This includes a fresh focus on working together with people in the sector and the need to encourage growth within a framework that is both controlled and flexible. Instead of making broad guidelines that some said were not consistent with DeFi or blockchain innovation, the SEC is now showing that it is open to changing how it regulates.

Many people are happy that these measures are being rolled back, but this doesn't mean that regulatory scrutiny is over. The SEC is still taking action against people who break the law, and people who work in the market are still expected to follow the rules.

However, some are seeing this step as a promise to make more rules in the future that include input from the public, clearer rules, and techniques that are better suited to the nature of digital assets and decentralized networks.

The U.S. Senate voted on Wednesday to advance the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, known as the GENIUS Act, setting it up for a final floor vote in the coming days.

The legislation aims to regulate the roughly $238 billion stablecoin market, per CoinDesk data, creating a clearer framework for banks, companies and other entities to issue the digital currencies.

The bill has bipartisan support, as well as criticism from both parties, making its fate in the Senate uncertain. 

Here's what to know about what's included in the bill and how it could impact investors — even those who don't hold crypto.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is pegged to another asset, typically the U.S. dollar, which makes it less volatile than other cryptocurrencies tend to be. 

The currency is used in a number of ways, including for payments and futures trading. Since they're also more predictable than regular crypto tokens, traders also use stablecoins "to sit out times of volatility or market downturns," says Nic Puckrin, a crypto analyst, investor and founder of The Coin Bureau.

"Stablecoins are also being used increasingly in emerging markets, like Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, to hedge against monetary instability, as well as for cheap cross-border payments," he adds. 

"The use cases are very broad, and new ones are emerging all the time."

Ultimately, the GENIUS Act could make stablecoins more mainstream by bolstering trust in the currency and encouraging more competition in the market, Puckrin says.

"Right now, [the stablecoin market] is, for all intents and purposes, a duopoly. The market is nearly entirely dominated by Circle's USDC and Tether's USDT," Puckrin says.

Since the bill will create a clear pathway for banks and other entities to begin issuing stablecoins, "we'll likely see a flood of them rush into the market at the start," he says.

Big banks are gearing up to create their own coins. And while they may not all be successful, Puckrin says they will give consumers more options to find a stablecoin and issuer that works best for their needs.

Proponents say it will help safeguard investors and regulate the stablecoin market by ensuring issuers have the reserves needed to give stablecoins their value. 

"If we fail to act now, not only will these benefits slip away — we will also fall behind in global competitiveness," Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), who introduced the bill, said in the Senate on Wednesday. "Without a regulatory framework, stablecoin innovation will proliferate overseas — not in America!" 

Puckrin agrees stablecoin regulation could be a boon for the U.S. and its position in the global economy.

"Congress has also realized that instead of threatening the U.S. dollar, stablecoins can help cement its global dominance, because 99% of stablecoins are pegged to USD," he says. "With the dollar struggling to maintain its role in the global economy, the GENIUS Act could just be the thing that saves it."

Some supporters acknowledge the bill isn't perfect, but think it's better than not having regulation on stablecoins at all.

"The general outlook is that [the bill] will do better than anything that is currently happening," says Bezalel Eithan Raviv, CEO of blockchain security firm Lionsgate. 

"It's a step in the right direction for everyone. There are ways to make it better. There are ways to make everything better. But this is the first one. Let's give it a try, and it will ripple in many ways."

Critics of the GENIUS Act argue it compromises crypto's decentralization and could enable corruption, such as officials favoring specific stablecoins under new regulations.

"We need guardrails that ensure that government officials aren't openly asking people to buy their coins in order to increase their personal profit or their family's profit," Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore), who opposed the current version of the bill, said during Wednesday's session. 

"Where are those guardrails in this bill? They're completely, totally absent."

Some critics also say the bill gives too many entities the ability to create new stablecoins which could make enforcement of the regulation standards more difficult.

"As long as issuers are clearly following the rules and regulations, more competition in the stablecoin landscape is both welcome and necessary," Puckrin says.

During the GENIUS Act's passage through the House, some members sought to attach amendments, including proposals from the Credit Card Competition Act. The latter, introduced in 2023 but previously stalled, aimed to boost credit card payment competition by requiring issuers to allow more than two networks (beyond mainly Visa and Mastercard) to process transactions.

Some legislators saw enough similarities between the credit card and stablecoin marketplaces to justify adding the CCCA to the GENIUS Act, but Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) nixed that plan, fearing the CCCA's inclusion could cost votes in favor of the larger bill. 

Still, the GENIUS act could impact retailers outside of crypto, Puckrin says.

"We'll likely see stablecoins increasingly adopted as a digital alternative to the U.S. dollar, so banks, fintechs and merchants will be forced to offer stablecoin payment options," he says. "Eventually, payment networks like Visa and Mastercard will have to do so as well, which will lead to lower fees. The CCCA proposals are an inevitable evolution of the GENIUS Act. It will just take a little longer if it isn't written into law."

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is doubling down on its investment in blockchain intelligence technology, along with other investigative platforms. According to a notice of intent on a government procurement website, the Department of Homeland Security component aims to buy more technology from TRM Labs, which focuses on crypto risk management but also offers a bevy of forensics services for government clients. ICE this week also posted an intent to sole source similar technology from Chainalysis, which comes amid a series of planned purchases for other digital forensics tools. Both Chainalysis and TRM Labs have myriad contracts with federal agencies, including the FBI, the State Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. In posting its intent to single source both TRM and Chainalysis technology, ICE is indicating there is no other provider that could reasonably provide the same services.

Executives from high-tech firms Meta, OpenAI and Palantir are joining the Army Reserve at the rank of lieutenant colonel to serve in Detachment 201, a new “Executive Innovation Corps,” the service announced Friday. The move is the latest push by the department to tap into capabilities and know-how from Silicon Valley and the commercial sector. The new corps “brings top tech talent into the Army Reserve to bridge the commercial-military tech gap” and is “designed to fuse cutting-edge tech expertise with military innovation,” the Army stated in a press release. On Friday, the service is set to swear-in Meta's chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI's chief product officer Kevin Weil, Palantir's CTO Shyam Sankar and Bob McGrew, an advisor at Thinking Machines Lab who was previously OpenAI's chief research officer.

Ether (ETH) ETH$2,540.95 tumbled more than 7% over the past 24 hours, falling from a session high of $2,770.56 to as low as $2,477.71 before recovering slightly to $2,536 at press time. 

The sharp decline came amid a broad risk-off move across global markets following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian military infrastructure — a major escalation in Middle East tensions that caught investors off guard.

According to a report by CNBC, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strikes were part of a “targeted military operation” against Iran's nuclear and missile programs. Iran responded by launching around 100 drones toward Israel in retaliation. While the United States denied direct involvement, Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that America's priority was protecting its regional forces.

In response to the rising geopolitical risk, investors fled into traditional safe-haven assets. The U.S. dollar rallied 0.6% on Friday morning, reversing a three-year low from the previous day. Gold also surged to near a two-month high, while oil futures spiked as much as 13% before paring gains. The dollar's strength was particularly notable as it outperformed other safe-haven currencies like the Swiss franc and Japanese yen.

Market strategists noted that the conflict's depth and duration—especially its impact on oil — would shape investor behavior going forward. ING analysts said the dollar's rebound was significant, even if more muted than expected. Meanwhile, Bank of America's survey showed that traders remained heavily short the dollar, though conviction in that trade had not yet collapsed.

ETH's sharp move lower aligned with similar risk-asset weakness seen across equities, bonds, and commodities. While prices have steadied above the $2,530 level for now, volatility is likely to remain elevated as traders digest the unfolding geopolitical situation.

Crypto prices have plunged in the wake of Israel's airstrikes on Iran, with major altcoins taking significant hits and liquidations passing $1 billion, as markets braced themselves for Iran's response.

Ethereum has tanked 7.8% over the past 24 hours to $2,533, according to CoinGecko, while XRP dropped 3.9% to $2.13 and Solana 8.4% to $145. The best-performing assets in the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization are both stablecoins holding their peg to the U.S. dollar—never a good sign.

As a result, according to CoinGlass, $1.16 billion worth of liquidations have swept the crypto market. Leading the way is Bitcoin with $449.95 million of liquidations, followed by Ethereum at $301.92 million, and Solana at $53.46 million. The vast majority of these liquidations were long positions.

Predictors on Myriad shifted their stance on more long Bitcoin positions being liquidated on Saturday, June 14 to over 55.8%—a notable move from the near 50% odds that predictors gave the market on Thursday afternoon.

(Disclosure: Myriad Markets was created by DASTAN, the parent company of Decrypt and Rug Radio.)

Israel launched a large-scale airstrike against Iran in the early hours of Friday, with government officials claiming the country was targeting nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military commanders. Iranian state media outlets have reported several casualties, including civilians and senior officials. 

“The Zionist regime will regret its action today,” Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian tweeted, announcing a “special meeting” set to take place on how to respond. Meanwhile, Israel declared a state of emergency in anticipation of possible missile and drone attacks in response from Iran.

The crisis could also impact on the chances of a nuclear deal being struck between Iran and the United States, with predictors on Myriad now giving odds of just 4.7% for a positive outcome in the talks.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio quickly confirmed after the Israeli strikes that the U.S. was “not involved,” urging Iran not to attack U.S. personnel.

The price of Bitcoin has also declined, though not as sharply as altcoins, falling 2.2% on the day to $104,976.

Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) are considering issuing their own stablecoins in the United States, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. 

These corporate digital tokens, pegged to the U.S. dollar or other government-backed currencies, could dramatically reduce merchant fees and speed up payment settlements, disrupting the dominance of traditional financial institutions.

The move is contingent on the passage of the Genius Act, a proposed regulatory framework for stablecoins that recently passed a key procedural step in Congress. If passed, it could pave the way for large companies to adopt or issue stablecoins as an alternative to existing payment rails.

Both companies are still in early stages, exploring private coins or third-party stablecoin partnerships, the report added.

Walmart, long interested in financial services, is also lobbying for amendments that would increase credit-card competition. 

Walmart, Amazon were not immediately available for comment at press time.

 Under Pompliano's leadership, ProCapBTC would reportedly seek to raise $750 million in equity and convertible debt as part of a merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1. 

Cryptocurrency entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano is reportedly in talks to launch a new Bitcoin-buying vehicle that will seek to raise $750 million.

Pompliano is expected to become CEO of ProCapBTC, a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) that is set to merge with the publicly traded blank cheque vehicle Columbus Circle Capital 1, the Financial Times reported on Friday.

Under Pompliano's leadership, which is still under discussion, ProCapBTC would seek to raise $500 million in equity and $250 million in convertible debt as part of a merger with Columbus Circle Capital 1, backed by the Cohen & Company investment bank.

According to the FT's sources, the ProCapBTC deal could be announced next week, but its terms have not yet been finalized.

Columbus Circle Capital 1 is a blank check company formed with the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange and purchase, asset acquisition, reorganization or similar combination with one or more businesses.

In May 2025, Columbus Circle raised $250 million in an initial public offering sponsored by Cohen & Company Capital Markets (CCM), a division of Cohen & Company's broker-dealer subsidiary, JVB Financial Group.

Cohen & Company is a publicly traded investment bank listed on the New York Stock Exchange, focused on expanding the range of capital markets and asset management services. 

The bank has been active in the crypto and digital asset industry over the past few years, providing audits, tax and advisory services related to crypto assets, initial coin offerings, decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens and digital asset exchanges.

The news follows Pompliano's leadership of ProCap Acquisition, a fintech-focused SPAC that debuted on the Nasdaq in April.

ProCap's shares (PCAPU) started trading soon after its upsized IPO closed on May 21, raising $250 million in gross proceeds through the sale of 25 million units at $10 per unit.

PCAPU shares have seen a notable spike in June, surging from $10.60 on June 1 to $11.40 on Tuesday. The stock closed at $11.30 on Thursday, according to data from TradingView.



Pompliano had not confirmed the reported SPAC merger on social media by publishing time. Cointelegraph approached Pompliano for comment regarding the merger but had not received a response by the time of publication.

Blockchain is reshaping education, with universities offering specialised programmes to meet growing demand for skills in decentralised finance, tokenomics and crypto innovation

Bybit Fintech

Cryptocurrency has evolved from a niche interest to a mainstream feature of the global economy. As blockchain enters finance, logistics, healthcare and governance, companies in the fintech, consulting and cybersecurity sectors – along with traditional banks – will need experts in the technology.

Education institutions worldwide are now offering dedicated programmes on blockchain technology, meaning students no longer have to study computer science to find courses in blockchain fundamentals, tokenomics, smart contract development or decentralised finance. The skills that learners gain from these courses extend beyond simply knowing about digital assets and decentralised structures.

More people want blockchain education

Tokenomics now appears in business school curricula, economics programmes and law courses. It points out how closely digital assets are connected to innovation and the future global market. With these programmes growing in popularity, educators are starting to track market indicators and trends, such as the BTC price, as a helpful exercise for their students.

Specialised degrees, certificates and research centres for blockchain are increasingly common, demonstrating a firm focus on academic research. They offer training in programming smart contracts and using crypto wallets, as well as in the economics, rules and moral questions of decentralised systems.

Students are also learning about governance decentralisation, what makes different consensus protocols unique, and what happens to economies when centralised currency authorisation is no longer required. These aren't just theories – they are important parts of the fast-evolving industry that future professionals will influence.

Organisations take the lead

Several universities have started leading in blockchain education. Undergraduate students can find electives and those interested in master's programmes can learn about cryptocurrencies. Some institutions also allow students to gain knowledge through online courses and earn certificates remotely. Universities are also partnering with blockchain businesses, arranging crypto hackathons and establishing start-up incubators for beginner blockchain companies.

The relationship between blockchain and financial innovation is especially important to business schools. MBA students are being introduced to decentralised finance in their studies. In many universities, discussing Web 3.0 startups and their innovation potential is a norm in labs and accelerator programmes. In addition to learning about blockchain, students can use it to start the next group of technology-driven companies.

Blockchain literacy as a new essential skill

As blockchain is adopted in more mainstream fields, knowing how to use decentralised systems will be essential. Educational bodies know that blockchain's effects will extend beyond tech and finance. It is expected to play a role in every sphere, supporting agriculture in managing supply chains and securing healthcare data. Because of this, new programmes have appeared that bring together students in law, engineering, economics and policy to explore blockchain from their own fields.

Students are graduating ready to incorporate blockchain and decentralised approaches into their fields of interest. Smart contracts, decentralised applications and updated regulations are now all possible because training is available to support these areas.

Applications and real-world use

In addition to educating the next generation of blockchain experts, academic institutions are developing research and ideas for the blockchain industry. More universities are conducting and publishing research on blockchain capacity, cryptocurrency trading and how decentralisation benefits society.

More frequent partnerships with private organisations are also happening. Firms working with blockchain are investing in research centres, sponsoring student efforts and employing graduates from such programmes. The involvement of industry means teaching is timely and aligned with what employers seek.

Institutions are introducing their own tokens for campus use, testing blockchain ID systems for students and trying DAO systems to govern student councils. This technology makes educational spaces a place to experiment with blockchain.

A modern and creative revolution in education

Introducing cryptocurrency and blockchain education in colleges and universities is an essential change to our future education system. It means that people see blockchain as more than a fad; it is transforming the methods we use for establishing value and trust in the new digital space.

As programmes in this field expand, they will produce trained professionals and influence the systems, rules and inventions that advance the field of decentralisation. Those learning about blockchain today might design the future of money systems, government methods and standard technology rules.

Special purpose education reflects a shift in how academia prepares to lead change in the crypto field.

According to recent technical analysis, Ethereum (ETH) may be gearing up for a major breakout that could propel the cryptocurrency close to the $4,200 mark. Meanwhile, ETH continues to attract growing institutional interest, with Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) outperforming their Bitcoin (BTC) counterparts.

Ethereum Headed For A Breakout?

In a recent X post, noted crypto analyst Titan of Crypto highlighted that ETH is climbing within a massive weekly broadening wedge structure. The analyst shared the following chart and suggested that ETH could be targeting the $4,200 level – marking the top of the wedge.

For the uninitiated, a broadening wedge is a chart pattern characterized by diverging trendlines, where price makes higher highs and lower lows, forming a megaphone-like shape. It typically indicates increasing market volatility and can signal a potential breakout, with the direction depending on the prevailing trend and breakout confirmation.

Fellow crypto analyst Master of Crypto echoed a similar outlook, stating that ETH is “setting up for a big move,” especially with over $2.2 billion in short positions clustered near the $3,000 level.

If Ethereum breaks above $3,000, it could trigger a short squeeze, potentially accelerating ETH's rally. At the time of writing, ETH is trading 43.7% below its all-time high (ATH) of $4,878, recorded in November 2021.

Capital flows also indicate rising institutional interest in Ethereum. Crypto market commentator Ted Pillows recently pointed out that spot ETH ETFs attracted $240.3 million in inflows yesterday, compared to $164.6 million for spot BTC ETFs.

The stronger performance of ETH ETFs suggests that capital may be rotating from Bitcoin to Ethereum. It's worth noting that while BTC is up 54% since June 2024, ETH is still down 24.6% during the same period.

Crypto trader Merlijn the Trader shared the following monthly BTC/ETH chart showing two consecutive red candles, signaling a potential shift in momentum as BTC weakens relative to ETH. The trader noted that a similar capital rotation in 2020 preceded a “monster altseason.”

Things Look Positive For ETH

While altcoins like Solana (SOL), Tron (TRX), and SUI created fresh ATHs in 2024, ETH's performance did not live up to expectations. As a result, the broader sentiment in the Etheruem ecosystem took a hit.

However, 2025 appears to be ushering in a more favorable outlook. On-chain data reveals that ETH faces no major resistance until the $3,417 level.

Additionally, ETH recently flashed a golden cross on the daily chart – a bullish technical signal that could indicate an impending rally. At press time, ETH trades at $2,756, down 1.7% in the past 24 hours.

The broader cryptocurrency market risk-off sentiment, as Israel confirms attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, triggers a wave of profit booking among top coins, leading to Bitcoin (BTC) edging lower by nearly 2% at press time on Friday. With the market leader under pressure, the top altcoins Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Dogecoin (DOGE) have declined by nearly 10% in the last 24 hours, while XRP (XRP) has recorded a 6% drop during the same period. 

As the crypto market trades in the red, Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), Ethena (ENA), and Lido DAO (LDO) rank the chart with a pullback of nearly 20% in the last 24 hours. 

Bitcoin trades in the red on Friday at press time, briefly dropping under $103,000 to $102,664. With the third consecutive bearish candle, BTC erases the recovery earlier this week and is down nearly 2% so far this week.

Bitcoin marks a short-term recovery as it bounces off the high-demand zone, marked in a green band, above $102,000 and the rising 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $104,458. This creates a minor shadow in the intraday candle, projecting recovery chances later in the day. 

 The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) indicates a failed bullish reversal, as it reverses from its signal line without crossing above it. With the resurgence of bearish histograms, the indicator suggests a pullback phase is underway. 

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 45 steps under the halfway level indicates a loss in bullish momentum. As RSI edges lower towards the oversold zone, it warns of further downside. 

A daily close under the 50-day EMA at $104,458 could violate the support zone above $102,000. In such a case, sidelined investors could find an entry opportunity with $100,372, the 30-day lowest trading price, as the next immediate support. 

BTC/USDT daily price chart.

However, a recovery later in the day, as Bitcoin upholds the 50-day EMA, could result in a consolidation move before taking a recovery run towards the all-time high of $111,980. 

Fartcoin marks its third consecutive bearish day, reversing from Wednesday's high at $1.53. Crossing below its 50-day EMA at $1.13, the meme coin is down by over 10% to $1.09 at press time on Friday. 

The momentum indicator suggests a sharp surge in bearish momentum as the RSI at 45 drops below the halfway line and the MACD nears crossing below its signal line. 

The immediate support lies at $0.92, marked by the low on May 7, if it breaks below the $1 psychological support level.   

FARTCOIN/USDT daily price chart.

A reversal above $1.36 will nullify the downfall and could result in a surge towards the Wednesday high at $1.53. 

Ethena prolongs the lower high trend with the recent reversal from $0.37 on Wednesday. With an over 20% drop in the last three days, ENA tests the support level at $0.28, marked by a low last Thursday. 

The momentum indicators on the daily chart show a similar bearish momentum surge to other coins. The MACD indicator drops below its signal line while the RSI at 41 nears the oversold zone. 

A closing below $0.28 could test the lowest 30-day trading price at $0.25. 

ENA/USDT daily price chart.

A reversal above $0.30 could pause the steep correction, potentially leading to a sideways trend. 

LDO fails to close above the $1 psychological resistance level despite the breakout of a long-awaited resistance trendline in the daily chart. Closing below the 50-day EMA, the altcoin retests the broken trendline. 

The MACD indicator drops towards its signal line for a bearish crossover as the bullish histograms decline. The RSI indicator drops under the halfway level at 44, projecting a sudden decline in bullish momentum. 

If the downtrend extends, it could test the $0.74 support level marked by a low on May 6.

However, a reversal above could trend towards the $1 psychological level.

XRP comes under immense pressure, falling toward $2.09 as Israel and Iran escalate conflict. Ripple and the SEC file a joint motion requesting the release of $125 million held in escrow.

The cryptocurrency market has been hit by a sudden wave of extreme volatility, triggering widespread declines as global markets react to tensions between Israel and Iran.

Sui (SUI) edges lower by over 5% at press time on Friday, concurrent with the broader crypto market crash due to the escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran.

Bitcoin price edges below $105,000 on Friday after falling 4% over the last two days. Market sentiment sours as conflict in the Middle East escalates, with over $1.15 billion in liquidation across crypto markets.

Bitcoin (BTC) tumbled to a low of $101,095 on Friday amid volatility in the market. The effect of the tussle between United States (US) President Donald Trump and Tesla Chief Elon Musk negatively influenced the NASDAQ and Tesla's stock price on Thursday, although both are recovering on Friday.

A lightsail built in one day could travel at 20 percent the speed of light. That shouldn't be possible.

Here's what you'll learn when you read this story:

To travel beyond our solar system to destinations like Alpha Centauri, our nearest neighboring star system, it would take many human lifetimes with current technology. But what if this could be accomplished in just a fraction of a human lifetime instead? That's the dream behind the Breakthrough Initiatives' Starshot project. It began in 2016 and aims to design small, lightweight spacecraft powered by light that can reach Alpha Centauri in just over 20 years. 

If this type of machine comes to fruition, it will vastly outpace today's fastest spacecraft, like the Helios probes that NASA and West Germany collaborated on in the 1970s. Those older probes would take nearly 20,000 years to travel 4.4 light years (roughly 25 trillion miles) to Alpha Centauri, scientists estimate. But a new featherweight probe would give scientists unprecedented access to the farthest reaches of space, allowing them to capture close-up images of stellar objects like exoplanets for the first time in history, says Harry Atwater, Ph.D., a professor of applied physics and materials science at the California Institute of Technology. Formerly, Atwater was the lightsail research director for Breakthrough Starshot; he is continuing this work independently at Caltech.

“There's a lot of really transformative work going on in astronomy right now using large telescopes [. . .] to do remote observations of distant stars and exoplanets,” Atwater says. “But there are certainly new things that we [can] learn as a result of actually going to them.” 

To travel very far in space, you have to travel fast; to travel fast, you need to be very light. One way to lighten your spacecraft is to do away with rocket fuel altogether and rely on a type of weightless fuel instead: light. 

For this project, scientists supporting Breakthrough Starshot are working to develop what they call a “photon engine.” If successful, the device will create a powerful light beam that can propel a swarm of future Starshot craft into deep space. This may seem counterintuitive at first, because the light from an everyday laser pointer or flashlight could never propel a feather let alone a spacecraft. But when scaled to high enough intensities, a laser beam can act similarly to wind propelling a sailboat across water. 

This works because a beam of light is composed of photons, which are weightless subatomic particles that carry momentum—essentially the smallest possible particles of light. When these photons strike a special type of spacecraft, called a lightsail, this momentum is felt as a push. The goal of the photon engine is to concentrate enough laser power to give a spacecraft a sustained push over the course of 10 minutes that is powerful enough to accelerate it to speeds a fraction of the speed of light—one-fifth to be exact.

These lasers would be ground-based, Atwater explains, and would take up the space of a large solar farm. Instead of absorbing solar power, the panels would be composed of many densely packed lasers that can emit 45 watts each. To picture how bright a single laser would be, imagine the luminosity of a light bulb shooting out from the end of a small laser pointer, Atwater says. 

He stresses that this photon engine would not be hazardous to unsuspecting passersby or create a threat to national security in the form of a weapon. 

“If you were flying in an airplane above [the laser field] within the Earth's atmosphere, you would experience something that would be roughly a few times higher than theintensity of sunlight, but not enough to burn yourself,” Atwater says. “The intensity is very high at the point where [the lasers] are focused, but it's not focused [with]in the Earth's atmosphere.”

To achieve the kind of acceleration that these craft will need to reach an interstellar target like Alpha Centauri in just about 20 years, they not only need a strong power source like a souped-up laser beam, but also must weigh no more than 1 gram per component—that includes the lightsail itself and a microchip payload. (For reference, one penny is 2.5 grams.) 

The target size for the sail is roughly 109 square feet, so it must be very, very thin to keep the weight down, says Richard Norte, Ph.D., an associate professor of microsystems engineering at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. In this case, the sail must be about 200 nanometers thick, which is a thousand times thinner than a human hair. 

Building these types of sails is a daunting task that can be expensive and time intensive. In recent work published in the journal Nature Communications in March 2025, Norte and his collaborators were looking to solve those issues. To do so, the team used AI optimization techniques to design a scalable lightsail that could be manufactured in just one day and at a fraction of the standard cost. 

One key advantage of this new design is the shape of the small holes that are etched into the sail itself, Norte says. The holes are meant to enhance reflectivity and the efficient use of light. “The two main things that we were going for, performance and cost, don't necessarily go hand in hand,” Norte says. “This is where the machine learning algorithm had to make choices about what to do, and what it came up with was something that looked like a bunch of potatoes.” 

This shape was confusing to him at first, but Norte and the research team later realized that it imitates a 200-year-old tiling technique called a pentagonal lattice. Altogether, this design made it possible to manufacture the sails more quickly and more cheaply without sacrificing much performance.

After nearly a decade of work, a full-fledged photon engine is still far from reality, but Atwater says scientists have worked out most of the technical kinks. Meanwhile, the research lab Hamamatsu Photonics in Japan is testing prototypes of the individual lasers. Still, actually launching these craft into interstellar space remains a distant goal. 

For now, Norte is looking forward to the local pit stops this technology might make along the way.

“With the sails we're making, it would take us maybe about 32 hours to get to Mars,” he says. “I'm even a little bit more excited about this than I am about interstellar stuff, because I feel like this is possible with what we have today.”

Metrics details

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB), results in more human mortality than any other single pathogen, in part because of the lack of an effective vaccine. Although T cells are essential for immunity to TB, the mechanisms that provide protective immunity are poorly understood. In this Review, we describe current gaps in our knowledge about T cell-mediated immune responses to M. tuberculosis and discuss how recent technologies, including multiphoton intravital microscopy, spatial multiomics and high-resolution in vivo analyses of cell–cell interactions, may be used to gain insights that can inform the design of T cell-targeted TB vaccines.

Inhibiting IDO activity in tuberculomas in macaques induces the reorganization of the granulomata, with T cells otherwise present in the peripheral region of lesions being able to gain greater access to the core region. This can potentially improve TB control by enhancing immune-mediated control and reducing bacterial burden and pathology.

Quantum Computers Simulate Particle 'String Breaking' in a Physics Breakthrough

Physicists are a step closer to using quantum computers for simulations that are beyond the ability of any ordinary computers

Subatomic particles such as quarks can pair up when linked by ‘strings' of force fields — and release energy when the strings are pulled to the point of breaking. Two teams of physicists have now used quantum computers to mimic this phenomenon and watch it unfold in real time.

The results, described in two Nature papers on June 4, are the latest in a series of breakthroughs towards using quantum computers for simulations that are beyond the ability of any ordinary computers.

“String breaking is a very important process that is not yet fully understood from first principles,” says Christian Bauer, a physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California. Physicists can calculate the final results of particle collisions that form or break strings using classical computers, but cannot fully simulate what happens in between. The success of the quantum simulations is “incredibly encouraging,” Bauer says.

Each experiment was conducted by an international collaboration involving academic and industry researchers — one team at QuEra Computing, a start-up company in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and another at the Google Quantum AI Lab in Santa Barbara, California.

The researchers using QuEra's Aquila machine encoded information in atoms that were arranged in a 2D honeycomb pattern, each suspended in place by an optical ‘tweezer'. The quantum state of each atom — a qubit that could be excited or relaxed — represented the electric field at a point in space, explains co-author Daniel González-Cuadra, a theoretical physicist now at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Madrid. In the other experiment, researchers encoded the 2D quantum field in the states of superconducting loops on Google's Sycamore chip.

The teams used diametrically opposite quantum-simulation philosophies. The atoms in Aquila were arranged so that the electrostatic forces between them mimicked the behaviour of the electric field, and continuously evolved towards their own states of lower energy — an approach called analogue quantum simulation. The Google machine was instead used as a ‘digital' quantum simulator: the superconducting loops were made to follow the evolution of the quantum field ‘by hand', through a discrete sequence of manipulations.

In both cases, the teams set up strings in the field that effectively acted like rubber bands connecting two particles. Depending on how the researchers tuned the parameters, the strings could be stiff or wobbly, or could break up. “In some cases, the whole string just dissolves: the particles become deconfined,” says Frank Pollmann, a physicist at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Garching, Germany, who helped to lead the Google experiment.

Although simulating strings in a 2D electric field could have applications for studying the physics of materials, it is still a long way from fully simulating high-energy interactions, such as those that occur in particle colliders, which are in 3D and involve the much more complex strong nuclear force. “We do not have a clear path at this point how to get there,” says Monika Aidelsburger, a physicist at the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Munich, Germany.

Still, the latest results are exciting, and progress in quantum simulation in general has been “really amazing and very fast,” Aidelsburger says.

Last year, Bauer and his LBNL colleague Anthony Ciavarella were among the first teams to simulate the strong nuclear force on a quantum computer. Approaches that replace qubits with qudits — which can have more than two quantum states and can be more realistic representations of a quantum field — could also make simulations more powerful, researchers say.

Tectonic Plates Can ‘Infect' One Another with Earth-Shaking Subduction Zones

Evidence from Earth's deep past suggests dramatic subduction zones can spread like a contagion

Subduction zones, where one tectonic plate dives underneath another, drive the world's most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis. How do these danger zones come to be? A study in Geology presents evidence that subduction can spread like a contagion, jumping from one oceanic plate to another—a hypothesis previously difficult to prove.

This result “is not just speculation,” says University of Lisbon geologist João Duarte, who was not involved in the research. “This study builds an argument based on the geological record.”

Because subduction drags crust deep into the earth, its beginnings are hard to examine. The new study provides a rare ancient example of potential subduction “infection.” Its authors say they've discovered evidence that neighboring collisions triggered East Asia's “Ring of Fire,” a colossal subduction system currently fueling earthquakes and volcanoes from Alaska to the southern Indian Ocean.

Nearly 300 million years ago China was a scattering of islands separated by the ancient Tethys and Asian oceans. Established subduction zones consumed these oceans, welding the landmasses into a new continent and raising mountains from Turkey to China. By 260 million years ago this subduction seems to have spread and begun pulling down the neighboring Pacific plate.

“The dying act of those closing oceans may have been to infect the Pacific plate and start it subducting westward under the Asian continent,” says study lead author Mark Allen, a geologist at Durham University in England. “In one form or another, it's been diving down ever since.”

The smoking gun in this case is the “Dupal anomaly,” identified by a geochemical fingerprint from the ancient Tethys Ocean and what is now the Indian Ocean. When the study authors unexpectedly found this signature in volcanic rocks from the western Pacific, they surmised that material from the Tethys had spread eastward across a plate boundary from one subduction zone to another—triggering the neighboring plate's descent. “It's like seeing someone's fingerprint at a crime scene,” Allen says.

But the mechanism of spread remains mysterious. The researchers suspect that transform faults—boundaries where plates slide past one another, like the San Andreas Fault—may act as weak spots where slight changes in collision angle or speed can destabilize dense oceanic crust, causing it to sink. Duarte compares the scenario to aluminum foil in water. “The foil floats,” he says, “but the slightest tap will cause it to sink.”

If subduction spreads this way, could the Atlantic Ocean's relatively quiet plate margins be next? The massive 1755 Lisbon earthquake hints at early subduction invasion there. Duarte suggests parts of Iberia and the Caribbean are undergoing this process's initial stages: “In another 100 million years a new Atlantic ‘Ring of Fire' may form—just as it once did in the Pacific.”

Using advanced single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and a widely used preclinical model for Alzheimer's disease, researchers from Mass General Brigham and collaborators at SUNY Upstate Medical University have identified specific brain cell types that responded most to exercise. These findings, which were validated in samples from people, shed light on the connection between exercise and brain health and point to future drug targets. Results are published in Nature Neuroscience.

"While we've long known that exercise helps protect the brain, we didn't fully understand which cells were responsible or how it worked at a molecular level," said senior author Christiane D. Wrann, DVM, PhD, a neuroscientist and leader of the Program in Neuroprotection in Exercise at the Mass General Brigham Heart and Vascular Institute and the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. "Now, we have a detailed map of how exercise impacts each major cell type in the memory center of the brain in Alzheimer's disease."

The study focused on a part of the hippocampus -- a critical region for memory and learning that is damaged early in Alzheimer's disease. The research team leveraged single-nuclei RNA sequencing, a relatively new technologies that allow researchers to look at activity at the molecular level in single cells for an in-depth understanding of diseases like Alzheimer's.

The researchers exercised a common mouse model for Alzheimer's disease using running wheels, which improved their memory compared to the sedentary counterparts. They then analyzed gene activity across thousands of individual brain cells, finding that exercise changed activity both in microglia, a disease-associated population of brain cells, and in a specific type of neurovascular-associated astrocyte (NVA), newly discovered by the team, which are cells associated with blood vessels in the brain. Furthermore, the scientist identified the metabolic gene Atpif1 as an important regulator to create new neurons in the brain. "That we were able to modulate newborn neurons using our new target genes set underscores the promise our study," said lead author Joana Da Rocha, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow working in Dr. Wrann's lab.

To ensure the findings were relevant to humans, the team validated their discoveries in a large dataset of human Alzheimer's brain tissue, finding striking similarities.

"This work not only sheds light on how exercise benefits the brain but also uncovers potential cell-specific targets for future Alzheimer's therapies," said Nathan Tucker, a biostatistician at SUNY Upstate Medical University and co-senior of the study. "Our study offers a valuable resource for the scientific community investigating Alzheimer's prevention and treatment."

This New Map of Nearby Stars May Solve a Cosmic Mystery

A near-complete census of our interstellar neighborhood hopes to answer how stars, brown dwarfs and rogue planets form throughout the universe

By Phil Plait edited by Lee Billings

Newborn stars set gas clouds aglow in this mosaic of images from the James Webb Space Telescope. This is the star-forming region NGC 1333, located some 960 light-years from Earth; a census of stars much closer to our solar system is revealing new details about how this and other stellar nurseries across the universe manufacture stars.

I don't think it's overly poetic to say that stars are how we know the universe.

When we look out at the night sky, stars are overwhelmingly what we see—thousands of them, ranging from Sirius, the brightest in the night sky, to ones so dim they are known by mere catalog designations instead of names.

And for every star we can see by eye in our sky, telescopes can see millions more. Astronomers study them to understand the shape, size, structure, history, and fate of our galaxy and use them to gauge the distances and behavior of other galaxies. Even when studying exoplanets, we need to understand their host stars to make sense of these alien worlds. The heavier elements making up our planet and even our body were forged in stars long ago, and our own sun is a star, of course—so in a very real sense, to study stars is to study ourselves.

Yet for all that, some basic questions about stars remain unanswered. While we have a pretty decent grasp of how individual stars are born, there are still gaps in our knowledge of their statistics en masse.

One of my favorite unanswered questions concerns the most fundamental properties of stars as a group, which is how different kinds are born out of a gas cloud. Say you have a giant gas cloud that is busily manufacturing stars. As a percentage, how many of them will be like the sun? How many will be feeble red dwarfs, how many will be massive blue beasts, and how many will be so low in mass that they will straddle the line between a true star and a planet? The mass of a star—how much matter is in it—determines most of its properties, including its temperature, color, brightness, evolution and even its destiny, so this is something astronomers are very keen to understand. Understanding stars' distribution in our galaxy tells us about the galaxy itself, much like poring over the contents of a construction kit offers insights about the finished product and the way it's assembled.

The “initial mass function” is the technical term for this unresolved question of stellar demographics. And in theory, it's not too hard to answer: just observe a bunch of stars, determine their masses and then figuratively put them into the proper box.

In practice, though, it's very difficult indeed. Massive stars are bright and easy to spot. We can't, however, see small, dim ones if they are very far away—which means our cosmic census of low-mass stars is largely limited to whatever happens to be relatively near our solar system. Still, given time, these stars mix pretty well throughout the galaxy, so we can assume such fainter stellar next-door neighbors are representative of the galaxy at large.

Still, to give you an idea of just how hard this undertaking is, after millennia of astronomical observations, the first nearly complete tally of all stars out to a distance of about 65 light-years only appeared—in 2024! Published by a huge team of astronomers, the paper, which was published in the Astrophysical Journal, is a sprawling description of the Herculean effort involved.

Performing the survey in the first place required using several space- and ground-based astronomical observatories. The European Space Agency's Milky Way–mapping Gaia mission was chief among them, and it pinned down key data for most of the bright stars within the requisite 65 light-years. For lower-mass stars, which shine brightest in infrared, Gaia's observations were augmented by data from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer and the Spitzer Space Telescope.

Such stellar dim bulbs are critical for determining the lowest-mass end of the initial mass function. Brown dwarfs, which are objects of intermediate mass between planets and stars, give off essentially no visible light and can only be detected in the infrared. The first brown dwarfs were only found in the 1990s. And in general, these objects are so dim that even nearby ones can elude detection. Luhman 16 is a binary brown dwarf system just 6.5 light-years from the sun—the third closest system to us—yet was only discovered in 2013.

After carefully teasing out the details of objects confirmed to be within the 65 light-year region, the study team found a total of approximately 3,000 stars and 600 brown dwarfs. Right away this is a remarkable finding. I'm used to thinking on much larger spatial scales, so finding 3,600 objects within a mere 65 light-years of the sun is more than I'd have guessed. Mind you, our Milky Way galaxy is a flat disk 120,000 light-across, which is roomy enough for hundreds of billions of stars and other celestial citizenry.

The astronomers were careful to note that their survey wasn't complete at the low-mass end, either. Brown dwarfs cooler than about 325 degrees Celsius are so faint that our current technology can't directly see them beyond about 50 light-years. Also, some brighter brown dwarfs may still be hiding in crowded parts of the sky, such as the star-rich disk of the galaxy. There could also be smaller binary companions to some stars that have gone undiscovered.

What that means is that some brown dwarfs have likely been undercounted, which is actually pretty problematic for trying to determine the full range of object masses spawned in galactic gas clouds. Think of it this way: if you smash a rock with a hammer, you're likely to get one or two big pieces, a dozen or two midsize ones, hundreds of small chunks and thousands or tens of thousands of tiny grains. If you don't count all the grains, you can't really know how the size of the debris is distributed.

Still, this new, best-yet census of our interstellar neighborhood does extend our understanding of the initial mass function. Before, it wasn't clear if objects had a mass cutoff at the lower end. We know that gas clouds in stellar nurseries have to form clumps that collapse under their own gravity and that these clumps become stars. Is there a limit to how small a clump can be to collapse? Possibly, but until brown dwarfs were discovered and counted, we weren't sure they could even form like stars do. What the census finds is that the number of objects formed generally increases as mass decreases, as expected, much like the debris distribution from a hammer-struck rock. But the census does reveal some quirks: the tally of objects flattens out a bit as mass descends from the stellar regime to brown dwarfs but then starts rising again at lower, more planetary-scale masses. Does it flatten out again at some lower mass, such as around a few times that of Jupiter? That's for future telescopes to determine.

Still, this survey is a big step forward. Extrapolating it to the Milky Way and other galaxies will help us understand how galaxies behave—and how they change their behavior over time, churning out different mixes of stars as they age. The confidence we have in our scientific knowledge depends on each link in the chain, so the better we determine the initial mass function, the better we will comprehend the universe.

This Ant Has a Sting Worse Than a Fire Ant's—Here's How to Avoid It

The Asian needle ant looks ordinary, but its sting can be worse than a fire ant's and can be dangerous for anyone who has experienced anaphylaxis

Warnings of a potentially dangerous invasive ant have popped up on news sites and social media this week. You'd be forgiven for thinking a new threat had arrived. But this insect, the Asian needle ant (Brachyponera chinensis), is no newcomer—just a master of remaining inconspicuous.

The ant is getting attention after University of Georgia (UGA) entomologist Dan Suiter issued a warning that its sting can be remarkably painful and sometimes cause a serious allergic reaction called anaphylaxis. The ant is not new or spreading any faster than it used to, Suiter says. Rather, as a UGA Cooperative Extension entomologist, he's been getting calls about people being stung by the ant and needing hospital care. With summer in full swing, the insect is active, and people are likely to be in the woods or in their gardens where they might encounter it, prompting Suiter to raise awareness of the species.

“By this time last year, I had fielded three calls of people who had been stung by an Asian needle ant—they knew it was an Asian needle ant—and suffered anaphylaxis,” Suiter says. The problem, he adds, is that the insect is small, black and nondescript. “You're not thinking that ‘this tiny little creature right here could have consequences if it stung me.'”

The Asian needle ant is native to Japan, Korea and China. It arrived in the U.S. around or before the 1930s, probably in ships carrying plants and livestock “before we even realized that is a great way to spread things around,” says Theresa Dellinger, a diagnostician at the Insect Identification Lab at Virginia Tech. It's not clear precisely where the ant has spread within the U.S., but it's plentiful in the Southeast and appears to range as far north as Massachusetts, according to sightings on the community science app iNaturalist. It's not often seen farther west than Missouri, probably because it's not well-adapted to arid conditions, Dellinger says.

Studies have found that when Asian needle ants move into an area, they outcompete native ants, reducing ant diversity.

These ants don't lay down pheromone trails to lead their colony to food, so you won't see them marching in a line like the little black ant (Monomorium minimum). Instead, when an Asian needle ant finds food, it will return to its colony, pick up another worker and physically carry it to the jackpot, says Christopher Hayes, an entomologist at North Carolina State University.

And unlike fire ants, Asian needle ants don't build big nest mounds. Instead they love nesting in damp wood, such as fallen logs or wet mulch. While they aren't particularly aggressive, they will sting to protect their nest, making them a danger to the home gardener.

Their sting is initially more painful than a fire ant sting, Hayes says, but also irritatingly persistent, like fiberglass under the skin. The pain can also come and go. Hayes's two-year-old son recently got a sting. The little boy was fine after a few minutes, Hayes says, but then woke up after midnight that night crying about the pain again.

In their native range, Asian needle ant bites are associated with a 2 percent risk of anaphylaxis compared with a 0.5 to 1.5 percent risk from the bites of fire ants, Hayes says.

So how should you react if you see a suspected Asian needle ant on you? Gently flick or brush it off, Hayes and Suiter say. If it does sting you, try to capture the ant for identification purposes if you can (though it will probably scurry away too quickly). If you start to experience hives, swelling of the lips or tongue or difficulty breathing, get to an emergency room because these symptoms are signs of anaphylaxis.

If you suspect you have Asian needle ants on your property, you can snap a good photograph or collect an ant or two with tweezers to submit to your county agricultural agent for identification, Suiter says. There are no centralized entities mapping out the ants' spread, but Suiter says he hopes more public attention will spur more scientific research. Identification is particularly important for those who have had allergic reactions to bee and ant stings in the past. “If people have a family member that suffers from anaphylaxis and knows it, and they carry around an Epipen,” he says, “somebody like that needs to know what this ant looks like.”

The accumulation of microplastics in the environment, and within our bodies, is an increasingly worrisome issue. But predicting where these ubiquitous particles will accumulate, and therefore where remediation efforts should be focused, has been difficult because of the many factors that contribute to their dispersal and deposition.

New research from MIT shows that one key factor in determining where microparticles are likely to build up has to do with the presence of biofilms. These thin, sticky biopolymer layers are shed by microorganisms and can accumulate on surfaces, including along sandy riverbeds or seashores. The study found that, all other conditions being equal, microparticles are less likely to accumulate in sediment infused with biofilms, because if they land there, they are more likely to be resuspended by flowing water and carried away.

The open-access findings appear in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, in a paper by MIT postdoc Hyoungchul Park and professor of civil and environmental engineering Heidi Nepf. "Microplastics are definitely in the news a lot," Nepf says, "and we don't fully understand where the hotspots of accumulation are likely to be. This work gives a little bit of guidance" on some of the factors that can cause these particles, and small particles in general, to accumulate in certain locations.

Most experiments looking at the ways microparticles are transported and deposited have been conducted over bare sand, Park says. "But in nature, there are a lot of microorganisms, such as bacteria, fungi, and algae, and when they adhere to the stream bed they generate some sticky things." These substances are known as extracellular polymeric substances, or EPS, and they "can significantly affect the channel bed characteristics," he says. The new research focused on determining exactly how these substances affected the transport of microparticles, including microplastics.

The research involved a flow tank with a bottom lined with fine sand, and sometimes with vertical plastic tubes simulating the presence of mangrove roots. In some experiments the bed consisted of pure sand, and in others the sand was mixed with a biological material to simulate the natural biofilms found in many riverbed and seashore environments.

Water mixed with tiny plastic particles was pumped through the tank for three hours, and then the bed surface was photographed under ultraviolet light that caused the plastic particles to fluoresce, allowing a quantitative measurement of their concentration.

The results revealed two different phenomena that affected how much of the plastic accumulated on the different surfaces. Immediately around the rods that stood in for above-ground roots, turbulence prevented particle deposition. In addition, as the amount of simulated biofilms in the sediment bed increased, the accumulation of particles also decreased.

Nepf and Park concluded that the biofilms filled up the spaces between the sand grains, leaving less room for the microparticles to fit in. The particles were more exposed because they penetrated less deeply in between the sand grains, and as a result they were much more easily resuspended and carried away by the flowing water.

"These biological films fill the pore spaces between the sediment grains," Park explains, "and that makes the deposited particles -- the particles that land on the bed -- more exposed to the forces generated by the flow, which makes it easier for them to be resuspended. What we found was that in a channel with the same flow conditions and the same vegetation and the same sand bed, if one is without EPS and one is with EPS, then the one without EPS has a much higher deposition rate than the one with EPS."

Nepf adds: "The biofilm is blocking the plastics from accumulating in the bed because they can't go deep into the bed. They just stay right on the surface, and then they get picked up and moved elsewhere. So, if I spilled a large amount of microplastic in two rivers, and one had a sandy or gravel bottom, and one was muddier with more biofilm, I would expect more of the microplastics to be retained in the sandy or gravelly river."

All of this is complicated by other factors, such as the turbulence of the water or the roughness of the bottom surface, she says. But it provides a "nice lens" to provide some suggestions for people who are trying to study the impacts of microplastics in the field. "They're trying to determine what kinds of habitats these plastics are in, and this gives a framework for how you might categorize those habitats," she says. "It gives guidance to where you should go to find more plastics versus less."

As an example, Park suggests, in mangrove ecosystems, microplastics may preferentially accumulate in the outer edges, which tend to be sandy, while the interior zones have sediment with more biofilm. Thus, this work suggests "the sandy outer regions may be potential hotspots for microplastic accumulation," he says, and can make this a priority zone for monitoring and protection.

The work was supported by Shell International Exploration and Production through the MIT Energy Initiative.

Metrics details

Most megaherbivores in the Americas went extinct around 10,000 years ago, presumably disrupting the long-distance seed dispersal of large, fleshy-fruited plant species. The neotropical anachronism hypothesis, proposed by Janzen and Martin, suggests that large fruits evolved in response to past selective pressures from now-extinct megafauna. While this explains many key adaptations of ‘megafaunal fruit' plants, it lacks robust palaeoecological evidence. Here we use a multiproxy approach that provides evidence of frugivory by the extinct South American proboscidean Notiomastodon platensis. Using a machine learning model that reveals the extinction effects of these megafaunal dispersers in modern ecosystems, we show how losing seed dispersal interactions increased the extinction risk of megafaunal fruit plants in regions across South America lacking smaller surrogate dispersers. Our results imply that current ecosystems may undergo further functional changes under continuing anthropogenic pressures.

Researchers at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz (JGU), the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research and the University of Texas at Austin have identified a form of molecular motion that has not previously been observed. When what are known as 'guest molecules' - molecules that are accommodated within a host molecule - penetrate droplets of DNA polymers, they do not simply diffuse in them in a haphazard fashion, but propagate through them in the form of a clearly-defined frontal wave. "This is an effect we did not expect at all," points out Weixiang Chen of the Department of Chemistry at JGU, who played a major role in the discovery. The findings of the research team have today been published in an article in the prestigious journal Nature Nanotechnology. The new insights are not only fundamental to our understanding of how cells regulate signals, but they could also contribute to the development of intelligent biomaterials, innovative types of membranes, programmable carriers of active ingredients and synthetic cell systems able to imitate the organizational complexity of the processes in living beings. Molecular wave patterns instead of conventional diffusion

It is usually the case that molecules are distributed throughout liquids by means of simple diffusion. For instance, if you add a blue dye to a glass of water, the dye gradually disperses in the liquid, forming soft, blurry color gradients. However, the observed behavior of guest molecules in DNA droplets is quite different. "The molecules move in a structured and controlled manner that is contrary to the traditional models, and this takes the form of what appears to be a wave of molecules or a mobile boundary," explains Professor Andreas Walther from JGU's Department of Chemistry, who led the research project.

The research team used droplets made up of thousands of individual strands of DNA, structures that are also known as biomolecular condensates. What is of particular interest in this connection is the fact that the properties of the droplets can be precisely determined with the help of the DNA structures and other parameters, such as the concentration of salts. Moreover, these droplets have their counterparts in biological cells, which are able to employ similar condensates to arrange complex biochemical processes without the need for membranes. "Our synthetic droplets thus represent an excellent model system with which we can simulate natural processes and come to better understand them," emphasizes Chen. Into their droplets, the researchers introduced specially designed 'guest' DNA strands that are able to specifically recognize the inner structure of the droplets and bind to them. According to the team, the intriguing motion of the guest molecules, that they have now detected for the first time, is in part attributable to the way that the added DNA and the DNA present in the droplets combine on the basis of the key-and-lock principle. This means that the surrounding material becomes less dense and no longer fixed in place, so that swollen, dynamic states develop locally. Chen adds: "The well-defined, highly concentrated front continues to move forward in a linear fashion over time, driven by chemical binding, material conversion and programmable DNA interactions. Something that is completely new when it comes to soft matter."

 New basis for understanding cellular processes 

The findings are not only relevant to providing us with a better understanding of the physics of soft matter, but also to improving our knowledge of the chemical processes that occur in cells. "This might be one of the missing pieces of the puzzle that, once assembled, will reveal to us how cells regulate signals and organize processes on the molecular level," states Walther. This would also be of interest when it comes to the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders in which proteins migrate from cell nuclei into the cytoplasm, forming condensates there. As these age, they transform from a dynamic to a more stable state and build the problematic fibrils. "It is quite conceivable that we may be able to find a way of influencing these aging processes with the aid of our new insights, so that, over the long term, an entirely new approach to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases could emerge," concludes Walther.

A group of bat viruses closely related to the deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be one small mutation away from being capable of spilling over into human populations and potentially causing the next pandemic.

A recent study published in the journal Nature Communicationsexamined an understudied group of coronaviruses known as merbecoviruses -- the same viral subgenus that includes MERS-CoV -- to better understand how they infect host cells. The research team, which included scientists at Washington State University, the California Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina, found that while most merbecoviruses appear unlikely to pose a direct threat to people, one subgroup known as HKU5 possesses concerning traits.

"Merbecoviruses - and HKU5 viruses in particular - really hadn't been looked at much, but our study shows how these viruses infect cells," said Michael Letko, a virologist at WSU's College of Veterinary Medicine who helped to spearhead the study. "What we also found is HKU5 viruses may be only a small step away from being able to spill over into humans."

During the past two decades, scientists have cataloged the genetic sequences of thousands of viruses in wild animals, but, in most cases, little is known about whether these viruses pose a threat to humans. Letko's lab in WSU's Paul G. Allen School for Global Health focuses on closing that gap and identifying potentially dangerous viruses.

For their most recent study, Letko's team targeted merbecoviruses, which have received limited attention apart from MERS-CoV, a zoonotic coronavirus first noted in 2012 that is transmitted from dromedary camels to humans. It causes severe respiratory disease and has a mortality rate of approximately 34%.

Like other coronaviruses, merbecovirusesrely on a spike protein to bind to receptors and invade host cells. Letko's team used virus-like particles containing only the portion of the spike responsible for binding to receptors and tested their ability to infect cells in the lab. While most merbecoviruses appear unlikely to be able to infect humans, HKU5 viruses - which have been found across Asia, Europe, Africa and the Middle East - were shown to use a host receptor known as ACE2, the same used by the more well-known SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. One small difference: HKU5 viruses, for now, can only use the ACE2 gene in bats, but do not use the human version nearly as well.

Examining HKU5 viruses found in Asia where their natural host is the Japanese house bat (Pipistrellus abramus), the researchers demonstrated some mutations in the spike protein that may allow the viruses to bind to ACE2 receptors in other species, including humans. Researchers on another study that came out earlier this year analyzed one HKU5 virus in China that has already been documented to have jumped into minks, showing there is potential for these viruses to cross species-barriers.

"These viruses are so closely related to MERS, so we have to be concerned if they ever infect humans," Letko said. "While there's no evidence they've crossed into people yet, the potential is there -- and that makes them worth watching."

The team also used artificial intelligence to explore the viruses. WSU postdoctoral researcher Victoria Jefferson used a program called AlphaFold 3 to model how the HKU5 spike protein binds to ACE2 at the molecular level, which could help provide a better understanding of how antibodies might block the infection or how the virus could mutate.

Up until this point, such structural analysis required months of lab work and specialized equipment. With AlphaFold, Jefferson generated accurate predictions in minutes. The results matched those recently documented by a research team that used traditional approaches.

Letko noted the study and its methods could be used for future research projects and aid in the development of new vaccines and treatments.

The research was funded through a research project grant from the National Institutes of Health. Jefferson's work was supported by an NIH T32 training grant.

Researchers at the University of California, Davis, have developed an investigational brain-computer interface that holds promise for restoring the voices of people who have lost the ability to speak due to neurological conditions.

In a new study published in the scientific journal Nature, the researchers demonstrate how this new technology can instantaneously translate brain activity into voice as a person tries to speak -- effectively creating a digital vocal tract.

The system allowed the study participant, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to "speak" through a computer with his family in real time, change his intonation and "sing" simple melodies.

"Translating neural activity into text, which is how our previous speech brain-computer interface works, is akin to text messaging. It's a big improvement compared to standard assistive technologies, but it still leads to delayed conversation. By comparison, this new real-time voice synthesis is more like a voice call," said Sergey Stavisky, senior author of the paper and an assistant professor in the UC Davis Department of Neurological Surgery. Stavisky co-directs the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab.

"With instantaneous voice synthesis, neuroprosthesis users will be able to be more included in a conversation. For example, they can interrupt, and people are less likely to interrupt them accidentally," Stavisky said.

Decoding brain signals at heart of new technology

The man is enrolled in the BrainGate2 clinical trial at UC Davis Health. His ability to communicate through a computer has been made possible with an investigational brain-computer interface (BCI). It consists of four microelectrode arrays surgically implanted into the region of the brain responsible for producing speech.

These devices record the activity of neurons in the brain and send it to computers that interpret the signals to reconstruct voice.

"The main barrier to synthesizing voice in real-time was not knowing exactly when and how the person with speech loss is trying to speak," said Maitreyee Wairagkar, first author of the study and project scientist in the Neuroprosthetics Lab at UC Davis. "Our algorithms map neural activity to intended sounds at each moment of time. This makes it possible to synthesize nuances in speech and give the participant control over the cadence of his BCI-voice."

Instantaneous, expressive speech with BCI shows promise

The brain-computer interface was able to translate the study participant's neural signals into audible speech played through a speaker very quickly -- one-fortieth of a second. This short delay is similar to the delay a person experiences when they speak and hear the sound of their own voice.

The technology also allowed the participant to say new words (words not already known to the system) and to make interjections. He was able to modulate the intonation of his generated computer voice to ask a question or emphasize specific words in a sentence.

The participant also took steps toward varying pitch by singing simple, short melodies.

His BCI-synthesized voice was often intelligible: Listeners could understand almost 60% of the synthesized words correctly (as opposed to 4% when he was not using the BCI).

Real-time speech helped by algorithms

The process of instantaneously translating brain activity into synthesized speech is helped by advanced artificial intelligence algorithms.

The algorithms for the new system were trained with data collected while the participant was asked to try to speak sentences shown to him on a computer screen. This gave the researchers information about what he was trying to say.

The neural activity showed the firing patterns of hundreds of neurons. The researchers aligned those patterns with the speech sounds the participant was trying to produce at that moment in time. This helped the algorithm learn to accurately reconstruct the participant's voice from just his neural signals.

Clinical trial offers hope

"Our voice is part of what makes us who we are. Losing the ability to speak is devastating for people living with neurological conditions," said David Brandman, co-director of the UC Davis Neuroprosthetics Lab and the neurosurgeon who performed the participant's implant.

"The results of this research provide hope for people who want to talk but can't. We showed how a paralyzed man was empowered to speak with a synthesized version of his voice. This kind of technology could be transformative for people living with paralysis."

Brandman is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurological Surgery and is the site-responsible principal investigator of the BrainGate2 clinical trial.

Limitations

The researchers note that although the findings are promising, brain-to-voice neuroprostheses remain in an early phase. A key limitation is that the research was performed with a single participant with ALS. It will be crucial to replicate these results with more participants, including those who have speech loss from other causes, such as stroke.

The BrainGate2 trial is enrolling participants. To learn more about the study, visit braingate.org or contact [email protected].

Agents of the Trump administration are increasingly using social media posts to crack down on immigrants, tourists, and even some U.S. citizens. Last month, a leaked document showed the State Department had crafted a new standard for reviewing the social media accounts of any foreign students planning to attend or even visit Harvard University. Legal immigrants may have benefits denied based on social media activity, and people expressing opinions or acting contrary to Trump are being detained at airports. Whether you're a U.S. citizen or not, it's time you reexamine how much of yourself you're willing to show publicly online.

Amid the ongoing travel turmoil that's made several countries institute warnings to foreign citizens planning trips to the U.S., I was looking for ways to make it more difficult for governments to use my social posts against me. That's when I was invited to use Block Party. It's not, by its nature, a politically charged app. With a $25 annual subscription, Block Party uses a browser plugin to help rein in your privacy settings on your various social media accounts with a simple checklist and easy-to-follow, step-by-step guides. Privatizing your social media accounts helps keep big tech from building data profiles based on your activity, which it then uses for targeted advertising, but it may not be enough to completely deter a visit from Customs and Border Protection as you muscle through airport security after coming to the States. [Editor's note: Getting thrown into another bin for targeted advertising isn't great either, but it's better than getting thrown into Guantanamo.] At the very least, it may make the jobs of federal agencies—or anybody looking for dirt on you based on your online activity—a little harder. For the time being, that might be enough to help you avoid being held up by U.S. officials for hours in an airport.

You can simply delete your profiles, but as somebody who still needs to remain active on social media, Block Party is one of the better options I've personally used to get into the weeds of my accounts' esoteric privacy settings. It even helps you find settings in some apps to keep AI from scraping your posts. Still, changing all your settings may not be enough to avoid all scrutiny. According to a Politico report on the leaked State Department document, the U.S. government imagines foreign students' lack of a social presence or privatized social media “may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant's credibility.”

The Trump administration may ascribe this same standard to U.S. citizens. Already, there are concerning examples of agents targeting supposed Trump opponents. Left-wing influencer Hasan Piker said in May that he was detained and questioned for hours by Homeland Security after he came back to Chicago from France. In April, immigration agents detained Michigan-based attorney Amir Makled at an airport for more than an hour as he returned home from the Dominican Republic. The attorney was representing Columbia University students who had protested against the war in Palestine. Makled said feds requested he hand over his phone, and after 90 minutes of questioning, he eventually complied.

The situation is growing more constrained for non-citizens traveling to the U.S. Every individual has to decide for themselves what precautions they need to take when traveling as a citizen or non-citizen alike. Sophia Cope, the senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told Gizmodo it's not an easy decision, and some people planning to visit the U.S. may be better off choosing a different destination. However, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's proclamation that privatizing social media was somehow an indication of “evasiveness,” it's still a good idea to privatize your socials before crossing the border to the U.S. And it's not just protesters who need to think long and hard about what thoughts of theirs are shared online. Nonprofit and government staff now have to consider whether their public presence necessitates drastic culling of their online profiles.

“We've definitely been seeing an uptick in interest given the activities of the government recently,” Tracy Chou, the founder and CEO of Block Party, told Gizmodo in a video interview. After Trump's inauguration, she said she's received interest from both current and former government workers from multiple federal agencies, afraid their previously innocuous social media posts could be used as ammunition for right-wing groups. Government workers weren't just trying to avoid the eyes of Trump and DOGE. Chou gave an example of people who worked in the Department of Justice's civil rights division who were trying to avoid attacks from right-wing groups online.

You can find a loose gaggle of tutorials online for turning on social media privacy settings, but even an experienced user will be surprised by just how many settings there are to limit. You may also want to look into subscriptions such as DeleteMe or Kanary, which work to eliminate information data brokers have on you and remove data from some websites. Block Party is more concerned with restricting the data big tech companies can garner from your social accounts. Privacy settings for most apps are arcane—often deliberately so—and even if you're trying to privatize an account, you can still miss something.

Block Party currently works with X, LinkedIn, Facebook, Venmo, Instagram, Reddit, Strava, YouTube, Bluesky, and Google. Additionally, Block Party will only impact the mobile versions of TikTok and Snapchat. Chou said her team is planning to support more apps in the future. The app operates as a browser plugin that offers a checklist for your social accounts. Some settings can be done for you with the tap of a button, but various settings will take some attention on your part. On LinkedIn, Block Party can automatically turn off settings to “represent company,” a sneaky setting used for sponsored ads about your employer. If I want to change the number of apps connected to my YouTube account, I have to click a link through the app and disable them manually, then mark the task as “done.”

Even using Block Party, the process of tuning all your socials is time-consuming. After you're done, you may realize how many features of these apps depend on your private data. Block Party recommends you change YouTube settings to limit viewing history. Suddenly, I can't see which videos I've watched, making it harder to return to a YouTube essay I paused before going to sleep. This is the trade-off for privacy. You simply won't be able to use your apps in the same ways you used to.

Nina Jankowicz, the cofounder of The American Sunlight Project, which advocates against online disinformation, said she has started to advise people to lock down their social media not just for the sake of avoiding targeted ads, but to keep from being targeted by the government. She said she offers Block Party free to staff, but even that may not be enough in this age, where her activities as an advocate are receiving more and more scrutiny. Jankowicz said she started bringing a burner cell phone when she travels through and to the U.S.

Beyond massaging your social accounts, travelers need to start considering device security. Turning off biometric log-in when you travel is a good start, as experts say law enforcement has less legal liability to unlock your device if they flash your Face ID at your mug. You should avoid saving WhatsApp or Messenger chats to the cloud in case government agents manage to bypass phone security. VPNs, which help hide your IP address and keep you anonymous when online, are also good to have on hand. The fact of the matter is, U.S. officials have the legal ability to detain people at the airport, but as Cope stressed, the U.S. is not legally allowed to keep citizens from entering the U.S. without probable cause. Non-violent political opinions posted to social media still don't meet grounds for an arrest just because Trump is in office. At the same time, Trump's administration has continued to ignore court decrees, and his flaunting of the law may turn on American citizens as well. For now, it's best you know your rights. Refusing to hand over a phone to officers could delay you, but you're only legally required to establish your identity, not to share your phone with anybody. Again, knowing your rights can still lead to delays.

“If there's anything remotely controversial, I would delete that post, privatize the account, or even shut down the account,” Cope said. “I want to emphasize again it's each individual person's choice, but I think for me, I'd rather not have the government have this particular data point or set of data points about me.”

The U.S. already knows what kind of chilling effect this abuse of social media has had on protest efforts. When I asked Jankowicz whether privatizing your social media can make it harder to organize, she responded bluntly: ”Yes.”

“Researchers are a lot more reticent to be on things like Signal group chats or on email chains and message boards,” she said. “The toll it takes on attempting to muster a collaborative response on anything that's happening to the community is really difficult.”

Privatizing your social media can't be a panacea for your travel anxieties, especially if you still want to use these apps to communicate with friends or organize for causes you care about. The best it can do is make a government operator's job harder, and since there are so many accounts to monitor, you may slip through the dragnet. As time goes on, Trump will rely more on technology from firms like Palantir to compile a wider database on every citizen based on government data, according to a recent report from The New York Times. Whether you use apps like DeleteMe and Block Party in tandem or you go out and prune your posts and public persona, get ready for a far more constrained online existence.

On Wednesday, United States Customs and Border Protection confirmed to 404 Media that it has been flying Predator drones over Los Angeles amid the LA protests. The military drones, a CBP statement said, “are supporting our federal law enforcement partners in the Greater Los Angeles area, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, with aerial support of their operations.”

State-level law enforcement agencies across the US use various types of drones and other vehicles, like helicopters, to conduct aerial surveillance, and other agencies use drones in their operations as well. For example, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection “doubled its use of drones” this year, according to the office of Governor Gavin Newsom, as part of efforts to combat forest fires. However, CBP's MQ-9 Reaper drones, also known as Predator B drones, are military-caliber UAVs used for aerial reconnaissance that can be armed.

In 2020, during President Donald Trump's first administration, CBP flew a Predator drone over Minneapolis during the George Floyd protests. And, in the intervening years, researchers have tracked Department of Homeland Security Predator drones flying over various US cities with no clear explanation. In the case of LA, Trump has deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines and federalized the National Guard, sending nearly 4,000 guardsmen to California over Newsom's objections. In combination with these actions, the presence of the CBP drones paints a picture of expanding federal involvement—and potentially control—over what are typically state matters.

“Military gear has been used for domestic law enforcement for a long time, but flying military gear over LA at a time when the president has sent military units against the wishes of the governor is noteworthy," says Matthew Feeney, a longtime emerging technologies researcher and advocacy manager at the nonpartisan UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch. “If the federal government portrays immigration as a national security issue, we shouldn't be surprised if it openly uses the tools of national security—i.e., military hardware—in response.”

Carrying powerful cameras and other sensors, Predator drones can record clear, detailed footage of events like protests from high altitudes.

CBP's “Air and Marine Operations (AMO) is providing aerial support to federal law enforcement partners conducting operations in the Greater Los Angeles area,” CBP told WIRED in a statement responding to questions about whether the operation over LA is routine or anomalous. “AMO's efforts are focused on situational awareness and officer safety support as requested.”

Patrick Eddington, a senior fellow in homeland security and civil liberties at the Cato Institute, warns that “the more the protests spread to other cities, the more of that kind of surveillance we'll see.”

CBP told 404 Media this week that “AMO is not engaged in the surveillance of first amendment activities.” That statement aligns with a commitment the US Department of Homeland Security made in December 2015. “Unmanned aircraft system-recorded data should not be collected, disseminated or retained solely for the purpose of monitoring activities protected by the US Constitution, such as the First Amendment's protections of religion, speech, press, assembly, and redress of grievances (e.g., protests, demonstrations),” a DHS “Privacy, Civil Rights & Civil Liberties Unmanned Aircraft Systems Working Group” wrote at the time.

In practice, though, it is unclear how the Predator surveillance could “support” ICE agents and other federal law enforcement without monitoring the protests and capturing images of protesters.

While researchers note that the use of Predator drones over LA is not unprecedented—and, at this point, perhaps not surprising—they emphasize that this pattern of activity over time only makes it more likely that the federal government will deploy such monitoring in the future, regardless of how a state is handling a situation.

“It's not new or even all that unexpected from a spooked Trump administration, but it's still a terrible use of military technology on civilian populations,” says UAV researcher Faine Greenwood. “It's basically continuing a worrying trend, but also people should be angry about it and refuse to normalize it.”

It seems like totes don't want to work these days. They're floppy, allergic to moisture, and too cool to carry actual stuff. They went vegan, then minimalist, then micro. Finding the best totes for travel shouldn't be harder than finding your gate. You want something spacious, wipeable, and tough enough to survive TSA.

These are the best totes for travel. They don't collapse under pressure, don't mind getting dirty, and, most importantly, carry your baggage (emotional or otherwise). We've schlepped them through airports, overstuffed them with travel essentials, and wedged them under seats.

For more travel bags, check out our guides to the Best Metro Totes, Best Laptop Backpacks, and Best Toiletry Bags.

Next Up

I'll be testing the Metro Tote from Monos, the Travel Tote from Béis, and the Suncatcher Daytripper Carryall Tote from Sidney Baron.

Away

Away

For business travelers and solo flyers who pack light, the Away Everywhere Tote is the one-bag solution for back-to-back meetings, red-eye flights, and weekend getaways. Made from water-resistant nylon and accented with leather trim, it was clearly designed by someone who knows the realities of travel: fumbling through security lines, sprinting to trains, dodging coffee spills. It's fashionable enough for client dinners and durable enough to store in the overhead bin or under your seat.

The dimensions are dialed in to meet most airlines' personal item requirements, and it comes in a variety of low-key tones, from coastal blue to clay pink. A full top zipper keeps your essentials secure. There's a trolley sleeve that slides over a rolling luggage handle (though be warned: it looks like the exterior zip pocket, which has caused me more than one accidental drop). Inside, a padded sleeve cradles up to a 16-inch laptop and multiple interior pockets—plus a handy key clip.

Just know this: There's no dedicated water bottle pocket, which feels like a strange omission in 2025.

L.L. Bean

L.L. Bean

L.L. Bean's Field Tote is all grit and no gimmicks: a thick, double-layered polyester shell, burly double-stitched seams, and handles that feel industrial. Inside, a thermoplastic lining shrugs off moisture, mud, and mystery goo with wipe-clean ease. It's not fully leakproof, but it's close, and that makes it perfect for hauling damp beach towels, snow-crusted boots, or a post-workout fit.

It's a single, cavernous compartment, with no fussy pockets. There's an open-top version, but we love the zip-top model for travel. WIRED director Michael Calore tested the extra-large, 53-liter version, and it's massive enough for a week's worth of produce, a couple half-gallon cartons of oat milk, and a 12-pack of hard kombucha if you're also planning on going grocery shopping during your vacation.

Longchamp

Nordstrom

Longchamp

If you're shopping for a travel tote that's as stylish as it is packable, the Longchamp Le Pliage Xtra M is a jet-setter's dream. This updated model of the best-selling Le Pliage is ideal for slipping under the seat in front of you or sightseeing through a new city. The rich leather trim and nylon body complement most outfits, and it comes in eight sophisticated shades (though the cognac brown is a standout). Spacious enough to hold your in-flight must-haves—laptop, snacks, passport, and an extra layer—and it stays pretty compact and lightweight. Best of all, it folds flat, so it's easy to tuck in your luggage.

Cincha

Cincha

This vegan leather bag is deceptively huge. The base is 7.5 inches deep, so while it doesn't look that big in pictures, it holds an astonishing amount of stuff—I've packed enough clothes in it for a full weekend trip. I usually have concerns about vegan leather cracking and breaking with use, but Cincha's soft pebbled fabric does not look or feel obviously plastic. It has stood up to several months of use being tossed in and around car trunks without getting scuffed or cracking.

It has two (two!) mesh water bottle holders in the interior, a laptop sleeve that holds a 13-inch laptop, and three interior pockets (one that zips shut). There is one exterior zip pocket that fits my iPhone for easy access. As far as carrying options go, it has two grab handles, two hidden fabric shoulder straps that tuck away into zip pockets, and my favorite accessory—two loops for the separate travel belt so you can strap it to the rest of your luggage. However, it is more than 2 pounds heavier than a Longchamp Le Pliage, so this is strictly for when you can sling it around on top of your carry-on. —Adrienne So



Cuyana (16-inch)

Cuyana (Laptop Sleeve)

The Cuyana System Tote is a modular gear-hauler that shape-shifts with your itinerary. Designed to outlast the churn of fast fashion, this travel tote starts minimal, but the genius lies in its add-ons. A laptop sleeve or insert organizer creates a structure on the go, with dedicated slots for your computer, water bottle, and other work essentials.

Instead of stitched-on straps prone to failure, the System Tote's handles are cut directly from its leather body, minimizing points of wear. The main compartment snaps shut rather than zips, something to know if you're the spill-averse type. The Classic Easy Tote ($298) offers a zippered alternative.

Modularity extends to accessories: A System Flap Bag insert doubles as a clutch or in-bag organizer, and a detachable, adjustable strap (also available in a wide model) converts the tote into a crossbody, perfect for hands-free airport sprints if you're unintentionally trying out airport theory.

BaubleBar

Baublebar (Small)

Baublebar (Medium)

Baublebar (Large)

What sets BaubleBar apart is its playful personalization. Your chosen icons (up to six depending on the size) are embroidered directly onto the canvas tote. The process is super user-friendly, with predesignated spots to help you visualize your picks. Choose from zodiac signs, cutesy foods, initials, and more. Just note that it's a final sale, so be sure of your design before ordering.

Inside, you'll find a roomy main compartment with a small interior pocket and key loop. The large size fits everything you need for a beach day trip, and the medium and small options are better for light shopping or city exploring. It closes with just a snap button, which isn't the most secure for crowded areas. The quality of the playful embroidery makes it a fun choice for travel.

Topo Designs

Topo Designs

Evo

I recently took this versatile and large tote from Topo Designs to Colorado for a long weekend as a stand-in for my ski boot bag (yes, Arapahoe Basin is still open!) after using it all winter to haul my curling gear to the club. The main compartment, which zips closed, is big enough for ski boots, gloves, and the like, and there's plenty of room to stash socks or other gear in the side pockets. Come July, this tote will make the perfect bag for my cook kit on a summer camping road trip. When you have a tote this stylish and durable the question is not whether it's coming on the trip but what you're going to use it for. —Martin Cizmar

For the first time in decades, active-duty US Marines are rolling into Los Angeles—not for disaster relief or training drills, but to guard federal buildings during a protest crackdown that legal experts say threatens long-standing limits on military power at home.

The deployment, announced by President Donald Trump on Monday, involves more than 700 Marines from the 2nd Battalion, 7th Regiment of the 1st Marine Division, based at Camp Pendleton and Twentynine Palms. Mobilized under Title 10 orders, the Marines have been commanded to protect federal property and personnel from mounting protests over aggressive immigration raids and neighborhood sweeps. It is a rare and forceful use of federal military power on US soil.

The mobilization follows Trump's June 7 order that federalized as many as 4,000 California national guardsmen, overriding the objections of state officials and igniting a high-stakes legal fight.

A US district judge on Thursday ordered Trump to return control of the guardsmen to the state of California, saying the takeover was unlawful, only likely to inflame tensions in the city, and had deprived the state of resources necessary “to fight fires, combat the fentanyl trade, and perform other critical functions.” The injunction was quickly stayed, however, by a federal appeals court, pending a hearing next week.

Protests began Friday in Westlake, an immigrant-heavy neighborhood near downtown LA, where residents rallied in response to sweeping ICE raids that targeted day laborers outside local businesses. Demonstrators marched, held signs, and chanted for several hours before tensions escalated after police declared an unlawful assembly and advanced on the crowd. LAPD officers and federal agents deployed a range of crowd control weapons, including batons, tear gas, pepper spray, and flash-bang grenades. Reports from journalists and observers describe nonviolent protesters—and members of the press—being struck by rubber bullets and stun devices during the crackdown.

Widespread protests are expected in LA and at some 2,000 other locations around the US this weekend.

While the president holds broad emergency powers, legal scholars say that without invoking the Insurrection Act—a statute that permits domestic troop deployments only in cases of a rebellion or civil rights violations—federal law sharply limits what active-duty forces can do. Marines may not act as a posse comitatus, or function as law enforcement. They're barred from arrests, surveillance, and crowd control, and may only support police in narrowly defined ways, according to Defense Department rules.

Pentagon directives governing “civil disturbance operations” reinforce these limits. Federal troops are prohibited from arresting civilians, searching property, and collecting evidence. They may not conduct surveillance of US persons. That includes not just individuals but vehicles, locations, and “transactions.” They may not serve as undercover agents, informants, or interrogators. Unless a crime is committed by a service member or on military property, Title 10 forces are likewise banned from engaging in any kind of forensics for the benefit of civilian police—unless they are willing to put in writing that such evidence was obtained by consent.

That said, there are numerous scenarios in which the military can provide assistance to police, including by giving them “information” obtained “in the normal course” of their duties, unless applicable privacy laws prohibit it. Military members can also provide police with a wide variety of assistance so long as it's in a “private capacity” and they're off duty. Additionally, they can provide “expert advice,” so long as it doesn't count as serving a function core to civilian police work.

The Department of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment; however, a staff member in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy confirmed for WIRED by phone the current set of policies under which deployed federal troops must operate.

There is one major caveat to the military's restrictions. During an “extraordinary emergency,” military commanders may take limited, immediate action to prevent massive destruction or to restore critical public services, but only so long as presidential approval is “impossible” to obtain in advance. And while military personnel are naturally expected to maintain order and discipline at all times, under no circumstances are they required to stand down when their lives, or the lives of others, are in immediate danger.

Still, enforcement of these rules in the field is far from guaranteed. Legal experts warn that adherence often varies in chaotic environments. Trump administration officials have also demonstrated a willingness to skirt the law. Last week, homeland security secretary Kristi Noem asked the Pentagon to authorize military assistance in conducting arrests and to deploy drone surveillance, according to a letter obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle—a move experts say directly contradicts standing legal prohibitions.

At a press conference on Thursday, Noem stated the federal government was on a mission to “liberate” Los Angeles from “socialists” and the “leadership” of California governor Gavin Newsom and LA mayor Karen Bass. US Senator Alex Padilla, who represents the citizens of California, was forcibly removed from the press conference after attempting to question Noem. Outside the press conference room, federal agents forced the senator to the ground, where he was temporarily placed in handcuffs.

Unlike the National Guard, which is well trained for domestic crowd control, active-duty Marines generally receive relatively little instruction in handling civil unrest. Those who do typically belong to military police or specialized security units. Nonetheless, the Marine Corps has published footage online showing various task forces training with riot-control tactics and “nonlethal” weapons. Constitutional concerns do not arise, however, when Marines face off against foreign mobs—such as in civilian zones during the Afghanistan war or on the rare occasion protesters breach the perimeter of a US embassy. And wartime rules of engagement are far more lenient than the rules of force by which Marines must adhere domestically.

In a statement on Wednesday, US Northern Command, which oversees military support to nonmilitary authorities in the contiguous 48 states, confirmed the Marines had undergone training in all “mission essential tasks,” including “de-escalation” and “crowd control.” They will reportedly be accompanied by legal and law enforcement experts.

Constitutional experts warn that deploying military forces against civilian demonstrators blurs the line between law enforcement and military power, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for unchecked presidential authority. The risk deepens, they say, if federal troops overstep their legal bounds.

If lines are crossed, it could open a door that may not close easily—clearing the way for future crackdowns that erode Americans' hard-won civil liberties.

Take the article's example "send today's schedule to my boss John Doe" where the product isn't entirely guarded by the Plan-Then-Execute model (injections can still mutate email body).But if you combine it with the symbolic data store that is blind, it becomes more like:    "send today's schedule to my boss John Doe" -->
    $var1 = find_contact("John Doe")
    $var2 = summarize_schedule("today")
    send_email(recipient: $var1, body: $var2)

`find_contact` and `summarize_schedule` can both be quarantined, and the privileged LLM doesn't get to see the results directly.It simply invokes the final tool, which is deterministic and just reads from the shared var store. In this case you're pretty decently protected from prompt injection.I suppose though this isn't that different from the "Code-Then-Execute" pattern later on...

i think basically all of them involve reducing the "agency" of the agents though - which is a fine tradeoff - but i think one should be aware that the Big Model folks dont try to engineer any of these and just collect data to keep reducing injection risk. the tradeoff of capability maxxing vs efficiency/security often tends to be won by the capabilitymaxxers in terms of product adoption/marketing.eg the SWE Agent case study recommends Dual LLM with strict data formatting - would like to see this benchmarked in terms of how much of a perfomance an agent like this would be, perhaps doable by forking openai codex and implementing the dual llm.

  These patterns impose intentional
  constraints on agents, explicitly 
  limiting their ability to perform 
  arbitrary tasks.

That's a bucket of cold water in a lot of things people are trying to build. I imagine a lot of people will ignore this advice!

The problem with prompt injection is that the attack itself is the same as SQL injection - concatenation trusted and untrusted strings together -  but so far all of our attempts at implementing a solution similar to parameterized queries (such as system prompts and prompt delimiters) have failed.

Long ago I encountered a predecessor's "web scripting language" product... it worked based on repeatedly evaluating a string and substituting the result, until it stopped mutating. Injection was its lifeblood.As much as it horrified me, in retrospect it was still marginally more secure than an LLM, because at least it had definite (if ultimately unworkable) parsing/escaping rules, instead of statistical suggestions.

There are lots of things that we'd like to improve about our laptops and computers. Memory is a big one for a lot of us, and so is general performance. However, one that's a little easier to overlook and forget about is the number of USB ports you've got. You don't have to suffer through that though, you can just buy more if you know how.

See at Amazon

There are a few devices that'll do that for you, but a really good one is this HP USB-C Dock, which can turn one USB-C port into 11 different ports, making it really easy to use more accessories. This means you can do more creative tasks, add more webcams, or just fill them with play-dough if you want to. Don't do that though. Anyway, this awesome device is currently 54% off, which means it's down to just $105 at the moment.

This device is incredibly easy to use, and it's highly compatible. In essence, as long as you've got a Thunderbolt-enabled device, you can plug it into a USB port and you'll immediately add a huge number of extra slots to whatever you're using it with. You get not only extra USB ports, but also two DisplayPorts, one HDMI port, and one gigabit Ethernet port as well. You get all of that from a device that's just 5 inches by 5 inches too, which means it'll work whether you've got limited desk space, or you're using it on the go while you commute.

This is pretty much the perfect device for anyone who commutes but needs more ports, or those who want more things attached to their PC but can't afford a proper upgrade for whatever reason. It's just really convenient, and it also makes these ports a lot easier to get to than they are normally. After all, we've all suffered at the hands of the USB ports on the back of our PC at some point, right? Well, with this thing plugged in, you don't have to deal with that, you can access a bunch of essential ports on your desk without having to get a load of dust and all the random things your cats drag around on you.

We'd recommend acting quickly if you're hoping to get your hands on this though, as we're not expecting the 54% discount to last very long. That means the price will go up from the $105 sale price back to the normal $230 price if you wait too long.

Nearly 10 years ago, scientists observed ripples in spacetime created by the collision of two black holes that took place 1.3 billion years ago. The first direct detection of gravitational waves opened up an entirely new way of seeing the universe, allowing us to observe a once invisible side of the cosmos. Today, the ability to track the frequencies produced by the most notable events that shape our surrounding cosmos is at risk due to drastic budget cuts targeting a breakthrough observatory.

In late May, the U.S. administration released a so-called skinny budget that highlighted the proposed funds allocated to NASA and the National Science Foundation in 2026. As part of several monstrosities committed against ongoing science programs, the proposed budget would gut the funding for the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) by 39.6%. The budget request allocates $29 million instead of $48 million for LIGO, and shuts down one of its two interferometers.

The twin interferometers are situated 1,865 miles apart (3,002 kilometers), with one facility in Washington State and another in Louisiana. The enormous research facilities operate in unison as a single observatory designed to detect gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime that travel at the speed of light.

Unlike other telescopes, LIGO is blind. It detects gravitational waves by measuring incredibly small distortions in spacetime. Using its laser interferometers, it splits a laser beam into two and sends each of them down two long vacuum-sealed arms. The beams travel back and forth through each arm, bouncing between precisely configured mirrors. Each beam monitors the distance between the mirrors and detects tiny changes caused by gravitational waves, which can stretch space in one direction and compress it in the other. The lasers can discern movements between their mirrors with an accuracy of 1/10,000th the width of a proton.

Researchers from Caltech and MIT, with funding and oversight from the National Science Foundation, completed construction of LIGO—one of the world's most sophisticated scientific observatories—in 1999. Scientists spent years searching for gravitational waves and coming up empty. Finally, on September 14, 2015, the observatory began picking up the signal of its first gravitational waves. The groundbreaking detection provided scientists with a brand new way of observing the universe, allowing them to trace the waves back to events that had long remained hidden in the cosmos. Gravitational waves are caused by the merger of black holes, the collision of neutron stars, and asymmetric supernovae. Some may have also been produced in the early universe, moments after the Big Bang.

Three researchers behind LIGO's discovery were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017 for their role in the detection of gravitational waves: physicists Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish, and Kip Thorne. These ripples in spacetime were first predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916, and could only be confirmed decades later. The first discovery was confirmed because the signal was observed by both LIGO detectors. Since then, the twin LIGO interferometers—sometimes in coordination with the Virgo observatory in Italy—have detected hundreds of additional gravitational wave signals.

Gravitational waves produce a high-pitched chirp when translated to audio, beginning at a low frequency. The two interferometers, and sometimes three, need to work in unison to confirm these faint signals. If one of LIGO's twin interferometers is shut down, as is suggested by the proposed budget, researchers would have trouble distinguishing between a black hole collision and a nearby seismic tremor, according to Science.

The field of gravitational waves is only just getting started thanks to the twin LIGO detectors. Killing off one of the laser interferometers would hinder our newfound ability to listen in to the soft ripples of spacetime that echo through the cosmos.

If you've ever struggled with a tangle of old chargers and power strips to keep all your devices charged, you'll appreciate what the latest 150W USB-C wall charger can do. This compact and powerful charging station is now available at an all-time low on Amazon for just $27, down from a list price of $46 which is a 41% discount that makes it a deal too good to miss.

For the price of less than an meal, you get a thin solution that lets you charge three devices at once, whether your phone, tablet, or even laptop – all with fast charging from USB-A or USB-C. It's the perfect setup for whoever has had it up to cluttered chargers and limited outlets.

See at Amazon

The beauty of this charger lies in its novel GaN Ultra technology that provides increased efficiency and smarts in charging compared to traditional silicon-based chargers. That means less heat, more power and a safer experience for your devices. The charger continuously monitors temperature in real time and performs millions of safety checks every day to enable maximum performance and protect your devices.

With a maximum output of 150W, you can charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 60% in 30 minutes using the main USB-C port that can supply up to 100W. The other two ports can share up to 50W between them so that you can charge two more devices simultaneously. This is a huge advantage for anyone who needs to power up multiple gadgets quickly.

Thanks to the advanced GaN Ultra technology, this charger is 60% smaller than traditional 150W adapters with a foldable plug that makes it even more portable.

These wireless earphones may look very much like AirPods or Galaxy Buds at first glance, but they're obviously distinct products. But with a record low price tag of just $21, currently discounted by 86% from a typical $160 price on Amazon, these represent a compelling trade-off for whoever is willing to sacrifice wireless audio quality but without a huge expense outlay.

While you should not expect the premium finish or advanced features of higher-priced companies, these earbuds have been highly rated with a 4.7 out of 5-star rating and nearly 10,000 units sold in a single month. For this price, it is hard to find a better bargain in the market today.

On the technical front, these wireless earbuds are powered by Bluetooth 5.4 technology which offers seamless pairing, reduced latency and a steadier connection over a range of 15 meters. While this latest version of Bluetooth enhances the experience itself, it also extends battery life which is a crucial aspect for a user who uses earbuds throughout the day. The earbuds themselves deliver up to 8 hours of playback at 80% volume and the charging case provides an impressive total of 40 hours of playtime.

These earbuds feature a 13mm vibration diaphragm and AAC/SBC audio codec for deep bass and clear, detailed sound. They also have their Hi-Fi stereo sound boosted by ENC (Environmental Noise Cancellation) technology that uses four microphones to eliminate background noise and wind noise when making calls. They thus qualify as suitable bets for hands-free calling in even louder environments or while outdoors.

The earbuds come with uncomplicated touch controls so that you can play/pause music, answer/terminate a call, skip songs and even activate voice assistants like Siri without putting your hands on your phone. The charging case features a dual LED display that shows the remaining battery level for both the earbuds and the case, so you're never caught off guard by a dead battery.

They also have the IP7 certification for water resistance which means they can withstand immersion into water one meter deep for 30 minutes. This implies that they can be used while exercising, running, or even in the rain. They have an ergonomic shape that forms a snug, secure fit on most ears, and the light material that they are made of makes them tolerable for extended use. The fit is tight enough for active wear so you don't need to worry about them coming off while you work out or make your daily commutes.

If you're searching for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds at a decent price point, don't miss this deal.

Another Rosetta 2 holdout gone

Valve just released a Steam Client Beta that runs on Apple Silicon. The company announced on the Steam Community website that both the Steam Client and the Steam Helper now run natively on Apple Silicon. This move will improve Steam's performance on Apple computers, especially as it removes the additional overhead for Rosetta 2.

Valve also has no choice but to create a native version for Steam, especially as Apple is largely sunsetting Rosetta 2 after macOS 27. The company made the announcement this week at WWDC 25, where it also said that macOS Tahoe will be the last OS update for Intel Macs, some five years after the company released the first Apple Silicon-powered MacBook Air.

That means most apps designed for x86 systems will no longer work with macOS, unless their developers create a version that runs natively on Apple Silicon. The company said it will only retain a few portions of Rosetta to run older games that are no longer updated by their developers.

This update means that Steam will have better performance, improving the gaming experience on your macOS device. Notably, it's also the only public Arm version of Steam going. However, it doesn't mean that you can now start playing Windows-only games on your Apple computer. You still need emulation tools if you want to run x86 Windows games on your Mac.

Despite that, this change is slowly making Apple devices more conducive for gaming. The company wants to capture a bigger slice of the computer gaming pie with its ecosystem approach, but the limited number of titles (compared to the vast library of Windows games) and the relative price of Apple computers versus gaming PCs make it harder for gamers to switch over, despite the performance that Apple silicon delivers.

The phasing out of Rosetta 2 might disappoint a few users, but it is high time that developers start building apps specifically for Apple Silicon. After all, it's already been five years since the first M1 chip arrived on the MacBook Air, and relying on a translation layer is certainly holding back the hardware from performing at its maximum potential.

If you want to upgrade the Steam client on your macOS device, open the Steam app, go to Steam > Preferences… In the Steam Settings window, go to Interface, then click on the dropdown menu beside Client Beta Participation and choose Steam Beta Update. This will restart Steam and download the updated version (Steam Version: 1749753892 or higher) that natively runs on Apple Silicon. To confirm the update, look for Steam in the Activity Monitor — the Kind column should say Apple.

The attack sounds unbelievably hard to pull off. 


When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here's how it works.


A new theoretical air-gap attack dubbed SmartAttack has been cooked up by researchers at the Ben-Gurion University of the NegevBeer Sheva, Israel, proposing that smartwatches could be leveraged as receivers for ultra-sonic covert communication in air-gapped systems, highlighting an emerging threat to the networks.

As per the paper, air-gapped systems are generally considered secure due to their physical isolation from external networks, a measure used to prevent unauthorized access and cyberattacks. Air-gapped systems take different forms, including actual physical isolation or 'logical' isolation, where the segregation is implemented using other means such as encryption.

The paper, authored by Mordechai Guri, PhD (Head of Offensive-Cyber Research Lab), focuses on the former physical implementation of air-gap security. He describes smartwatches as "an underexplored yet effective attack vector," and in the paper proposes a new method that uses smartwatches as a receiver for ultrasonic covert communication in air-gapped environments.

According to the abstract, the method uses the built-in microphone of a smartwatch to capture covert signals in real time, specifically ultrasonic frequencies ranging from 18 to 22 kHz. According to the paper, extensive experimentation demonstrates that the attack can successfully transmit data over distances up to and possibly beyond 6 meters, with data transfer rates of 50 bits per second.

Despite the theoretical threat, any such attack would be enormously difficult to pull off. An adversary would still need to infiltrate the secured network and implant malware; to that end, the research cites previous incidents where air-gap networks have been compromised by supply chain attacks, insider threats, or infected removable media.

Implanted malware would remain dormant or operate stealthily, gathering sensitive information such as keystrokes, encryption keys, biometric data, or user credentials. The information is then modulated onto ultrasonic signals, broadcast at an inaudible frequency via the computer's speakers so as to evade human detection.

The more you read the paper, the more it starts to sound like a discarded Mission: Impossible plot. That's because the attack also requires a compromised smartwatch belonging to an employee or visitor with access to the secure environment. The paper envisions using extensive smartwatch connectivity options, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC, or even email, to achieve this.

Once compromised, the smartwatch malware monitors its environment for incoming ultrasonic signals using its microphone. Even with malware in place on both the air-gapped network and the requisite smartwatch, ultrasonic data exfiltration is limited by factors such as position, signal reception, and strength, notably because a smartwatch is worn on the wrist and as such tends to move more or less constantly.

Despite the exceedingly high barriers to pulling off such an attack, the paper takes the threat seriously enough to propose mitigations. Obvious measures include prohibiting the use of smartwatches and similarly capable audio devices in air-gapped network environments, while other more sophisticated measures extend to deploying ultrasonic monitoring systems, using ultrasonic jamming, and even integrating ultrasonic firewalls within computers used in such networks.

To show off how easy it is for users to earn money by using his new chatbot platform, Pankaj Gupta offers to cash out $1 worth of Yupp credits, sending it to me over Venmo or PayPal. I'm talking with Gupta in the WIRED office during a prelaunch demo of Yupp, which comes out of stealth mode today. Journalistic ethics forbid accepting gifts from sources, so I politely decline. He proceeds to send it over PayPal to his Stanford alumni email.

Gupta is the CEO of Yupp, which is free to use and available globally. The website looks similar to other generative AI tools like ChatGPT. There's a prompt box, a way to attach files, and a log of past conversations.

The main difference is that every time users ask Yupp a question, they'll see two answers, generated by two different models and displayed side by side. Yupp routes prompts to a pair of large language models, choosing from a pool of over 500 models that includes products from leading US generative AI companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, as well as international releases, like models from Alibaba, DeepSeek, and Mistral.

After looking over the two answers, users pick the response they like best, then provide feedback explaining why. For their effort, they earn a digital scratch card with Yupp credits.

"You're not being employed, but you can make a little bit of money,” says Gupta. In my testing, the Yupp credits on the scratch cards typically ranged from zero to around 250, though they occasionally went higher. Every 1,000 credits can be exchanged for $1. Users can cash out a maximum of $10 a day and $50 a month.

Not sure where to start while testing this web app, I turned to the range of prewritten topics flickering beneath Yupp's prompt bar, which spanned from news topics, like David Hogg leaving the Democratic National Committee, to ideas for image-creation prompts, like generating a crochet-looking surfer. (Yupp's models can generate text or images.) I eventually chose to have the bots explain different perspectives on the current Los Angeles protests.

I was interested in how it would pull from news reports and other sources to generate the analysis about a political issue. Yupp notified me that generating this answer would cost 50 of my 8,639 Yupp credits; users have to spend credits to make credits on Yupp.

It generated two answers, one from Perplexity's Sonar, on the left side, and one from an “AI agent” for news built by Yupp, on the right. AI agents are buzzy right now; they're basically task-based AI programs that can perform a string of simple operations on your behalf when given a single prompt.

The output based on Perplexity's model answered the question citing five online sources, including CBS News and a YouTube video uploaded by the White House titled “Third-World Insurrection Riots on American Soil.” The other answer, generated by the news agent, cited twice as many sources, including the socialist magazine Jacobin and MSNBC.

In addition to having more sources, the answer on the right side included more context about what Los Angeles mayor Karen Bass has been doing. I clicked the button saying I preferred that generation and gave my feedback, which Yupp anonymizes before aggregating.

A shiny card resembling a lottery scratcher ticket popped up afterward, and I used my mouse to scratch it off. I got a measly 68 credits for that feedback, not exactly a windfall. But since I spent 50 credits to run the prompt, it put me up by 18 credits.

After about an hour of messaging with the chatbot about different topics and giving my feedback on the models, the total points accrued equaled about $4. The cash-out options include PayPal and Venmo, but also cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. “Crypto and stablecoin allow us to instantly reach anywhere in the world,” Gupta says.

While I didn't earn much money, the free outputs did include answers generated by newly released models that are often locked behind subscription paywalls. If someone wants to use a free chatbot and doesn't mind the friction of providing feedback as the web interface flips between models, Yupp could be worth trying out.

During the demo, Gupta asked Yupp where the WIRED office was located. Both models spit out wrong answers initially, though subsequent tries got it right. Still, he sees the side-by-side outputs as potentially helpful for users who are concerned about AI-generated errors, which are still quite prevalent, and want another point of comparison.

“‘Every AI for everyone' is kind of our tagline,” says Gupta. “We have organized all the AI models we can find today.” Yupp's website encourages developers to reach out if they want their language or image model added to the options. It doesn't currently have any deals with AI model builders and provides these responses by making API calls.

Every time someone uses Yupp they are participating in a head-to-head comparison of two chatbot models and sometimes getting a reward for providing their feedback and picking a winning answer. Basically, it's a user survey disguised as a fun game. (The website has lots of emoji.)

He sees the data trade-off in this situation for users as more explicit than past consumer apps, like Twitter—which he's quick to tell me that he was the 27th employee at and now has one of that company's cofounders, Biz Stone, as one of his backers. “This is a little bit of a departure from previous consumer companies,” he says. “You provide feedback data, that data is going to be used in an anonymized way and sent to the model builders.”

Which brings us to where the real money is at: Selling human feedback to AI companies that desperately want more data to fine-tune their models.

“Crowdsourced human evaluations is what we're doing here,” Gupta says. He estimates the amount of cash users can make will add up to enough for a few cups of coffee a month. Though, this kind of data labeling, often called reinforcement learning with human feedback in the AI industry, is extremely valuable for companies as they release iterative models and fine tune the outputs. It's worth far more than the bougiest cup of coffee in all of San Francisco.

The main competitor to Yupp is a website called LMArena, which is quite popular with AI insiders for getting feedback on new models and bragging rights if a new release rises to the top of the pack. Whenever a powerful model is added to LMArena, it often stokes rumors about which major company is trying to test its new release in stealth.

“This is a two-sided product with network effects of consumers helping the model builders,” Gupta says. “And model builders, hopefully, are improving the models and submitting them back to the consumers.” He shows me a beta version of Yupp's leaderboard, which goes live today and includes an overall ranking of the models alongside more granular data. The rankings can be filtered by how well a model performs with specific demographic information users share during the sign-up process, like their age, or on a particular prompt category, like health-care-related questions.

Near the end of our conversation, Gupta brings up artificial general intelligence—the theory of superintelligent, humanlike algorithms—as a technology that is imminent. “These models are being built for human users at the end of the day, at least for the near future,” he says. It's a fairly common belief, and marketing point, among people working at AI companies, despite many researchers still questioning whether the underlying technology behind large language models will ever be able to produce AGI.

Gupta wants Yupp users, who may be anxious about the future of humanity, to envision themselves as actively shaping these algorithms and improving their quality. “It's better than free, because you are doing this great thing for AI's future,” he says. “Now, some people would want to know that, and others just want the best answers.”

And even more users might just want extra cash and be willing to spend a few hours giving feedback during their chatbot conversations. I mean, $50 is $50.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will be among the first hyperscalers to deploy AMD's latest Instinct MI350X-series GPUs as well as its Pensando Pollara 400GbE network interface card, which is the industry's first Ultra Ethernet-compliant NIC, AMD disclosed at its Advancing AI event. The announcement comes as the Ultra Ethernet Consortium this week published Specification 1.0 of the Ultra Ethernet technology designed for hyper-scale AI and HPC data centers. 

Systems featuring AMD's Instinct MI350X-series GPUs as well as Pensando Pollara 400GbE NICs will be broadly available at OCI and possibly other cloud service providers in the second half of this year, according to the company. The Pensando Pollara 400GbE network cards will be particularly handy for Oracle, which plans to broadly deploy AMD's latest AI GPUs and build a zettascale AI cluster with up to 131,072 Instinct MI355X to enable its customers to train and inference AI models at a massive scale. 



AMD's Pensando Pollara 400GbE NICs — just like other Ultra Ethernet-compliant network hardware — are designed for massive scale-out environments containing up to a million AI processors or GPUs and promise an up to six times performance boost for AI workloads. AMD claims that its Pollara 400GbE card offers a 10% higher RDMA performance compared to Nvidia's CX7 and 20% higher RDMA performance than Broadcom's Thor2 solution. In addition, UEC 1.0 features like efficient load-balancing, selective retransmission, and path-aware congestion control can further improve RDMA performance by 25% compared to traditional RoCEv2. 

The Pensando Pollara 400GbE NIC is based on an in-house designed specialized processor with customizable hardware that supports RDMA, adjustable transport protocols, and offloading of communication libraries. The NIC can intelligently split data streams across multiple routes to avoid bottlenecks and dynamically reroute traffic away from overloaded network paths to ensure consistent throughput across large-scale GPU deployments. 

In addition, AMD's Pollara 400GbE card features failover technology that rapidly detects and bypasses the connection to preserve high-speed GPU-to-GPU links. Such capabilities are crucial for maintaining cluster utilization and reducing latencies in environments with tens of thousands of interconnected accelerators.



While Oracle will be the first big hyperscaler to deploy AMD's Pollara 400GbE NICs (as it will probably own the largest AMD Instinct MI355X-based cluster), other companies that plan large-scale AMD Instinct deployments will follow soon, popularizing adoption of Ultra Ethernet gear. The cards are currently shipping to interested parties.

UPDATE 6/12: As it turns out, AMD's Helios has 72 GPUs, not 128 GPUs. Updating the story to reflect changes.AMD gave a preview of its first in-house designed rack-scale solution, Helios, at its Advancing AI event on Thursday. The system is set to be based on the company's next-generation EPYC 'Venice' processors, will use its Instinct MI400-series accelerator, and will rely on network connections featuring the upcoming Pensando network cards. Overall, the company says that the flagship MI400X is 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, which is a remarkable progress given that the MI400X will be released about three years after the MI300X. 

When it comes to rack-scale solutions for AI, AMD clearly trails behind Nvidia. This is going to change a bit this year as cloud service providers (such as Oracle OCI), OEMs, and ODMs will build and deploy rack-scale solutions based on the Instinct MI350X-series GPUs, but those systems will not be designed by AMD, and they will have to interconnect each 8-way system using Ethernet, not low-latency high-bandwidth interconnects like NVLink.

The real change will occur next year with the first AMD-designed rack-scale system called Helios, which will use Zen 6-powered EPYC 'Venice' CPUs, CDNA 'Next'-based Instinct MI400-series GPUs, and Pensando 'Vulcano' network interface cards (NICs) that are rumored to increase the maximum scale-up world size to beyond eight GPUs, which will greatly enhance their capabilities for training and inference. The system will adhere to OCP standards and enable next-generation interconnects such as Ultra Ethernet and Ultra Accelerator Link, supporting demanding AI workloads.

 "So let me introduce the Helios AI rack," said Andrew Dieckman, corporate VP and general manager of AMD's data center GPU business. "Helios is one of the system solutions that we are working on based on the Instinct MI400-series GPU, so it is a fully integrated AI rack with EPYC CPUs, Instinct MI400-series GPUs, Pensando NICs, and then our ROCm stack. It is a unified architecture designed for both frontier model training as well as massive scale inference [that] delivers leadership compute density, memory bandwidth, scale out interconnect, all built in an open OCP-compliant standard supporting Ultra Ethernet and UALink." 

From a performance point of view, AMD's flagship Instinct MI400-series AI GPU (we will refer to it as to Instinct MI400X, though this is not the official name, and we will also call the CDNA Next as CDNA 5) doubles performance from the Instinct MI355X and increases memory capacity by 50% and bandwidth by more than 100%. While the MI355X delivers 10 dense FP4 PFLOPS, the MI400X is projected to hit 20 dense FP4 PFLOPS. 

Overall, the company says that the flagship MI400X is 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, which is a remarkable progress given that the MI400X will be released about three years after the MI300X. 

"When you look at our product roadmap and how we continue to accelerate, with MI355X, we have taken a major leap forward [compared to the MI300X]: we are delivering 3X the amount of performance on a broad set of models and workloads, and that is a significant uptick from the previous trajectory we were on from the MI300X with the MI325X," said Dieckman. "Now, with the Instinct MI400X and Helios, we bend that curve even further, and Helios is designed to deliver up to 10X more AI performance on the the most advanced frontier models in the high end."

The new MI400X accelerator will also surpass Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, which is currently ramping up, in terms of compute performance. However, when it comes to comparison with Nvidia's next-generation Rubin R200 that delivers 50 dense FP4 PFLOPS, AMD's MI400X will be around 2.5 times slower. Still, AMD will have an ace up its sleeve, which is memory bandwidth and capacity (see tables for details). Similarly, Helios will outperform Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra-based NVL72 and Rubin-based NVL144. 

However, it remains to be seen how Helios will stack against NVL144 in real-world applications. Also, it will be extremely hard to beat Nvidia's NVL576 both in terms of compute performance and memory bandwidth in 2027, though by that time, AMD will likely roll out something new.

At least, this is what AMD communicated at its Advancing AI event this week: the company plans to continue evolving its integrated AI platforms with next-generation GPUs, CPUs, and networking technology, extending its roadmap well into 2027 and beyond.

The China National Space Administration has shared the first image from its Tianwen-2 probe, which is en route to Kamo‘oalewa, a near-Earth asteroid.

The image was captured by a camera onboard the probe, which is currently more than 3 million kilometers from Earth, and shows one of its wings with its solar panels deployed. It is also the first glimpse the CNSA has offered of its space probe, which launched on May 29 on a Long March 3B rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Zeyuan Town, China. The design of Tianwen-2's panels is similar in appearance to those on Lucy, NASA's space probe that is exploring asteroids floating near Jupiter. These serve to meet the power demands required for the trip.

Tianwen-2's mission is to land on the surface of Kamo‘oalewa, collect samples, and return to Earth. The spacecraft is scheduled to land on the asteroid's surface in July 2026. Before then, it will spend several months studying Kamo‘oalewa from a safe distance, to determine its sampling area, before proceeding with landing maneuvers, a particularly difficult task given the asteroid's low gravity.

Once the samples have been collected, Tianwen-2 will travel back to Earth and send its samples down to the surface in a capsule, before then attempting to use Earth's gravity as a slingshot to head toward 311P/PanSTARRS, an unusual-looking asteroid beyond Mars that has some of the characteristics of a comet, including visible tails. Tianwen-2 is expected to conduct this mission until 2035.

Kamo‘oalewa is one of Earth's seven known quasi-moons—objects that appear to be orbiting our planet, but which aren't actually gravitationally bound to Earth, and are actually asteroids circling the sun in an orbit similar to Earth's.

Discovered in 2016 by astronomers at the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii, Kamo‘oalewa—whose name means “oscillating celestial object” in Hawaiian—is located approximately 4.65 million kilometers from our planet, 12 times further away from Earth than the moon. Kamo‘oalewa is estimated to be roughly 40 to 100 meters in diameter, has maintained its current orbit for 100 years, and will probably maintain it for 300 more.

It's hoped that Tianwen-2 can solve the mystery of Kamo‘oalewa's origin. One theory is that it's a chunk of rock that broke off from the moon millions of years ago. The sampling mission will help multiple scientific investigations into the composition of rocky celestial bodies, as well as aid scientists in the search for clues about the formation of the solar system.

Observational evidence and modeling suggest that Kamo‘oalewa has been orbiting the sun for millions of years, albeit with an unstable trajectory. A direct exploration of this asteroid could, in addition, expand knowledge about nearby celestial objects that might potentially pose a threat to Earth.

Data-labeling company Scale AI confirmed on Friday that it has received a “significant” investment from Meta that values the startup at $29 billion. The startup also said its co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang is stepping down from his role to join Meta and help the bigger company with its AI work.

Reports indicate that Meta invested about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the startup, which produces and labels data that's used to train the large language models that underpin a significant portion of generative AI development.

Meta confirmed the investment. “Meta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI. As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts. We will share more about this effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks,” a spokesperson for Meta told TechCrunch.

Jason Droege, Scale's current chief strategy officer, will hop in as interim CEO. Scale AI noted that Meta's investment will be used to pay investors and shareholders, as well as to fuel growth. The company emphasized that it remains an independent entity. Wang will continue at the data-labeling firm as a director on its board.

As my colleague Max Zeff wrote on Wednesday, this investment is a way for Meta to improve its AI efforts as its rivals Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic rush ahead, and the social media company's own AI model releases trail the competition. Plus, according to data by SingalFire, the company lost 4.3% of its top talent to other AI labs last year.

For the last several years, leading AI labs such as OpenAI have relied on Scale AI to produce and label data that's used to train models. In recent months, Scale AI and its data annotation competitors have started hiring highly skilled people, such as PhD scientists and senior software engineers, to generate high-quality data for frontier AI labs.

Scale AI raised $1 billion last year from investors including Amazon and Meta at a valuation of $13.8 billion.

A new case report was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on May 22, 2025, titled "A rare case: Pure Sertoli cell tumor uncovered in atrophic ovary during postmenopausal vault prolapse evaluation."

In this case report, corresponding author Naina Kumar from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and team describe a rare ovarian tumor in a 70-year-old postmenopausal woman. The tumor was found incidentally during surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. This unusual finding demonstrates the importance of careful tissue evaluation during routine surgeries, especially in older women who may show no symptoms of ovarian disease.

Sertoli cell tumors of the ovary are rare and usually occur in younger women. An even rarer subtype, known as "pure" Sertoli cell tumors, lacks other cellular components typically found in related tumors. While some of these tumors may produce hormones, the tumor in this case was non-functional and was discovered only through microscopic analysis after removal during surgery for an unrelated condition.

The patient had undergone a hysterectomy two decades earlier and was admitted to address a vault prolapse, a type of vaginal wall collapse. During the procedure, both atrophic ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed as part of standard surgical care. Although the ovaries appeared age-shrunken and unremarkable, tissue analysis revealed a Stage Ia pure Sertoli cell tumor in the right ovary, with no abnormalities in the left ovary or fallopian tubes.

"Her medical history included Whipple's surgery six years ago for periampullary carcinoma (pT1aN0), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² IV infusion weekly for 7 weeks, a week of rest, and then weekly infusions for 3 weeks in each 28-day cycle)."

Because the tumor was diagnosed at an early stage and confined to the ovary, no additional treatment was needed. The patient recovered well from surgery and remains in good health under regular follow-up. The authors emphasize that early-stage tumors like this one are generally not aggressive and have excellent outcomes, especially when detected early.

This case emphasizes how rare conditions can go undetected in postmenopausal women, particularly when symptoms are absent. It also highlights the value of thorough inspection and histological analysis during pelvic surgeries. Identifying such tumors early, even when incidental, can ensure appropriate management and long-term health monitoring.

By reporting this case, the researchers contribute to broader clinical awareness of rare ovarian tumors and support best practices for surgical evaluation in gynecological care.

Dozens of HIV experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received emails on Wednesday revoking notices they received 10 weeks ago that laid them off. Damage to their projects may be permanent, however, and ongoing restrictions on their research will harm lives, multiple HIV scientists at the CDC told KFF Health News on condition of anonymity because of fears of retaliation.

The researchers were laid off in early April, just before they put the finishing touches on in-depth, national surveys about HIV. Health officials across the country had interviewed tens of thousands of people at risk of acquiring HIV, or who are living with the virus, and compiled information from mountains of medical records.

States and cities were prepared to submit the information they collected to the CDC in April so the agency's statisticians could prepare the volumes of data for analysis.

Health officials and policymakers use the data to design HIV programs that more efficiently curb the spread of infections and save lives. For example, a 2023 survey revealed that about half of adults under age 30 who were living with HIV weren't on treatment steadily enough to keep them healthy and prevent them from spreading the virus to others. Treatment rates were far higher for those over 50. As a result, health officials doubled down on outreach to younger generations.

However, in April, state and local health officials found themselves cut off from their CDC counterparts after the layoffs. Emails from the Department of Health and Human Services told staff their roles were "either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency."

Marti Merritt, a project coordinator at the Illinois state health department, was flabbergasted that she and other state employees had invested more than a year into the surveys only to have them go dark in the final phase. "It's like the data has gone into a black hole," she said. "How do you set priorities if you don't have data?"

Merritt worries that if the surveys don't resume, limited budgets will be misspent — and that cases will rise. Data allows health departments to tailor their efforts to the populations at greatest risk of infection or disease progression.

Evidence shows that preventing HIV is far cheaper than treating people once they're infected. Preventing one HIV infection results in $466,000 in lifetime savings. Merritt was also dismayed to have wasted the time of thousands of people who opened up about intimate details of their lives in hopes of fighting the HIV epidemic.

A doctor and HIV expert reinstated at the CDC this week said the late termination of the surveys would waste millions of taxpayer dollars that have already been spent on data collection. Two large, long-standing efforts, the Medical Monitoring Project and the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system, cost around $72 million, he said.

"Two years' worth of data from 30,000 participants will be unusable, and therefore wasted," if the projects can't be finished, he said.

To resume the surveys, he and other CDC researchers would need a green light from higher up because the grants covering these surveys ended while they were on administrative leave in May.

State health officials said they haven't received the CDC notices that typically renew the surveys every June. Merritt has conducted interviews for the Medical Monitoring Project for about 20 years, she said, but the Illinois health department has now assigned her to other tasks. Other health departments have laid off or reassigned employees dedicated to HIV surveillance, too.

If HHS allows the reinstated researchers to resume the projects, they could try to account for the 10-week gap in their analysis. But it would take time, further delaying the next round of surveys — if those begin at all.

"These surveys aren't lights that you turn on and off," said John Brooks, a researcher who retired from the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention last year. If the surveys resume, he said, "we can get some value out of all of the money spent."

However, the surveys would be further impaired by actions related to Trump's executive orders targeting words such as "gender" that researchers use to learn who has HIV, who is at risk, and why.

Experts at the CDC said they've already had to revise earlier surveys and recalculate results to not reference gender. This has meant altering data on two populations disproportionately affected by HIV: transgender people and men who have sex with men.

"To erase people from our data harms them," said the researcher and doctor now reinstated at the CDC. "I care about the transgender patients I see, and it's so hurtful to see them treated this way by the government."

The doctor said he has treated HIV patients since the beginning of the epidemic in the 1980s, and the sting he feels now is worse than under President Ronald Reagan, who never publicly mentioned HIV in his first term.

"There was a lack of funding," he said, "but they didn't censor science or try to control science like they're doing now."

Many HIV researchers have taken jobs outside the government or moved since the April layoffs. Some researchers returning to the agency called the reinstatements perplexing because the notices don't say what they'll be doing when they return and for how long.

A terse email to CDC employees from Tom Nagy, chief human capital officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, reviewed by KFF Health News, simply refers to the notice regarding the reduction in force and says, "That notice is hereby revoked."

In an email response to queries, Andrew Nixon, HHS director of communications, wrote, "HHS is streamlining operations without compromising mission-critical work. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority."

"We've been getting paid this whole time even though we've not been allowed to work, and that doesn't feel good when you're a dedicated civil servant," said one reinstated employee.

We'd like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what's happening within the federal health bureaucracy. Please message KFF Health News on Signal at (415) 519-8778.

Arthritis causes persistent inflammation and pain in the joints, affecting mobility and quality of life for millions. While thermotherapy—applying heat to affected areas—has long been used to ease symptoms, traditional methods like heat pads or hot patches often fall short. They can overheat, burn, or lose effectiveness over time, and they rarely adapt to real-world conditions like cold air or damp weather. Moreover, many heating devices are bulky, immobile, and unable to detect when therapy is actually needed. These shortcomings highlight the urgent demand for smart, wearable solutions that can monitor the body's needs and deliver safe, stable, and timely heat. Due to these problems, intelligent thermotherapy devices must be further explored and developed.

On May 13, 2025, researchers from Dalian University of Technology unveiled a flexible, wearable thermotherapy system (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00912-8) in Microsystems & Nanoengineering. This multilayered device integrates temperature and humidity sensors with a thin gold-based heater on a stretchable polyimide film. Designed for real-time, automatic use, it responds to environmental cues and body movement, providing personalized thermal treatment for arthritic joints. The system marks a step forward in wearable health technology, addressing the limitations of conventional devices and offering patients a discreet, reliable tool for daily therapy and protection in varying conditions.

At the heart of the system is a kirigami-serpentine structure—an origami-like pattern that enhances flexibility and stretchability. Layered with an Au temperature sensor, Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based humidity sensor, and Joule heater, the device conforms closely to joints, such as knees, and performs reliably during movement. Using real-time data processed by a flexible circuit and Bluetooth-enabled feedback loop, the system can adjust heat output within 1 second, maintaining temperatures with less than 0.1°C variation at 45°C.

This innovation supports multiple applications: programmable on-demand therapy with customized heat cycles; daily thermal protection that automatically activates in cold weather; and moisture control to combat joint-stiffening humidity. On-body tests showed the heater could raise local skin temperature even outdoors, while humidity levels dropped steadily during use. Most strikingly, the team used photoplethysmography (PPG) to measure blood flow and confirmed that thermotherapy via this system significantly boosted local perfusion—an essential factor in pain relief. The design also proved durable through 1,000+ use cycles, remaining accurate during walking, stretching, and running. By combining high precision with real-world practicality, this soft, wearable system delivers clinical-grade function in a form factor that patients can use every day.

Our goal was to make thermal therapy truly wearable—not just portable, but adaptive and intuitive. By integrating precise sensors and closed-loop control into a stretchable format, we're giving patients the ability to receive therapy in real time, tailored to their specific environment and condition. This technology reflects the future of personalized medicine, where treatment moves with the body and responds as needed. It's not just engineering—it's empathy through innovation."

Dr. Mengxi Wu, co-corresponding author of the study

Beyond arthritis relief, this technology signals a new direction for wearable health systems. Its modular design, environmental responsiveness, and soft mechanics make it well-suited for integration into clothing, bandages, or therapeutic garments. For chronic conditions sensitive to temperature and humidity—such as circulatory issues, muscle injuries, or autoimmune disorders—the platform could offer customized support. Additionally, the same sensing-feedback-heating architecture might be adapted for wound care, smart rehabilitation, or ambient-responsive materials. As digital health advances, the marriage of microscale electronics with human-scale needs could reshape how therapy is delivered—not in clinics, but directly on the body, wherever and whenever it's needed most.

Identifying effective anti-cancer drugs and combinations is essential for successful treatment. To support this goal, there's an urgent need for efficient methods to test drug efficacy and uncover new therapeutic targets.

Three-dimensional cancer cell models, like tumoroids and spheroids, closely mimic the structure and behavior of tumors, making them powerful tools in cancer research and drug development.

However, manual 3D cell culture workflows are often time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone, hindering their adoption for high-throughput drug screening. 

To expedite and standardize spheroid assays, automated 3D cell culture methods utilizing the CellXpress.ai™ Automated Cell Culture System have been developed. This system enables automation of the entire cell culture process, including automated processes for plating, media exchange, passaging and culture monitoring in response to compound treatment and endpoint assays.

The study discussed here outlines the automation of a colorectal cell culture workflow, specifically the culture and imaging of colorectal cancer 3D spheroids derived from HCT116 cell lines in U-shaped low-attachment plates.

HCT116 cells were expanded in two-dimensional culture, and spheroids were generated through automated dispensing of the cell suspension into U-shaped 96- or 384-well plates.

Following a 48-hour incubation, spheroids were treated with various anti-cancer compounds at multiple concentrations for 3–5 days, after which staining and imaging were conducted.

The processes of cell plating, compound addition, media exchange and staining were executed automatically by the CellXpress.ai system.

During the cell culture automation, spheroids were monitored using transmitted light to assess phenotypic changes, including growth inhibition and spheroid disintegration.

For the endpoint assay, spheroids were stained with a combination of Hoechst nuclear stain and viability dyes Calcein AM and EtHD. The spheroids were subsequently imaged and analyzed for size and live-dead cell scoring.

Additionally, ATP content was measured utilizing a CellTiter-Glo assay, with luminescent readouts obtained using the SpectraMax® iD3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader.

A concentration-dependent decrease in ATP content was observed, as well as inhibition of spheroid growth and increased cell death in response to the anti-cancer compounds.

According to a new study, presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Care of the Athletic Heart 2025 conference, sleep apnea may be more prevalent in younger female athletes than previously believed, especially among female athletes with higher levels of training. While obstructive sleep apnea has been observed in younger male athletes, the prevalence in female athletes and the association with cardiovascular risk is largely unknown.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder, impacting about 18 million Americans, and is prevalent in both men and women. It occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway, causing patients with OSA to repeatedly stop and start breathing when sleeping. Symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, waking during the night and gasping or choking. OSA increases the risk of high blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues, including arrhythmias, heart attack, heart failure and stroke.

There is a lot of overlap in symptoms of sleep apnea and sleep deprivation, which is unsurprisingly quite common among these athletes. Some symptoms that might clue in an athletic trainer, coach or clinician that an athlete may be experiencing or at risk for sleep apnea include not feeling well-rested despite a full night of sleep, snoring very loudly, gasping or choking while sleeping. There may be more subtle signs too, including difficulty concentrating or irritability. Accurately diagnosing sleep apnea is important, as a range of treatment options-such as CPAP, mandibular advancement devices, or even surgery-can significantly improve quality of life and, depending on disease severity, potentially reduce long-term cardiovascular risk."

Austin Rim, MD, a cardiology fellow at Emory University in Atlanta and study's lead author

The study included 68 female collegiate athletes at two universities in the United States. Softball players made up the largest proportion of female athletes, followed by volleyball and basketball. According to the researchers, about 6 in 10 self-identified as White, a quarter as Black and the rest as Hispanic/Latino, Asian or another race/ethnicity. The average age of participants was 19 years old.

"We found in this cohort that sleep health, not even considering sleep apnea, was poor among athletes, with 36% reporting poor sleep quality and 22% reporting that they had trouble staying awake at least once in the past month while eating or engaging in social activities," Rim said. "Ensuring good sleep hygiene among these athletes is low-hanging fruit for improving overall health in this population,"

The study recorded anthropometrics (the systematic measurements of the human body to define a person's size and form), blood pressure and pulse wave velocity-a measurement that quantifies arterial stiffness, a precursor to hypertension. Participants also completed home sleep tests, which can detect abnormalities such as pauses in breathing during sleep. The primary outcomes were apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse wave velocity.

AHI is a key metric to diagnose and assess the severity of sleep apnea by determining how many apneas and hypopneas occur per hour. An apnea is a complete pause of breathing lasting more than 10 seconds, and a hypopnea is a partial reduction in airflow lasting more than 10 seconds. OSA is diagnosed either by an AHI greater than five events per hour accompanied with associated symptoms like daytime sleepiness or unrefreshing sleep or an AHI score greater than 15 events per hour regardless of symptoms. According to Rim, between five events and 15 events per hour is "mild," 15 to 30 is "moderate," and anything over 30 is "severe."

In this study participants ranged from 2.1 events to 7.7 events per hour and 25% were considered to have mild sleep apnea. No athletes had a measured AHI over 15 events per hour. Pulse wave velocity was higher in athletes with mild sleep apnea and was associated with higher AHI. The study found greater age and lean mass were independent predictors of sleep apnea, which the researchers said suggests sleep apnea may become more prevalent with higher levels of training in female athletes.

According to the researchers, while this is the largest study of sleep apnea among female athletes, it is limited in its generalizability given the small sample size. Future studies are needed to confirm the findings.

"Ideally, a future study would include multi-campus projects that track athletes over several seasons, compare men and women directly, and evaluate whether treating mild apnea reduces these early measures of cardiovascular risk. Treatment of OSA in older trials through CPAP haven't always been shown to mitigate risk, so it would be helpful to see if treatment at a younger age could improve on this," Rim said.

 About 30% of all respiratory tract infections are caused by coronaviruses, leading to widespread illnesses and, in some cases, to epidemic and even pandemic outbreaks, as we experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the development of groundbreaking technology that enables the design of prophylactic vaccines, access to those vaccines is not equal across the globe, especially in low-resource countries, and also other hesitations prevent their adoption. 

In addition, coronavirus variants are emerging that can have higher infectivity and resistance to existing vaccines and antiviral treatments. Therefore, fast-acting antiviral drugs with broad activity against multiple respiratory coronaviruses and the ability to be rapidly distributed as oral treatments are urgently needed. 

In 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a multidisciplinary team of computational biologists, and infectious disease, medical chemistry and drug development experts formed at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. With early support from the Defense Advanced Research Agency (DARPA), the team, led by Wyss Founding Director Donald Ingber, M.D, Ph.D., sought to leverage the Wyss Institute's existing computational and biological modeling capabilities to rapidly repurpose existing FDA-approved drugs for the fight against the disease. 

By creating a cohesive AI-enabled and physics-based molecular modeling and drug discovery pipeline built around film industry procedural animation software, they identified the orally available, FDA-approved drug bemcentinib, as a potential antiviral agent. However, to further optimize its activity with follow up support from Open Philanthropy-Good Ventures Foundation, they used this chemical compound as a launch pad for developing a more specific and effective antiviral drug with efficacy against a broad range of coronaviruses. Their findings are published in Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences.

During COVID-19, many research groups sought to develop drugs that target the external surfaces of Spike proteins shared by coronaviruses, which bind to receptor molecules on the surface of host cells and mediate virus entry. At the start of the project, the researchers hypothesized that rather than targeting these external sites, which are prone to mutation under the pressure of vaccines and therapies, focusing on hidden regions of the Spike protein could offer unprecedented benefits.

"We thought that constant regions that remain hidden while the virus initially binds to its host cell, but become accessible during a critical time window when it prepares itself for membrane fusion could be ideal sites. Targeting those could be a way to essentially lock the virus in at the pre-fusion stage before it can release its genetic material into the cytoplasm of host cells," said first-author Charles Reilly, Ph.D., a former Wyss Principal Scientist who led the project with Ingber. "The major challenge lay in identifying these moving cogs for which we could design drugs that could work as a universal wrench for multiple coronaviruses." 

Previously, Reilly and Ingber had used tools from the film special effects industry to develop computational models of how molecules move and function from the atomic level to that of whole cells, and they used this to depict movements during the origins of human life – the fusion of a sperm with an egg cell – as featured in the short film, "The Beginning". 

The team used a similar approach to model the dynamic transformations that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein undergoes after binding its receptor and while literally moving towards fusion. To accomplish this complex modelling, they essentially animated a variety of structural snapshots of the Spike protein that other researchers had captured at different stages of virus binding and fusion in X-Ray crystallography and other studies. This "molecular dynamics simulation," based on actual physical features of the Spike protein, allowed them to generate "synthetic data" in which they could glean regions in the so-called S2 subunit of the protein that underwent large-scale mechanical transitions. By applying AI methods to their synthetic data, they were able to pinpoint a specific site within one of those mechanically highly-active regions that revealed itself at a pre-fusion step before facilitating the Spike protein's embedding within the host cell membrane. This key site had potential to function as a binding pocket for drug compounds that would gum up the works to prevent membrane fusion and viral entry and, importantly, it was shared by different members of the coronavirus family. 

To identify drugs that could precisely fit themselves into the predicted binding pocket within the Spike protein's S2 subunit, the researchers computationally screened through about 10,000 existing drugs and ranked them according to their predicted binding affinities to the pocket. The highest-ranking drug that was also orally available was bemcentinib, which in their AI-enabled simulations and molecular docking studies remained strongly bound across multiple structural changes the entire region was undergoing, eventually freezing it at the pre-fusion stage. In fact, the team, with drug development expertise of Wyss Senior Principal Scientist Sylvie Bernier, Ph.D., and Wyss' Senior Director, Translational R&D, Ken Carlson, Ph.D., demonstrated that bemcentinib potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells expressing the ACE2 receptor on their surface by preventing its entry into the cells.

Interestingly, the infection-blocking effect of bemcentinib had also been observed by other researchers, and bemcentinib had actually improved clinical outcomes in a clinical trial with hospitalized COVID-19 patients. But it was generally assumed that the drug had to function through its original target, the AXL kinase protein, which helps drive the growth of tumor cells.

To unequivocally prove that bemcentinib achieved its antiviral activity through our proposed mechanism and further improve its efficacy, we needed to create structurally similar compounds (analogs) that lack any affinity to AXL but retain their affinity to the Spike protein's binding pocket."

Charles Reilly, Ph.D., a former Wyss Principal Scientist

Joel Moore, Ph.D., a talented medicinal chemist on the team, designed a series of novel compounds, the best of which, dubbed WYS-633, inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into lung cells just like bemcentinib did and, importantly, without binding to AXL. WYS-633 also prevented SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from infecting cells, suggesting that the approach could indeed lead to a broad-spectrum antiviral drug against multiple coronaviruses. 

To further improve the drug-like features of WYS-633, also with an eye towards oral bioavailability, the team performed another round of medical chemistry, AI-enabled computational analysis, and in vitro testing, which culminated in WYS-694, an antiviral compound 12.5-fold more potent than WYS-633. In a last crucial step, Bernier, Carlson, and other members of the team tested WYS-694 as an oral prophylactic treatment in mice expressing the human ACE2 receptor, which they infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. While both bemcentinib and WYS-633 failed to reduce the viral load, WYS-694 reduced the viral load in the animals by more than 4-fold and significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection.

"While additional computational predictions using Google's AlphaFold 3 machine learning algorithm supported our central hypothesis, we will still have to demonstrate that WYS-694 precisely binds to the target site we identified in the Spike protein's S2 subunit through detailed structural studies, and that the interaction alone and no other potential target enables the antiviral activity," said Reilly. "But our findings are extremely compelling and open up a new path for dealing with viral outbreaks."

"By aiming for an orally available drug that broadly inhibits multiple coronaviruses, even as a prophylactic treatment, we deliberately set the bar at maximum height," said senior author Ingber. "Yet, our integrated approach merging new AI-driven computational and experimental technologies has proven to be incredibly powerful in achieving this goal. Beyond producing a promising new drug that could be useful in future respiratory pandemics, this approach holds great potential for the discovery of drugs against a number of other virus families utilizing membrane fusion proteins, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, Measles, and others." Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital and the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences.

Additional authors on the study were Shanda Lightbown and Austin Paul. The study was supported by the Wyss Institute at Harvard University, a contract from the DARPA (under contract #HR0011-20-2-0040), and additional funding by the Open Philanthropy–Good Ventures Foundation and Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

Your breath is one of a kind. A study published June 12 in the Cell Press journal Current Biology demonstrated that scientists can identify individuals based solely on their breathing patterns with 96.8% accuracy. These nasal respiratory "fingerprints" also offer insights into physical and mental health. 

The research stemmed from the lab's interest in olfaction, or the sense of smell. In mammals, the brain processes odor information during inhalation. This link between the brain and breathing led researchers to wonder: since every brain is unique, wouldn't each person's breathing pattern reflect that? 

To test the idea, the team developed a lightweight wearable device that tracks nasal airflow continuously for 24 hours using soft tubes placed under the nostrils. Most breathing tests last just one to 20 minutes, focusing on evaluating lung function or diagnosing disease. But those brief snapshots aren't enough to capture subtle patterns. 

You would think that breathing has been measured and analyzed in every way. Yet we stumbled upon a completely new way to look at respiration. We consider this as a brain readout." 

Noam Sobel, Author, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel

Sobel's team fitted 100 healthy young adults with the device and asked them to go about their daily lives. Using the collected data, the team identified individuals using only their breathing patterns with high accuracy. This high-level accuracy remained consistent across multiple retests conducted over a two-year period, rivaling the precision of some voice recognition technologies. 

"I thought it would be really hard to identify someone because everyone is doing different things, like running, studying, or resting," says author Timna Soroka of the Weizmann Institute of Science. "But it turns out their breathing patterns were remarkably distinct." 

Moreover, the study found that these respiratory fingerprints correlated with a person's body mass index, sleep-wake cycle, levels of depression and anxiety, and even behavioral traits. For example, participants who scored relatively higher on anxiety questionnaires had shorter inhales and more variability in the pauses between breaths during sleep. Soroka noted that none of the participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for mental or behavioral conditions. The results suggest that long-term nasal airflow monitoring may serve as a window into physical and emotional well-being. 

"We intuitively assume that how depressed or anxious you are changes the way you breathe," says Sobel. "But it might be the other way around. Perhaps the way you breathe makes you anxious or depressed. If that's true, we might be able to change the way you breathe to change those conditions." 

The current device still faces real-world challenges. A tube that runs under the nose is often associated with illness and may deter adoption. The device also doesn't account for mouth breathing and can slip out of place when sleeping. The team aims to design a more discreet and comfortable version for everyday use. 

Soroka and Sobel are already investigating whether people can mimic healthy breathing patterns to improve their mental and emotional states. "We definitely want to go beyond diagnostics to treatment, and we are cautiously optimistic," says Sobel.

Adding nivolumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year overall survival among patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to findings from a phase 3 trial presented at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting. The survival benefit was more pronounced in patients who achieved a pathologic complete response or a presurgery clearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).

“In this trial, we found that the use of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone, along with long-term benefit regarding event-free survival,” the authors wrote. “These findings support the hypothesis that neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy can have a profound impact on the course of a patient's life when paired with the curative potential of surgical resection.”

This study, led by Patrick M. Forde, MB, BCh, PhD, Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, was published online in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at ASCO.

Although the overall survival with nivolumab plus chemotherapy achieved statistical significance, the margin was narrow. Additionally, several subgroups in the exploratory analyses were too small for adequate statistical comparison, requiring cautious interpretation of these results. Black patients were underrepresented, which may have affected the generalizability of the findings.

This study was funded by Bristol Myers Squibb. Five authors declared being employees of Bristol Myers Squibb, with some holding stock or stock options with the company. Several authors declared working as consultants or having other ties with various sources including Bristol Myers Squibb.

This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process. Human editors reviewed this content before publication.

Now, the work presented at the 2025 annual EULAR congress in Barcelona adds two important pieces to the puzzle. First, a large-scale real-world study reporting no significantly higher risk of cancer in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to bDMARDs, and second an abstract looking at whether the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) which are causing waves in many fields including diabetes and obesity might offer cardiovascular protection in RA. 

Romain Aymon and colleagues set out to assess the cancer incidence in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD), using data from 13 registers. Cancers were linked to treatments within 5 years of cessation or until follow-up loss, death, or study end, whichever came first. Overall they identified 53,169 treatment initiations in 33,127 patients; 219 non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) were reported, plus 638 non-NMSC cancers. The crude incidence of non-NMSC cancer was lower for TNFi than both JAKi and bDMARDs with other mechanism of action (OMA), with rates of 2.2, 2.9, and 3.1 per 1000 patient-years. But further statistical analysis found no significant difference in the incidence of either cancer type between JAKi and TNFi, nor between JAKi and OMA. 

A sub-analysis was performed on patients aged 50 and older who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor – mimicking the inclusion criteria from ORAL Surveillance. This high-risk cohort made up 39.4% of treatment courses, and showed a higher cancer incidence in each treatment group: 3.2, 4.2, and 4.1 per 1000 patient-years for TNFi, JAKi, and OMA, respectively. But similarly to the overall population, there was no significant difference in the incidence of either cancer type between JAKi and either bDMARD group. 

The authors note that further analyses are planned, including additional registries to enhance statistical power and that they will evaluate the cancer incidence across different exposure periods – but in the meantime the findings look reassuring. 

Of note, the incidence of keratinocyte cancer – largely comprised of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma – is increasing in the general population. This could be due to UV light, but immune alteration has also been linked to increased risk – including in people with RA, but largely with data from the pre-biologic era. New work has set out to assess the risk of keratinocyte cancer in modern RA patients initiating treatment with b/tsDMARDs, including the risk of a second keratinocyte cancer. 21,121 people were identified from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register. Overall, 94 keratinocyte cancers were identified in people starting a JAKi, 407 with OMA, and 628 with a TNFi. When compared to TNFi, the hazard ratio for a keratinocyte cancer was 1.72 with JAKi and 0.81 with OMA, Among RA patients with a history of keratinocyte cancers, the hazard ratio for a second diagnosis was 2.76 for JAKi versus TNFi, and 1.54 for OMA versus TNFi. 

Presenting the work, Viking Huss said "these findings suggest that people with RA treated with a JAKi have a higher incidence of a first keratinocyte cancer, primarily driven by basal cell carcinoma. Additionally – although based on a limited number of events – we saw a higher incidence of a second cancer of this type with JAKi compared to TNFi." 

These findings support the notion that skin examination would be beneficial in this population, and skin cancer risks with JAKi treatment should be monitored. 

It is well-known that as well as increased cancer risks, people with RA are prone to cardiovascular complications, and in ORAL Surveillance JAKi were associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Conversely, GLP-1RA have demonstrated possible cardioprotective effects in other patient populations, with some agents now specifically approved for reducing cardiovascular risk. 

Asmaa Beltagy presented findings from a retrospective analysis of two cohorts of RA patients over the age of 40. All 2,449 patients were on JAKi, but one group subsequently initiated GLP-1RA, while the other group did not. The work assessed primary outcomes occurring within 5 years, including the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, cerebral infarction, acute peripheral arterial thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, and overall arterial events. 

The results show that patients taking a GLP-1RA had a significantly lower risk of acute coronary syndromes and deep venous thrombosis, with a trend towards a lower risk of acute cerebral infarction and peripheral arterial disease events, although the difference was not statistically significant. The overall incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly lower in GLP-1RA group. A survival analysis showed comparable probabilities between the two groups for all studied outcomes, with no significant difference in median survival. 

These findings underscore the potential of GLP-1RA to reduce certain CV risks in people with RA being treated with JAKi. However, not all effects were significant, and there remains a need for further research to validate the results.

A new study published in PLOS Mental Health has explored whether having a sibling born preterm (before 37 weeks of gestation) affects the behavior of children born at term. In a study by the University of Oulu, researchers found no evidence that siblings of preterm-born children experience more behavioral problems than those with only term-born siblings. However, children without any siblings showed higher levels of behavioral difficulties.

The study analyzed data from 65,711 children aged 14 and under, using information from birth cohorts in Denmark, Norway, Italy, and the Netherlands. Children were divided into three groups: those with at least one preterm-born sibling, those with only term-born siblings, and those without siblings. Researchers assessed internalizing behaviors—such as anxiety, depression and stress—and externalizing behaviours, including impulsivity, aggression and rule-breaking. Behavioral data were gathered using parental reports via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Child Behaviour Checklist. The results showed that children with preterm-born siblings did not differ significantly in behavioral outcomes compared to those with only term-born siblings.

In contrast, children without siblings had higher internalizing and externalizing scores. While the study did not identify a behavioral risk associated with having a preterm-born sibling, it highlights the need for further research. The authors note that the mental health of siblings and larger sample sizes for specific subgroups should be included in future longitudinal studies. Children with preterm-born siblings remain an understudied group that could potentially be at increased risk of mental health challenges. The researchers emphasize that continued investigation could provide essential evidence for targeted support, especially if future studies reveal specific vulnerabilities among siblings of preterm-born children.

The study analyzed all data using DataSHIELD, an analysis platform which allows remote access to data and aims to facilitate data sharing across institutions, whilst ensuring total data protection. The research was conducted as part of the European Union-funded LifeCycle project but was a larger collaboration involving projects such as LongITools and ATHLETE, part of the European Human Exposome Network. The LifeCycle project created the EU Child Cohort Network (EUCCN), which brings together data from 17 cohorts across Europe and Australia, and is featured in the larger European Health Research Data and Sample Catalogue developed in the other projects.

Inter Miami kick off their 2025 FIFA Club World Cup campaign on Saturday night when they face Al Ahly in the tournament opener in Miami. 

The Herons were controversially awarded their place in the competition, but will care little once the first whistle blows this weekend. The Herons, who will be playing in familiar surroundings during the group stage, will want to make a fast start. They face daunting opposition in 45-time Egyptian Premier League winners and record CAF Champions League victors Al Ahly. 

However, with Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets aiming to roll back the years on the world stage, Inter Miami will fancy their chances of causing an upset or two. For manager Javier Mascherano—a former clubmate of the ex-Barcelona quartet—it will be an opportunity to prove himself in the dugout. 

Here's how Inter Miami could line up for their upcoming duel. 

GK: Oscar Ustari—There were concerns over goalkeeper Oscar Ustari after he was withdrawn at halftime during the 5–1 victory over Columbus Crew at the beginning of the month, but the Argentine should be fit to guard the net. 

RB: Marcelo Weigandt—The defender is on loan from fellow Club World Cup competitors Boca Juniors and will be potentially tasked with thwarting former Aston Villa winger Trézéguet. 

CB: Maximiliano Falcón—Falcón has earned plenty of minutes in recent weeks and will have his hands full with Wessam Abou Ali, who has scored six goals in his last four matches for club and country. 

CB: David Martínez—An injury could force Gonzalo Luján to miss out against Al Ahly, with Paraguay international Martínez perhaps taking his place. He played over an hour in both of Miami's recent high-scoring wins. 

LB: Noah Allen—With the experienced Alba another injury doubt for Saturday, Allen could be asked to play at left back. The versatile young defender is earning plenty of experience this year under Mascherano. 

RM: Tadeo Allende—The Celta Vigo loanee has already scored eight goals in 20 appearances for Inter Miami, including two in his last three. He will take residence on the right wing. 

CM: Benjamin Cremaschi—Cremaschi has not been a constant starter in recent weeks. He featured from the off against Columbus Crew last time out and impressed in the heart of midfield. 

CM: Sergio Busquets—Busquets won the previous iteration of the Club World Cup on three separate occasions, although his chances of securing a fourth title with Miami are infinitesimal. 

LM: Telasco Segovia—Segovia has impressed since arriving from Portuguese side Casa Pia at the beginning of the year, with four goals and three assists for Inter Miami. He represented Venezuela twice over the June international break. 

ST: Lionel Messi—The man, the myth, the legend. Messi will draw more eyeballs than most at the Club World Cup despite being 37, and for good reason. Despite his age, he's managed 20 goal contributions in as many games for the Herons in 2025, eight of which have come in his last three outings. 

ST: Luis Suárez—Messi will steal the show at the Club World Cup, but Suárez will play a similarly colossal role for the Herons. The 38-year-old has eight goals and nine assists in all competitions this season.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. – Inter Miami's set of former FC Barcelona standouts have been on the FIFA Club World Cup stage before.

Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets won it all with Barcelona in 2009. Their Inter Miami coach, Javier Mascherano, came off the bench to help them win it again in 2011. Luis Suarez and Jordi Alba joined them to win it all in 2015.

Ten years later, the former Barcelona standouts are back in the Club World Cup together again – playing for a Major League Soccer club that was an expansion franchise before COVID-19 altered 2020.

Inter Miami will face Egyptian Premier League champion Al Ahly in the 2025 Club World Cup opener at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday at 8 p.m. ET. The match is available to live stream for free on DAZN, and will be broadcast on TNT.

The road to win the Club World Cup may be Inter Miami's toughest test to date since the Barcelona stars reconvened in the U.S. This is the first time the Club World Cup features 32 of the best clubs in the world, compared to just seven clubs in its past.

Al Alhy is regarded as one of the best teams in Africa. They've won 26 continental titles and 45 Egyptian Premiere League titles, including 16 of the last 20. They've played in the Club World Cup nine times, and finished in third place in 2006, 2020, 2021 and 2023.

Inter Miami also will face FC Porto, who compete in the Champions League out of Portugal, Thursday in Atlanta, and Palmerias, one of Brazil's best, in Miami on Monday during the group stage.

But Messi, Busquets, Suarez, Alba and Mascherano still have their fire and desire to win and prove they still can compete at the highest level – despite all being 36 and older.

“Well, it's an interesting competition. Having the chance to be part of it is exciting,” Messi said in an interview with FIFA this week. "The expectations I have are different to the ones I had when I played for other teams, but I'm eager and I look forward to competing against the best, and doing well.”

Inter Miami's stars have all shined and experienced heartbreak on bigger stages than this.

Messi, turning 38 on June 24, crowned his career by leading Argentina to the World Cup title in Qatar in 2022, sandwiched between Copa America titles in 2021 and 2024. Mascherano, 41 and a first-year MLS coach, was there with Messi for much of the national-team heartbreak they experienced in both tournaments before those victories.

Busquets, 36, was part of Spain's World Cup winning side in 2010, while he and Alba, 36, were part of Spain's Euro championship in 2012. Suarez, 38, led Uruguay to the Copa America title in 2011, but not the same success in four World Cups.

They know anything can happen in this Club World Cup.

“In this kind of tournament – in the World Cup, the Copa América, in all tournaments – there's always a team that surprises you and has the ability to do so,” Suarez said before Friday's practice. “We have players who can make a difference, so let's hope that the team that surprises is us.”

Inter Miami started this season unbeaten in their first 14 matches across all competitions (11 wins and three draws), but hit a major slump toward the end of April when they were bounced by the Vancouver Whitecaps 5-1 on aggregate score in the semifinals of the Concacaf Champions Cup.

Since April 24, Inter Miami has played 10 matches – they've lost five of them and had two draws. They were outscored 23-15 in the first eight matches, before outscoring CF Montreal and Columbus Crew 9-3 in two wins before the Club World Cup.

Inter Miami, despite its aging stars, has flaws that could be exposed during this Club World Cup.

It also doesn't help they could be without Alba, one of their best playmakers who sustained a hamstring injury against Columbus May 31. Midfielder Yannick Bright (hamstring) and defender Gonzalo Luján (hamstring) also will not be available for the match.

Mascherano is hopeful they can return at some point in the next two matches.

"I think it's a great opportunity for us to measure ourselves, to see what level we're really at – beyond the fact that we already know what level we're at within the MLS, within Concacaf, having reached the final stages of the Concacaf Champions League,” Mascherano said during his pre-match press conference.

“Now, the level is higher, and we want to rise to the occasion.”

Let's remember, Sounders actually earned this spot.

Competence can be boring.

We all know the feelings we get from the dependable, the tried-and-true: the familiar rituals that give us structure, the colleagues you love at work who make things clearer and simpler for those around them, helping everyone get on with their lives.

It's a little different when our shift is over and we actually want to feel something, be it at the theater, a stadium, a concert or just sitting in front of our televisions at home. Some emotions, a little drama, hot mess or even heart-pounding tension can bring color and depth to our lives, even with some accompanying stress.

I'm talking about the MLS teams in the Club World Cup, of course.

After years of buildup, the hyped, heated event is finally here. The host nation's top flight has three entries, triple the number of MLSers that had taken part in all previous editions combined – which would be exactly one, the Sounders in 2023, though they were actually participating in the 2022 CWC, which… OK, let's not get sidetracked.

Of that trio, the consensus among both pundits and oddsmakers is that Seattle, despite enjoying the most pronounced home-field advantage, face the longest odds of making a run into the CWC knockout stages, mostly because of the (un)luck of the draw that dropped them into a group of death alongside the reigning champions of Europe and South America as well as one of Spain's elite sides.

Despite kinder group-stage assignments, Inter Miami and LAFC still have ample work to do against potent opponents, as Backheeled.com recently noted, whose squads are rated as somewhere between three and 19 times as valuable as their own by Transfermarkt. Even MLS commissioner Don Garber sounds pretty bearish about the economic realities crimping the hopes of the league's three representatives.

That's unfortunate. Because as skeptical as the global audience appears to be about this tournament, it nevertheless remains arguably the biggest stage MLS teams have ever stepped foot on, a rare opportunity to assert the league's competitive and qualitative credentials. And despite the mountain the Sounders will have to climb just to reach respectability this month, they're the most appropriate MLS flagship imaginable. For better or for worse.

From day one, Seattle has been a beacon of sense and sustainability in a league with regulations that deter the latter. Sounders fans know the bullet points better than anyone: four U.S. Open Cups, a Supporters' Shield, two MLS Cups, two more MLS Cup final appearances, playoffs qualification in 15 of 16 MLS seasons, a constant perch at or near the top of the attendance rankings, and best-in-class media coverage, local relevance and supporter culture year after year.

The Rave Green showed everyone that a consistent contender dips into every bucket: Designated Player recruitment; academy cultivation and player development; smart trades and drafting; investment in the middle of the roster; physical infrastructure; staff hires; data analytics; and frankly every other buzzword that describes the parts of an organization.

As SaH's Brian McKay analyzed in pointed detail back in January, general manager Craig Waibel took this approach to a new level over the winter with the acquisition of Jesús Ferreira and Paul Arriola and the re-signing Albert Rusnák, pragmatically valuing depth and proven productivity at the risk of leaving some observers let down by a relative lack of sizzle.

I get the distinct sense that a significant number of Sounders fans are quite tired of hearing all this. And yeah, doing your big-ticket shopping at FC Dallas is inherently less sexy than hitting up Tottenham Hotspur or Boca Juniors. Maybe there's inherently less ‘ambition' involved, as subjective as that word can be. Like I said, competence can be boring.

Anyone pining for bigger, bolder swings on the transfer market may want to glance over at the profound struggles former club president Garth Lagerwey and Atlanta United are currently experiencing after a record-breaking offseason shopping spree. Or the worst-ever title defense being produced by the LA Galaxy after they redlined on the cap to grab last year's championship. Working within the limitations imposed by MLS salary-budget rules can be annoying; it's still the name of the game for any club interested in contending over the long haul rather than riding the rollercoaster from feast to famine.

Inter Miami has its (drastically different) model, and it may well be pushing the league forward just as Seattle's arrival did all those years ago. It's fundamentally built, however, on the transcendence of Leo Messi – a one-of-one world talent – which is by definition not a replicable blueprint. Life has been rather stormy even with the bounty of talent the GOAT has helped recruit to the Herons, their chronically leaky defense and propensity for drama both on the pitch and in the office making them MLS's most gripping telenovela since 2023.

LAFC sit somewhere between Miami and Seattle on this spectrum, yet have only been around a fraction as long as SSFC and enjoy the particular advantages of being based in Los Angeles, a huge and uniquely attractive market in which to work, not only for players like Hugo Lloris and Olivier Giroud but also the well-heeled, well-connected Hollywood types who populate their ownership group. The Sounders' way is the long cut, by comparison.

So Seattle is the prototype here. No one else has figured out how to thrive in this soil quite like they have. And if the Sounders are indeed hopelessly outgunned at the CWC, that reflects as much or more on their league as it does their team, and the scale of the work still to be done in North American soccer over the coming decades.

The 2025 Concacaf Gold Cup starts this weekend, and the United States Men's National Team's path to an eighth Gold Cup title kicks off Sunday, June 15 in San Jose, California against Trinidad and Tobago. The USMNT will continue their group stage with back-to-back matches in Texas against Saudi Arabia on Thursday, June 19 and Haiti on Sunday, June 22.

Head coach Mauricio Pochettino released his 26-player roster last week, and it includes a mix of familiar faces and young talent. Miles Robinson, the hero for the United States in the 2021 Gold Cup final victory over Mexico, appears alongside other stalwart defenders such as Walker Zimmerman, Tim Ream and goalkeeper Matt Turner. Their experience will lead a group that is the third youngest to start the Gold Cup for the United States.

The USMNT looks to continue its command in the biennial tournament that has crowned the U.S. continental champions seven out of 17 times. Historically, the United States has dominated the group stage, totaling a 40-1-5 record and winning their group in 16 out of 17 Gold Cups, including the most recent competition in 2023.

Here's a look at the upcoming group stage schedule for the United States and the opponents:

FIFA World Ranking: No. 100

The United States has dominated the series against Trinidad and Tobago, winning 17 of 18 meetings on American soil. The most recent matchup between the two sides came November 2023 in the Concacaf Nations League tournament. At Port of Spain, the capital city of Trinidad and Tobago, the Americans played more than 50 minutes down to 10 men, and Trinidad and Tobago took advantage to record a 2-1 win. Playing in the States – which the Gold Cup primarily does — gives the USMNT a huge advantage, winning 17 of 18 matches against Trinidad and Tobago and outscoring the Caribbean nation 41-0 over the last 12.

With a win Sunday, the United States could equal its longest home winning streak against any opponent, tying with Ecuador, which the U.S. has beaten 16 consecutive times.

Kickoff: Sunday, June 15, 2025 – 6:00 p.m. ET at PayPal Park (San Jose, Calif.)

FIFA World Ranking: No. 58

The United States has only faced Saudi Arabia once in the past five years, a scoreless draw in an international friendly in September 2022. Before then, Saudi Arabia appeared in the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar where it most notably shocked the soccer world and defeated Argentina early in the group stage, handing the eventual and current reigning World Cup champions their only loss of the tournament.

Saudi Arabia enters the Gold Cup still alive in qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, earning a result in three of their last four AFC qualifying matches. This is the highest-ranked opponent the United States will face in the group stage.

Kickoff: Thursday, June 19, 2025 – 9:15 p.m. ET at Q2 Stadium (Austin, Texas)

FIFA World Ranking: No. 83

The United States has a longstanding history playing against Haiti, and the series dates all the way back to 1941 when the USSF was known as the U.S. Football Association. While Haiti owned the first half of the all-time series, the United States has been the far better team over the past several decades and has not lost to Haiti since 1973. The two nations have met four times in Gold Cup action, and the USA has never lost, earning three wins and one draw.

Kickoff: Sunday, June 22, 2025 – 7:00 p.m. ET at AT&T Stadium (Arlington, Texas)

The Gold Cup quarterfinals will be held June 28-June 29 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Ariz. and U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The semifinals take place July 2 at Energizer Park in St. Louis and Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. 

Sixteen teams will look to make it to Houston, Texas where the final will be played at NRG Stadium on July 6. Among those in contention are defending champions Mexico in Group A. The United States and Mexico have dominated the tournament, and the two countries have combined to win 16 out of 17 times. Mexico won the last time around in 2023, beating a Panama side that outlasted the United States in penalty kicks in the semis. The Americans won the Gold Cup prior in 2021, swiping the trophy from Mexico thanks to Robinson's epic game-winning header in extra time.

The Club World Cup begins in the United States on Saturday evening

The much-discussed and widely derided Club World Cup will finally get under way in Miami at 01:00 BST on Sunday.

Fifa's revamped and newly expanded tournament is being played for the first time in the United States amid the backdrop of apparent ticketing issues and accusations of little regard for player welfare.

It will be something of a dress rehearsal for the 2026 World Cup in the US, with five of the venues - Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Hard Rock Stadium, MetLife Stadium, Lincoln Financial Field and Lumen Field - also hosting matches next year.

Most of the merits and concerns were discussed over the course of last season, but what are the views of those putting it on, and taking part?

Your guide to the 2025 Club World Cup

The NZ part-timers looking to shock Bayern and Benfica

Mbappe, Messi & Ramos - big names set for Club World Cup

With the big kick-off looming, talk is rife that ticket sales are slow.

Lionel Messi's Inter Miami headline the first game, and world governing body Fifa declined to comment when asked by BBC Sport about sales for their match against Al Ahly at the 65,000-capacity Hard Rock Stadium.

Some reports, external suggest an offer was made to students at Miami Dade College that if they bought one ticket for $20 (£14.70) they would get four free. Sources have said  the college is a partner of Fifa and tickets being offered may be taken up by students who would not usually have an interest in football.

A search on reselling website Ticketmaster on Friday showed tickets still available for purchase for Saturday's game, with the cheapest costing £48. It has been reported that when sales opened in December, the cheapest available was £257.

Speaking at a media event this week, Fifa president Gianni Infantino said: "I expect a full stadium. We will have an incredible atmosphere. It's historic.

"We have two teams in that game with very different stories: a young team like Inter Miami that is already known around the world, and the team that has won more trophies than any team in Africa, with millions of fans around the world."

Tickets for the tournament have been sold under a dynamic pricing model, with prices determined by demand. A lower price suggests less interest.

There are still tickets available for every match, with the majority of fixtures having seats for as little as £45 - and some even as low as £25.

Some matches, understandably, appear to have attracted more interest than others. Tickets for Real Madrid's first match against Al-Hilal - also at the Hard Rock Stadium - are only available for in excess of £166.

Paris-St Germain's opener against Atletico Madrid also appears to be selling well, with the cheapest tickets now priced at £60.

With reports that sections of stadiums are being closed,, external only once the tournament kicks off will we get the full picture.

Fans in the US, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Canada lead the way for tickets purchased, with the UK 11th on that list.

Infantino said: "It starts a new era of football, a new era of club football. A little bit like in 1930, the first World Cup started.

"Everyone today speaks about the very first World Cup. That's why this World Cup here is historic.

"I'm a positive person generally, but they criticise Fifa if the prices are too high, then they criticise Fifa if the prices are too low. Then they criticise Fifa if we make ticketing promotions with students. Students! When I was a student and I didn't have money, I would have loved Fifa to come to me and say: 'You want to come and watch a World Cup match?'"

MLS players have been embroiled in a row with their association regarding bonuses for the tournament

Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, external has said there is not "any appetite" for the tournament from "players, clubs and even supporters" - but does this ring true?

Speaking to Fifa channels, Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane said playing in the tournament would be a "great experience", Monterrey defender Sergio Ramos said his side were approaching it with "a lot of hunger", and Chelsea midfielder Enzo Fernandez said the competition would be "watched by the whole world".

The big European teams involved have all named strong squads, with the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Jude Bellingham and Antoine Griezmann all set to feature. Manchester City, meanwhile, have spent more than £100m on players to bolster their squad in preparation for the competition.

Asked how Americans will respond to the event, former US national team boss Jurgen Klinsmann told BBC Sport: "You have big names coming in from South America and the European teams, and mixed in with the Mexican and American teams, you will get some excitement over here.

"Obviously, it will not be like that for every game. They will cherry-pick their games a little bit. The American people are event-driven - they pick their concerts, their sport, their games.

"It will be very interesting to see how they pick it, but I think there will be some very, very interesting games from those clubs that will come into the country.

"It will spark some excitement for the World Cup next summer."

But things feel rather low-key in Miami in the build-up to the opening game, with few banners or billboards advertising this global spectacle of 'soccer'.

Boca Juniors T-shirts have been the most popular seen on the streets, and it has been difficult to spot fans wearing Messi tops in the city where he plays his club football.

With the action about to begin, Fifa and the Club World Cup itself could do with a spark of magic from Messi to rouse local interest. It that does not materialise, it may bring about more disdain from those who are already unconvinced.

'Looking forward to it' or 'not really bothered'? Fans on Club World Cup  

Club World Cup is 'ridiculous', says Frank

Fifa has been criticised from multiple angles about the tournament, which has increased to 32 teams and is set to be hosted every four years.

This week alone, Spanish La Liga president Javier Tebas, external described the Club World Cup as "absurd" and said Fifa had not "consulted us about anything".

Manchester City will be in action 24 days after playing their final game of the 2024-25 domestic season, and City players such as Ballon d'Or winner Rodri and defender Manuel Akanji have previously raised concerns about the relentless fixture schedule.

In January, players' union Fifpro and Fifa met to discuss the packed calendar.

That was after Fifpro filed a legal complaint against the organisation led by Infantino, accusing it of an "abuse of dominance".

Clearly, some strong and forthright views have been aired.

But senior Fifa sources have told BBC Sport the protection of player welfare has  been at the core of decision-making, pointing to initiatives such as a fund for players, additional substitutes in competitions and permanent concussion substitutes.

Suggestions the competition has contributed to further congestion in the fixture calendar were firmly dismissed, with a source saying it was "not caused by the Club World Cup".

It was pointed out that a maximum of seven Club World Cup games will be played by two teams every four years, with the slot for the competition replacing the one previously used for the Fifa Confederations Cup.

A £775m prize pot will be split between the teams, with the tournament winners earning up to £97m, but uneven distribution will mean European clubs earn more for taking part than those from other continents.

Meanwhile, Major League Soccer players have been embroiled in a row, external with their association regarding bonuses for the tournament.

Earlier this month, the Seattle Sounders team, who are in Group B alongside Champions League winners PSG, warmed up in T-shirts with 'Club World Ca$h Grab' written on the front.

Money is clearly a major issue across the board at this Fifa showpiece.

Sources said the tournament was inclusive, with an aim to "grow the game globally", and that the distribution model for prize money "respects every confederation" and "strongly incentivises" good performances.

The long and controversial story of the FIFA Club World Cup has been shaped by Saudi Arabia, COVID-19, Gianni Infantino, and a little of the NASA space missions.


          Sports correspondent
              @RobHarris


Friday 13 June 2025 18:09, UK

Among Donald Trump's gilded additions to the Oval Office, one ornament stands out: symbolising power plays in sport and geopolitics. 

The outlandish, elaborate golden discs form football's newest prize: the Club World Cup that will be handed out in New Jersey on 14 July, after 63 matches across 11 American cities.

The trophy has become part of presidential theatre, prominent for all the major announcements - from nuclear warnings to Iran to celebrating the trade deal with Britain.

It was hand-delivered to Mr Trump three months ago by Gianni Infantino, the FIFA president whose name is etched into it. Twice.

This whole competition - supersizing an old, little-regarded format from seven to 32 clubs - is very much Mr Infantino's creation to reshape world football and extend FIFA's reach into the club game.

For a trophy inspired by NASA missions into space - featuring astronomy and maps - it also signals how Mr Infantino has gained influence in Mr Trump's orbit.

Becoming the commander-in-chief's closest non-American associate has secured invites to political speeches as well as sporting trips.

The alliance - contentious given Mr Trump's rhetoric and interventions on topics such as immigration and diversity - is defended as fast-tracking decision-making at the highest level.

This Club World Cup (CWC) is in many ways the test event for the more complex tournament next summer, as the World Cup is contested by 48 men's national teams across the US, Canada, and Mexico.

"I think it is absolutely crucial for the success of a World Cup to have a close relationship with the president," Mr Infantino said.

But the CWC begins against the backdrop of immigration raids and violent protests in Los Angeles amid concerns fans could be targeted or denied entry to FIFA events.

Saudi Arabia's role

This was a tournament intended to launch in China in 2021 until the pandemic shook the world and interest in football waned in the country once heavily courted by FIFA.

And so attention shifted to Saudi Arabia.

It can appear that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has bailed out Mr Infantino, bankrolling his pet project.

There was little interest from FIFA's usual World Cup broadcasters - BBC and ITV in Britain - until loss-making streamer DAZN stepped in with a $1bn (£736m) deal, just around the time Saudi Arabia was handed the hosting of the 2034 World Cup.

That was followed by DAZN selling a 10% stake to SURJ, an investment firm owned by Saudi's sovereign wealth fund, chaired by MBS.

And then, completing the circle, the Public Investment Fund signed up as a CWC sponsor less than two weeks before the tournament begins.

PIF also owns Al-Hilal, who qualified as Asian Champions League winners for the CWC in a group featuring Real Madrid.

A Super League?

Given Mr Infantino maintains the extravaganza features the 32 best teams in the world, what, for example, are RB Salzburg doing there?

While four of Europe's slots went to recent Champions League winners, the other eight went to the best-performing teams ranked by European results in recent years.

Follow our channel and never miss an update.

And while Liverpool should have made the cut by that measure, FIFA imposed a cap on two teams per country unless they had all qualified as competition winners.

So FIFA only has Chelsea and Manchester City, although Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were handed a place as national champions despite not actually winning the main American soccer title.

To some, this could seem to be the genesis of a Super League - the aborted European breakaway in 2021 - in a different guise.

Champions League organiser UEFA once tried to thwart the CWC, given it could diminish the status of its own competition, before caving-in to FIFA.

And while selling tickets and finding viewers will be challenging, it will be lucrative for the participants.

That Saudi $1bn (£736m) is all going back to clubs, with up to $125m (£92m) for the winners.

Workload concerns

Chelsea and City have already played 57 matches this season - now up to seven more are being bolted on.

And their players could have had up to 10 international matches over the last year, including two in the gap between the end of the domestic season and the CWC trip.

It is why - in plans first revealed by Sky News in 2023 - global players' union FIFPRO has launched a legal challenge claiming FIFA has abused a dominant position to risk the health of players.

But the European Commission has not officially taken up the case to prevent this launch.

And, given that other FIFA events have already expanded - or are expanding - to 48 finalists, the Club World Cup could be here to stay - and even get even bigger.

There is also still the delayed women's tournament, which is set to finally launch in 2028.

Liverpool could break the British transfer record to sign Florian Wirtz while Thomas Frank may bring two Brentford stars with him to Spurs

Time to sign off – here's a run-down of Friday's main stories:

Liverpool agree £116m deal to sign Leverkusen's Wirtz

Tottenham target Mbeumo and Wissa after Frank arrival

John Brewin takes a look at the Spurs manager's in-tray

Club World Cup kicks off amid extreme heat fears …

… plus concerns over the political climate in the US

City could loan out Grealish having received no offers

Everton have turned their attentions to the Villarreal striker Thierno Barry as David Moyes attempts to improve his forward options for next season.
 Barry, 22, scored 11 goals in La Liga last season and 19 overall as Villarreal qualified for the Champions League. The France under-21 international is understood to have a release clause of €40m in his contract with the Spanish club but Everton would hope to sign him for less. Barry is currently on international duty at the Under-21 Euros in Slovakia.
 Moyes' need to upgrade Everton's attack is pressing, with the club having missed out on Liam Delap, and declined to take up an option to sign Armando Broja on a permanent deal from Chelsea. Dominic Calvert-Lewin is expected to leave on a free transfer this summer, which would leave only Beto and the unproven Youssef Chermiti as central striking options.

How about Dilated Peoples' “Wirtz comes to Wirtz?” asks Fadden Holden, shouting to be heard over bass-heavy speakers while the DJ nods approvingly.

Saudi Arabia currently hosts annual four-team Italian and Spanish Super Cup events, so it makes sense that the Saudi Super Cup is being held in … Hong Kong. The tournament will take place in August at the Hong Kong Stadium, with Al-Ittihad, Al-Qadisiyah, Al-Hilal and Al-Nassr taking part.

Tottenham have tempted Thomas Frank across London to become their new manager – now they could swoop for two of his Brentford stars. Ed Aarons reports:

More potential Wirtz chants from Peter Oh – “Wirtz Science by Oingo Boingo?” – and Nick Smith, who suggests “Wirtz going on?”

More than 170 transfers in the top five men's leagues this summer, and we're barely into June. And it's been even busier in women's football:

On this day in 2004, England led France 1-0 heading into stoppage time in Lisbon. Fabian Barthez had saved David Beckham's penalty, but England were heading for victory regardless. Until Zinedine Zidane got involved …

Celtic fans will face further Hampden Park ticket sanctions after the Scottish champions were one of three clubs to be hit with disciplinary charges relating to pyrotechnics.

The SPFL has revealed that Celtic, Aberdeen and Partick Thistle face notices of complaint. In March, Celtic and Rangers were hit with an immediate reduction of 500 tickets for the next League Cup match to be played at Hampden as a result of similar offences at the final in December.

Celtic were also handed a suspended reduction of 800 tickets, which it appears has been breached. The club were cited over a “large-scale orchestrated pyrotechnic display” which took place on the final day of the season against St Mirren.

The flares were accompanied by a banner directed at chief executive Michael Nicholson which read: “Fan engagement up in smoke”. PA Media

“Not quite a holiday, but I met John Collins when doing my Duke of Edinburgh bronze expedition in the Lake District,” writes Chris Little. “Me and my mates got lost and found this fancy hotel where we thought we'd ask directions. I went in to ask for help and the Celtic midfield maestro was stood at reception. He asked if I was OK and when I explained, he hollered for the receptionist to help me. Top bloke.”

“Big challenge lies ahead for Liverpool fans like myself ahead of Florian's arrival,” writes Graeme Neill. “His name doesn't exactly lend itself well to chants. An REM-inspired Everybody Wirtz isn't going to get the Kop bouncing, nor a rendition of the Nine Inch Nails song. I guess there's perhaps scope for a spin on this belter…” Nailed it.

He's not done yet: James Milner has agreed a one-year extension to his Brighton deal. “I'm really pleased we will have James with us again this season,” said Fabian Hürzeler. “He's a great guy to have in our environment, who is always there for me and the team.”

Milner will turn 40 in January and could join an elite group of outfield players to feature in the Premier League after their 40th birthday – including Teddy Sheringham, Ryan Giggs, Kevin Phillips and Gordon Strachan.

Milner, who only played four times last season due to injuries, also needs 15 more games to equal Gareth Barry at the top of the Premier League's all-time appearance list.

Here's today's Football Daily, by me, on Gianni's big geopolitical headache.

Speaking of Inzaghi, he has helped lead Pisa back to Serie A for the first time in 34 years – but won't be there to coach them in the top flight. He's left his role by mutual consent, and is expected to take over at Palermo, returning to the second tier with the CFG-affiliated Sicilian side.

Thanks Will, and hi everyone. I don't have any great tales of meeting footballers on holiday, but I did once spot Pippo Inzaghi at an airport in the Czech Republic. At least I think it was him.

Thank you very much for joining me. The delightful Niall McVeigh will take you through to the end of time.

Steven Pressley understands why some Dundee fans were unhappy with his appointment as head coach but believes he will be a better leader for his time away from the front line.

The club's selection of the former Rangers, Dundee United, Hearts, Celtic and Scotland defender was not particularly well received among supporters given Pressley's previous role as a manager ended when he was sacked by Carlisle in 2019. For the past four years, the former Falkirk, Coventry, Fleetwood and Pafos manager has been head of individual player development at Brentford while completing a masters degree in strategic leadership.

When asked about the fans' reaction at his first media conference, Pressley said: “I understand how the business works. The only way to win supporters over is to win and get results. But I am aware there has to be a period of growth before we get success. Make no mistake, I am aware we need to win games and we are working extra hard to do so. Regardless of if everyone was happy with the appointment, you will be judged in the same way.”

The 51-year-old added: “If you're a Dundee supporter and you're looking for a manager with a history of producing titles and winning honours, then I'm not your man. I'm perfectly honest, I'm not your man. I've not demonstrated that as yet. I hope I can demonstrate that moving forward but my career to date doesn't suggest that.

“But certainly from a development perspective and certainly from creating a style of play and a way a team performs, I have demonstrated that over the course. And I would like to think the four or five years that I have had out of football, not just the education I had at Brentford but I have also been working on my university career, all of those in the mix I hope brings a different type of leadership than I gave before. Hopefully with that leadership we can bring some form of success.” PA Media.

Joe Pearson gets in touch: “My story concerns a different kind of footballer, the NFL kind. My wife and I were returning from Hawaii on a red-eye in 1990, I think. We had been upgraded to first class as a gift. Sat right across the aisle from us was Billy Sims, Heisman Trophy winner and former running back for the Detroit Lions. Given that it was basically the middle of the night, I did not approach him at all. Opportunity missed, I guess.”

Mikey Moore is excited to show new Tottenham boss Thomas Frank what he can do – but the teenager's immediate focus is ending an unforgettable breakthrough campaign with another European trophy.

The winger was given his chance by Ange Postecoglou, who was sacked last week but with have to reset for his new head coach. “With Ange, I'm thankful to him,” Moore said. “He gave me an opportunity to go and show people what I could do. Now I'm just excited to get back and hopefully go and impress the new manager. Try and show what I can do, really. I started away at Brentford, where obviously he was in charge, and I've played against his team before.

“I've heard that he's a good man and he's a good manager. One of the boys here (with the Under-19s) works under him and says good things about him, so I'm just excited to get going under him, really.” PA Media

Thomas Frank is now the main man at Tottenham. John Brewin takes a look at what he needs to sort out.

Real Madrid have beaten off plenty of competition to sign teenage sensation Franco Mastantuono from River Plate. Most of the top clubs in Europe were eager to acquire the Argentinian but Xabi Alonso has won the race.

“It's not a footballers on holiday story but is along those lines,” writes Martin Cruise. “I was once working away in glamorous Telford where upon walking into the hotel bar I strangely seemed to recognise everyone I looked at despite being away on my own. After a queue at the bar for a drink alongside more men I recognised I sat somewhat discombobulated at a table thinking I was in some sort of fever dream.

“I went back for another swift pint and a rather large gent bumped into me on his way out of the gents at which point I recognised the recently departed Uriah Rennie. He apologised and I said “just a yellow on this occasion” to a giant smile and a chuckle from Mr Rennie. It then dawned on me that the entire bar was filled with Premier League referees (your Mike Riley's, Phil Dowd's and so on) on their training activities in what was then the new era of professional refs.”

That is lovely stuff.

Juventus head coach Igor Tudor has signed a new deal with the club, running until June 2027, with the option of a further year.

The Croatian took the role in March and proved himself in the final months of the season that he deserved a long-term crack at the gig. Tudor will lead Juventus at the Club World Cup, where they will play Manchester City, Al Ain and Wydad AC.

Brentford are expected to target an external candidate to replace Thomas Frank despite holding talks with Keith Andrews about stepping up from his role as set-piece coach.
 The former Republic of Ireland midfielder has emerged as a potential candidate for the post after Frank's departure was confirmed on Thursday night. Andrews joined Brentford last summer and is highly regarded by Brentford but it is understood he is unlikely to be given his first senior role in management despite being made the favourite by some bookmakers. 
 Brentford's owner, Matthew Benham, is believed to have considered promoting Justin Cochrane from his role as Frank's assistant until the 43-year-old former midfielder, who is part of Thomas Tuchel's England staff, opted to join Tottenham instead. 
 That means that Brentford are likely to turn their attention to other candidates thought to include Ipswich's Kieran McKenna - who is a long-term target - and the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic.

I really enjoyed this from the great John Brewin this week. You should too.

Tottenham have filed high court proceedings against Manchester United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe's company Ineos over a terminated sponsorship agreement.

Court records show Spurs filed a commercial claim at the high court against Ineos Automotive on Thursday, though no documents are available. Chemicals firm Ineos agreed a five-year deal with Spurs in 2022 - before Ratcliffe bought a stake in United – for Ineos Grenadier to become the London team's official 4x4 vehicle partner.

Ineos said in a statement: “Ineos Automotive has been a partner of Tottenham Hotspur since 2022, expanding on a partnership agreement that Ineos Group had in place with the club since 2020. We have a contractual right to terminate our partnership contract and in December 2024 exercised that right.”

Spurs declined to comment.

In March it was announced Ineos had reached a settlement with New Zealand Rugby in relation to a sponsorship deal. The previous month, NZR had said it had launched legal proceedings against Ineos after alleging that the first instalment of 2025 sponsorship money due under a six-year agreement struck in 2021 had not been paid.

Chris Boyle reminisces: “When I was nine we stayed at the same resort in Portugal as legendary striker John Aldridge. As a Liverpool-mad kid, this was incredible, even more so as John and his family were very down to earth and friendly. I have happy memories of him and my Dad ‘singing' La Bamba on karaoke. To add to the football-Stella Street vibe, Lee Dixon was also there (from memory he spent the time chasing after his small children and looking harassed) and we bumped into Joe Jordan at a water park. My days of holidaying alongside top flight footballers are highly unlikely to return (and much less appealing in my 40s tbf).”

Shaun Tooze gets in touch: “Met John Barnes in the queue at Qatar airport getting on the plane back to the UK (I was just connecting from Thailand) and we had a good old chat about the 1987/88 season - Barnes was on fire that season and I'd been lucky enough to see him play a handful of times (the 4-0 v QPR being the stand out.)

“Anyway, he was really normal, just a humble guy and you could see the glow as he recalled ‘They were happy days' and other bits.

“One thing that sticks out is that none of the flight crew knew who he was as I protested ‘ That's John Barnes...John Barnes!' after he'd passed them, and I just remember feeling deflated that none of them who he was.

“But I didn't bother him again because I didn't want to get all ‘fanboy' and in his face. (He was in economy by the way).

“Anyway. John Barnes. Nice guy.”

Fraser Mann emails: “On the topic of meeting footballers on holiday, me and my family shared a lift in a Spanish airport with Pat Jennings some time in the mid 80s. My mum had always had a bit of crush on him and was all over the shop to be stood so near to him. I said, ‘hello Mr Jennings, are you on holiday?' and he chuckled and said, ‘I hope so, otherwise I'm a bit far from home'. At which point, we all laughed very loudly as if it was the funniest thing anyone has said EVER. Cue awkward silence until the lift door opened and Pat left saying, ‘Be nice to your mum, son.'

“A strange encounter with the big handed Irish legend I'll think you'll agree. My mum still can't really talk about it.”

And rightly so.

This was published while I as on holiday. I hunted down some of the very few UK-based Chelsea and Man City fans heading over for the Club World Cup and asked “why?”.

In the meantime … Caio Carrieri has been chatting the Palmeiras president Leila Pereira.

“People think women are the weaker sex, and we're not. I fight back. If they hit me, I hit back – but much harder. The way I hit back is by continuing to work and by showcasing Palmeiras's work.”

Thank you Yara. Go enjoy the sunshine. Speaking of which … I was on holiday last week and the former Nottingham Forest and Manchester City manager Frank Clark was at the same hotel. I considered confronting him to ask why he played striker Craig Russell at left-back during his Maine Road days. Then I remember it was 30 years ago and Clark is now in his 80s. This, however, leads to the question … when have you met a footballer on holiday?

That is all from me today. Will Unwin is on deck to take you through the afternoon's stories. Happy Friday!

Bayer Leverkusen are expected to make an offer for Manchester City's James McAtee when the transfer window reopens according to multiple reports.

The 22-year-old is currently captaining the England U21s in Slovakia and any move to Germany cannot progress until after the U21s Euros and Club World Cup.

City expect a fee of at least £25m plus add-ons for McAtee. The player is understood to be keen to join Leverkusen if the clubs can come to an agreement.

Cardiff City are inching towards the appointment of Brian Barry-Murphy as their manager, as a protracted process heads towards the end game. The 46-year-old was appointed as Ruud van Nistelrooy's assistant by Leicester last December but Cardiff are expected to trigger his release.

Van Nistelrooy remains in the dark over his own future after relegation from the Premier League and the expectation remains that the Dutchman will leave this summer. Cardiff have flip-flopped over the decision after holding advanced talks with Des Buckingham, who is out of work after leaving Oxford, before landing on Barry-Murphy, whose only job as a No 1 was at Rochdale.

Aaron Ramsey also held discussions about taking the job on a permanent basis but the 34-year-old has agreed to prolong his playing career in Mexico with Pumas with a view of playing at the 2026 World Cup.

The postbag is here with some of your thoughts on the CWC, Wirtz and more.

Rick on Liverpool's newest acquisition:

For what it's Wirtz: it is truly wonderful that Liverpool have splashed the cash for Florian Wirtz as his fabulous talent will light up the PL next season and also make the Reds far more enjoyable to watch with real midfield creativity injected into the more effort based approach that has been the mainstay of the Klopp years and Slot's first season.

Makes a change to see the best player in the Bundesliga go to England rather than Munich or Madrid.

John on heatwave solutions:

As an Aussie who lives in the cooler City of Melbourne, I can attest to the temperature gauge getting it massively wrong from time to time.

Playing cricket in summertime in Australia is a mixed bag, but when you are playing in the middle of summer the heat doesn't miss you.

The air temperature said 35C on this hot day, but in the middle it felt like 42C. Needless to say standing around in white isn't as near taxing as running full tilt For 100 minutes as Footballers do. Short drinks break will be handy but not a solution. Maybe 7 subs per game?

And Rogorn on comparing the PL to Europe:

The wording of this bit of news reminds me of what I used to call the Matt Derbyshire Dilemma a few years ago, which was: would you rather play for Blackburn Rovers or Olympiacos? (That's how the club spells it now in Latin alphabet, by the way) I don't mean the league-winning 1995 Rovers or the current version down in the second tier, but the Rovers of around 2006, when they were middle of the Premier League table. (A few years ago, did I say? Blimey, it's 20 years ago!) I used the question to spark a debate whether English players would have a more interesting career staying in a 9th to 12th-placed club in England season after season or venturing into “lesser” (all due respect) continental sides, with a big chance of a league trophy and Champions League football. Derbyshire was the perfect example of that at a time when top English players abroad were a rarity. Of course, for a Greek player like Kostoulas the version of the MDD is different.

Gabriel Magalhães has described the Arsenal transfer target Rodrygo as a “phenomenon” and admitted he would like to see him join the north London club.

The Real Madrid winger, who plays with Gabriel for Brazil, is of interest to Arsenal this summer as they look to strengthen their attack after falling short in the Premier League race this season.

According to reports Rodrygo is questioning his future at Real Madrid amid fierce competition for places. The Brazilian is competing for places in the starting XI with Kylian Mbappé and Vinícius Júnior.

Asked if he knows whether Rodrygo is coming to Arsenal, Gabriel told the Podpah podcast in Brazil: “I don't know. I would like it but who knows? Rodrygo for me is a phenomenon. People are mentioning his name a lot. If it was up to me, of course. As I said, he is a phenomenon.”

David Beckham has been awarded a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours. The former England captain, a winner of league titles in four countries and of 115 national team caps, has been awarded the honour for services to sport and to charity.

Sir David also won the Champions League as part of Manchester United's treble-winning team in 1999, and since retiring as a player has become a founder and co-owner of American team Inter Miami.
 He has worked as an ambassador for the worldwide charity UNICEF since 2005 and since last year has been an ambassador for the King's Foundation.

Beckham said: “Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour. To have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true.

“Off the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation. I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.

“It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I'm immensely proud and it's such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.”

Rachel Daly, one of the stars of the England women's team which won the European Championship on home soil in 2022, has been made an MBE. The Harrogate-born star, 33, plays for Aston Villa in the Women's Super League but retired from international football last year.

Daly said: “I am greatly honoured to receive an MBE. This award is not just for me, but for everyone who has supported me and worked alongside me. It's a very proud moment for me and my family.”

Chelsea's first match at the Club World Cup is against Los Angeles FC where they will meet a familiar foe in Hugo Lloris.

The former Tottenham goalkeeper took some time to settle in but is now one of the MLS's best. Lloris played a pivotal role in getting LAFC to the tournament by making a big save late in extra time during the play-in match against Club América, one of Mexico's perennial powers.

The score was tied 1-1 in the 109th minute when Club América's Javairô Dilrosun (who, interestingly, has just signed with LAFC ahead of the Club World Cup) fired a blistering shot from eight yards out after a give-and-go with Diego Valdes. But Lloris reacted quickly and pivoted to his left to deflect the ball away from the near post. Six minutes later, Denis Bouanga scored to give LAFC a 2-1 victory.

Joseph D'Hippolito has the lowdown from Lloris and his teammates on his time in LA.

Brighton have signed the teenage forward Charalampos Kostoulas, who gave up a Champions League season with Olympiakos to play in the Premier League.

The 18-year-old Kostoulas signed a five-year contract, Brighton said, with the transfer fee reportedly set at an initial €35m.
 “It is a dream for everybody to come here and play football,” the Greece Under-21 striker said. He scored seven goals in 22 games in the Greek league as Olympiakos won a record-extending 48th title and completed a trophy double in the domestic cup.

Olympiakos was elevated directly into the lucrative Champions League opening phase — because title-holder Paris Saint-Germain already secured a place by winning the French league — and will play eight games in the single-standings league. Brighton finished eighth in the Premier League and did not qualify for European football. Associated Press

Thomas Frank and Spurs are a good fit on paper but the north London job will be a tough one for the Dane. Frank is tactically flexible but can be a slow starter and has limited experience in managing sides competing in Europe. Plus he arrives as the love still lingers for Ange Postecoglou after the Australian delivered Tottenham's first trophy since 2008 and the club's first European trophy since 1984.

Frank has limited experience of balancing the domestic league and Europe, the furthest he ever took Brøndby being the fourth qualifying round of the Europa League. His European record is notably poor: played 10, won three, and two of those were against Juvenes/Dogana of San Marino. His record in domestic cups, similarly, is dismal; his past history makes it unlikely a poor league season could be redeemed by other silverware – although the depth of the Spurs squad perhaps means the cups will not be such a low priority.

There is one further doubt, which is more to do with Spurs than with Frank. He is leaving an exceptionally well-run club, at which every component worked together to a coherent philosophy. There can be no certainty that any one cog from that system, however important, can achieve success in a different environment, something Chelsea have found as they accumulate more and more parts from Brighton without ever looking like replicating the efficiency of the Brighton model. It may be that such efficiency is not even possible at bigger clubs.

Read Jonathan Wilson's full assessment below.

Tottenham confirmed the appointment of Thomas Frank last night after holding talks via ­intermediaries and plainly keen to avoid a protracted search for the ­person to lead them forward following a season in which they finished 17th with 38 points.

Spurs have been impressed by more than the headline items of Frank's Brentford tenure – the ­promotion from the Championship via the playoffs in 2021, how he has established them in the Premier League, finishing 13th, ninth, 16th and 10th. Frank consistently over-achieved in relation to his financial means at Brentford; they have one of the smallest budgets in the division. An excellent ­communicator and noted developer of young ­talent, he has also shown himself to be ­tactically flexible.

Thomas Frank has penned a letter to Brentford supporters after deciding to leave the west London club nine years on from when he came in.

To everyone associated with Brentford Football Club.

The time has come for me to move on. But, even as I leave, I know I have left a big piece of my heart at Brentford, not just at the football club but with the community and, of course, the incredible and loyal supporters.

I want to extend my profound gratitude to the club for giving me the chance to pursue my dreams and for everyone involved who made the journey such a memorable one.

For my family and I, it has been a privilege to be allowed to be part of such a special community - it's an experience and adventure that we will cherish for life. So, thank you.

Whatever we have achieved, we have achieved together, and our success is built on unity, spirit, courage and ambition at every level of the club and amongst the fans.

Everybody has contributed, and every contribution has been invaluable. I am not just leaving a football club, I am saying goodbye to friends whose support through good and bad times I will carry with me always.

I would like to say a special word of thanks to Matthew Benham [Brentford owner]. His trust and friendship have meant so much and the fact he gave me a chance in English football means I will always owe him a debt of gratitude. Thank you, Matt.

So, while this is a goodbye, I hope the relationships I have built with everybody will be lasting ones and, of course, we will meet again in the wonderful world of football.

Thank you,

Thomas

Florian Wirtz has equally impressed for Germany. After missing the 2022 World Cup due to his ACL injury. He returned to the national side in 2024, scoring his first goal for Germany in seven seconds against France to become the second fastest goalscorer in international football history behind Austria's Christoph Baumgartner.

Wirtz was named in Germany's squad for the 2024 Euros 2024 where he scored the opener of the tournament in a 5–1 victory against Scotland, becoming the youngest German player to score in the European Championship. Against Spain in the quarter-final, Wirtz came off the bench to score an 89th-minute equalising goal but Spain went on to win in extra-time.

A possible British transfer record is nothing to scoff at but the fact Liverpool only spent around £10m on Federico Chiesa last summer combined with the finances that come with winning the Premier League, means the club seem to be happy to spend big to support Arne Slot.

With Trent Alexander-Arnold leaving the club, there are likely concerns about where Liverpool's creative output comes from. While the two do not play the same position, Wirtz can fill help bridge that gap as a player who can progress the ball forward effectively.

Liverpool's pursuit of Florian Wirtz has been no secret. The club fought off interest from Manchester City and Bayern Munich with the German only wanting to join Arne Slot's side. Wirtz, who can play across the frontline, is one of the most coveted players in Europe and was understood to be impressed by Liverpool's plans.

The 22-year-old has spent his entire senior career at Bayer Leverkusen. He was instrumental in breaking the chokehold Munich have on the Bundesliga by helping his side win their first ever league title and the DFB-Pokal in 2023-24 with 18 goals and 19 assists in 47 games, showing no signs of his ACL injury in 2022 being an issue.

Last season, Leverkusen finished runners-up to the German giants and Wirtz managed 16 goals and 14 assists in all competitions. According to Opta, only Mohamed Salah (18) and Lamine Yamal (13) recorded more than his 12 assists from open play among players from Europe's top five leagues.

With the fee agreed between the two clubs Liverpool is now free to speak to Wirtz to agree on personal terms.

Liverpool have agreed a fee with Bayer Leverkusen for Florian Wirtz. The German will join the Premier League champions in an £100m deal plus £16m in potential add-ons that would make Wirtz the most expensive British transfer of all time, eclipsing Chelsea's £115m purchase of Moises Caicedo.

He will undergo a medical and finalise the transfer in the coming days. Personal terms have already been agreed.

The Club World Cup starts on Sunday and has already been controversial because of extra fixtures and Fifa involvement. Add on that temperatures in US are likely to be above 30C and whew.

Notable heat events are not guaranteed during the Club World Cup but they are more likely to happen than in the past because of climate breakdown and there is a question over whether enough is being done to adapt to a new reality. The sole reference to extreme weather in Fifa's regulations for the Club World Cup relates to the use of cooling breaks, which allow players to take on extra fluids once in each half if the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) (a measure of heat stress that includes humidity and air movement) exceeds 32C on the pitch. This is the protocol in place since 2014, and for the international players' union, FifPro, it is insufficient. It argues that the threshold for cooling breaks should be between 28C and 32C under the WBGT, with options for a second drinks break per half. If the heat rises above 32C, FifPro argues, matches should be rescheduled.

Tyler Adams and Mauricio Pochettino were on the same page after the Concacaf Nations League third place match—the level they showed wasn't good enough.

The U.S. men's national team is facing immense pressure heading into the Concacaf Gold Cup. Losses to Panama and Canada during the Nations League final raised alarm bells, but two more losses in friendly action to Türkiye and Switzerland have pressure turned up to a level not seen since the USMNT failed to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

Representing one final, competitive tournament to prepare for a 2026 World Cup on home soil, down numerous stars amid varying circumstances, Gold Cup is a flashpoint in Mauricio Pochettino's short tenure as head coach. If he can rally the team after a demoralizing send-off match, this summer could be the catalyst for something special. If not, it'll be a precursor for what's to come next year on the biggest stage. Not to mention the drama surrounding Christian Pulisic's absence.

Tyler Adams sat down with Sports Illustrated before the team's summer friendlies revealing Pochettino's post-Nations League message to the team. 

“When we got knocked out of the Nations League and Mauricio spoke after Panama and Canada, we touched on the level of competition we showed in those two games was never good enough. It doesn't matter what level you're at, who you're playing against, any players will make you look bad when you compete at that level. The level of competition has to be higher and higher and we need to raise the bar. For me, it's an opportunity to show we're ready for that,” Adams says.

Pochettino's words seemingly rang true with players when they took the pitch against Türkiye. The passion and energy were there, but defensive lapses resulted in a third straight loss for the team. Switzerland, albeit demoralizing and another loss, should be looked at in a vacuum given the amount of squad rotation. If anything, that game is a warning sign to Pochettino that there's a stark contrast between his perceived best XI, the team that faced Türkiye and the team that started against Switzerland.

Adams didn't play against Switzerland nursing a foot injury, but watching the performance should push him further as a leader this summer. The Bournemouth midfielder brought a sense of calm and poise to the second half against Türkiye, things greatly lacking against the Swiss.

Off the pitch, his mindset remains similar. When asked to describe what the Gold Cup represents this summer for the USMNT, Adams had one word: Opportunity.

“I look at it as a massive opportunity to set the tone of what we're trying to do in the right way. My goal is obviously to win Gold Cup. Whenever you enter a tournament, you want to win. But for me, the most important thing I've said to everyone is to get back to the basics. Make sure we understand what makes the U.S., the U.S. Running, competing, winning duels, tackles, all the things that make fans jump out of their seats because that represents American pride. People want to talk about the quality of players that we have now. The quality can only be shown once we do the basics really well. I think that's what the national team's always been built off of. We have to get back to that point and a high level of competing.” Adams says.

Off the back of the two friendly losses, while blocking out outside noise, Adams is poised to be a driving force behind whatever success the USMNT has this summer as one of the few veteran players in camp.

Their Gold Cup journey gets underway on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago.

Reigning 18-time French champions OL Lyonnes are looking to secure the signatures of another two U.S. Women's National Team stars to join forces with international teammate Lindsey Heaps.

Former Notre Dame star Korbin Albert is very familiar with Lyon, having spent the last two and a half seasons in the French top tier with Paris Saint-Germain. The 21-year-old midfielder has impressed during her time on the continent, making 47 appearances in Division 1 Féminine, scoring six goals, and lifting the 2024 Coupe de France in the process.

Albert is expected to switch Paris for Lyon this summer as a free agent, as per ESPN, shortly after being dropped from the USWNT by head coach Emma Hayes for their recent friendly wins against China and Jamaica.

A regular in the lineup since she made her debut in late 2023, Albert has gone on to make 26 appearances for the USWNT, scoring once, and winning gold at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

Upon Albert's potential move to Lyon, she may yet be joined by international teammate and fellow midfielder Lily Yohannes. The 18-year-old has been a standout performer for the USWNT since Hayes' arrival, with one goal in eight caps to date.

“As I keep saying to everyone, she's 17,” Hayes said in May, via ESPN. “She's got a couple of years of experience as a professional. I think the next two years of development will be important for her.

“I think it's been an unbelievable development pathway for her to be at Ajax. That, for me, I think, has advanced her positional play in a way that I think makes her stand out beyond her years.

“She's physically developed in the last 12 months. Tactically in possession, when she plays for her club team, they generally have the ball against sort of mid-to-low blocks. So, I think she's developed that side of her play.”

Yohannes has already secured her role as a regular for the Dutch giants over the last two seasons, appearing in 39 games and scoring on 11 occasions, leading her to be named the Johan Cruyff Talent of the Year in 2024, whilst also lifting the KNVB Women's Cup.

Lyon are now said to be “in talks” over signing the youngster, with the team having “expressed serious interest” in acquiring her services, as per The Athletic.

Exactly what compensation would be required to pry Yohannes away from Ajax is unclear, although she still has another year on her current deal.

Not that Lyon is the only team potentially considering signing Yohannes, with ESPN having claimed Women's Super League champions, and Hayes' former side, Chelsea, are also keeping an eye on her.

Should Albert and/or Yohannes head for Lyon, they would link up with Heaps, who has called the eight-time UEFA Women's Champions League winners home since 2022 when she joined from the Portland Thorns.

Instead of entering the Gold Cup on a high, the United States Men's National Team (USMNT) is limping into this summer's tournament and hoping to get itself back on track.

That's because there's a lot going on at the moment. Christian Pulisic is sitting out in order to rest following a long season with AC Milan, a decision that has created drama amid backlash from former USMNT stars like Landon Donovan. 

Other current USMNT mainstays – including Weston McKennie, Tim Weah, Antonee "Jedi" Robinson, Sergino Dest, Gio Reyna, Folarin Balogun and Ricardo Pepi – aren't with the team due to Club World Cup commitments or injury recovery. These absences have forced USMNT manager Mauricio Pochettino to call in a green roster – one that averages 16 caps – with even more limited experience in official competition.

More pressing, however, are the results from two friendly matches this week. The U.S. was edged 2-1 by Türkiye last Saturday before getting run over by Switzerland 4-0 on Tuesday. Now, there's not much time to regroup because the USMNT begins Gold Cup competition on Sunday against Trinidad and Tobago (6 p.m. ET on FOX) before facing Saudi Arabia and Haiti to round out group play.

The negativity surrounding the team seems overwhelming, but players are just trying to get their minds right.

"I think it's really easy to look at one game, one half, and be like, ‘Oh this is all going to pieces. They can't come back from this," veteran center back Walker Zimmerman told the TNT broadcast after the drubbing by Switzerland. "Things change. It's not the end of the world. We accept that it's not good enough and we realize that, so that's where the disappointment comes in."

Zimmerman referenced the build-up to the 2022 World Cup and how in June of that year, the USMNT beat Morocco 3-0 in a friendly. Six months later, the Atlas Lions inspired a nation and made history by advancing to the World Cup semifinal.

"We have to flip the script," Zimmerman continued. "We gotta make sure that we do not come out like that ever again, especially as we enter the Gold Cup."

But can this motley crew of unseasoned players quickly recover from disaster and respond? Their charge is not only to win a Gold Cup trophy – players have said that is how they would define success this summer – but more importantly to make a statement at the World Cup on home soil one year from now.

"The boys are so motivated to play in the Gold Cup," Pochettino said. "The feeling after Türkiye was good. We made nine changes [to the lineup vs. Switzerland] and the combinations didn't work. That's it.

"We can lose, but we can win the Gold Cup and arrive at the World Cup and do well."

Additionally, the Gold Cup still represents a massive opportunity for young and inexperienced players to make some noise and impress Pochettino enough to become part of his World Cup roster plans. Midfielders Diego Luna and Jack McGlyn, both 21, are examples of that. Luna has proven he can play through a broken nose and has been a consistently energetic presence on the field. McGlynn, who didn't play against Switzerland, has scored two goals in his first two USMNT starts. 

The field is wide open.

"I think if you ask anyone to write down 26 names for next year, there would be a lot of spots that people would objectively say are available," Zimmerman said. "And we as players have to recognize that and take this opportunity that we have each and every day of training, each and every camp that we called into to try and be one of those spots." 

Most of all, the players are desperate to put recent results behind them – the USMNT has now lost four straight games and been outscored 9-2 in those contests. They have to find ways to score goals and win games, or this could end up being a deja vu to last summer when the squad didn't make it out of the Copa America group stage. That tournament was also preceded by two tune-up friendlies, including a 5-1 loss to Colombia.

Regardless, the team has no choice. The Gold Cup is starting and they have to play the games.

"It's a massive opportunity," Zimmerman said. "One that I think every player should take seriously with both hands."

Giants Jermaine Eluemunor also takes note

MetLife Stadium has installed a grass playing surface for the FIFA World Cup matches that will be held from Saturday, June 14 through July 13. The NFLPA and at least one member of the New York Giants have taken notice.

Looks nice  ... #SaferFields https://t.co/Vugv4teNxI

The artificial surface at MetLife, which is currently a FieldTurf Core system installed in 2023, has long been a source of controversy. Before the field was upgraded in 2023, there were a number of complaints about the playing surface.

The NFLPA has been pushing for grass playing surfaces in all NFL stadiums for several years, pointing to data showing lower injury rates. In fact, 92% of players reportedly prefer grass.

The Giants and Jets have said that to date they do not believe they can maintain adequate playing conditions on a grass playing field due to both the heavy use of the surface with two NFL teams, Northeast weather conditions, and the number of non-football events held at the stadium.

“I want to get to the point where the experts can tell us that late in the season we can have a safe, playable grass field, and when we get to that point, then maybe we'll make the switch,” Mara said at last year's NFL owners meetings. “We're not there yet.

“With the amount of events in our building, particularly during the football season, having two teams there, and how many times last year we had back-to-back games where it rained during the first game, I can't imagine what a grass field would've looked like on a second day.”

FIFA requires grass playing surfaces, and the fact that the event will only last a month makes its installation and maintenance at MetLife feasible.

Chelsea's quest to add another trophy to their growing cabinet gets underway on Monday when they take on LAFC in their Club World Cup opener.

Todd Boehly will no doubt be keen to get his hands on a second honour after the Blues secured Conference League glory last month.

Despite the competition disrupting their build up for the new Premier League season, Enzo Maresca has taken a strong squad to the United States. This includes new signing Liam Delap and star loanee Andrey Santos.

The American has been an advocate in the past for less games to be played in the footballing calendar, with the Blues adding anywhere between three and seven games to their already busy 2024/25 campaign.

However, finance expert Adam Williams has claimed he believes the Club World Cup is a competition the owner would love to make a regular feature for his side, and instead make changes elsewhere.

He exclusively told The Chelsea Chronicle that Boehly would love to cut down the extortionate wage bill by not needing as many players on the books to play in a reduced schedule.

He said: “I think the Club World Cup is a litmus test in terms of what Todd Boehly and Clearlake want at Chelsea.

“Boehly has said that the fixture calendar is too crowded and that they need to reduce the number of matches. But what he really means is that there should be fewer less lucrative matches. The Club World Cup could be worth up to £100m in prize money, so that's definitely not the type of event he wants removed from the calendar.

“Instead, he probably wants to scrap the League Cup and reduce the size of the Premier League. That way, you keep fixture congestion relatively limited, you lose less money to injuries and you can maybe cut the size of your squad and reduce your wage bill. I think if you look at the research, if you can remove seven or eight competitive matches from the calendar then that can let you have quite a brutal revision when it comes to the size of your squad.

I know Chelsea have a massive squad at the moment and that has been one of the hallmarks of this nascent phase under Boehly and Clearlake, but that's not the long-term vision. In my view, they're using their squad now as a player trading base – they are going to continue to trim the fat and make money in the process in the coming years. Or, at least, that is the plan.

“Their camp for the Club World Cup is 28 players and they're all on big wages. The wage bill was £338m last season, down a bit from the previous year but still high. If they can reduce the total number of matches and replace some of the lost ones with matches like the Club World Cup or money-spinning friendlies in big commercial markets, they are going to be laughing.

“Because you're replacing less lucrative matches with more lucrative ones, you're probably at a net neutral position financially in terms of revenue, but your costs are lower because you don't have to pay as significant wages.“

Some of the methods utilised by the new Chelsea owners can certainly be described as unique, and something the Premier League has not seen before.

However, Boehly is clearly trying to disrupt the recognised big three in the Premier League, with Williams stating that those in charge at Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool disagree with his way of thinking in terms of the football calendar.

He said: “Some owners take a different view. I think the received wisdom among clubs like Man United, Arsenal and Liverpool has been that more matches equals more money, which can only be a good thing. But Boehly and a couple of other guys are looking at it in a different way.“

The American will be keen to see his side get off to the perfect start against MLS opposition when they get underway in the Club World Cup on Monday night.

World Cup

When Mauricio Pochettino was hired to coach the U.S. men's national team in September 2024, the federation amplified their shared “belief that U.S. Soccer is on the cusp of something truly special.” Over the past week, however, his squad couldn't even handle a Turkey and Swiss.

A year away from the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico and sandwiched in between two regional competitions, the USMNT hardly looks ready. Pochettino's side followed an embarrassing fourth-place showing at the Nations League with a pair of consecutive friendly losses. The latest, a 4-0 thrashing against Switzerland – with all goals coming in the first 36 minutes – provides little optimism about the looming Concacaf Gold Cup, to say nothing of the sport's grandest tournament.

How much of an outlier is this brutal run-up to hosting the World Cup? To understand how the USMNT compares to past hosts, let's look back at every one since the U.S. last hosted the men's World Cup in 1994. To look at how a team improved or regressed, we'll use the Elo Ratings system. While FIFA's rankings are pushed the hardest and even used for competition draws, the formula has changed often and still seems unreflective of recent form. The Elo model uses head-to-head results to award points to teams after every game, with the score fully transparent and ranked among every other national team in the world.

The Elo Rating also considers the stakes of a game, where competitive games will impact a team's rating to a more outsized extent than a friendly. For example, one-goal defeats to Panama and Canada in March's Concacaf Nations League have more sway over the U.S.'s Elo Rating than Tuesday's loss to Switzerland or January's 3-1 win over Venezuela.

Over the course of six games in 2025, the model assesses Pochettino's side to be in freefall. After rising to 28th globally at the end of the January window, four straight defeats have sunk the U.S. to 45th — its lowest ranking since 1997. That feels a bit more honest than FIFA's latest rankings, which has the USMNT 16th in the world as of April 3.

The other 2026 cohosts have only seen slight changes to their ranking since the start of 2025. Mexico has risen eight spots, from 32nd to 24th, while Canada has taken a slight dip from 26th to 29th. At the start of the year, the USMNT was nestled between their regional rivals; now, faltering form has placed the U.S. well behind the pack.

Using Elo, we hope to answer a simple question: did the games host nations played in the 18 months preceding their World Cup leave them in better or worse position in the global landscape?

Elo Rating on January 1, 1993: 32nd (1688)

For the first half of 1993, the hosts (who had qualified outright in 1990) slumped through 14 friendlies. Most notable was a 3-1 defeat at then-74th ranked Japan, while the program notched credible draws against Denmark and Russia on home soil.

Then came the U.S. Cup, a short-lived round robin tournament providing stout competition: Brazil, England and Germany. While the United States lost its opener to Brazil and lost a 4-3 slugfest against Germany, the middle match was an undeniable highlight. The USMNT beat England 2-0 in Foxborough, with Thomas Dooley and Alexi Lalas scoring. England, which entered the match ranked ninth, ultimately failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.

The USMNT fell back to earth immediately after, taking one point from its Copa América group. A month later, it finished as runner-up to Mexico in the 1993 Gold Cup, sinking to 55th at year's end after some more worrying friendlies. 1994 began in the same vein, with friendlies ranging from wins over Norway and Mexico to defeats against Sweden, Iceland and Chile.

Pre-tournament record: 13-19-17 (1.18 ppg)

Elo Rating before 1994 World Cup: 58th (1605); -26 ranks

No match from this 18-month stretch carried as much weight, in the Elo ratings and in real life, as the U.S.'s 2-1 win over Colombia. The infamous result that ultimately cost Andrés Escobar his life helped the USMNT advance from its group, coupled with an opening-match draw against Switzerland. Ultimately, the hosts fell in the round of 16 to eventual champion Brazil.

Elo Rating after 1994 World Cup: 49th (1627)

Trend: -17 ranks, -61 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 1997: 3rd (2017)

This is where the difference between the nascent early 1990s USMNT and the well-established nature of Les Bleus becomes starkly pronounced. While the U.S. needed to enter and host any tournament it could to whip itself into readiness, France kept a fairly lean datebook during its run-up, playing just 15 games compared to its hosting predecessor's 49.

France spent the entirety of its prep ranked either third or fourth in the Elo Ratings, averaging roughly one friendly a month against mostly European opposition. A win against Spain was quickly nullified by a defeat in Russia. In a hosted friendly tournament akin to the U.S. Cup, France struggled, drawing with Brazil and Italy but losing to England. Its final window gave cause for concern: a narrow victory over Belgium (20th), a draw against Morocco (31st) and a slim win at Finland (68th) were hardly befitting of a World Cup contender.

In hindsight, the close calls allowed the team to coalesce ahead of the occasion. After all, youngsters Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet entered the tournament with just 14 combined international caps.

Pre-tournament record: 8-5-2 (1.93 ppg)

Elo Rating before 1998 World Cup: 4th (2004); -1 rank

France snapped out of its pre-tournament sleepwalk in a hurry, claiming all nine points on offer from a thin Group C despite Zinedine Zidane being sent off in its second group match. Its path through the knockout bracket was also unconvincing in moments: narrowly overcoming Paraguay in the round of 16, needing a shootout to see out Italy in the quarterfinal and pipping Croatia 2-1 in the semifinal.

Ultimately, Davor Šuker's goal was the only one France would concede after the group stage. The tale of the 1998 final is largely told through a Brazilian's vantage point, as Ronaldo's pre-match convulsive fit led to Mário Zagallo removing him from his lineup before reinstating him just 45 minutes before kickoff. The striker looked like a shell of himself, while a Zidane brace and a last-minute celebrator from Emmanuel Petit ensured the World Cup trophy remained in France.

Elo Rating after 1998 World Cup: 1st (2090); +3 ranks

One of two nations to serve as the first co-hosts in tournament history, Japan also benefitted from the Confederations Cup no longer being a Saudi Arabian-organized standalone. Instead, this was the first installment where it served as a dress rehearsal for hosts a year out from the World Cup, providing meaningful matches in venues that would become familiar to a global audience the following summer.

Japan won its group, beating Canada and Cameroon before playing Brazil to a scoreless draw. Japan then beat Australia 1-0 in the semifinal before falling to France in the final by an identical scoreline. It was the undeniable high point of the build-up period, which otherwise saw a smattering of friendlies on either side of the Confederations Cup.

Pre-tournament record: 8-6-5 (1.58 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2002 World Cup: 15th (1850); +6 ranks

As with the previous summer, Japan won its group after drawing with Belgium and beating Russia and Tunisia. The good luck ended once the knockout bracket took shape, however, as Japan stared down Turkey in the round of 16.

History remembers this Turkey side as one of the great knockout grinders in World Cup history. Japan ultimately fell 1-0, with Ümit Davala scoring the lone goal in the 12th minute. Turkey went on to finish third in the tournament, notching another 1-0 win in the quarterfinal. As such, Japan finished this stretch in a near-identical standing to where it began at the start of 2001.

Elo Rating after 2002 World Cup: 20th (1827) 

Trend from start: +1 rank, +30 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 2001: 25th (1765)

Another beneficiary of the Confederations Cup, South Korea didn't fare nearly as well as its co-host. A 5-0 defeat in its opener against France left the team at a severe disadvantage. While it did well to beat Mexico and Australia in its final group games, the blowout saw South Korea finish third in Group A, eliminated on goal difference.

Like Japan, South Korea flanked its Confederations Cup appearance with friendlies. Wins over Croatia and the U.S. served as highpoints, while it suffered another 5-0 defeat shortly after the Confederations Cup, this time against Czech Republic. Unlike its co-hosts, however, South Korea participated in the 2002 Concacaf Gold Cup (held in January and February), hoping to bolster its preparations. The guests held their own, losing to the USMNT in the group but beating Mexico on penalties in the quarterfinal. Ultimately, they lost to eventual runner-up Costa Rica in a 3-1 semifinal before Canada beat them in the consolation game — the two most consequential results from this stretch according to the Elo Ratings.

Pre-tournament record: 11-11-9 (1.42 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2002 World Cup: 34th (1736); -9 ranks

It was South Korea who fared better among the co-hosts. It kicked off its tournament with a 2-0 win over Poland, but a draw against the USMNT left Korean hopes of advancing in the balance entering the final game against Portugal. The visiting favorites did themselves no favors, as João Pinto drew a 29th-minute red card for sliding through the back of Park Ji-sung. Still a few years ahead of his move to Manchester United, Park scored the match-winner in the second half to vault South Korea to its knockout bracket in World Cup history – and famously send the U.S. through in the process.

History hasn't been entirely favorable to the ensuing semifinal run. Francesco Totti was sent off in the round of 16 on a controversial call, while Spanish media still believe that then-FIFA executive Jack Warner rigged the quarterfinals by giving the cohosts a favorable referee assignment. No matter: after beating Italy on a golden goal, South Korea toppled Spain in PKs, only to have a storybook run ending with a 1-0 semifinal defeat to Germany.

Elo Rating after 2002 World Cup: 27th (1782)

Trend from start: -2 ranks, +17 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 2005: 12th (1883)

Jurgen Klinsmann had his work cut out for him ahead of Germany's hosting duties, having to fold in a rising generation (including Bastian Schweinsteiger, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski) into the established core led by Oliver Kahn, Michael Ballack and Miroslav Klose. Controversially, Klinsmann took the captain's armband off of Kahn and thrust him into a goalkeeper competition with Jens Lehmann, unsettling the program's mainstays.

The group made an unconvincing case at its Confederations Cup: wins against Australia, Tunisia and Mexico were overshadowed by a draw against Argentina and a 3-2 defeat to Brazil in a rematch of the 2002 final. Its preparations closed out with some concerning results, namely losses in Slovakia and Turkey.

Italy logged a 4-1 win over Germany three months before the tournament, leaving many to wonder if Klinsmann was cut out for international management as the FIFA rankings placed the hosts 22nd. The Elo Ratings' head-to-head model liked them much more than that, though, positioning them 10th entering the 2006 World Cup.

Pre-tournament record: 10-5-4 (1.84 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2006 World Cup: 10th (1913); +2 ranks

Germany left no bones about its group, beating Costa Rica, Poland and Ecuador by a combined 8-2 scoreline. A Podolski brace inside 12 minutes sprung the hosts to an early lead in the round of 16 against Sweden, seeing out that scoreline to book a date with pre-tournament favorite Argentina in the quarterfinal. Lehmann backed his coach's trust with some shootout heroics, working off research notes tucked in his sock before making two saves to send Germany to the semis.

The hosts played Italy hard in the semifinal, forcing extra time and keeping the contest scoreless for 118 minutes. Seemingly, Lehmann would have another chance to unfurl paper from his hosiery. Instead, Italy left back Fabio Grosso broke the stalemate in the 119th minute, with Alessandro Del Piero finishing the job two minutes later.

Germany went on to beat Portugal in the third place game, while Italy beat France after Zidane's infamous headbutt. Klinsmann would ride the coattails of this performance into several jobs over the years, most notably leading the U.S. from 2011-2017 before being sacked in the middle of its only World Cup qualification failure since 1986.

Elo Rating after 2006 World Cup: 8th (1955) 

Trend from start: +4 ranks, +72 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 2009: 75th (1534)

Even compared to the plucky USMNT of 1994, no previous World Cup host was a clearer underdog who would've otherwise struggled to qualify than South Africa. Bafana Bafana made the field in 1998 and 2002, but was still in a rebuilding phase as 2009 kicked off. The guarantee of meaningful games provided ample opportunity for growth, between tournament hopefuls like Chile and Serbia wanting to pay the hosts a friendly visit and the Confederations Cup fielding top opponents.

South Africa advanced from its Confederations Cup group after beating New Zealand and drawing with Iraq and falling against Spain. It lost to Brazil 1-0 in the semis and 3-2 in a consolation rematch against a Spain side reeling from its shocking defeat to the USMNT. The three losses began a six-match skid in the summer and fall of 2009, followed by friendly losses against Serbia, Germany and Ireland.

Equally surprising was the struggle at the 2009 COSAFA Cup in Zimbabwe, with South Africa finishing fourth among 13 teams from the Southern part of Africa. The New Zealand win was its most impactful result of the build-up, followed by friendly victories over Norway, Jamaica and Colombia.

Pre-tournament record: 14-8-12 (1.56 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2010 World Cup: 63rd (1594); +12 ranks

While the tournament opener from Siphiwe Tshabalala was an instant classic, South Africa suffered from receiving an unusually tough draw for a host. Mexico leveled late in that opening match, and Uruguay thrashed them 3-0 in Pretoria. South Africa sprung one last surprise by toppling a rudderless France 2-1 in the finale, but a -2 goal differential saw the hosts go out in a tie-breaker with Mexico.

Then again, the 63rd-best team in the world seldom advances from a World Cup group.

Elo Rating after 2010 World Cup: 54th (1619)

Twelve years after Ronaldo, Ronaldinho and Kaká won Brazil's fifth World Cup, Neymar seemed poised to lead his nation to a record-extending sixth. Brazil stayed in the top three of the Elo Ratings throughout its run-up, although the defensive cracks that doomed the Seleção in the tournament were visible ahead of time.

Brazil opened 2013 with a 2-1 friendly loss to England at Wembley, then drew four of its next five games against Italy, Russia, Chile and England again. Pressure was building ahead of the Confederations Cup, but a perfect nine-point group stage against Japan, Mexico and Italy returned Brazil to the ascendency. The hosts ultimately won the tune-up tournament final against Spain, winning six of seven games to close 2013 in pole position.

Their 2014 schedule was quite lean: a 5-0 win in South Africa, and a pair of wins against Panama and Serbia immediately before the group stage kicked off. What could possibly go wrong?

Pre-tournament record: 16-4-2 (2.36 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2014 World Cup: 1st (2038); +1 rank

First, the good: Brazil won its group with Mexico, Croatia and Cameroon and weathered a round-of-16 test by eliminating Chile in PKs. Their 2-1 win in the quarterfinal over Colombia was marred by Neymar exiting on a stretcher after taking a knee to his back, ruling him out for the competition.

You know what came next. With Neymar injured and Thiago Silva suspended, Brazil was a shell of itself in a 7-1 scoreline that is among the most famous (or infamous, depending on your slant) results in history. That Germany went on to win the final provided no consolation. It's a loss from which Brazil has seemingly never recovered.

Elo Rating after 2014 World Cup: 7th (1980)

Trend from start: -5 ranks, -71 points

Elo Rating on January 1, 2017: 39th (1691)

Rather than play a balanced schedule of home and away matches, as most hosts before had done, Russia played all but two games at home, working to foster a staunch advantage when the tournament rolled around.

While friendly results were uneven as the Russians invited likely qualifiers like Brazil, Spain and Argentina, their Confederations Cup was arguably even more worrisome. After dispatching New Zealand 2-0 in the opener, losses against Portugal and Mexico saw Russia be the second Confederations Cup host to fall in the group stage.

While Russia notched a 4-2 win in its first friendly after that, it failed to win any of the ensuing seven friendlies before the World Cup.

Pre-tournament record: 2-5-8 (0.73 ppg)

Elo Rating before 2018 World Cup: 44th (1678); -5 ranks

Leaning into the feverish fan-created atmospheres, Russia shocked everyone by holding its own. Wins over Saudi Arabia and Egypt were enough to advance from their group despite a loss to Uruguay. Russia labored to force penalty shootouts in its two knockout games, beating Spain in the round of 16 before falling to eventual runner-up Croatia in the quarterfinal.

Elo Rating after 2018 World Cup: 38th (1721)

Trend from start: +1 rank, +30 points

Elo Rating on June 1, 2021: 47th (1646)

Qatar didn't follow Russia's lead and instead took a page from South Korea's book by looking for additional tournaments. With AFC combining qualification for the World Cup and Asian Cup in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Qatar got meaningful games against regional rivals before accepting an invitation into the 2021 Concacaf Gold Cup. A group win over Honduras and a quarterfinal triumph over El Salvador more than made up for a semifinal loss against the USMNT.

In the first run-up without a Confederations Cup since 1998 after FIFA folded the tournament, Qatar hosted the 2021 Arab Cup as a test event. Qatar finished third, winning four games before losing to Algeria and beating Egypt on penalties in a third place game. 2022 featured many friendlies against lower-ranked opponents, with a 2-1 win over Panama (in Spain) being the standout result.

Pre-tournament record: 16-7-8 (1.77 ppg)

Qatar went on to make history in 2022, just not how it had intended. It became the first World Cup host to exit a group stage without netting a single point. Its draw was tough, with matches against Netherlands, Senegal and Ecuador.

Seattle Sounders FC are no strangers to high-stakes tournament soccer.

They'll soon put that experience to the test at the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup, starting Sunday when storied Brazilian side Botafogo visit Lumen Field (10 pm ET | DAZN.com). They'll also face European heavyweights Atlético Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in Group B, with the top two teams reaching the knockout phase.

This marks Seattle's second foray into the Club World Cup via their 2022 Concacaf Champions Cup title, the first coming in 2023 when they fell 1-0 to Egypt's Al Ahly in Morocco.

"This is a well-earned, big deal," head coach Brian Schmetzer told reporters midweek. "We fell short in Morocco. If I had to do that over again, I would have added one more exhibition game before we had to play Al Ahly.

"We're trying to use everything coached and thought about and experienced here at the club," he continued. "[Goalkeeper coach] Tommy [Dutra]'s given me some good history lessons, just to get these guys to enjoy this moment and play up to their potential to see if we can get a result. Because that's what we want to do.

"We want to enjoy this, and it does feel different, but we also want to compete as well."

Seattle are part of arguably the most stacked group in the expanded 32-team tournament, highlighted by a dominant LaLiga power in Atlético and reigning UEFA Champions League winners PSG.

Botafogo have championship credentials as well, winning last year's Brasileiro Série A and Copa Libertadores. Their squad includes several ex-MLS standouts, including forward Jefferson Savarino (Real Salt Lake) and midfielder Gregore (Inter Miami CF).

"In group play, it's really important, when you're playing against really good competition, to have a good first game," midfielder Cristian Roldan said of Sunday's matchup. "It kind of sets you up for the entire tournament, and it doesn't feel like you're trying to catch up with the rest of the group.

"So, the first game is extremely important, and I think that's our mentality going into group play. Take it game by game, but intensity and mentality in group play is always the starting point."

Given their underdog status, Roldan identified energy and effort as the foundation for a shock result and, potentially, a Cinderella run.

"We want to show that this league is capable of competing against the very best," Roldan said. "So, I think good performances, good energy, intensity, is really important going into this game because we understand the quality that they have. We just need to bring that intensity to be able to compete at this level.

"... We already talk about the quality that Botafogo, Atlético and PSG have. But you can minimize that quality by bringing the intensity."

For Schmetzer, it's about proving what the Sounders are capable of – starting with a strong performance against Botafogo.

"[Success would be] that we're competing and if there's any sort of result, draw or win," said the coach. "Success is measured by, for me internally, just if the guys play to their potential."

Welcome to the dress rehearsal for a year from now when a chunk of the soccer world will descend on Seattle.

This one, though, comes with a new twist on an attempt to bring together the international soccer community.

Clubs instead of countries. Some of the biggest names in international soccer playing competitive games in Seattle. A decidedly local angle and an opportunity for Sounders FC that may never come again.

And an event that also begs the question: Will anyone really care?

“We're all looking at this with a prism of this has never happened and we don't really know how this is going to play out,” said ESPN analyst and former Sounders goalkeeper Kasey Keller.

The 2025 FIFA Club World Cup will kick off on Sunday night when the local side Sounders FC will face Brazilian club Botafogo for the first of six matches to be played at Lumen Field over the next two weeks.

The tournament will bring some of the biggest club names in international soccer to the Pacific Northwest, with the likes of Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan, River Plate and Atlético Madrid all slated for games during the first playing of this tournament in its newly expanded format.

For FIFA and local officials, the Club World Cup is essentially a test event for next year when the FIFA Men's World Cup comes to Seattle for six matches over a three-week span that is expected to bring a significant number of international visitors and attention to the city and region.

“We'll be looking very closely at sort of the security, the crowd control. We've been discussing, kind of improvements on how we move people in and around the stadium, and so those things all will be very much examined,” said Peter Tomozawa, CEO of Seattle's organizing committee for next year's tournament. “It is, in a way, a dress rehearsal for the World Cup.”

While next year is expected to turn the city into a cultural melting pot of soccer fans from around the world descending on the city, that will not be the case for this year's tournament. There are strong signs that even the most die-hard soccer fans aren't interested in spending their dollars to see some of these big clubs play in Seattle with uncertainty of how many of the top players for those teams might even see the field, although the initial rosters released for the event show teams are brining the majority of their stars. FIFA has slashed ticket prices in markets around the country, including Seattle, hoping that games don't end up getting played inside significantly empty stadiums.

For the Sounders, the opportunity to play competitive matches against the likes of the current UEFA Champions League winners PSG and Atlético Madrid may never come again. But the backdrop to the matches has come with controversy over bonus payouts for the players of the three Major League Soccer teams participating in the event.

The Sounders went as far as a public protest before their last home match against Minnesota United on June 1.

If the Club World Cup sounds familiar, you'd be correct. The tournament dates to 2000, including the 2022 version (played in February 2023) that included the Sounders as a participant. Their participation lasted one match in Morocco where they were eliminated by Egyptian side Al Ahly.

At that time, the tournament included only the champions of the six confederations around the world, plus a host team. The tournament usually took place during the winter and lasted about 10 days.

But with the growing interest in club soccer around the world and the Men's World Cup being held in North America next year, FIFA saw an opportunity — both for exposure and financial gain — to launch plans for an expanded tournament for 2025.

The 32-team event will follow a similar format to the World Cup, with each team guaranteed three group stage matches, and the top two teams in each group advancing to a knockout bracket. The final will be on July 13 at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

The uniqueness of the Club World Cup lies with the chance to see players that may not otherwise appear in a World Cup playing for their country. Will Norway qualify for the World Cup? No idea, but Erling Haaland and Manchester City will be here this summer. Turkey might not qualify either, but Inter Milan midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu might be the best player at his position in the world and will play in Seattle twice. Luka Modric is leaving Real Madrid after the Club World Cup and there's no guarantee he'll be back next year with Croatia.

But player participation has come begrudgingly with growing concerns about overuse, especially for European players just finishing a long club season and knowing that next year will be another long campaign with additional matches for those hoping to play in the World Cup itself.

“It really is a concern for players' well-being. Players are facing greater levels of possible injury just by nature of anytime you play more games there's more risk of injury because you're playing more. ,” said Ron Krabill, professor and director of the Global Sports Lab at UW.

The favorites are clear and obvious because they are the current powers of world soccer: Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich and Chelsea. But, depending on the rosters each club brings, an unexpected team could emerge as a contender. 

Sounders general manager Craig Waibel said the tournament will mean more when it's played next in 2029 because someone will have four years to brag about it.

“It's a trophy no one owns, and so there's no jealousy right now. And I think jealousy in sports has a value that transcends a lot of a lot of just the moments,” Waibel said.  

As an enticement for clubs and players to take the competition seriously, FIFA created a $1 billion prize pool for the tournament. But that's also led to issues for at least one team playing in Seattle: the Sounders.

When MLS and its players agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in 2021, an expanded Club World Cup including MLS teams wasn't even a dream. Now it's a reality, and the split of the money the three MLS teams will get from the event is leaving the players feeling shortchanged.

As part of the prize pool from FIFA, the three MLS teams are ensured of earning at least $9.55 million each from their participation. The teams can earn another $2 million for wins and $1 million for a draw in the group stage, while advancing to the knockout round would garner another $7.5 million.

That is — and could be — a lot of money for a franchise and its players.

However, the CBA agreed to in 2021 created a 90/10 split between teams and players for events like this, meaning of that $9.55 million guaranteed to the Sounders less than $1 million would go to the players to be split.

The frustration from players at such a paltry payment structure reached a tipping point on June 1 when Sounders players wore “Club World Ca$h Grab” shirts before their match against Minnesota United and owner Adrian Hanauer reportedly angrily confronting the players after the match.

The MLS Players Association received a proposal from the league last week on how pay would be divided that the players were “deeply disappointed” with. As of Thursday, a resolution in a pay split had not been reached.

Whatever viewpoint fans take in looking at the tournament is probably fair. An optimist may look at the fact that PSG, Atlético Madrid, River Plate and Inter Milan will play competitive matches in Seattle for likely the only time ever, with two of those teams playing the hometown squad.

“My uncle is coming from Germany just to watch these games,” Sounders FC coach Brian Schmetzer said.

A pessimist will see high ticket prices that overestimated the interest of the tournament, clubs have no requirement of playing their top players, some odd starts times in order to appease overseas markets and the local side an underdog in two of its three matches.

Both views are fair and add to the uncertainty of how this tournament will ultimately be received.

“This might be the only time we play one of these teams in Seattle in our stadium, in our home,” Sounders midfielder Obed Vargas said. “So we're going to have fun and at the end of the day, this is a game, it's a tournament. Obviously, it's a great opportunity, but we need to have fun with it. This is an unbelievable moment for us, for the whole city, for the whole team and we just need to look at it that way.”

Botafogo has three players on the way out to Nottingham Forest of the Premier League after the tournament. Seeing River Plate will be the last chance to watch 17-year-old young phenom Franco Mastantuono before his permanent move to Real Madrid. PSG might still be on a celebratory bender after winning the Champions League.  

For the combo of star power and entertainment, the June 19 match between Sounders FC and Atlético Madrid might be the game to see. Atleti is full of stars from Koke to Julián Alvarez to Jan Oblak to noted Seattle Mariners fan Antoine Griezmann.

Seattle will be a decided underdog in the match, but it could be an entertaining Thursday afternoon. And as Keller noted, the resources for the two clubs vastly different, noting that the transfers last year of Alvarez and Conor Gallagher to Atleti were $160 million which might equate to a decade worth of combined salaries for the Sounders.

“We're talking different ballparks on different planets,” he said.

Still, Keller thinks the Sounders can be competitive in all three matches.

“I wouldn't be surprised if they sneaked a draw or maybe even a win against somebody that came in sleeping,” Keller said.

Gab Marcotti and Julien Laurens call out Landon Donovan for his criticism of players pulling out of the USMNT, in the wake of the 4-0 defeat to Switzerland. (2:36)

Are you or a loved one "getting Concacafed?"

Are you experiencing symptoms of a referee giving you a yellow card for getting punched by another player? Have you felt confusion upon watching another man somersault across the grass in anguish after you shook his hand to congratulate him on a nice play? Ever seen a group of ball boys shrug their shoulders and sit, immobile, after a goalkeeper literally punted the ball into the Atlantic Ocean? Want to scream because you just lost a game on a field of knee-high grass against a team of players who spent most of the past week on a commercial fishing boat?

If you've followed North American soccer for long enough, you're familiar with the term. Heck, ESPN contributor Jon Arnold writes an entire newsletter about it every week; it's called Getting CONCACAFed.

Arnold's newsletter celebrates the conundrum that is Concacaf -- a region that features two of the richest federations in all of the sport, the United States and Mexico; another one that mostly plays hockey, Canada; and then a bunch of other soccer-loving nations with varying (low) levels of resources and degrees of professionalism. Just a few years ago, the 60-year-old president of Suriname forced himself into a Concacaf league match. This is the same federation within which Lionel Messi plays his club ball and the likes of Christian Pulisic and Alphonso Davies represent their countries. It all exists together, and it's beautiful.

At its worst, though, the fans who talk about getting Concacafed are fans of the richest country in the region, and they're complaining about the "uncultured methods" of their poorer regional brethren. God forbid the underdogs try to find ways to even the playing field.

But what actually happens in Concacaf, from minute one through 90? It's a question with competitive consequences in the Gold Cup, which begins Saturday, for the U.S. men's national team, Mexico and Canada -- all of whom also hope to make it deep into next summer's World Cup.

How different is the sport played here, compared with over there? Let's look into the numbers.

We'll start with the place where it seems Concacaf is most different from everywhere else: its apparent tolerance for violence.

In the rest of this piece, we'll be comparing the Gold Cup with the Copa América, the Euros and the Premier League. Because there aren't many games in any one international tournament, we're using data from the past two Gold Cups, Copas América and Euros. And then we're using only this past season of Premier League data, since there are way more games. This should give us a sense of how Concacaf stacks up against the two best regions for international soccer and then the gold standard for club soccer.

Here's a graph that plots the number of yellow cards per game and the number of fouls per game for the average team:

Though the Gold Cup averages more fouls per game than any of the three other competitions, it also averages the second-fewest yellow cards -- just barely more (1.86 per game to 1.85) than at the Euros.

The way I'd interpret this data: The Concacaf referees allow a lot more physicality than refs do in any of the other tournaments. Though the Copa América has a reputation for being one big rock fight, there aren't as many fouls as in North America, and the referees are way quicker on the draw with their yellow and red cards.

One of the themes here is that, stylistically, South American soccer has a lot more in common with North American soccer than it does with European soccer. Part of the reason for the similar data is that a few Concacaf teams played in last summer's Copa América, but that's not enough to skew the numbers much.

Now, take a look at our next graph:

Why are the Euros all the way in the upper right corner? The possession game is more prevalent in Europe, but in the Premier League, teams are coming up against much more athletic players and much more aggressive pressing systems than in the Euros. So, in the Euros, it's not that these teams are better at passing than Premier League clubs; it's just a lot easier to pass. Plus, both Euros in the dataset came at the end of long seasons, so teams tended to sit on the ball longer once they won possession.

However, the average Gold Cup team attempts around 420 passes per game and completes 82% of them. Those are, nearly exactly, the same numbers that relegated Leicester City put up in the most recent Premier League season.

Although the passing numbers are quite similar, the major area where Concacaf and CONMEBOL differ is in how often dribbles are attempted. Copa America teams attempt 21.2 take-ons per game -- the most of the four competitions we're looking at -- while Gold Cup squads try to beat their opponents on the dribble 17.7 times per game, second fewest in our dataset.

This is where Concacaf sits on its own -- but not for the reasons you might think.

When I say "aggression" here, I don't mean, "How much do you try to injure your opponents?" Instead, I mean: "How aggressively are teams trying to move the ball forward?" There are two ways to determine that: How far do they pass the ball, and how many passes do they make before they attempt a shot?

Behold, the answer!

The longer passing and trigger-happy approach also leads to more moments of transition. In Concacaf, the ball changes hands more frequently (the number of possessions per game) and moves up the field more quickly than in the other competitions:

Those possession and speed numbers are almost exactly what Andoni Iraola's Bournemouth averaged this past season. Tyler Adams was born to play in this tournament --- and yet, he never has. Depending on how serious his foot injury is, it's possible he never will.

All right, so we now know that there are lots of fouls and very few cards at the Gold Cup. We know there aren't many passes attempted, and there are even fewer completed. There's not much dribbling, either. But there's lots of long, aggressive passes, plenty of turnovers and a bunch of shots. Broadly, this is what Gold Cup games look like.

What about the shots themselves? We know how teams are getting the ball forward, what midfield play tends to look like, and how frequently shots are being attempted. But what kind of shots are these?

If there are two basic tactical takeaways from soccer's still-fledgling analytics movement, they are: (1) stop shooting from outside the box and (2) stop crossing so much. Now, this isn't to say you should never cross, but most crosses don't lead to shots; they lead to turnovers that leave your defense scrambling. And even when crosses lead to shots, those shots tend to be with your head, and headers are way less likely to turn into goals than shots with your feet.

As for point one, well, yeah, duh. The hallmark of every analytical revolution in sports was something obvious: For baseball players, getting on base is good, no matter how you do it; passing a football is easier than running; 3-point shots are worth more than 2-pointers; shots from close to the goal are more likely to go in.

Well, as of yet, it doesn't appear as if anyone has told anyone in Concacaf any of these things.

But in the Gold Cup, goals saved is right around expectation. The same kind of talent-level disparity doesn't exist in any kind of consistent way for keepers.

And then there's pressure on the ball. Perhaps because defenders in the other regions are more talented, or their tactics are more fine-tuned, or because possession play isn't so hectic, the Gold Cup averages the fewest shots under what Stats Perform defines as high pressure, but the most shots under either moderate or low pressure. Defensive pressure, or even the possibility of defensive pressure, has a large effect on shot conversion -- and there's just not as much of it in the Gold Cup, so we get more goals.

I've written before about how the wide-open style of play in the German Bundesliga just isn't preparing Bayern Munich for the Champions League. Most teams in Germany aren't employing typical underdog strategies, so Bayern don't have to figure out how to break down low blocks. But they're also way more talented than everyone else in the league thanks to their massive resource advantage, so they're not playing games where they can't just expect to dominate the ball.

Then, in Europe, they play teams that challenge their claim to possession or fine-tune their own counterattacking strategies -- neither of which Bayern get any practice with at home.

With the 2024-25 season officially over, it's time to rank the top 100 players in the world of men's soccer right now. Welcome to the FC 100. Read the full list here.

There's probably some similar kind of translatability problem for the likes of the U.S., Mexico and even Canada. The soccer you see in Concacaf is just significantly different from what you'll see when you play in the World Cup, a tournament that theoretically gathers most of the best teams in the world. Plus, Concacaf is quite different from what all of the USMNT's best players experience on a week in, week out basis for their club teams in Europe these days.

The flipside of this is that the friendlies against European clubs better mirror the tactical environment the U.S. will be facing at the World Cup -- especially the first halves, when teams tend to be less experimental and at least enter the match with a cohesive lineup and some kind of plan. But, uh, yeah: Mauricio Pochettino's team has been outshot 17 to 4 -- to the tune of 0.14 expected goals for and 3.2 xG against; one goal for, six against -- across the two first halves of the recent Turkiye and Switzerland matches. This team is getting UEFAed, too.

Such is the nature of international soccer, then, that the sport the U.S. plays at the Gold Cup this summer will have only a vague connection to the sport it's going to play next summer. Also, the players playing this summer will only vaguely resemble the players who are playing next summer.

Given the recent performances, the latter is a positive. As for the former? It means we're unlikely to learn a whole lot from the Gold Cup about the team's chances at the World Cup. Given the trending direction of recent results, that's probably a good thing, too.

Miami, FL (Thursday, June 12, 2025) – Concacaf today conducted the draw for the Final Round of the Concacaf Qualifiers to the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The Third and Final Round, which will determine the region's remaining participants for next summer's tournament, will feature 12 national teams competing during the FIFA international windows of September, October, and November 2025.

The live made-for-TV event, hosted by sports anchor Alejandro Berry in Miami, FL, included Concacaf President and FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani, Concacaf Chief Football Competitions Officer Carlos Fernández, and former Panama international Blas Pérez, who served as draw assistant.

During Thursday's draw, the six group winners and six runners-up from the Second Round were drawn into three groups as follows:

Group A: Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, SurinameGroup B: Jamaica, Curacao, Trinidad and Tobago, BermudaGroup C: Costa Rica, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua

What should be a festive start to the FIFA Club World Cup in Seattle this Sunday has instead created fear and uncertainty for some fans. This comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) suggested on social media that it would be involved in security at the matches.

SEATTLE, Wash. - What should be a festive kickoff to the FIFA Club World Cup in Seattle this Sunday has instead sparked fear and uncertainty among some fans after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) suggested on social media it would be involved in security at Club World Cup matches.

The Seattle Sounders will face Brazil's Botafogo in a high-stakes match at Lumen Field on Sunday, marking one of the biggest games in the tournament. Seattle, considered the underdog, will host the match as the city prepares for a broader role in the global soccer spotlight ahead of next year's FIFA World Cup.

But for some fans, the excitement is being overshadowed by rumors and social media posts suggesting increased immigration enforcement presence at matches — not just in Seattle, but across the country.

Earlier this week, CBP shared a now-deleted post on its official channels stating, "Let the games begin – the first FIFA Club World Cup games starts on June 14 in Miami. CBP will be suited and booted ready to provide security for the first round of games." The post has since been taken down but is still being circulated by outlets such as FOX Sports 940 AM in Miami.

According to FOX's affiliate in Florida, FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed CBP agents would be working alongside Miami-Dade Sheriff's deputies to provide security for the matches in Florida.

Concerns grew further after reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents advised non-citizens to bring proof of legal status to the matches. While that advisory appears specific to Miami, the uncertainty has reached fans in Seattle as well.

Washington Governor Bob Ferguson addressed those concerns saying, "I'm not getting communication from the federal government about what they're doing. I want to be very clear about that," Ferguson said. "But we, of course, are very focused on the days ahead of us and being sure we're doing everything we can to ensure the President does not take any legal action here in Washington."

The office of Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell also responded, acknowledging awareness of the rumors. A spokesperson said the city has been in contact with Gov. Ferguson and Attorney General Nick Brown. The office emphasized that Seattle does not coordinate or assist federal agencies in immigration enforcement.

Ticket sales have also become a topic of conversation. Sunday's match tickets are available for as low as $35. In comparison, a ticket to see Paris Saint-Germain — featuring some of the most well-known players in international soccer — costs around $117 – compared to $350 a year ago. 

While it's unclear whether the enforcement rumors are affecting sales, sports analyst Nico Moreno of Pulso Sports said the drop in demand isn't surprising.

"I really thought a couple months back that it would be beyond that," Moreno said. "But when I'm hearing that there's basically a fire sale on tickets, that people are getting free tickets if they bought the 300 level — people are being brought down from 300 levels down — it makes me feel like it's going to be a Portland vs. Sounders atmosphere."

In a statement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said, "U.S. Customs and Border Protection is committed to working with our local and federal partners to ensure the FIFA Club World Cup 26™ is safe for everyone involved, as we do with every major sporting event, including the Super Bowl. Our mission remains unchanged."

Security concerns aren't unprecedented. During the 2023 Copa América final, hundreds of fans breached Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, an incident attributed to a lack of security personnel.

FOX 13 Seattle reached out to Lumen Field for comment but has not yet received a response.

Seattle is set to host six matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and Sunday's match is being seen as an early test of how the city handles international sporting events — both on and off the pitch.

The Sounders are three days away from their first FIFA Club World Cup match, the biggest tournament in franchise history, as an ongoing disagreement between players and Major League Soccer casts a shadow over the event.

As you might expect, Rafael Nadal was one of the millions who watched the historic Roland Garros final between Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday. The Spaniard, who won the tournament's Coupe des Mousquetaires 14 times, reflected on the tussle while at the Pula Golf Resort in Son Servera supporting The Battle of Stars, a charity golf tournament in Spain to raise money for the fight against ALS.

“It was a match for the ages,” said Nadal. “I'm very happy for Carlos. It was a spectacular final, very exciting. Ending up with the cup after Sinner was so close to taking it for so long... I'm very happy for him.

“I feel for Jannik,” added the 22-time major champion. “Despite the fact that it was an incredibly difficult match for him, he maintained an impeccable attitude and carried himself well.”



Between them, Sinner and Alcaraz have won the past six Grand Slam titles (all four in 2024, and the first two of 2025) and seven of the past eight. Following the retirement of Roger Federer, Andy Murray and Nadal — and with their exits, the end of the Big 4 (only Novak Djokovic remains active) — the Italian and Spaniard have immediately taken the baton and created their own marquee Lexus ATP Head2Head rivalry.

“Tennis is more important than any player,” opined Nadal. “There will be Grand Slam champions every year, and each of them will tread their own path. New stars will always appear, and here we have two of them,” he said of Sinner and Alcaraz, the top two players in the PIF ATP Rankings. “They are two players who are head and shoulders above the rest at the moment, proving that they are great champions. Tennis is in good hands in that regard.”

Nadal, who was given an emotional tribute on the first Sunday of competition at Roland Garros on Court Philippe-Chatrier, later returned to Spain and watched the tournament from his home. It is something he feels perfectly happy to do.

“I don't feel like I would have liked to be there,” he admitted. “I watched the tournament like any other fan, excited to see a place that was so important during my career and simply enjoying the tennis. This is my new reality, I don't look beyond that.”

Men's singles semifinals of the ATP Libema Open in Den Bosch, Netherlands are set after a couple of upsets on Friday. Lucky loser Reilly Opelka took out No. 1 seed Daniil Medvedev, while Gabriel Diallo overcame a 0-3 head-to-head record to defeat Karen Khachanov. Can No. 2 seed Ugo Humbert take advantage of the draw seemingly opening up? Who do you think will reach the final?

Head-to-head: First meeting

It's good to see Ugo Humbert back in shape after struggling with an arm injury over the clay season. The Frenchman couldn't properly hit through with his two-handed backhand and had to work extra hard to try to set up as many forehands as possible. But now it seems like this situation is behind him and we're also on a court that fits him extremely well. His game thrives on surfaces that are fast and slick, but it's not going to be that easy to neutralize the big weapons of Gabriel Diallo. Humbert's flatter ball at the Canadian's backhand might be the key here, even if Diallo's playing with a lot of confidence after saving match points to beat Jordan Thompson.
Prediction: Humbert in 3

Head-to-head: Bergs 1-0

Reilly Opelka lost in the final qualifying round to Mark Lajal, really struggling to manage his giant body against balls bouncing low in his backhand corner. But the American's weaponry has been shining through more and more after he received that second chance. On Friday, he basically backed himself in the tie-breaks against Daniil Medvedev and ended up claiming the win (had some big help with the three consecutive double faults in the second set breaker). Now he's facing Zizou Bergs, who had to raise his level from where it was at the start of the week and has done just that. The Belgian has so many grass-court tools and his slices probably make it uncomfortable enough for Opelka here.
Prediction: Bergs in 3

										Damian is a connoisseur of the lower tiers of men's tennis and would probably watch the World No. 700 play a ferret if he could see it from the stands. Always pleased by a beautiful one-handed backhand or classic volleying technique.

American lucky loser Reilly Opelka put up an intense battle to stun top seed Daniil Medvedev 7-6(5) 7-6(5) and reach the Libema Open semifinal in Den Bosch on Friday.

Medvedev, who on Thursday edged a first-set tiebreak against Frenchman Adrian Mannarino, hit three double faults in the second-set tiebreak and five overall, compared to no such error by Opelka, who also hit 24 aces.

The 2021 U.S. Open champion, currently ranked 11th in the world, needed to match or better Ben Shelton's result in Stuttgart this week to return to the Top 10 on Monday.

The American, ranked 12th, will beat him to it after he overcame Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-4 6-4 to advance to the Stuttgart semifinals.

Former Wimbledon junior champion Opelka will contest an ATP grasscourt semi-final for the second time in his career, having reached the same stage at Newport last year.

Emma Raducanu will face a tough test at Queen's Club today with the young Brit set to go up against the top seed in the quarter-finals. She will play Olympic champion Qinwen Zheng in the last eight, with the winner facing either Emma Navarro or Amanda Anisimova in the semis. Raducanu has already locked in a return to the top of the British rankings after beating Rebecca Sramkova in straight sets yesterday.

The former US Open champion will surpass Katie Boulter, who was knocked out by Diana Shnaider in the last eight. She won the first set but allowed her Russian opponent to fight back and claim a 2-6 6-3 6-2 victory. It means Raducanu will return to the summit of British tennis for the first time in two years when the rankings are updated on Monday.

It's the end of the road for Emma Raducanu at Queen's as the Brit is defeated in straight sets by top seed Qinwen Zheng.

Raducanu had a commanding lead at one point in the second set, having been outclassed in the first, but Zheng held her nerve to come back and win 6-2 6-4.

Not the result Raducanu wanted, but she comes away from the tournament with many positives to take as Wimbledon edges closer.



Zheng is fully back in this second set now, breaking Raducanu back to level the score at 4-4.

Raducanu will be bitterly disappointed after losing the game on a double fault.

Raducanu has got off to a stormer in the second set as she looks to keep her Queen's campaign going.

She broke Zheng straight away before holding her own serve, and leads 2-0 in the second set currently.

During the break in play between sets, Raducanu is receiving treatment on her back.

The physio came out to check in on the Brit, and she has just made her way off court for a medical timeout.

Hopefully it's just a minor issue.

Qinwen Zheng claims the first set 6-2 and it's a difficult task from here on in for Raducanu against the Olympic champion.



Qinwen Zheng has stamped her authority on this match. She is currently 4-2 up and will be looking to wrap the set up quickly from here.

But Raducanu is battling and has the home crowd on her side.

Emma Raducanu is due to get going any minute now against Qinwen Zheng in the quarter-finals at Queen's.

A very exciting match-up this...

Fourth seed Elena Rybakina is in a spot of bother in her Queen's quarter-final clash against German qualifier Tatjana Maria.

Maria took the opening set 6-4 and currently leads the second set 4-3. She also has the serve to move 5-3 in front.

After this match, Emma Raducanu will face top seed Qinwen Zheng for a spot in the semi-finals...

Madison Keys is safely through to the semi-finals at Queen's Club after coming from behind to beat Diana Shnaider.

The reigning Australian Open champion lost the opening set but fought back to secure a 2-6 6-3 6-4 victory.

Tatjana Maria and Elena Rybakina are currently in action at the Andy Murray Arena, with the scores locked at three games each in the first set.

Once that match concludes, it will be the turn of Emma Raducanu and Qinwen Zheng.

John McEnroe has claimed that Carlos Alcaraz is the only tennis player he would buy a ticket to watch.

"Carlos is the most talented young man I have ever seen hold a racket, Jannik [Sinner] is not far behind," said the American.

"Alcaraz is brighter, Sinner is more consistent. I am struck by the sound of Jannik's ball. I have never heard anything like it.

"Carlos is the best gift the post-Big Three generation could give us and he's the only tennis player I'd pay a ticket for."



The action is underway at Queen's Club with Diana Shnaider going up against Madison Keys in the quarter-finals.

Shnaider won the opening set at a canter but Keys is battling back, having raced to a three-game lead in set two.

It looks like it will go to a decider unless Shnaider can pull off a run of successive games.

Defending champion Tommy Paul is among several big names who have pulled out of the men's tournament at Queen's Club.

He had been nursing several injuries at the French Open and will be looking to return to full fitness ahead of Wimbledon.

Lorenzo Musetti has also withdrawn from the ATP 500 event due to a leg muscle injury.

Matteo Berrettini, meanwhile, will not be playing because of an abdominal problem.

Nick Kyrgios has given himself a bold new look two months after celebrating his 30th birthday.

He has taken the plunge and shaved his head, having previously been known for his signature dark curls.

Kyrgios revealed his new buzzcut in a short Instagram video, turning his head to show it off from multiple angles.

He captioned the post: "30 is unreal. Not even in my prime yet. And shaved head is UNREAL."



Wimbledon chief Sally Bolton has confirmed that security measures will be ramped up at SW19 this year.

It comes after Emma Raducanu was targeted by a stalker during a match against Karolina Muchova in February.

Bolton said: "The safety and wellbeing of all of the players is our absolute top priority.

"I think the recent incidents coming to light certainly recognise the concern generated by that.

"But we have in place, and have had for many years, processes for ensuring the safety of our players.

"That is in liaison with law enforcement agencies, specialist security teams and we liaise with both tours.

"It is a bit like the broader security for the grounds. We are putting in place measures that are reflective of the threat and risk profile at the time."

Novak Djokovic has revealed that he has always felt closer to Rafael Nadal than Roger Federer in a candid interview.

He said: "Just because someone is my biggest rival doesn't mean I wish them harm, hate them, or want to do anything else on the court to defeat them.

"We fought for the win, and the better player won. I've never said a single bad word about them [Federer and Nadal] and never will.

"I looked up to them and still do, but I've always gotten along better with Nadal."



Here's a look at what's in store today at Queen's Club...

Women's singles: Quarter-finals

Diana Shnaider vs Madison Keys

Tatjana Maria vs Elena Rybakina

Qinwen Zheng vs Emma Raducanu

Emma Navarro vs Amanda Anisimova

Women's doubles: Semi-finals

Erin Routliffe/Lyudmyla Kichenok vs Demi Schuurs/Asia Muhammad

Shuai Zhang/Ellen Perez vs Anna Danilina/Diana Shnaider

Novak Djokovic has emotionally admitted that he felt like an 'unwanted child' in comparison to Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer.

He told Failures of Champions: "I acted and still felt like an unwanted child.

"I asked myself why that was. It hurt me. Then I thought the fans would accept me if I acted differently, but that wasn't the case either.

"I was never as loved as Federer and Nadal because I wasn't supposed to be there.

"I was the little guy, the third guy who came along and said: 'I'm going to be No 1'. Many people didn't like that."

Emma Raducanu sent a classy message to Katie Boulter after surpassing her doubles partner as Britain's top-ranked female player.

Following her victory over Rebecca Sramkova at Queen's Club, she wrote a message on the camera lens which read: "Long live Boultercanu."

Raducanu also revealed that she wanted to rekindle her partnership with Boulter, having enjoyed their brief run in the doubles tournament.

"I really want to play with Katie again in the future," she said. "Maybe over the grass, but for sure in the future."

Daria Saville has highlighted that Novak Djokovic is facing similar questions about retirement, which bothered Serena Williams. The 38-year-old has often discussed his future in different press conferences.     


            Djokovic's most recent appearance was at the French Open, where he was knocked out after losing in the semifinal to Jannik Sinner in straight sets with a score of 6-4, 7-5, 7-6. While talking to the media after the match, Djokovic admitted that it might have been the last time he played in the competition where he lifted the title three times.    


            "I mean, this could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know," he said. "That's why I was a bit more emotional, even in the end. But if this was the farewell match of the Roland-Garros for me in my career, it was a wonderful one in terms of the atmosphere and what I got from the crowd. Not long, you know, I don't know. I don't know really what tomorrow brings in a way at this point in my career. You know, I'm going to keep on keeping on, yes.”    


            Saville recently appeared on the Australian Open official YouTube channel podcast, where she emphasised that Djokovic is now facing something similar to what Serena faced during her final playing days. The 31-year-old also highlighted that, as a player, it is not easy to know when the right time is to retire.    


            “It's pretty hard going to every press [conference] and hearing people asking him the same questions. How much longer? How many more?” she said. “That's what people did to Serena [Williams]. The funny thing as a player is I don't think you know yourself. I kind of feel that he'll be there, I don't think that's how he'd want to go out. I think he doesn't know where his body is. He's just unsure, but I don't think he's there. It would be hard to know, how the hell do you even retire? My favorite retirement was Ash [Barty], that was pretty cool.”

Wimbledon is on the way, and whether you're planning to watch on TV, brave the famous queues or are lucky enough to have a ticket, it's an exciting time for tennis fans everywhere. 

For those attending in person, one big question (other than how many strawberries with cream you can possibly consume in one day) is what to wear. After all, while it's mainly about the tennis action on court, Wimbledon has always been a place to see and be seen, with celebrities from Sienna Miller to the Princess of Wales snapped on Centre Court in stunning outfits.

The dress code for Wimbledon is generally smart casual - you don't want to go too over-the-top (this is not Royal Ascot) but at the same time, it's a nice opportunity to don a beautiful dress or some on-trend tailoring. Shoes-wise, think practical: if you're up on Murray Mound, you don't want to sink into the grass, and the day tends to involve quite a lot of walking around. 

With the other accessories, you can go to town - think bold jewellery, chic handbags and a useful sun hat (although nothing too large, as you'll be very unpopular if you block someone else's view of the tennis action). As for what to avoid - clothes with political slogans or big company logos are banned - although you probably weren't going to wear that anyway. Here's what we suggest instead...

Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper are Britain's best hopes at glory this year at Wimbledon

Britain's brightest tennis talents, Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper, enter Wimbledon as the nation's top-ranked players in their respective categories. 

The pair have demonstrated promising form in recent weeks, though both have encountered difficulties when facing elite competition.

Their challenges were evident at recent tournaments, where Raducanu fell to Iga Swiatek at the French Open whilst Draper was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz at the Italian Open.There's no shame in these losses - Swiatek, known as 'the Queen of clay', reached the final before losing to Coco Gauff.Emma Raducanu and Jack Draper have had tough paths in tennis but both have their backsReutersMeanwhile at Roland Garros, Alcaraz went on to claim the title after a gruelling five-and-a-half-hour battle against world number one Jannik Sinner, as well as beating him on his home patch in the Italian Open final.Despite these setbacks, the two young British stars remain close allies as they prepare for the Championships at SW19.JUST IN:Liverpool agree record-breaking fee for Florian Wirtz transfer from Bayer LeverkusenTheir friendship has deep roots, having trained together at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton from a young age.Born less than a year apart, Raducanu and Draper competed in many of the same junior tournaments throughout their development.The pair's shared experiences include prestigious events such as the Orange Bowls in Miami and the Eddie Herr Invitationals in Bradenton.Their parallel journeys through British tennis have naturally fostered a strong bond between them.Draper has spoken warmly about their relationship, telling The Times: "She has always been there for me.

I really wanted to achieve what she'd done, winning a Grand Slam."Raducanu has been equally supportive of her compatriot, describing Draper as "very driven" and "hard-working" in a joint interview with The Times.

Meanwhile at Roland Garros, Alcaraz went on to claim the title after a gruelling five-and-a-half-hour battle against world number one Jannik Sinner, as well as beating him on his home patch in the Italian Open final.

Despite these setbacks, the two young British stars remain close allies as they prepare for the Championships at SW19.

Their friendship has deep roots, having trained together at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton from a young age.

Born less than a year apart, Raducanu and Draper competed in many of the same junior tournaments throughout their development.

The pair's shared experiences include prestigious events such as the Orange Bowls in Miami and the Eddie Herr Invitationals in Bradenton.

Their parallel journeys through British tennis have naturally fostered a strong bond between them.

Draper has spoken warmly about their relationship, telling The Times: "She has always been there for me. I've always been there for her.

"What Emma did was obviously incredibly inspiring," he told reporters after his own impressive run to the US Open final last year.

"I've known her from a young age, and to see what she did was incredible. I was very proud of her, very excited."

Jack Draper's clay season was largely promising but he must now prepare for Wimbledon

The 23-year-old acknowledged that whilst they had witnessed Andy Murray's Grand Slam success, Raducanu's victory felt particularly special.

"Obviously, we've watched the likes of Andy Murray winning a Grand Slam from Great Britain, but her winning, it was just really a fairy-tale run," he said.

"I definitely think as a competitor, it fuelled my fire. I really wanted to achieve what she'd done, winning a Grand Slam."

"There's no doubt it was extremely difficult for Emma, because she's done her A Levels and she'd just come out of school," he said, urging people to allow her to continue her journey without undue pressure.

Their enduring friendship represents more than personal camaraderie - it embodies the future of British tennis. 

As they prepare for Wimbledon, both players will undoubtedly draw strength from their mutual support system.

Despite speculation about their relationship, reports indicate they remain close friends rather than romantic partners.

Raducanu reportedly ended her relationship with Carlo Agostinelli in summer 2024, whilst Draper is thought to be single.

The British number ones have forged a bond through shared experiences at Roehampton and international tournaments.

Their parallel journeys from junior tennis to the sport's biggest stages have created a unique understanding between them.

As Britain's leading tennis talents head into the Championships, their friendship serves as a testament to the collaborative spirit fostering success at the National Tennis Centre.

Currently, the women are enjoying their first campaign back at the Queen's Club Championships since 1973, with the event already going down well amongst the masses.

It marks a new initiative to reinvigorate tennis in the country, whilst also furthering the already-established brand associated with this tournament.

Two full weeks, a festival of tennis, flitting from the WTA to the ATP as Wimbledon looms.

However, the latter has already seen some of its notable stars pull out injured, with Tommy Paul, Matteo Berrettini and Lorenzo Musetti the three outstanding names to have ruled themselves out.

Frustratingly, they now have another departure to contend with, but this one is ironically not related to an injury.

In fact, it just seems like Alexander Bublik would prefer to play elsewhere.

Having been registered for both Queen's and Halle, the latter was likely always his primary destination given he has played there the last two years in a row, winning the title in 2023.

He has flitted between these two events in the past, playing the former in 2022, but enjoying success in one specific event is always bound to draw him back.

And, with Halle seeing some of their star power drop out as well, a spot has opened up for the man who soared into the French Open quarter-finals just earlier this month.

He'll be hoping to maintain that form despite the stark shift in surface.

After thriving on the clay of Roland Garros, Bublik will be freshly backed as someone to support heading into the grass-court season.

Especially given how his thunderous yet deft game favours the latter surface rather than the slow, high-bouncing dirt.

And yet, he still managed to storm into the French Open quarter-finals, defeating the world number five (at the time) on his way to that stage. Bublik's win over Draper led him to claim that he was enjoying ‘the best moment' of his life, but there might still be more to come.

After all, should he convert this newfound energy, and apply it into a real effort to improve and compete, Bublik has everything needed to be a huge threat on grass and at Wimbledon.

It's just a shame that the Queen's crowd won't be treated to his enigmatic, unpredictable play style.

Where does Sunday's final stack up against other GMOAT candidates?BySteve TignorPublished Jun 13, 2025 copy_link

Published Jun 13, 2025

“Dude, that French Open final!” an old friend wrote in an email two days ago. “Just when I thought the glory days were over.”That was the theme of a dozen messages I received and conversations I had this week, and maybe it was for you as well. If any sports fans were unaware of the budding—now fully blooming—rivalry between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner before this weekend at Roland Garros, they know about it today.Part of me even fears that the Spaniard and Italian have set the bar a wee bit high for themselves. Is the sporting public going to be let down if they don't make every Grand Slam final, and don't duel all the way to a fifth-set tiebreaker when they do?But those are worries for another week. For the past few days, tennis fans have been able to bask in a rare moment in the mainstream sun: Sinner and Alcaraz have been the talk of the world.

It hasn't hurt that, even before it was over, their Roland Garros final had entered the G-MOAT—greatest match of all time—conversation. I saw the chatter begin online late in the fifth set, when it became clear that Sinner wasn't going away, and that this would be more than just a legendary comeback by Alcaraz.The match belongs in the best-ever conversation. In terms of quality and drama—the two categories that count—Sinner-Alcaraz was as good as anything that has come before in tennis. The question at the back of my mind since Sunday has been where exactly it should fall in the all-time list.So let's hazard an early guess.For today, to keep the comparisons relatively apples to apples, I'll restrict myself to men's matches played in the Open era. A definitive ranking of the all-time greatest matches, by men or women, in the entirety of tennis history, is a longer-term project—or an impossibility, depending on your point of view. I'll also stipulate that this is a subjective exercise, and not meant to speak for anything other than my personal preferences.

For me, the men's matches since 1968 that stand out are, in chronological order:Pancho Gonzalez d. Charlie Pasarell, 1969 Wimbledon 1st roundBjorn Borg d. John McEnroe, 1980 Wimbledon finalRafael Nadal d. Roger Federer, 2008 Wimbledon finalNovak Djokovic d. Rafael Nadal, 2012 Australian Open finalNovak Djokovic d. Rafael Nadal 2018 Wimbledon semifinalNovak Djokovic d. Roger Federer, 2019 Wimbledon finalCarlos Alcaraz d. Novak Djokovic 2023 Wimbledon finalCarlos Alcaraz d. Jannik Sinner, 2025 Roland Garros final

All of these had multiple twists and turns, with many match points saved and squandered. All went deep into a fifth; Alcaraz-Djokovic was the only one that didn't continue past 5-5 in the deciding set. All of them except Gonzalez-Pasarell and 2018 Djokovic-Nadal were Grand Slam finals, and only Pasarell wasn't a Grand Slam champion. All but two were played on Centre Court at Wimbledon. That makes Sinner vs. Alcaraz, the only one at Roland Garros, an outlier in a good way. Court Philippe Chatrier deserves an all-time great contest.I'll start by eliminating Gonzalez-Pasarell. Yes, it lasted 112 games, but it was a first-round match.Next, I'll eliminate Djokovic-Nadal in Australia, because there was some sense at the time that, at five hours and 53 minutes, it was slightly too long, and that the tennis was slightly too attritional—“brutal,” in the parlance of that moment.(As I said, this is a subjective exercise. I love all of these matches, but I like best-of lists, too, and to make this one I have to find reasons to choose between them wherever I can.)I'll continue by eliminating Borg v. McEnroe because…I guess because it didn't really come to life until the fourth-set tiebreaker.

I'll eliminate Djokovic-Federer, because…I don't know…because it's tough to think that this was Federer's last Slam final, and he lost it after having two match points? Also, as high-quality as the play between these two all-timers was, the rallies weren't quite as extensive or mind-boggling as the ones that Alcaraz and Sinner produced.I'll eliminate Alcaraz-Djokovic because two of the sets were 6-1.That leaves Nadal-Federer 2008 Wimbledon, Djokovic-Nadal 2018 Wimbledon, and Alcaraz-Sinner.Most people probably don't have the Djokovic-Nadal Wimbledon semi from 2018 at the top of their list. But it's an all-time favorite of mine, and the best of their 60 face-offs, in my opinion. On the first day, they raced to beat a curfew, and it only made their play sharper and, especially in Nadal's case, more aggressive. That pace continued the next afternoon. Djokovic's hair's-breadth victory, which he saved with one of his handy running forehand passes late in the fifth, was an appropriate microcosm of their rivalry. And if it wasn't a final, it felt like one to both men—they knew their opponent two days later would be surprise finalist Kevin Anderson. Djokovic indeed went on to beat the South African in straights.Alcaraz-Sinner was as brilliantly played and theatrically thrilling as any match on the list. It featured No. 1 vs. No. 2, on Chatrier's wide expanse of red, in front of a French crowd that lives to amp up the tension. The young players' super-charged mix of pace, finesse and athleticism made it feel like the next step in the game's evolution, and especially its evolution on clay. It featured a goal-line stand in the fourth set from Alcaraz, and a goal-line stand from Sinner in the fifth. And it ended with Alcaraz going stratospheric to win it in the deciding tiebreaker.

Most people probably don't have the Djokovic-Nadal Wimbledon semi from 2018 at the top of their list. But it's an all-time favorite of mine, and the best of their 60 face-offs, in my opinion.

If there's a hesitation about calling Sinner-Alcaraz the greatest match ever, it's probably due to their youth. Someday, we may rank them alongside the Big 3. But their names don't conjure the same sense of historical awe yet.Which brings me to Nadal-Federer at Wimbledon in 2008. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, it was No. 1 vs. No. 2. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, it was brilliantly played; at the time, I thought it was the highest-quality match I'd ever seen. Like Sinner-Alcaraz, one player was trying to invade the other's surface—Nadal succeeded where Sinner failed. In both matches, there was a flurry of shots that saved match points in the fourth set, and sent it to a fifth. And both matches came to a climactic conclusion. On Sunday we had Alcaraz going supernova; in 2008, we had the duel in the darkness.I'll give the darkness, and the cinematic images of agony and ecstasy that it created, the edge. And I'll give the moment the edge as well. Where Alcaraz and Sinner were playing their first Slam final, Nadal and Federer had been contesting them for two years, and had been building to this collision that whole time. It would be far from their final collision, but with this win Nadal would take over No. 1 from Federer for the first time, prove he wasn't just a dirt-baller, and etch their names together forever.

                            • 1 MINUTE READ
                    

Wild cards have been announced for the men's ATP 500 event at the HSBC Championships – including Cam Norrie, Billy Harris and Dan Evans.

The Queen's Club gets set for a second week of world class tennis from 16-22 June after the conclusion of its first women's event for over 50 years. 

Back-to-back Wimbledon and Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz is set to headline the tournament, alongside British No.1 and world No.4 Jack Draper, Taylor Fritz, Holger Rune and Alex de Minaur – and many more.

British No.2 Jacob Fearnley has also earned himself a spot in the main draw at the HSBC Championships following the withdrawals of reigning champion Tommy Paul and Lorenzo Musetti. 

The British wild cards will look to challenge the top-ranked players in the world at one of the most iconic events in the tennis calendar. 

2021 runner-up Norrie returns to The Queen's Club in his best form of the season so far – reaching the fourth round at the French Open and semi-final in Geneva in his last two events. 

This will be Norrie's first grass court event of the summer but it's a surface where he's had some of the best results of his career. A year after making the final at Queen's, the former world No.8 went on to reach the semi-finals at Wimbledon – the best Grand Slam performance of his career. 



Harris was one of the breakout stars of the grass court season last summer – making semi-finals in Surbiton, Nottingham and Eastbourne, as well as a quarter-final at Queen's. 

The big serving Brit is currently ranked just outside the world's top 100 and could tick off that milestone with another good run in West London. 

Heading straight from a second round appearance in Ilkley to the HSBC Championships, Harris will be hoping he can spark his grass court season alight when he returns to the venue that saw him reach his first ATP 500 semi-final almost 12 months ago. 

Evans will be heading back to British soil following a run to the second round of the Libema Open. 

The 35-year-old came through two rounds of qualifying to reach the main draw and beat Australia's Rinky Hijikata in the first round before being defeated by Frenchman Ugo Humbert.

With two grass court tournaments already under his belt this summer, Evans could be one to watch next week as he looks to cause an upset in West London.

Carlos Alcaraz has enjoyed a stellar year thus far, culminating in the retention of his French Open crown earlier this month.

The Spaniard, who is now a five-time Grand Slam champion, will now be hoping to mimic his Parisian feat by successfully defending his Wimbledon title too.

One of very few to have ever won these two events back to back, and now vying to become just the second-ever player to have defended both in successive years as well, so much history is on the line as he prepares to return to the All England Club.

However, before then, he must reacclimate to the grass courts which have served him so well over recent years.

There have been some questions over his preparation ahead of Wimbledon though, with his Queen's participation thrown into doubt.

These worries were sparked by his coach, after he made some comments about their upcoming plans that did not specify when his pupil's next tournament would come.

Juan Carlos Ferrero spoke about Alcaraz's potential Queen's appearance, and played down the chances, admitting that additional tests were needed to confirm.

He noted: ‘The plan is to play him, but we'll make a final decision in a few days.

‘After these days off, on Thursday or Friday, we'll do a test to see how he's feeling physically and mentally.'

Whilst they hope to be available, missing Queen's might mark a huge error from the Carlos Alcaraz team that could have huge repercussions ahead of Wimbledon too.

It seems like Alcaraz is becoming a creature of habit during certain parts of the year, with May to July all following the same pattern.

After all, why fix what's not broken?

The 22-year-old seems to have fallen into the routine of winning the French Open, jetting off to Ibiza for some much-needed downtime, returning to play Queen's as his sole warm-up tournament before then winning Wimbledon too.

If he were to miss that crucial preparatory event, he would be heading to SW19 wholly unprepared, and having broken a routine that has brought him so much success in the past few years.

Hopefully, their tests come back positive, and Alcaraz is given the green light to confirm his attendance at Queen's.

If not, there will be serious worries over his ability to convert his fine form directly from the Parisian clay to the grass of Wimbledon.

Defending champion Tommy Paul is among several big names who have been forced to pull out of next week's ATP 500 at the Queen's Club at the last minute. Paul had been carrying leg and abdominal injuries during his recent run to the quarter-final at the French Open and has now withdrawn from the HSBC Championships due to the latter.

Lorenzo Musetti, the world No. 6 who lost to Paul in last year's final, has also pulled out of Queen's with a leg muscle injury. The Italian retired from his Roland Garros semi-final match against Carlos Alcaraz last week. And two-time former champion Matteo Berrettini will not be playing due to an ab problem.

It comes after Nick Kyrgios, who was set to return to Queen's for the first time since 2019, announced he would be skipping the entire grass season due to an injury setback. World No. 23 Sebastian Korda also pulled out of the draw.

Paul was set to defend his crown at the West Kensington club next week. The American went on an impressive run 12 months ago, dropping just one set to Jack Draper across five matches on his way to the title.

But, after reaching a career-high ranking of No. 8 this week, Paul has officially removed himself from the Queen's entry list. The 28-year-old made it no secret that he was playing through injuries at the recent French Open.

After beating Marton Fucsovics from two sets and 5-3 down in round two, Paul said: “I've been dealing with a bunch of things. But just something in my lower ab I've been dealing with. I mean, for most of the match, I mean, I was feeling it.”

Paul made it all the way to the last eight but visibly struggled and had his right thigh strapped up during his 6-0 6-1 6-4 defeat to Alcaraz and said it quickly became apparent that he “wasn't moving amazing”.

Musetti's French Open campaign also ended in a match against Alcaraz. The Italian pushed took the first set and pushed Alcaraz to a tiebreak in the second but he quickly fell away and retired with the No. 2 seed leading 4-6 7-6(3) 6-0 2-0.

Last year's runner-up at Queen's later explained: “I felt at the beginning of the third when I was serving, I started losing a little bit of strength on the left leg behind, and definitely was going worse and worse, so I decided to stop.

“I think it was, you know, the right decision to make, even if it was not what I wanted. Tomorrow I will do exams, and I will of course see and evaluate the situation.”

Berrettini, who was crowned the Queen's Club champion in 2021 and 2022, will also no longer be playing. The former world No. 6 has been plagued by injuries in recent years and skipped the French Open for the fourth year running.

Meanwhile, Alcaraz's participation in the ATP 500 at Queen's remains in doubt. The world No. 2 successfully defended his French Open crown over the weekend then jetted to Ibiza to celebrate.

His coach, Juan Carlos Ferrero, later confirmed that they would do some tests and make a final decision on whether to play Queen's when he returned.

AI-generated summary reviewed by our newsroom

Eight-year-old Reese Brantmeier stared out her classroom window at a pair of tennis courts, where overgrown weeds sprouted from cracks in the green and red surface.

A rusted fence surrounded the neglected space outside of Washington Elementary in Whitewater, Wisconsin. There was no net; only the empty poles, faded white lines — and memories.

Frustration consumed the fourth grader when she packed her gear into her mom's car to take tennis lessons in Lake Geneva, 45 minutes away. The two courts at her elementary school mocked her from afar.

A teammate on her basketball team had picked up tennis, but hated making the 45-minute commute alone, so she asked Brantmeier to join her. 

Brantmeier enjoyed it enough to keep going, but the future UNC women's tennis star wished she could play in Whitewater. Her school was only 10 minutes away from her house in rural Cold Spring, population: 786. 

But, she had no choice. Wisconsin is a tennis desert. It's difficult to play year-round, and it's expensive.

A large portion of the population of the east side of Whitewater — which includes Washington Elementary – is classified “low-income.” Twenty-nine percent of Whitewater's residents live in poverty, according to U.S. Census data.

Even as her tennis skills and ambition have outgrown Wisconsin, Brantmeier hasn't forgotten the sight of those courts outside her classroom window.

She thought about the courts as she qualified for the U.S. Open at 14, and again at 16. They remained on her mind when a dispute with the NCAA over prize money cost her the first semester of her freshman year — and as she led UNC to its first-ever national championship in spring 2023. 

They were certainly on her mind when a torn meniscus ripped her away from the sport and shattered North Carolina's chances of going back-to-back — and when she sued the NCAA over those prize money rules. 

Andnow, as the 20-year-old Brantmeier works to come back from a second meniscus injury and earn a U.S. Open doubles wild card at a playoff in Orlando on Tuesday, the thought of those courts has not abandoned her. 

“Since she was in the fourth grade,” Her mother, Becky, said, “she said, ‘I'm gonna become famous, and I'm gonna fix those courts.'”

Now, the rusted chain-link fence is gone. The weeds and cracks, too — replaced with new, smooth asphalt. It's not completed, yet, still a work in progress.

But so is Brantmeier. 

Ahead 3-1 in doubles against Southern California with partner Elizabeth Scotty, looking to put UNC ahead in the round of 16 in the 2024 ITA indoor national championship in Seattle, Brantmeier swayed behind the baseline. 

North Carolina returned its entire starting lineup from the 2023 NCAA title run, and was aiming for a fifth-straight indoor title that February, with hopes of an NCAA repeat in the spring. 

On the serve, Brantmeier split-stepped.

Her right knee popped. Something snapped. Her mother could see the pain on Brantmeier's face. 

“The second I took that step, I knew,” Brantmeier said, “I was not gonna be playing tennis like I'd been for a good amount of time.”

To avoid putting pressure on the rest of the team, Brantmeier stayed, and played standing still, even though it meant watching Scotty cover the court like a singles match. 

After the pair won 6-3, trainers carted Brantmeier off the court. 

UNC finished off USC, but lost to N.C. State, 4-3, the next day without Brantmeier.

The on-site doctor said she had patellar subluxation — her kneecap had popped out. It moved back into place on its own, so she could be back competing in two weeks. 

But she wasn't. 

An MRI back in Chapel Hill revealed a bucket-handle tear of her meniscus, a notoriously slow-healing injury. 

“It was just shock,” Brantmeier said. “And a lot of disappointment.”

Doctors gave Brantmeier two options.

One: Repair her meniscus, hoping to increase her health and longevity as an athlete. Sit out for six months. 

Two: Remove it completely. Sit out for two months.

She settled on the repair, at her doctors' recommendation. Brantmeier's mother, Becky, traveled to North Carolina to be with her daughter. 

That repair usually takes four or five permanent sutures. Brantmeier required 12, a record for her surgeon. She was bedridden in her mother's hotel room. 

“It was the most pain I've ever been in,” she said.

Then came blood clots, which set back the healing process.

“I told her I'd stay there until she had one day without complications,” Becky said.

She stayed a week.

It didn't get any easier. Walking to class on crutches exhausted Brantmeier. She skipped some days because of the pain. Still, she traveled to every match. If she couldn't be on court, she felt she at least owed the team that much.

“Somebody gets injured, something gets taken away, their attitude goes south,” head coach Brian Kalbas said. “Hers never went south.”

But the losses weighed on her.

Confined to the sidelines of the NCAA super regional, Brantmeier watched as the team's hopes for another national championship crashed. 

First, Texas A&M took the doubles point, clinching on Court 1 — where Brantmeier should've been playing. Then, three singles matches. Once again, the clinch came at the No. 1 seed. Her court. 

“I would have given anything to be able to help out,” Brantmeier said.

Who was Brantmeier without tennis?

This wasn't the first time she'd faced that question. In the fall of her freshman year, before her first individual tournament, the NCAA began investigating some of her prize money and expenses from high school. 

Prior to college enrollment, athletes can accept up to $10,000 per calendar year in prize money from professional tournaments. Beyond that, they can only accept money to cover “actual and necessary expenses” — like meals, lodging, equipment and “other reasonable expenses.” 

Brantmeier's family said they never received an itemization of what was being disputed, only random questions — particularly related to the nearly $49,000 for making it to the third round of the 2021 U.S. Open singles qualifying tournament and the main draw in doubles. 

Her mother had bought a receipt scanner to track their expenses. The NCAA questioned if it was necessary, as well as a racket restringing outside of a 14-day competition window and a hotel room 16-year-old Brantmeier shared with her mother at the U.S. Open. 

The NCAA refused to certify her amateur status for four months, rendering her ineligible for the fall semester.

“I had come to college to play tennis and that was all I'd done my whole life,” Brantmeier said. “So not being able to do that, I kind of was a little lost. I [didn't] really know why I'm here.”

The NCAA did not respond to a request for comment. 

At the end of winter break, the NCAA ruled she had to pay $5,100 to a charity of her choice. Then she could finally play college tennis. 

She remembered the courts. 

Brantmeier donated the money to the Patrick Ryan Memorial Tennis Foundation — aimed at promoting tennis in Wisconsin. She grew up taking lessons where David Ryan, the organizer of the foundation, also played. She asked him to resurface the courts in her hometown.

After her donation, Brantmeier found out it needed more work. The estimate totaled $200,000. She offered to become the spokesperson.

She fund-raised. Wrote grants. Networked with pro players and UNC donors. Ran clinics. 

A year later, she turned to the work during her injury. It made the weeks and months on the sidelines go by a little quicker. 

“I hadn't thought about tennis for myself in a long time,” Brantmeier said. “I was trying to give tennis back to a lot of people.”

In March 2024, she sued the NCAA. The legal action seeks a change in the prize money rules, specifically the ban on athletes' ability to receive money for outside competitions beyond expenses. 

“When the distinction was you cannot make money at all [and] that was the line that they drew, that's a fair distinction between amateur and pro,” Brantmeier said. “But now in this NIL era that we're in, it's just out of date.”

Eight months after the surgery, Brantmeier's knee still hurt. It made strange noises when she moved. 

A scope procedure in the fall of 2024 revealed the meniscus cartilage never healed. The repair had failed.

So, back under the knife she went. This time, surgeons removed her meniscus, resetting all progress.

“Ending up now without my meniscus, knowing that I could have done that earlier and played for the team by the end of the spring, was really tough to know,” Brantmeier said. “But obviously hindsight's 20/20.”

She woke up from her procedure in October and felt she could walk on her knee immediately. 

Brantmeier couldn't join the team in practice until January, right before the first match of the season against James Madison. She came back early to school from winter break to train, but only played one practice set. 

“I truly had no idea if I was gonna be ready,” Brantmeier said. “But it was to a point if I'm physically cleared, it's gonna be tough regardless, you've just got to rip the Bandaid off.”

She won her first match in straight sets. It was the most fun she'd had playing tennis since she was a kid making those commutes to Lake Geneva. 

She was back.

Brantmeier upset the No. 1 singles player in the nation at top-ranked Georgia in February to lead the team to a 4-3 victory. She finished the regular season with a 14-1 singles record and ranked No. 7 in the nation. 

In doubles, Brantmeier and her partner, freshman Alanis Hamilton, ranked No. 2 with a 23-3 record. 

She clinched North Carolina's 2025 ACC Tournament Championship and was named Tournament MVP. Four days later, the ACC named her player of the year. 

At the height of her game, she led UNC to the NCAA Tournament quarterfinals in May. 

Then, after hitting a serve in her singles match against LSU, Brantmeier landed awkwardly. Wincing, hands gripped her right leg. 

She called an injury timeout, but the pain in her knee was too much. She retired from the match, recording only her second loss of the season. Trainers carried her off the court. Again.

This time, it was a slight tear in her medial meniscus — the remaining pad of cartilage in her knee. 

Two days later, UNC's season ended in the NCAA semifinals with a 4-0 loss to Georgia. 

“She has been playing such good tennis — the best tennis I've seen all semester,” senior teammate Lindsay Zink said. “It's been tough to see her get reinjured, but I know she's gonna come back better than ever.”

Washington Elementary principal Tom Grosinske stood outside the Whitewater school in May. He took out his phone and hit record. 

“Hey Reese, it's Mr. G here,” Gronsinske said in the video. “I thought you wanted to see something pretty awesome.” 

He flipped the camera to pan across the scene around him. Every time there's changes on those no-longer-abandoned courts, he records an update and sends it to Brantmeier. 

In the first video, the removal of the rusted fencing. Next, the stripping of the cracked surface down to sand. Most recently, the laying of the base-level pavement.

“Everyone has a vision — a hero or someone [they've] admired,” Gregory Stewart, an assistant coach for the girls' tennis team at Whitewater High, said. “Reese [is] that within our community.”

Weeks have passed since Brantmeier's latest injury, but she's returned to training. Tuesday, she and Hamilton will travel to Orlando to face three other collegiate doubles teams. The winner will earn a spot in the U.S. Open.

Meanwhile, Brantmeier v. NCAA is proceeding to discovery. On July 7, nearly seven weeks before the U.S. Open, a judge will decide whether to certify it as a class action suit. If granted, a trial is expected to follow in the summer of 2026.

And as for those courts in Whitewater? Brantmeier has raised more than $159,000 in three years. Until the crew broke ground this summer, a green sign decorated the fence outside as a reminder that she hadn't forgotten. In white, bold lettering: 

Help us renovate these courts and bring tennis back to the East side. 

The Reese Brantmeier Project.

That name is apropos for the Whitewater tennis court reclamation project, but also for Brantmeier's ongoing journey through the tennis world. 

The former appears close to a positive resolution.

The latter appears to be just getting started — again.

If Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce take another hiatus from the spotlight, it won't come as a surprise. An insider exclusively told RadarOnline that the pop star has plans to take a year off with her beau amid rumors about their engagement and marriage. Swift reportedly told her friends that she has been spending a “freeing time” with the NFL star. The couple previously took a brief break from the public eye before resuming public appearances through date nights and holiday outings.

Over the past few weeks, Taylor Swift has had a busy personal and professional life. She regained ownership of her music catalogue while also marking date nights with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. RadarOnline exclusively reported that the singer has no complaints with her life at the moment and is quite optimistic about her future with the Kansas City Chiefs tight end. According to the source, Swift told her friends, “Having control over my music and building a genuine life with someone I care about — that's exactly what I needed.”

On May 30, the singer took to her social media to announce that she had brought back her masters from Shamrock Capital, six years after record executive Scooter Braun allegedly acquired them without her knowledge. Since her milestone achievement, Swift has been out and about with Kelce, most recently at Game 4 of the Stanley Cup Final.

Amid marriage speculations, the couple is reportedly staying committed for the long haul. A source close to the pair told RadarOnline that the duo sees this as their “final relationship.” The insider continued, “They're taking their time, but those close to them believe an engagement is imminent.” They further hinted that the proposal will happen at the “right moment.”

Swift and Kelce fueled marriage rumors after a wedding planner's envelope for the couple went viral. Page Six reported that while attending Kelce's fellow NFL pal Cole Kmet's wedding, the two went by, “Taylor and Travis Kelce.” While the couple is yet to address these speculations directly, fans have been eagerly waiting for a celebratory update.

It's been nearly a decade since record five-time champion Andy Murray last lifted the trophy at the HSBC Championships, but the echoes of his legacy still resonate on the Queen's Club grass.

At this year's edition of the ATP 500 event, Jack Draper will step onto the newly-named Andy Murray Arena with his sights set on carving his own history as the first British titlist since former World No. 1 Murray in 2016.

Draper arrives at Queen's Club at a career-high No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings after an eye-catching ascent, highlighted by three ATP Tour titles. While his victory in Indian Wells in March marked his first ATP Masters 1000 trophy, it was his breakthrough triumph in Stuttgart 12 months ago that underscored his grass-court pedigree and cemented his status as British No. 1.



Fans in west London have already witnessed Draper's potential at Queen's Club. Competing as a wild card in 2021, he upset third seed Jannik Sinner to record his first tour-level match win. Although he was forced to miss the 2023 grass swing due to a shoulder injury, Draper returned last year to seal another statement victory over then-defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.

“I have gone through a lot in the last couple of years,” Draper said after his straight-sets win over Alcaraz. “Coming here two years ago, I had just broken the Top 100, I felt like a bit of an imposter at the tournament. I had been here when I was very young watching Andy play, and it was a completely new experience for me.

“Last year having to miss out on the grass really hurt, but I think it was a blessing in disguise. Ever since I came back from those injuries I have been really putting in great work.”







Despite those headline victories, Draper is yet to advance past the quarter-finals at the iconic event. But this year, the 23-year-old is no longer an imposter. With runs to the semi-finals at the US Open last year and to his biggest title yet in Indian Wells — where he toppled two-time defending champion Alcaraz en route — Draper has firmly established himself among the sport's elite.
Yet for those well-placed to comment, Draper's rapid rise was less a surprise than an inevitability.
“Jack, I think, has bigger goals to aspire to than being British No. 1,” Murray said at Queen's last year. “In my opinion, he can get right up to the top of the game, right to the top of the world rankings. He works really hard and I think grass is a brilliant surface for him. I think he'll do really well over the years on the surface.”
Indeed, Draper's ascent has not only been defined by results, but by resilience. Having overcome a string of physical setbacks earlier in his career, the Briton has redefined his approach, placing renewed emphasis on his conditioning. Draper competed in just four tournaments across the first three months of the year, but yielded a fourth-round finish at the Australian Open, a runner-up showing in Doha and a title run in Indian Wells that propelled him inside the Top 10 for the first time.

Draper then carried that momentum onto the clay, which was once considered his least natural surface, with an inspired run to the final at the ATP Masters 1000 in Madrid. Despite falling short to Casper Ruud, it was a further signal of his growing adaptability and confidence.
Now, as he returns to home soil at Queen's Club, the second-seeded Draper is among the leading contenders for the crown. In pursuit of his first title at the tournament that helped inspire his dream, Draper aims to join a prestigious roll of champions that includes not only Murray, but other ATP No. 1 Club members Rafael Nadal, Lleyton Hewitt, and Andy Roddick.

Tommy Paul enjoyed a four-game winning streak at the French Open, making it to the quarter-finals, but was ultimately defeated by eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz. 

Alcaraz crushed Paul, 6-0, 6-1, 6-4, beating him for the fourth time in a row en route to his second consecutive Roland Garros title.

The American didn't look to be anywhere near his best in the match, considering his hot run of form on the clay courts of both the Italian Open and the French Open.

Paul‘s struggles in his clash with the Spaniard have now been made clearer, after the 28-year-old provided fans with an injury update ahead of the Queen's, where he is the defending champion. 

Paul took to Instagram to say: “I'm crushed, I will not be able to play Queen's next week. I sadly am still recovering from an abdominal strain and need more time to get fully fit. 

“I look forward to getting back on the grass soon. TP,” added the world number eight. 

Update from Tommy Paul pic.twitter.com/0o9w8LC930

He won Queen's for the first time last season, after defeating Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets in the final, to hoist the trophy on Centre Court, which is now the Andy Murray Arena.

The triumph marked his third career title, having picked up a maiden ATP crown at Stockholm in 2021, and clinching his second in 2024 at the Dallas Open. 

Paul won Queen's while only dropping one set throughout the tournament, which came in the quarter-final against Jack Draper.

After defeating Sebastian Baez and Alejandro Tabilo in the first two rounds, he played the British home hope in their fifth career meeting. 

Draper forced a third set in the match, but wasn't able to get over the line against a red-hot Paul, who he had beaten in three of their previous four clashes. 

In an all-American semi-final, Paul was able to best his compatriot Sebastian Korda 6-4, 7-6, to book his place in the final. 

He got off to a hot start in his showdown with Musetti on Centre Court, taking the first set 6-1, and despite the Italian's best efforts in the second set, he emerged victorious in London.

A new and exciting adventure begins for Carlos Alcaraz with the dispute of the ATP 500 Queen's 2025. The Spaniard arrives for his first encounter with the grass court, brimming with confidence from his achievements in Paris and with his sights set on Wimbledon 2025 where he will defend his title. It is important to review aspects such as the schedule, timings, where to watch, and the prize money of the English tournament.

There is no respite in the tennis calendar, especially not in this swift transition between two vastly different surfaces like clay and grass. The top players on the men's circuit will seek to adjust to this surface in preparation for Wimbledon 2025. Like the past two years, Carlos Alcaraz has chosen the ATP 500 Queen's 2025 as a testing ground before the third Grand Slam of the year.

- Schedule and Timings of ATP Queen's 2025

The final draw of the London tournament will take place from Monday, June 16, to Sunday, June 22, consisting of 32 players with no byes in the first round for any of the favorites. This means that everyone needs to win five matches to become the champion, resulting in almost daily matches throughout the week. The matches will begin at 12:00 local time, which translates to 13:00 in Spain, while the final will be held at 14:00 local time, corresponding to 15:00 in Spain.

In his debut, Alcaraz may face big names such as Dimitrov, Popyrin, Davidovich, Nakashima, Lehecka, or Mpetshi-Perricard, reflecting the challenge of emerging victorious in a tournament with a condensed lineup that intensifies competitiveness. The last-minute withdrawals of Musetti, Paul, Korda, and Berrettini have slightly clarified the situation.

- Prize Money and Ranking Points in ATP Queen's 2025

A significant cash prize awaits at the tournament competing with Halle to attract top stars in the circuit. Besides presumed high participation rates, the prize money is substantial, totaling €2,522,220. Additionally, the winner earns 500 ranking points. Here is how the prize money is distributed in the various rounds:

Made in Ukraine: Elina Svitolina has teamed up with fashion designer and compatriot Svitlana Bevza.for a Wimbledon-inspired capsule clothing collection.The limited capsule, which released this week, is inspired by the upcoming grass-court Grand Slam, which is one of Svitolina's most fruitful events; she's reached the semifinals twice—including in 2023 following a dramatic upset of Iga Swiatek when she was world No. 1.Paying homage to the tradition and prestige of Wimbledon, the high-end capsule reimagines some of Bevza brand's classic pieces, including its "Anna" dress and its signature hair bow, with a personal touch by Svitolina.

The entire collaboration took a year to produce, according to *Elle* *Ukraine*, where Bevza also said in an interview that after watching her country's top tennis player compete for the first time in 2023, she "fell in love with her strength, resilience and inner composure."It was something absolutely hypnotic—the way she holds herself, the way she moves, the way she doesn't seem to," Bevza, named Designer of the Year in Ukraine by Elle in 2018, said. "It was this feeling that I wanted to convey in this collection: the strength that comes from within."Svitolina modeled the collection, which also includes high-waist square trousers and a monogrammed bucket hat, at an April photo shoot by Anna Brudna in Paris.

While spending six weeks filming their two new Hallmark Channel movies in Spain, Alison Sweeney and Ashley Williams picked up some great new wardrobe pieces — straight from the costume department. 

But they didn't just take a couple of things. During an interview with EntertainmentNow about filming “To Barcelona, With Love,” which debuted on June 7, and “To Barcelona, Forever,” premiering on June 14, the stars and longtime friends laughed as they admitted to taking their characters' entire wardrobes home with them. 

“I literally kept everything,” Williams said, laughing and covering her face. “Guilty!” 

When Sweeney heard Williams' admission, she chimed in, “Same! I had a whole other suitcase I had to bring home!” 

While Williams and Sweeney clearly loved the wardrobe pieces enough to wear them all in real life, they both said that the clothes created and selected for them were critical for getting to know their characters. 

In “To Barcelona, With Love,” Williams plays Anna, an author whose latest book is a flop in America but a big hit in Spain. She's unaware that the writer who translated her book into Spanish — Sweeney's character, American expat Erica — secretly revised the love story set in her adopted city, Barcelona. Through lots of highs and lows, the two eventually develop a kinship (and one winds up in a blossoming romance), leading to the second movie, which takes place six months later.  

As executive producers of the movies, Williams and Sweeney had got to help choose the creative team, including who dressed their characters. 

During their chat with EntertainmentNow, Sweeney told Williams, “You brought in such a brilliant costume designer for us, because she really encapsulated our characters and gave us the physicality of like, what they wear and how they dress and how they look — before we even set foot on stage. And that helped me a lot to define who Erica is. And then, you know, just developing that along as we went was really so much fun for me.” 

Williams replied, “Shout out to Julia Schklair — she is a costume designer I actually worked with like 15 or 20 years ago on a TV show and we've kept in touch. I remember, Ali, after you had your fitting with her, you called me and said, ‘Okay, now I'm really excited!'” 

“You know, Ali and I've done a lot of these movies,” Williams continued, “and there's a couple of designers out of Vancouver that just make the movie for us. You just are able to find the character. It's acompletely different experience doing a movie where you feel like you're embodying the character because of the clothes that you're wearing. When the clothes fit, everything else, so many other things go into place and shout out to her, because she just did an unbelievable job. She made me feel very at home in the character.”

When Hallmark fans rejoin the dynamic duo in “To Barcelona, Forever,” they'll see Anna return to Barcelona to celebrate Erica and Nico's engagement. 

Sweeney told EntertainmentNow that she and Williams hope it's evident to viewers how their characters have grown since their paths first crossed at the start of “To Barcelona, With Love,” as they apply their newfound wisdom to new challenges. 

“You know, they have learned the lessons from the first movie,” she said, “so how do they apply it to the next set of circumstances? So that was, you know, a fun challenge for us at storytellers.” 

“But I think it's really fun, because Ashley's character kind of goes into a whole new adventure in a new in a different part of Spain,” Sweeney added. “So we got to shoot in totally different locations, come across totally different characters.” 

Williams then teased, “There's a family theme in the second movie that's not there at all in the first movie and it provides a lot of comedy.” 

Hallmark Channel's “To Barcelona, Forever” premieres on June 14 at 8 p.m. Eastern time and will be available to stream on Hallmark+ the following day.

Johnson will soon be seen in 'The Smashing Machine' for the indie studio.


							By 

	Mia Galuppo


Film Writer


	Darren Aronofsky is looking to reteam with his The Whale studio A24, and is talks to direct Dwayne Johnson in the feature Breakthrough, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.


	The logline for the film reads: “In turn-of-the-millennium Southern California, an alienated young man comes under the influence of a motivational guru, whose intoxicating charm masks his morally questionable methods of manipulation and his own concealed darkness.” Johnson will be playing a supporting role in the film.




	A24 will produce and finance actor-writer Zeke Goodman.

	











	Stacey Sher's Shiny Penny Productions will produce with Johnson and Dany Garcia's Seven Bucks Productions. Jacob Epstein and Justin Wolf will executive produce via Lighthouse Management and Media.

	This will be the second A24 project for Johnson, who stars in Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine, which is due out this October. Johnson, who is known for family-friendly fare like Jungle Cruise and Red One, has been setting up projects with auteur directors as of late. He is set to star in a Hawaii-set mob epic with Emily Blunt and Leonardo DiCaprio from director Martin Scorsese.


	Aronofsky will soon release crime thriller Caught Stealing.

EXCLUSIVE: Darren Aronofsky is in early conversations to direct the A24 pic Breakthrough that has Dwayne Johnson on board. Sources stress it is still very early, but if a deal closes this would mark his return to A24 after helming The Whale, which won Brendan Fraser an Oscar. Zeke Goodman penned the script.


	A24 had no comment.


	Set in turn-of-the-millennium Southern California, the story follows an alienated young man who comes under the influence of a motivational guru, whose intoxicating charm masks his morally questionable methods of manipulation and his own concealed darkness. We're told Johnson will play the supporting role of the guru, with casting still underway for the lead role and other supporting parts.

	











	The pic will be produced and financed by A24. Stacey Sher's Shiny Penny Productions will produce alongside Johnson and Dany Garcia's Seven Bucks Productions, with Jacob Epstein and Justin Wolf to exec produce via Lighthouse Management and Media.




			Watch on Deadline		







	Next up for Aronofsky is the Sony thriller Caught Stealing, starring Austin Butler and Zoe Kravitz. That pic will bow this August.


	He is repped by CAA.

Ryan Coogler is thanking fellow filmmaker Christopher Nolan for not only inspiring him, but also making the world a better place thanks to Nolan's art. “Sinners” director Coogler selected Nolan's directorial debut “Following” while visiting the Criterion Closet in the below video, and couldn't help but praise Nolan for changing cinema. 

“This is my guy. I've come to know him. I've come to know his wife [producer Emma Thomas]. Amazing people,” Coogler said. “First and foremost, they're just lovers of cinema, and lovers of family. The world is richer because they're making movies.” 

 










Coogler added that Nolan is a “mentor of mine,” no doubt since they both share indie filmmaking roots, have gone on to helm large IP installments (the “Black Panther” and “Dark Knight” respective trilogies), and also direct original blockbusters. The duo also champion IMAX technology.

Nolan's directorial debut “Following” premiered at Slamdance 1999. The film centers on an aspiring writer who stalks people to find inspiration. “It's just brilliant because it's obviously the most indie you'll ever see…Mr. Nolan, he's finding his way,” Coogler said while in the Criterion Closet (Criterion released “Following” in 2012). “A lot of the Christopher Nolan trademarks are here in this movie.”

 










Coogler also selected “Thief” by Michael Mann as being a film “in discussion” with “Following.” Mann's 1981 feature “Thief” is a neo-noir heist movie starring the late James Caan. 

“I do think that in observing Chris' movies, I think that Michael Mann is a big influence,” Coogler said. “You can feel it quite a bit when you look at this film. If you haven't seen this movie [‘Thief'], holy fucking shit, this movie.” 

And “Thief” also changed the game for crafts in filmmaking: Coogler added, “What I heard is that…a rumor about this film is this is the movie that made wetdowns a thing. A wetdown, if you don't know, is when you've got enough money to (this is probably a waste of water) to have a truck wet your streets down, and what it does is it makes, for nighttime photography, it makes the streets reflective.” 

Coogler previously thanked Nolan, along with auteur Spike Lee and Quentin Tarantino, for helping inspire “Sinners.” Coogler wrote in a letter shared with IndieWire, “I had the gift of the opportunity of making a film inspired by my family and my ancestry, but it was always a film that we wanted to make for audiences, in theaters. We always had our minds on you, the audience, and felt a deep responsibility to entertain you, and move you in the way only cinema can. We don't get to do what we do if you don't show up. To see your response to the film has reinvigorated me and many others who believe in this art form. And together maybe we can expand the definition of what a blockbuster is, what a horror movie is, and of what an IMAX audience looks like.”

Celine Song has found her next project, “Damage,” a series she's currently developing for HBO set in the world of competitive E-Sports.

The “Materialists” and “Past Lives” filmmaker told Variety in an interview that she's currently developing the series for HBO, but she declined to share any other specific plot information. An individual with knowledge of the project confirmed to IndieWire the series is in development. 

Here's the official logline: A gaming prodigy joins the ranks of a professional E-Sports team, where's she's taken under the wing of an older player with whom she shares a tragic past.

 










Song is writing, directing, and serving as executive producer on the series. Song will team with “The Last of Us” and “Chernobyl” creator Craig Mazin on the series, who is also joining as an executive producer. And A24, which produced both of Song's films, is co-producing the series with HBO.

Mazin, Jacqueline Lesko, and Cecil O'Connor are non-writing executive producers on behalf of their company, and Song's collaborator David Hinojosa is also a non-writing executive producer.

It's a big departure for Song, whose first two features have been indie love triangles (Song might disagree), though “Materialists” specifically has generated plenty of conversation for how it blends genres. 

“Past Lives” from 2023 was nominated for two Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay, and it served as a breakout role for lead Greta Lee. Her latest feature “Materialists,” which opens wide in theaters today from A24, stars Dakota Johnson, Chris Evans, and Pedro Pascal and stars Johnson as a romantic matchmaker. 

E-Sports had been one of the burgeoning industries for a matter of years, with games like “League of Legends,” “Valorant,” “Call of Duty,” “Overwatch,” and others, and it has a sizable fanbase that has made hits out of shows like Netflix's “Arcane,” a spinoff of “League of Legends” as produced by the game's developer Riot Games. But while competitive leagues continue to generate revenue, it's still largely been a niche industry trying to break into the mainstream. Hollywood, though, has seen video games become one of the biggest new realms to find intellectual property, so it only makes sense that HBO would want a piece of the action.

Celine Song's romantic dramedy “Materialists” opens from A24 in what we hear are about 2,800 theaters in the U.S. this weekend — majorly more screens than Song's debut “Past Lives,” which opened two years ago in four theaters. Strong social sentiment and positive reviews initially set the stage for a possible $7 million opening, but A24 could be looking at another fast-rising hit on its hands if the movie opens above $10 million, which is entirely possible. 

On this week's episode of IndieWire's “Screen Talk” podcast, co-hosts Anne Thompson and Ryan Lattanzio dish on what needs to happen for “Materialists” to sustain potential early success — especially as Dakota Johnson, with co-stars Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal at her side, delivers another viral press tour with candid thoughts on “Materialists,” plus “Madame Web” and Hollywood's drive for repetition and remakes.

Elsewhere on the podcast, we make some early Emmy predictions and share hopes (and hope-nots). Anne recently binged four seasons of Apple TV+'s “Slow Horses” and has great things to say about the Gary Oldman-starring spy series, but major drama contenders this year are “The Pitt,” the HBO Max medical drama packaged as the kind of old-fashioned, true-television series rarely made these days. Particularly as so many series are structured, written, and cut as basically 10-hour movies or longer. “Severance” also wrapped an unforgettable Season 2 this year, and Emmy voters are paying attention.

 










As the summer movie season rolls on but with more tentpoles and major studio releases to come, we also took a beat to make some early bids for potential Governors Awards recipients. The honorary Academy Awards — if AMPAS is paying attention to Scott Feinberg's massive Hollywood Reporter list of 100 worthy contenders — could award folks like Mike Leigh, Glenn Close, Jack Fisk, Werner Herzog, Harrison Ford, Isabelle Huppert, Eddie Murphy, or many more. 

We also dish on last weekend's Tony Awards and what stage shows would make for the best movies, or not. Glenn Close has been trying to get “Sunset Blvd.,” a film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical, off the ground for nearly a decade. Blockbuster ticket sales and Tony wins for Nicole Scherzinger's ongoing Broadway iteration, directed by Jamie Lloyd, could embolden Hollywood to expedite development and production on a screen version.

Peacock‘s Crystal Lake rounds out its series regular cast with the addition of Devin Kessler (Godfather of Harlem), Cameron Scoggins (Shades of Blue, Nashville), and Gwendolyn Sundstrom. 


They join the previously announced stars Linda Cardellini and William Catlett in the Friday the 13th prequel series from Brad Caleb Kane, who will also serve as writer, showrunner, and executive producer. The show's premise is being kept under wraps.


	Cardellini will play Pamela Voorhees, mother of masked killer Jason Voorhees—as in, chee chee chee, ah, ah, ah—who was believed to have drowned as a boy in Crystal Lake but emerges years later seeking revenge for the murder of his serial killer mommy, Pamela. Betsy Palmer played the female antagonist in the first Friday the 13th film, released in 1980. The role has subsequently been played by Marilyn Poucher, Paula Shaw, and Nana Visitor in various sequels, crossovers, and reboot movies. Catlett will play a character named Levon Brooks.

EXCLUSIVE: After collaborating on one of the great TV characters of the 21st century, Matthew McConaughey and True Detective creator Nic Pizzolatto have set their sights on another classic character to tackle. Sources tell Deadline that McConaughey is in talks to star in Skydance's feature film based on the iconic Mike Hammer from a script by Pizzolatto.


	Skydance acquired the rights to Mickey Spillane's and Max Allan Collins' Mike Hammer franchise with plans to develop and produce the bestselling book series into a feature film. Skydance's David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Don Granger will produce along with Entertainment 360's Guymon Casady. Benjamin Forkner of Pendleton will also produce as will Ken F. Levin also will produce. Collins will executive produce with Jane Spillane serving as co-producer. Carin Sage will oversee the project for Skydance.

	











	Hammer is the protagonist of a series of hardboiled detective novels, starting with 1947's I, the Jury, becoming one of the most popular figures of the genre.




			Watch on Deadline		







	With more than 250 million copies of Mike Hammer books sold globally, it often is recognized as the most popular American mystery/thriller series of all time. Hammer is credited with inspiring numerous other characters including Dirty Harry, Jack Reacher and James Bond, who Ian Fleming famously referred to as “the British answer to Mike Hammer.”


	McConaughey and Pizzolatto have teased a reunion for years following the success of season of True Detective, which earned both of them Emmy nominations. There had even been talks of the two reuniting along with fellow True Detective star Woody Harrelson for another season, but in recent weeks their attention zeroed in on the Mike Hammer movies after Pizzolatto got him the script. Hammer has all the makings of another character the two talents can blow out of the water, and now the project will look to land a high-profile director to take over the reins.


	While McConaughey hasn't starred in a live-action movie since 2019's The Gentlemen — he did reprise his role in the animated pic Sing 2 in 2021 — the Oscar winner has a big 2025 ahead of him. His film The Rivals of Amziah King premiered at this year's SXSW Film Festival and quickly became one of the big winners of the fest, earning rave reviews following its premiere. He has the Apple Original Films thriller The Lost Bus bowing later this year with Paul Greengrass directing. Apple recently released the teaser trailer, which drew huge buzz on social media with many expecting the film and McConaughey to be back in the mix among contenders this awards season.

	











	He also is set to make his return to TV with the Apple and Skydance series Brothers, which reunites with Harrelson who is also set to star.


	Pizzolatto's recent work includes his first film as writer-director, Easy's Waltz as well as multiple projects for Skydance and a television show in development with Netflix.


	McConaughey is repped by WME and Yorn Levine Barns, and Pizzolatto is repped by WME, Gillett Management and Eric Brooks of Goodman Genow Schenkman.

In Hollywood, there seem to be two camps when it comes to AI. 

Some preach how it will change how films are made, but with few tangible examples to back up the capabilities of the new technology. On the other side are anti-AI zealots, contributing an oversized backlash over anyone who uses AI tools in their work.

Stepping bravely into the enormous void between both is writer/director Scott Z. Burns, an AI-skeptic who wanted to see if it was actually a tool he could use. Specifically, Burns wanted to see if large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could help him with a screenplay for the sequel to his and director Steven Soderbergh's “Contagion,” a journey he documented in the new Audible Original podcast series “What Could Go Wrong?”

So, are LLMs a useful screenwriting tool? Can one ever write a screenplay itself? Can it help come up with a great idea for a movie? The answer is complicated, and the eight-episode series does a great job exploring the question from multiple perspectives, but overall, Burns has walked away from the experiment far less concerned that AI will ever become a successful screenwriter.

 











			Popular on IndieWire		






“It can't write scenes,” said Burns when he was a guest on an upcoming episode of IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast.

In one episode of “What Could Go Wrong?,” Burns tried to break a scene with actors Jennifer Ehle and Laurence Fishburne, who play CDC doctors in the original “Contagion,” and “Lexter,” Burns' Gen-AI collaborator. It's here that the limitations of Lexter, a customized ChatGPT, are apparent. Regardless of the prompt and modifications they feed Lexter, it's unable to capture the internal emotions and interpersonal dynamics between the two former colleagues.

“It does run out of gas when you start getting into some of the more detailed parts of filmmaking,” said Burns. “It doesn't have an experience of itself in three-dimensional space, and we, I think, underestimate what our physicality makes available to us.”

Writing scenes, though, wasn't Burns' goal going into the experiment. “What I was interested in using it for was very quickly coming up with a cool idea for a movie.”

“Contagion” was a hit when released in 2011 but found a whole second life in 2020 during the COVID lockdown, when millions were drawn to watch or rewatch the thriller that captured a dramatized version of what we were all living through. To make the original, Burns and Soderbergh worked with several top epidemiologists, who helped get many details on how a modern pandemic would play out, nine years before COVID hit.

 










That success sparked the desire to do a sequel, but the premise of a second fictional but science-based pandemic, coming after the audience had experienced a real one, had been elusive to Burns and Soderbergh. Burns hoped AI could help quickly explore multiple different science-based premises and help quickly iterate ideas based on “what if” questions until they found the seed of a premise they could build off.

“AI is useful in that regard,” said Burns. “So if you have an idea and you're trying to go, ‘OK, so what do we do now with this idea? What are the permutations? What are the possible things?' It's really good at making lists.”

Burns and Soderbergh made one big breakthrough with Lexter. Burns has requested IndieWire not get too detailed so as not to spoil the podcast, but underlined that this breakthrough came through a series of mistakes.

“The Lexter story to me is what ends up being the point of this whole experiment,” said Burns. “Which is Lexter wasn't meant to be my writing partner, companion, whatever we want to call it; Lexter was meant to be a [film] critic. And why we created a critic was, at one point, we were having a conversation, and we thought, ‘Well, let's ask a critic if making a sequel to “Contagion” is even a good idea.' So, of course we had to create an AI critic, and that was Lexter.”

 










The sharp-tongued, British-accented Siskel and Ebert bot's biggest contribution to the new premise was also a mistake, or a happy accident. The idea for the premise came from Lexter disregarding a key aspect of Burns' prompt and creating a scenario outside the perimeters it was given.

Burns believes the ability to quickly work through different scientific permutations of what the next pandemic might be, and therefore quickly offering a number of potential narrative roads to go down, plays to Gen AI's strength. But could this type of brainstorming work for other movies? Burns is highly doubtful, and his experience with Lexter leads him to believe that if studios rely on AI to generate movie premises, they'll end up with derivative work at best.

“We spent a lot of time in the podcast wondering about whether the technique we were using would actually work for other movies,” said Burns. “And then all of a sudden, you're like, ‘Oh, so now am I actually doing what a streamer might be doing?' Reassembling the constituent parts of other movies into a new movie. And that's where I wish there was a more robust conversation happening, [that] you can't, I think, rely on an AI to get you [an original] movie like ‘Anora.'”

And how does Burns see screenwriters using Lexter moving forward? He's currently running a writers' room for a new Netflix series, and he sees how fearful writers are of using AI.

 










“Even sitting here today, I have a lot of anxiety about how people will react to me having done this thought experiment,” said Burns. “Because there are a lot of people in my guild, some of whom I'm very close friends with, who find AI to be an affront.”

Burns believes that once screenwriters realize AI can't come up with original ideas, nor write scenes, they might be more open to using it.

“I'm encouraging people not to be fearful; it's not writing the scenes,” said Burns. “What it can do is if you have a character and you can fill the prompt with unique, very specific details about who that person is and what they want in the world, and then you say, ‘That person needs to take their daughter on vacation because they're trying to connect. Where should they go, and what should they do?' It'll spit out five ideas really quickly. And so does it allow you to go faster? Yes. I'm not entirely sure if it allows you to go further.”

All eight episodes of “What Could Go Wrong?” are available now on Audible, and wherever you get your podcasts.

EXCLUSIVE: Succession alum and Stereophonic Tony nominee Juliana Canfield has landed the female lead opposite Brandon Sklenar in F.A.S.T., the action thriller from Warner Bros.


	Character details for Canfield are under wraps. In the film, marking the feature directorial debut of veteran DP Ben Richardson, a former special forces commando is tapped by the DEA to lead a black op strike team against CIA-protected drug dealers.


	Script is by mega TV producer Taylor Sheridan, who was commissioned by Warner Bros prior to his current overall deal with Paramount, with the latter granting Taylor's request to render services, within Paramount's exclusive window. David Heyman and Jeffrey Clifford will produce for Heyday Films, along with Sheridan and Jenny Wood of Bosque Ranch Productions. Warner Bros. Pictures President of Production Jesse Ehrman and EVP of Production Kevin McCormick are overseeing the film, which will be released in theaters on April 23, 2027.

	











	Coming off of her first Tony Award nomination for her role in 2024's Broadway hit Stereophonic, Canfield previously portrayed Jess Jordan, the assistant to Jeremy Strong's Kendall Roy, in HBO's Succession, winning two SAG Awards as a member of the ensemble.

Some people might be surprised to hear this, but Tom Hiddleston is not the only star of Mike Flanagan's “The Life of Chuck.” He's not even the only Chuck! In Flanagan's sweeping Stephen King adaptation, four different actors play everyman Chuck throughout various periods of his life. There's Hiddleston, of course, as adult Chuck; Cody Flanagan (Mike and co-star Kate Siegel's real-life child) as kid Chuck; Jacob Tremblay as teen Chuck; and first-time film actor Benjamin Pajak as tween Chuck.

It's Pajak who will likely capture the most attention for his work here, even as he acts alongside legends like Mark Hamill and Mia Sara, thanks to his wonderfully open-hearted performance, plus plenty of dancing. While Pajak, just 12 years old at the time of filming, is no stranger to acting (he did, after all, appear on Broadway in “The Music Man” with Hugh Jackman in 2022), the film is his very first film role. It's an auspicious one at that, the kind of star-making role you simply know when you see.

One thing Pajak didn't know initially: He and Hiddleston were playing the same role. How's that for a Hollywood twist?

 










Ahead, Pajak tells IndieWire about getting the role, still being a scaredy-cat when it comes to horror, what he learned from his iconic co-stars, and even gets a little lesson in the sweeping cast of “The Mickey Mouse Club.”

The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.

IndieWire: Benjamin, are you aware of how many nice things people say about you? Like, true Hollywood legends like Mark Hamill and Mia Sara just gush over you.

Benjamin Pajak: I am so grateful for everything that they've said about me and about the film, too. I had such an amazing time working with Mark and Mia, and they've both been such inspirations to me, and they've motivated me to keep doing good work throughout the projects that I've been doing. But no, I just can't say how grateful enough … I could say it a million times to them. They've just been so kind.

I worked with Mark for a little bit more time than with Mia, but I still had amazing relationships with both of them. The one thing that always kind of stuck out to me when we were filming Mark really always kind of stayed in his character. He wasn't Method, he wasn't one of those actors where you have to call them by their [character] names and talk to them like that, but it was just amazing to see him transform into this character. He's unrecognizable in the best way in this film, and that's the thing that I got to take from it.

 










I spoke to Mark last week, and he told this story about how, on your last day on set, you wrote him a thank you note, and you wrote, “Thank you for being the best scene partner.” He was so taken with this, but it's a very funny thing to say.

[Laughs] That definitely sounds like my writing.

Were you actively looking for a film role or a screen role when “The Life of Chuck” came to you?

I had been auditioning at the time. I had a theater background, I had been on Broadway, and I did “Oliver” at New York City Center. I had been in the mix for a couple things, but when “Chuck” came around, it was the first [screen] audition that had dancing in it. I was like, “Maybe it's a movie musical?” And when I got the role, I was like, “Whoa, this is really original. This is really good stuff.”

I met Mike after the auditions on Zoom, and we both kind of geeked out about working with Luke Skywalker. When I got the audition, seeing Tom and Mark's name [already] on it, I felt I had to put everything into it.

Did you have to dance on Zoom?
 










I think there was a thing in the sides where I had to do a dance move or something, and I was on the couch, and I did something with my hands or something. I guess Mike thought that was prime dancing. I don't know how he thought that I was a dancer from that, but thank you, Mike.

At what point did you get to read the whole script? 

I got the [full] script fairly close to when I flew down to Alabama [to shoot it]. I read my part first, and I got connected with that, and I started learning all my lines. And I think it was after the fact of filming that I read the full thing, and I read the novella after it. I felt so connected with the material after. I felt that I should have read the full thing before I actually did the movie. I got into Stephen King. I got into a Stephen King hole for a while. 

I think, after reading the script, it kind of changed my perspective on filmmaking and writing. I also think it's one of those movies that you have to see a couple times to get. You're going to find something different every single time you see it. People should go and see it in theaters for that reason because there's so many things. There's so many little nuances that you're going to find every time that you're going to love every time. 

What's it like to think, “I'm playing young Tom Hiddleston”?
 










I didn't know because I didn't know who Tom was playing. [Laughs] I thought Tom was some leading role in the script, because I had only read my part. But when I found out that Mark and Tom were both going to be in it, those are two of my favorite actors, and I kind of freaked out a little bit.

You obviously didn't get to work with Tom, but did you spend time with any of the other Chucks?

I did meet Cody. Cody's so cute. I met Jacob briefly, too. He was there because I think he was mirroring Mike for a few days, which was really neat. I had watched Jacob in everything that he's done, and I think he's incredible in everything he does. It was so cool because we got to take a picture together, and I sent it to my grandmother, and she's like, “You guys look so similar. Are you sure it's just not you scaled up a little bit?” I was like, “No, that's Jacob.”

What was your preparation process for this, your first movie? 

I took a lot away from personal experience, because there's a lot of the grandparents' connection in the film that [feels close to me], because I feel very connected with my grandparents in real life. I spent so much time with Mark in the film, and I took that from my grandfather and my grandmother and put it into the film. 

I did watch a lot of movies. I saw a little bit of Mike's work. I'm not a huge horror fan, I'm a scaredy-cat, as a lot of my friends know, but I watched a lot of Mike projects, and I got the feel for it. I love his direction and his writing. I just got really pumped to do the project.

 










Do you remember what you did on your first day on set?

My first day was just dance, I think, because I did dance boot camp for about three weeks with Mandy [Moore]. Mia came in for a little bit, and Trinity [Bliss], who I danced with in the film. 

I think it was Tom's second day filming that I went to meet everyone on set for the first time, which was totally Mandy's idea. I didn't think that I had the right to go on set and see Tom Hiddleston dance, but I'll never forget that. That was the best thing I ever got to do. I got to take so many things from Tom, the subtle way that he moved his hips or how he used his face in his dance, and I got to put that into my performance. I'm so grateful that I got to be there for that day. And also, it was really cool to see Loki dance.

He's such a good dancer. I don't think I realized that.

I don't think anybody knew! I think he danced briefly on a late-night show, and that's how Mike found Tom [for the role].

What was dance boot camp with the great Mandy Moore like?

Every single day, getting to work with Mandy was so much fun. Even if I were to mess a dance move up or something, because I know I definitely stepped on Trinity's feet multiple times dancing, she would say, “It's fine. Just do it again. Pick yourself up, and we'll do it again, and you'll get it right.”

 










I had known she did “La La Land,” and that's one of my favorite movies. The choreography in that is spectacular, and I was like, well, if she can make Ryan Gosling into a dancer, she can turn me into a dancer.

Ryan Gosling was on “The Mickey Mouse Club” as a kid.

What? How did I not know this?

You are a little young for this. This was my youth. It was Ryan Gosling, Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears.

Oh, my God.

Keri Russell.

What?

I knew that one would get you. You need to go back and watch the '90s-era “Mickey Mouse Club.” Dancing, singing, they do little sketches, they have a little soap opera. I think you'll love it.

You're right, Keri Russell did get me!

You're still dancing, you're dancing all over your Instagram.

I love dancing now. I did “Music Man” a few years ago, and Mandy's friends with Warren Carlyle, who was the choreographer for that, and Mandy was like, “Where'd you get your dance experience from?” And I said in a nervous voice back when my voice wasn't changed, “Well, I was choreographed by Warren Carlyle,” and she was like, “Warren? I love Warren. We go way back.” 

When we made the Warren connection, that kind of made Mandy be like, “So you know how to do this, and you know how to do this?” She kind of took some stuff that she knew that I knew how to do from Warren and put it into the performance.

 










I think having all the dance experience back from my theater days kind of gave me a little head start because, when I read the script the first time, seeing all the different dance styles kind of threw me off. I didn't even know samba existed. I called up all my dancer friends, and I was like, “Hey, can you teach me how to do some of these moves?” 

Everyone loves the dancing, of course, but you also get to share this really lovely scene with Kate Siegel, where she's giving this monologue that kind of sums up the whole film. What was it like to act in those moments?

I think we did four shots. We did my coverage, her coverage, and then we did one of the both of us just looking down the barrel of the camera. I think we only did her monologue about four times, and every single time, it got better and better. I just kept on thinking, “How do you memorize all that?”

I was amazed by Kate's acting. I had never really been that close to someone in a scene. We were inches away. And being that close to someone's face, you see what they're thinking. Being in that moment, seeing Kate do that scene, was one of the most amazing experiences that I've ever had. 

What are you hoping audiences feel and think about when they leave the theater after seeing the film? 
 










There's so much that you're going to feel when you leave this film. The first time that I saw it at TIFF, I just felt everything, but the thing I felt the most was just utter joy. I just felt so glad that I got to be there in the moment and see it. I wasn't looking at the audience because I was crying myself, but Mark said that there were grown-ups with tears in their eyes. Hearing that, that kind of changed something in my head, saying, “Wow, people really feel connected to this, and people really want to see this movie, and people really want to experience what they just experienced again and again and again.”

What's next for you?

I have two films coming out this year, sometime. One of them is called “Playdate,” directed by Luke Greenfield. It's starring Kevin James and Alan Ritchson. And my other film this year is “Tiny Fugitives,” directed by Michael Lewen with Johnny Knoxville. And I think that already kind of tells you what it will be like. [Laughs]

As someone who is still fairly early in their film career, what is the big dream for you, the people you want to work with and projects you want to do?

I want to work with Mike again. If I only had a chance to work with Mike my entire career, I would do it. I want to do another “Chuck.” I think that would be amazing. I want to do another “Chuck”!

	Chicago house pioneer Vince Lawrence recalls witnessing Disco Demolition Night as a teenager, and later recognizing the racist undertones of the infamous incident, in a new clip from the fascinating documentary, Move Ya Body: The Birth of House, premiering on Rolling Stone. 


	Directed by Elegance Bratton, Move Ya Body digs into the origins of house music on the South Side of Chicago, where Lawrence and his peers crafted a new sound with emerging synth technology and perfected it in underground clubs like the Warehouse. The birth of house music in the 1980s was also, in part, a response to the heyday, and unceremonious downfall, of disco, another genre that had distinctly Black origins before garnering more mainstream attention via white artists and culture. (See: The Bee Gees and Saturday Night Fever.)


	Lawrence happened to be working as an usher at Chicago's Comisky Park on Disco Demolition Night in 1979, when a largely white crowd rioted after blowing up a crate of disco records. Lawrence was the victim of racist violence that night too, and an out-of-court settlement allowed him to buy a Moog synthesizer and pave the way for the creation of house music.

	











	But in the new clip from Move Ya Body, Lawrence admits that, at the time, he wasn't able to perceive the racism and anti-Blackness fueling Disco Demolition Night. As he puts it, “I was just not accepting of the reality of racism, of real racism.”

	











	Lawrence continues: “I feel now that a lot of the angst about disco was really about Blackness. Because people were on the radio describing things that were just Black. The gold chains was a symbol for us that we were no longer bound by chains. Bell-bottom pants and the leisure suits were a way for us to feel together, when we had matching tops and bottoms. All of these things were being said in a way that was looking down on everything that brought us joy.” 


	In an email to Rolling Stone, Bratton calls Disco Demolition Night an “ideological lynching” that was “meant to remind Blacks, queers, and femmes to stay in their place.” Pointedly, he adds: “The same forces that conspired to destroy Black dance music in the late 1970s are alive and well. Today, they call themselves MAGA…  It feels so easy to just give these lunatics what they want but in Vince there is a powerful rebuke of the status quo. It's rooted in music. Talk about non-violent resistance!”

Move Ya Body is set to screen Friday, June 13, as part of the Tribeca Film Festival, with additional showings scheduled through the weekend. Along with Lawrence, the film features interviews with other house luminaries including Marshall Jefferson, “Screamin'” Rachael Cain, Byron Stingily, Lady D, Kevin Aviance, and Lori Branch.

	In explaining why he wanted to make Move Ya Body, Bratton says it was as much about his love of music as it was a desire to “make sure the pioneers of house can get their roses while they are still here.”


	He adds, “If you look up the top EDM DJ's in the world, they are white men mostly from Europe. House music like just about every genre of American music starts in the Black community… House history is black history, it's queer history, and it's feminist history. I want to show through Move Ya Body that partying is political. Going to a club and dancing to the same beat as someone different from you is a radical act. It shakes oppressive power to the core to think that we can find that commonality through our differences. If they weren't scared of our collective power then they wouldn't spend so much time trying to keep us apart.”

Dakota Johnson is speaking out: We need more original films. The “Materialists” star said during her recent appearance on “Hot Ones” that modern Hollywood is reliant on remakes and IP, which audiences “don't want.” In turn, according to actress/producer Johnson, it's a “mess.”

“When something does well, studios want to keep that going so they remake the same things,” she said, “but humans don't want that. They want fresh, they want to feel new things, experience new things, see new things, so I don't know, I guess it's all just a bit of a mess right now, isn't it?”

 










Johnson continued, “I think it's hard when creative decisions are made by committee and it's hard when creative decisions are made by people who don't even really watch movies or know anything about them, and that tends to be what's occurring a lot.”

This isn't the first time that Johnson has deemed the studio system a corporate “committee.” Johnson told the Los Angeles Times that “a lot of creative decisions are made by committee or made by people who don't have a creative bone in their body,” such as the case for her superhero flop “Madame Web.”
 










Johnson added, “It's really hard to make art that way. Or to make something entertaining that way. And I think unfortunately with ‘Madame Web,' it started out as something and turned into something else. And I was just sort of along for the ride at that point. But that happens. Bigger-budget movies fail all the time.”

Thankfully, there are still bigger budget (or at least mid-tier budget) original films that are going the distance at the box office, proving that audiences do in fact want new stories. One of those new original films includes “Sinners,” which Johnson's fellow filmmakers have embraced as an “encouraging” step for non-IP films being greenlit. 

Sam Rockwell recently told Variety that “Sinners” succeeding at the box office is reignites hope for Hollywood. “It was encouraging because it was rated R, you know? The sexuality felt palpable,” Rockwell said. “And the fact that it made a bunch of money while mixing all these genres — ‘From Dusk Till Dawn,' ‘Sounder,' ‘Devil in a Blue Dress' — I thought that was encouraging. It's a big swing.”

Kim Cattrall‘s Samantha Jones knows good sex, and isn't afraid to ask. But does that make the iconic “Sex and the City” character a “nymphomaniac”? Not quite. 

Cattrall told The Times that she still disagrees with some audience reactions to the beloved role. Cattrall starred as publicist Samantha in six seasons of “Sex and the City” from 1998 to 2004, and reprised the role for the 2008 and 2010 movies. She later made a cameo in the Season 2 finale of revival series “And Just Like That” in 2023.

“[Samantha] wasn't a nymphomaniac — well, some people might have thought she was — but she was just enjoying the main course,” Cattrall said. “Everyone else was nibbling on the appetizers when she was going for the steak. And it was always on her terms — that I always insisted on.”

Samantha was arguably the on-screen epitome of sex-positivity before the term even existed as a colloquialism. And while Cattrall is proud of the character, she can't totally relate to her: “I'm the antithesis of her in many ways,” she said. “I'm a serial monogamist, and then some.”

 










Cattrall also recalled how she turned down the role of Samantha four times, believing that at age 41, she was too old to be considered sexy. “Self-inflicted ageism,” Cattrall said when asked why. “Well, that changed — 40 became sexy. It became, ‘Man, let's have more of that.'”

Cattrall previously said to Today that she is “protective” of Samantha almost 30 years since the series began. “I don't think I'll ever say goodbye to Samantha,” she said. “She's like a lot of other characters that I've done over the years. I get very emotionally attached and protective of my characters. She gave me so much, and I'm so appreciative of her.”

As for her “And Just Like That” presence, Cattrall is calling it a one and done cameo (Sarah Jessica Parker's Carrie does text Samantha in Seasons 1 and 3, but Cattrall only appeared onscreen for Season 2.) “This is as far as I'm going to go,” Cattrall said at the time. “It felt like dipping my toe back in time and having a wonderful afternoon. And then a great martini!”

	If anyone needed further evidence that Kendrick Lamar eviscerated Drake in their feud, look no further than the response Lamar received while performing in Drake's hometown of Toronto this week. He and SZA brought their Grand National Tour to Rogers Centre on Thursday night for the first of two shows in the Canadian city.


	The June 12th show was Lamar's first time performing in Toronto since the onset of the feud last year. While fans speculated whether or not he would further comment on Drake, their song battle or more, Lamar avoided saying anything further on the status of their beef. Instead, he let his chart-topping, Grammy-winning diss song “Not Like Us” speak for itself and serve as his victory lap.

	According to Global News, the stadium (which Drake has never played before) cheered on Lamar for two minutes after the song finished. The crowd even egged him on for an encore, chanting “one more time,” though Lamar did not deliver one.

	Meanwhile, Drake joined internet personality Kai Cenat on Twitch as the show occurred, giving away money as part of Cenat's “Somebody Loves Me” video challenge. Some of his more hardcore local fans in “The 6ix” plotted an “OVO Takeover” at the stadium during the shows this week, where they plan to play Drake's music outside of the venue from the time gates open until the show ends.

Kim Gordon has shared a reworked version of “Bye Bye,” the lead single from 2024's The Collective, that's now a protest song against President Donald J. Trump. The new version, dubbed “Bye Bye 25!,” swaps the original lyrics—Gordon's packing list for a trip—for words that the current administration has flagged and used to cancel grant projects, research proposals, and more. Check out the song's music video, co-directed by Gordon and Vice Cooler, below.

“[Producer and collaborator] Justin Raisen had this idea to redo ‘Bye Bye' starting at the end of the song,” explained Gordon. “When I was thinking of lyric ideas, it occurred to me to use words taken from a site that had all the words that Trump has essentially banned, meaning any grant or piece of a project or proposal for research that includes any of those words would be immediately disregarded or ‘cancelled.' I guess Trump does believe in cancel culture, because he is literally trying to cancel culture.”

The new track arrives ahead of the “No Kings” protests that are expected to happen nationwide on Saturday, June 14. Proceeds from the sale of both “Bye Bye 25!” and its promotional T-shirt will be donated to reproductive rights nonprofit Noise for Now. Among the words rattled off in the song are “female,” “climate change,” “Hispanic,” “women,” “mental health,” and “immigrants.” Organizations that have been affected so far by the president's administrative orders and policies include the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), National Science Foundation (NSF), and NASA, among others.

Both “Bye Bye” and The Collective were nominated for Grammy Awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those nods marked the first time Gordon was ever in the running for a Grammy, as neither she nor Sonic Youth were ever nominated prior. Late last year, The Collective got a digital deluxe edition, featuring the additional tracks: “ECRP” and “Bangin' on the Freeway.”

	Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers swarmed Southern California in concentrated raids of undocumented citizens that are still ongoing. Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Los Angeles (and in solidarity nationwide), giving President Donald Trump an excuse to send National Guard troops last weekend and move to deploy Marines to L.A.. 


	Trump baselessly implied the protesters are “paid insurrectionists” during a press conference where he revealed he told California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) that “He's doing a bad job, causing a lot of death and a lot of potential death. If we didn't send out the National Guard — and last time, we gave him a little additional help — Los Angeles would be burning right now.” (No one has died during the L.A. protests.) 


	Newsom has said the “chaotic” sweeps “to meet an arbitrary arrest quota are as reckless as they are cruel,” and that, “Donald Trump's chaos is eroding trust, tearing families apart, and undermining the workers and industries that power America's economy.” On June 10, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass (D) instituted an 8 p.m. curfew in downtown L.A.

Rolling Stone spoke with several on-the-ground Angelenos, who dispute the notion that L.A.'s “on fire” or being overrun by vandals. 


	Adrianne Shropshire is the board chair of the grassroots organization Community Coalition. She says the Trump administration and allied politicians are spewing propaganda that inflames tension between citizens and law enforcement. 

	











	“When you have federal national leaders from this administration talking about arresting our mayor, arresting our governor, when you have the president himself using the kind of rhetoric describing a reality that is nothing like what is happening on the ground right now, it just increases the tension,” she says. “Nothing here that they're doing is about de-escalation. It is all about escalating a confrontation with the people of Los Angeles.”

	Shropshire spoke at a June 9 rally for David Huerta, the president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) California, who was arrested during a June 6 ICE raid in downtown L.A. and charged with a felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer (he's since been released on $50,000 bail). She also attended a prayer vigil on June 10, noting that both events were “peaceful.” From her vantage point, “People [wanted] to simply show up and say, ‘I do not consent. This is wrong. And my presence here is a demonstration of my right to protest.'”


	The same mentality spurred 33-year-old L.A. native Victor Ulloa, aka L.A. media personality Rosecrans Vic, to participate in a demonstration in downtown L.A. on Sunday. “I'm not even sure what my politics are right now, but I just know that I don't stand for families being torn apart and destroyed,” Ulloa tells Rolling Stone. 


	On Sunday, Ulloa walked in a demonstration in downtown L.A., which initially took place without commotion. He saw cops on the roof of the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, including Hispanic officers, staring down at them. “I was like, ‘Are they observing in a “We support you” way or “I remember some of your faces” way?' I couldn't really call it, to be honest, but we were staring back at each other,” he says. 


	When Ulloa passed Temple and Los Angeles Street, he saw protesters blocking traffic on the nearby Highway 101, and a “line of cops” pushing back against them; that's when violence ensued. 


	One man was “shoeless,” “knocked out cold,” and being “dragged” away by officers, and another man in a Mexico shirt was arrested as well, Ulloa recalls. Then, he says, officers began shooting rubber pellets at protesters. “You start to see that stuff happen and it's like, ‘Oh, shit, it's going down now,'” he says.

	Shortly after he headed home, he saw viral footage of citizens being tear-gassed and a police car lit aflame in the area where he had been peacefully protesting 20 minutes earlier. While Trump's administration has framed these moments as evidence of Southern California being on the verge of destruction, Ulloa says that clash happened in a specific area, and it was “business as usual” on the other side of downtown L.A. — the BET Experience was taking place there before the Monday BET Awards showcase. “All of L.A. was not on fire. It wasn't all shut down,” he clarifies.

	











	Since last week in California, ICE has conducted a series of aggressive workplace raids and courthouse arrests. The ICE campaign began after White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller reportedly instructed agency officials not to bother trying to target gang members or violent criminals, and instead “just go out there and arrest illegal aliens,” including by going to Home Depot or 7-Eleven. 


	Ulloa, a first-generation Mexican-American, says he's never seen ICE raids on the scale that they've taken place over the past week, and even though he and his family are American citizens, he is worried about them, especially his young son, being accosted by law enforcement who don't know that. 


	Last Friday, the Department of Homeland Security announced, “Today, ICE officers and agents alongside partner law enforcement agencies, executed four ​federal search warrants at three location in central Los Angeles.” The department claimed to have apprehended “approximately 44 people” in the initial raids. 


	After rampant anti-ICE protests began that night, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth federalized and sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles and announced they would deploy 700 Marines there, too. While the National Guard is ostensibly there to protect federal buildings, Hegseth posted a photo on social media showing troops standing guard as ICE carried out an arrest.


	Newsom filed an emergency motion blocking the deployment. Yesterday, a federal judge ordered Trump to return control of the National Guard to the governor, but an appeals court quickly put that order on hold. An appeal hearing will be held on June 17. 


	On Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security published a press release titled, “ICE Captures Worst of the Worst Illegal Alien Criminals in Los Angeles Including Murderers, Sex Offenders, and Other Violent Criminals,” which contained mugshots of various undocumented citizens they detained. 


	In the statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, “These rioters in Los Angeles are fighting to keep rapists, murderers, and other violent criminals loose on Los Angeles streets. Instead of rioting, they should be thanking ICE officers every single day who wake up and make our communities safer.” 


	But the raids aren't about apprehending sex offenders; they're affecting everyday Angelenos like a Mexican mother of three who spoke to us under the alias Sofia. 

	











	Through a translator, the undocumented woman tells Rolling Stone that the “traumatizing” threat of ICE raids has her South Central community feeling like they're living in de facto lockdown. 


	“Stress levels have increased,” she conveys. “There's a lot of individuals who are not going to work because they fear deportation. It's not just about, ‘What if I get deported? I need to go to work, how am I going to pay my rent and my bills?' but, ‘Why are we being surrounded as if we're criminals?' Sofia has been concerned that her husband, who works at different L.A.-based sites every day, could be detained while out providing for his family. And the anxiety has extended to her children. 


	“A few days ago I was at the clinic when my son called me to ask me where I was. He sounded extremely worried, wondering if I was going to be OK because there were ICE raids in the area where I normally commute,” she says. “Instead of my children being able to be at school fully present, they are concerned about my well-being, and that's not how things should be. We are honorable, hardworking individuals with dreams, goals, and aspirations for a better life and a better future.” 


	Shropshire says that the Community Coalition is organizing mutual aid for Angelenos like Sofia to ensure their basic needs are met. Sofia also lauded the efforts of L.A. nonprofit Strategic Concepts in Organizing & Policy Education (SCOPE), which has provided her aid and taught her community how to “make use of their voice so that they could empower their friends, family, and neighbors, and together be able to come together as one.”


	The ICE raids continued into Thursday. Shropshire believes that the “show of force” isn't just a concern for Hispanic communities, but all of L.A. For that reason, she says a “mosaic” of people of all identities have been present at the protests, marching in anti-ICE solidarity. Contrary to rampant social media discourse relegating immigration to a Latino issue, she clarifies that ICE's predation affects immigrants in every community, including Black ones.


	“We're talking about African immigrants, we're talking about Caribbean immigrants, we're talking about Afro-Latinos,” she says. “There's no distinction between a Black American and a Black immigrant. How do you know if I'm Haitian? If I'm Belizean? There's nothing that says that ‘I am a citizen' or ‘I'm not a citizen.' So if you have unmarked vans rolling up in your neighborhood and you are a Black Angeleno, you are going to be concerned … it's a continuum of the kind of escalation and unnecessary policing of our communities that Black Angelenos have seen for decades.”

	Fox 5 DC has confirmed that Trump is preparing to deploy ICE special response teams in Northern Virginia (right outside Washington, D.C.), New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Seattle; Shropshire notes that the latter four cities, as well as Washington D.C., have Black Democrat mayors. “When we think about this being a test case, it's important that folks in those cities also get prepared,” she says, imploring citizens to “get their members of Congress and their senators to push back on what is happening.”


	Shropshire is unequivocal that what ICE is doing should be challenged by all citizens. “I think that people are really, really clear that this is a moral moment in America,” she says. “It is a moral moment in Los Angeles. This is about: Who are we as Americans? Who are we as Angelenos? Who are the better angels, and how do we pull them out in this moment to say, ‘This is not who we intend to be as a country. This is not who we intend to be as a city.'”

The soulful ballad from the quintet dropped a week after the band was signed by the Avex Music Group.

	While Justin Bieber stays busy recording the long-awaited follow-up to his 2021 Justice album, his backing gorup, We the Band, dropped their debut single on Friday morning (June 13). The Earth, Wind & Fire-esque slow-burn R&B jam “One & Only” showcases the group's smooth, soulful vocals and retro '70s funk style. The slick accompanying performance video was directed by Zev York in collaboration with Nick DeMoura, who was the choreographer and creative director for JB's 2023 Believe world tour.

	











	The group consisting of bassist/vocalist Harv, DJ Tay James, guitarist/vocalist Julian Michael, drummer Devin “Stixx” Taylor and keyboardist Dr. O backed up Bieber on his 2015 Purpose world tour as well as his 2022 Justice world tour, which prematurely ended in Sept. 2022 after the singer revealed that he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt Syndrome and suffering from partial facial paralysis.

	According to a release announcing the song, Tay James met Bieber in 2009 after graduating from college, snagging a gig as the singer's official DJ, followed by bassist Harv taking on the role of music director in Bieber's live band, which he filled out with Taylor and Michael. In 2021, Harv co-wrote and co-produced Bieber's Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hit “Peaches.”


	We The Band recently signed with the Avex Music Group and the group is working to finish their as-yet-untitled debut album, which, according to a release announcing the signing will include unnamed “special guest appearances.”


	“This has been a dream of ours for many years now,” the group said in a statement. “To create our own music that represents who we are as musicians with the support of a global powerhouse like Avex is incredibly exciting for all of us. We can't wait for our fans to hear what we've been working on.”


	At press time no additional information was available on Bieber's next studio album, which the singer has been teasing for much of the past year via videos and pictures from the recording studio.

	Stop us if you've heard this one before: A mother loves her daughter. The younger woman has issues, ranging from a bad boyfriend to substance-abuse problems. You'd never think it would happen to your kid — but it could! Still, only a fool would underestimate the strength of a mom's love. When the blowback from this problem child's dodgy associations threatens to wreck her life, the everymatriarch steps in. She will stop at nothing to protect her offspring. 


	For decades, we called them “maternal dramas.” Then, starting in the mid 1990s — scholars and scientists carbon-date the tipping point to somewhere around the broadcast of Mother, May I Sleep With Danger? — we began folding them into the category simply known as “Lifetime Channel movies.” Yes, this basic cable network's stable of straight-outta-tabloid thrillers from that golden era ran the full gamut of a suburbanite's nightmares, from husbands with double lives to black-market baby trafficking. But the teens-in-peril subgenre was especially popular among their viewers, and for a while, stories about mothers going into rescue mode became synonymous with the channel's programming. (See: this parody.)

	











	Don't let the premium branding, patina of prestige or star power fool you: Echo Valley, a real handwringer of a momma-paranoia melodrama, may open with the familiar Apple TV+ logo. (It drops on the streaming service on June 13th, after something slightly resembling a week-long theatrical run.) But this sizzling slab of cinema du grilled cheese from British director Michael Pearce (Beast, Encounter) is nothing if not a vintage Lifetime Channel joint, one which just happens to feature an Oscar winner and one of the biggest A-listers under the age of 30. It takes its name from the region of southern Pennsylvania where Julianne Moore runs a horse ranch, yet this purposefully trashy movie could easily have been called “A Child's Cry for Help,” or “Terror in the Family,” or “For My Daughter's Honor, Plus Also She's a Drug Addict and Now There's a Psychopath Living in My House.”

	To be fair, unlike so many of those Lifetime heroines, you couldn't say that the protagonist's life looked perfect from the outside. Despite the fact that she owns a gorgeous spread and lives in a lovely, large country home, Kate Garretson (Moore) has been in a state of depression for a while. Her wife, Patty (Kristina Valada-Viars), died nine months ago, and Kate is barely able to get out of bed in the morning. Friends, like her kindly neighbor Leslie (Fiona Shaw), are worried about her mental health. The estate is starting to drift into serious disrepair. She's been regularly canceling the horseriding lessons she gives the area's wealthy kids, and is forced to hit up her ex-husband (Kyle MacLachlan) for money. All of these problems pale in comparison, however, to what's going on with Kate's kid.


	From the second that Claire (Sydney Sweeney) shows up at the house, asking to use her mom's iPad to check her texts — her phone got thrown in a river by her dickhead boyfriend (Edmund Donovan), but don't worry, it's all totally kickin' back no big deal, everything's super cool! — you can hear the warning sirens going off. The twentysomething has a slightly twitchy demeanor and facility for emotional manipulation that immediately telegraphs she's a drug addict. You can also tell that this isn't a new problem, and that Kate and Claire have done this particular tango a dozen or so times before.

	Except this time… remember how that aforementioned boyfriend tossed her phone into the water? She retaliated by dumping some of his stuff off a bridge. And well, there was a bag of narcotics in his jacket, and now that's gone, and this makes the couple's dealer, Jackie (Domhnall Gleason, so skeezy you can smell him), pretty angry. Like, beating up Claire in her mom's front yard kind of mad. Soon, Kate understands how much serious trouble her daughter is in. Luckily for Claire, her mom is the sort that will stop at nothing to make sure her baby girl is safe. By “stop at nothing,” we naturally mean disposing of a corpse, arson, and stopping Jackie from siphoning what's left of her liquid assets. The things we do for our kids!

	On the surface, this may sound like a nice, trashy little diversion. We can confirm the “trashy” part, and you know that any time you give Moore the chance to either weep, become enraged or, in a best case scenario, do both at once, it's going to reap some sort of dividends. (As for Sweeney, her supporting role is just north of being a glorified cameo. All apologies, Sydney stans and Euphoria fans.) Viewers can sense a third-act turn coming, and when it does, it's so overly complicated, ludicrous and unbelievable that you'll find yourself left with a palm-sized imprint on your face for days afterward. You might hear “are you fucking kidding me?!” echoing throughout your living room several times before the end credits roll. You also might be better off bypassing this faux-Lifetime Channel throwback altogether and seeing if Mother, May I Sleep With Danger? is still streaming anywhere.

Former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Brandi Glanville hasn't had the best couple of years, as she has experienced some notable health issues. However, she recently took to social media to share some exciting personal news. Her son, Jake, graduated from high school. 

She posted on Instagram, “And just like that it's Graduation Day!!! so proud of you @jakecibrian.” The post contained three photos, the first of which was of Brandi and Jake. The second features him walking across the graduation stage, and the other is of Jake with some of his friends in their blue gowns. 

A post shared by Brandi Glanville (@brandiglanville)

Jake's dad, Eddie Cibrian, also took to Instagram to highlight the occasion. He did so with a video montage, which also included his wife, LeAnn Rimes. The caption of the post reads, “And the Class of 2025 is off and running!”

A post shared by Eddie Cibrian (@eddiecibrian)

It continued, “Congrats, my boy.” LeAnn also shared the post on her social media as she congratulated her stepson. 

According to PEOPLE, Brandi spent the most recent Christmas holiday with Eddie, LeAnn, and the kids. She said on her podcast, “I went over there to my ex's house [for Christmas] because of my kids. Brandi continued, “I mean, you guys don't understand the love I have for these children. Like, I would take a bullet for them.”

Brandi then said, “What was I gonna do? Stay over here in my house, be lonely during Christmas, or go be with, like, my beloved children and my in-laws, who I'm obsessed with and love?” She added, “I can step in there as long as everyone's happy and everyone's in one place and the kids are happy and we're having a good time and the food is good.”

Regarding Brandi and Eddie, they tied the knot in 2001 and have two sons. Jake is the youngest at 17, and Matt is 21. Sadly, they divorced in 2010 after he fell in love with LeAnn. Eddie and LeAnn connected in 2009 while filming the movie “Northern Lights” and married in 2011. This was a massive scandal at the time, but the three are now on good terms. 

Naturally, Brandi's divorce and the events that led to it became a topic while she was on “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.” However, she hasn't been on the series since 2015 and has recently spoken openly about her non-existent relationship with Bravo and Andy Cohen.

"Well, that changed — 40 became sexy. It became, 'Man, let's have more of that,'" Cattrall said about playing sex-positive publicist Samantha Jones.


							By 

	Lily Ford



	With And Just Like That… returning to our screens via HBO Max, it feels right that Kim Cattrall should also get back in on the Sex and The City action.


	The revival series is currently airing with stars Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis all reprising the roles that catapulted the group to superstardom in the late '90s and early '00s.




	Bar a small cameo in the season two finale, Cattrall has not reteamed with Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte on the streets of New York in the new show and confirmed she won't be appearing in the third installment. Reports of a long-running feud between Parker and Cattrall have dominated Sex and The City headlines for years following the 2008 and 2010 movies.

	However, in a new interview with U.K. outlet The Times, Cattrall is revealing a few tidbits about her connection to the iconic character of sex-positive publicist Samantha Jones.

	In the feature published Thursday evening, the 69-year-old Liverpool-born star said she turned down the role four times, believing that at 41 she wouldn't be seen by audiences as sexy. “Self-inflicted ageism,” she told the paper. “Well, that changed — 40 became sexy. It became, ‘Man, let's have more of that.'”


	The British/Canadian/American actress continued: “[Samantha] wasn't a nymphomaniac — well, some people might have thought she was — but she was just enjoying the main course. Everyone else was nibbling on the appetisers when she was going for the steak.”

	











	“And it was always on her terms — that I always insisted on.”


	Despite such a celebrated performance, Cattrall, who has been dating BBC audio engineer Russell Thomas since 2016, added that she is not much like her character in real life. “I'm the antithesis of her in many ways. I'm a serial monogamist, and then some.”


	The six seasons of the show, which ran from 1998 to 2004, saw the women battle tumultuous love lives, sex problems and professional hiccups while strengthening their own friendships. The popularity of the show has only increased since its addition to streaming services like Netflix, which broadcast the pinnacle of nineties NYC glamor to a younger, Gen Z audience.


	Cattrall was talking to The Times about the second season of Central Intelligence, a retelling of the founding of the CIA in which she stars opposite Ed Harris and Johnny Flynn.


	New episodes of And Just Like That… are dropping weekly on HBO Max and on Sky in the U.K.

Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the 10th Amendment and exceeded President Trump's statutory authority. 


							By 

	The Associated Press



	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday temporarily blocked a federal judge's order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California after he deployed them there following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids.


	The court said it would hold a hearing on the matter Tuesday. The ruling came only hours after a federal judge's order was to take effect at noon Friday.




	Earlier Thursday, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and both violated the 10th Amendment and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. The order applied only to the National Guard troops and not Marines who were also deployed to the L.A. protests. The judge said he would not rule on the Marines because they were not out on the streets yet.

	California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had asked the judge for an emergency stop to troops helping carry out immigration raids, had praised the earlier ruling.

	“Today was really about a test of democracy, and today we passed the test,” Newsom said in a news conference before the appeals court decision.


	In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump thanked the appeals court Friday morning.


	“If I didn't send the Military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now,” he said.


	The White House had called Breyer's order “unprecedented” and said it “puts our brave federal officials in danger.”


	“The district court has no authority to usurp the President's authority as Commander in Chief,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. “The President exercised his lawful authority to mobilize the National Guard to protect federal buildings and personnel in Gavin Newsom's lawless Los Angeles. The Trump Administration will immediately appeal this abuse of power and looks forward to ultimate victory on the issue.”

	











	About 700 Marines have been undergoing civil disturbance training at Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach in Orange County, California. Nicholas Green, an attorney for the state, told the court: “I have been told by the office of the governor that within the next 24 hours, 140 Marines will replace and relieve National Guard members in Los Angeles.”


	Typically the authority to call up the National Guard lies with governors, but there are limited circumstances under which the president can deploy those troops. Trump federalized members of the California National Guard under an authority known as Title 10.


	Title 10 allows the president to call the National Guard into federal service under certain limited circumstances, such as when the country “is invaded,” when “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government” or when the president is unable “to execute the laws of the United States.”


	Breyer, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said in his ruling that what is happening in Los Angeles does not meet the definition of a rebellion.


	“The protests in Los Angeles fall far short of ‘rebellion,'” he wrote.


	Newsom sued to block the Guard's deployment against his wishes. California later filed an emergency motion asking the judge to block the Guard from assisting with immigration raids.


	The governor argued that the troops were originally deployed to protect federal buildings and wanted the court to block the troops from helping protect immigration agents during the raids, saying that involving the Guard would only escalate tensions and promote civil unrest.

	











	Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, commander of Task Force 51, which is overseeing the Guard troops and Marines sent to Los Angeles, said that as of Wednesday about 500 of the Guard troops had been trained to accompany agents on immigration operations. Photos of Guard soldiers providing security for the agents have already been circulated by immigration officials.


	None of the Marines have been trained to go on immigration raids, and it is not yet clear if they eventually will, Sherman said.


	In his broad ruling, the judge determined Trump had not properly called the Guard up in the first place.The lawsuit argued that Title 10 also requires that the president go through governors when issuing orders to the National Guard.


	Brett Shumate, an attorney for the federal government, said Trump complied with the statute by informing the general in charge of the troops of his decision and would have the authority to call in the Guard even if he had not.


	In a brief filed ahead of the Thursday hearing, the Justice Department said Trump's orders were not subject to judicial review.


	“Courts did not interfere when President Eisenhower deployed the military to protect school desegregation. Courts did not interfere when President Nixon deployed the military to deliver the mail in the midst of a postal strike. And courts should not interfere here either,” the department said.


	“Our position is this is not subject to judicial review,” Shumate told the judge.


	Breyer, who at one point waved a copy of the Constitution, said he disagreed.

	











	“We're talking about the president exercising his authority, and the president is of course limited in that authority. That's the difference between a constitutional government and King George,” he said.


	The protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles intensified after Trump called up the Guard and have since spread to other cities, including Boston, Chicago and Seattle.


	Trump has described Los Angeles in dire terms that Mayor Karen Bass and Newsom say are nowhere close to the truth.

The couple were even described as "musical and sporting royalty" by an announcer of the game between the Edmonton Oilers and the Florida Panthers.

	Swifties the world over have been rushing to scream “Take me to Florida” as Taylor Swift and partner Travis Kelce were seen in the southeast for the Stanley Cup Finals.

	Turning up for Game 4 on Thursday (June 12), the pair were in attendance at Sunrise's Amerant Bank Arena to watch the Edmonton Oilers reign supreme over the Florida Panthers, with the 5-4 result coming via an overtime goal from Leon Draisaitl.

	However, with Swift and Kelce in the crowd, ice hockey was of least concern for fans of the musician, with announcers focusing on the pair to describe them as “musical and sporting royalty.” Likewise, even a photo of the pair taken during the game's second period with Canadian hockey icon Wayne Gretzky failed to overtake the excitement generated by Swift's presence.




			Trending on Billboard		







	Per a recent report from People, Swift is currently staying with Kelce at his Florida residence while he's in training for the upcoming NFL season. In February, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end made the decision that he would return to professional football for another season, with the upcoming season set to be his last under contract with the team.


	Earlier this month, Travis and brother Jason spoke to former professional basketball player Shaquille O'Neal on their New Heights podcast, where the NBA icon suggested that Travis could follow in his footsteps of his DJ moniker Diesel and become an opening act for Swift.

	











	“You know what [would be] crazy? You opening up with your girlfriend,” O'Neal suggested. “Bro, you'd be a f–king star. Ten minutes hyping up the crowd, oh my God.” 


	“Come on, you know I'm a hype man,” Kelce said while laughing. “You know I'm a hype man. Get it rocking in there. Have the Swifties bouncing off the walls before T gets out there.”

Love, a founder member of The Beach Boys, was inducted alongside music legends George Clinton, and The Doobie Brothers' Michael McDonald, Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons


							By 

	Ethan Millman


Music Editor


Mike Love gave thanks to his late cousin and Beach Boys bandmate and co-writer Brian Wilson during his Songwriters Hall of Fame induction in New York on Thursday night, telling the crowd of fellow writers and industry insiders that “I do feel his presence” in the room as he accepted his honor. 


	Love's induction to the Songwriters Hall of Fame came just a day after Wilson died Wednesday at age 82, and 25 years after Wilson himself was inducted into the Hall back in 2000. 




	“I especially must thank my cousin Brian Wilson,” Love said Thursday. “My first cousin by blood but brother in music, together we set the stage for some of the most successful music collaborations of all time.”

	Love was inducted by John Stamos, a famously huge Beach Boys fan who's collaborated with the band frequently. In his induction speech, Stamos said that Love chronicled “the American dream” with the songs he wrote.“He made the whole world want to be us: sun-kissed, carefree, full of promise,” Stamos said. “His lyrics were cinematic. What's a song without a hook? What's a hook without a picture in your head or a memory in your heart? Mike Love knows how to write that song.”  


	Love performed “California Girls,” with Stamos beside him adorned with a sparked gold electric guitar before going through culture-defining hits “I Get Around,” “Kokomo” and “Good Vibrations.”


	Love's induction and performance was just one of several major moments in a ceremony that also celebrated funk legend George Clinton, The Doobie Brothers' Michael McDonald, Tom Johnston and Patrick Simmons and hitmakers Ashley Gorley, Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins and Tony Macaulay as this year's inductees. Broadway icon Stephen Schwartz was also recognized as this year's Johnny Mercer Award recipient, while rising star Gracie Abrams received the Hal David Starlight Award. 


	Living Color kicked off the evening to induct Clinton, opening the night with a rousing rendition of Funkadelic's “Cosmic Slop,” complete with shredding guitar solos from Vernon Reid.

	











	Clinton came to the stage afterward for his speech, strutting to “We Want the Funk” and wearing a cream pinstriped suit, a bedazzled gold captain's hat and a Sly and the Family Stone shirt, presumably in homage to his close friend Sly Stone, who also died this week. 


	In his speech, Clinton acknowledged his previous honors and awards like his induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, but said that “This one hits different, this comes from people who truly know what it means to be a songwriter,” Clinton said. The 83-year-old stuck around the stage, performing a lively rendition of the Parliament's “(I Wanna) Testify” afterward. 


	Debbie Gibson also took the stage to perform a cover of the Tony Macaulay-penned classic “Build Me Up Butter Cup.” “Tony's list of accolades is the stuff of legend.” Gibson told the crowd. “Wouldn't the world be a happier place if we all sang “Build Me Up Buttercup” and “Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes?”” 


	Dan + Shay inducted Gorley, playing an extensive mashup of several of the country songwriting legend's hits including Morgan Wallen's “Last Night,” Luke Bryan's “Play it Again,” Carrie Underwood's “All-American Girl” Post Malone and Wallen's “I Had Some Help.”


	Gorely's daughter came up for her father, giving a speech before she performed Trace Adkins' “You're Gonna Miss This,” which Gorely wrote with Lee Thomas Miller. 


	Teddy Riley inducted Rodney “Darkchild” Jerkins, who recalled his early days as a producer and songwriter, recalling how his father took out $1,200 from his life insurance policy to buy his son production equipment. 

	











	“As a little boy at 5 years old, I used to write poetry for my mother, who would cherish every word, every rhyme,” Riley said. “She didn't know it then, but she was nurturing the soul of a songwriter.”


	Jerkins further spoke about how Clive Davis consistently rejected early songs he'd pitch to the legendary executive until he finally brought him Whitney Houston's classic “It's Not Right, but It's OK.”


	“Clive turned me down and said get back to work. The greatest way to become successful is to be turned down,” Jerkins said. “Those failures turn to wins, it builds you. I came back to Clive's office, the next year and the next year until I walked into his office with “It's Not Right, but it's OK,” and Clive told me ‘I think you've got it, Rodney.'”


	In one of the sweetest (and most impressive) moments of the evening, Jerkins' four children performed a string-arranged cover of Brandy and Monica's “The Boy Is Mine” as their father looked on. 


	Musical theater songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul introduced Schwartz, while Mary Kate Morrissey and Kristin Chenoweth duetted “For Good” from Wicked.


	By the latter half of the evening, the National's Aaron Dessner had introduced Gracie Abrams, his friend and frequent writing partner, as she was presented with the Hal David Starlight Award. 


	She's one of the most gifted lyricists and melodic artists I've ever heard,” Dessner said of Abrams. “Emotional narratives conveyed in her songs are uncompromising, honest, sung from the heart, and deeply moving and relatable to her fans. 

	











	Abrams, who soon after performed her song “Free Now,” told the crowd that “the truth is I love songwriters, and I'll never stop pinching myself that anyone, let alone the Songwriters Hall of Fame, considers me one.” 


	Garth came out soon after and immediately opened with “Long Train Runnin'” before jumping into “China Grove” to induct the Doobies' McDonald, Johnston and Simmons. 


	“We can talk about how great they were decades ago, but trust me, more people are listening to the Doobie Brothers today than they ever have,” Brooks said. “It's feel-good music, undeniable Doobies, some of the greatest songwriting ever.”


	The Doobies, for their part, played their hits “Black Water” and “Takin' It to the Streets” before finishing the night with their ultimate yacht rock classic “Listen to the Music.”


	“It's just amazing to think we would be named along people like Stephen Schwartz on that list,” McDonald said before they played. “If I could send a message to all the writers in this room, I'd say thank you for the inspiration. We've learned from you, we've imitated you our whole lives. We're honored to be among you.”

"One of my all time favorite songs ever," the Green Day singer said of the 1964 single.

	Tyler Jenke



Billie Joe Armstrong has paid tribute to Brian Wilson by sharing a cover of the Beach Boys‘ 1964 classic “I Get Around.”


	The Green Day guitarist and vocalist shared his rendition of the song on Instagram on Wednesday (June 12), hours after the news of Wilson's passing broke. 


	“Thank you Brian Wilson,” Armstrong wrote. “I recorded a cover of ‘I Get Around' a few years ago.. never got to share it. One of my all time favorite songs ever.”

	Originally released in May 1964 as the sole single from the Beach Boys' sixth album, All Summer Long, “I Get Around” would become the group's first song to reach No. 1 on the Hot 100, a feat they would achieve twice more in the '60s – thanks to “Help Me, Rhonda” and “Good Vibrations” – and once in 1988 by way of “Kokomo.”

	Armstrong's rendition of “I Get Around” isn't exactly a left-field choice for the musician, especially given the influence that many bands of the pop-punk genre have taken from the Beach Boys' approach to music and songwriting. 




			Trending on Billboard		







	While Green Day's 2009 track “Last of the American Girls” was noted as containing harmonies reminiscent of the Beach Boys, Wilson himself showed an ignorance toward the punk genre in 2015. “I never went for that. I never went for the fast kind of music,” he told The Guardian. 


	Wilson passed away on June 11 at the age of 82, with his death inspiring countless tributes from musicians around the world. In the same vein as Armstrong, Sting honored Wilson's legacy by performing a live rendition of 1966's “God Only Knows.”

	











	“Today, one of my heroes died, Brian Wilson from the Beach Boys,” Sting said during the encore of his Wednesday night concert in Rostock, Germany. “So I want to sing a song that I love.” Both Sting and Wilson had previously performed the same song together during a 2008 concert at Carnegie Hall.

Todd Chrisley is back, not just in real life but on Instagram, too. The former reality TV star broke his social media silence this week with a heartfelt post about his youngest son, Grayson, who recently hit a major college milestone.

After completing his first semester at the University of Alabama, the 19-year-old earned a spot on the dean's list. Naturally, his proud dad couldn't resist celebrating the achievement with a post that oozed classic Chrisley sentiment.

“God is good all the time, @graysonchrisley,” Todd wrote on June 12. “I love you to the moon and back and we couldn't be more proud. You have shown great character and fortitude and stood with your Lord and Savior amidst the fire and came out the other side never smelling of smoke. You are proof of [God's] word.”

And in true Todd fashion, equal parts scripture and Southern flair, the caption continued, “Stand tall, stand true, and stand for your fellow brothers in Christ. I love you, Gray Gray.”

Fans immediately flooded the comment section to welcome Todd back online. Several congratulated the family and praised Grayson's accomplishments. “Grayson is in college okay now I feel old ❤️ welcome back, Todd we've missed you,” one user wrote.

Congratulations Grayson! How remarkable despite all of the circumstances these past few years you were able to navigate with the help of Savanna and end up on the Deans list,” another one said. “Glad your Mom and Dad are home. We love you Todd and your entire family. Looking forward to seeing you and Nanny Fae back together! We missed you all.” 

This marked Todd's first public message on social media since his sentencing for bank fraud and tax evasion.

A post shared by Todd Chrisley (@toddchrisley)

For anyone who missed the media whirlwind that was “Chrisley Knows Best,” Todd rose to fame as the sharp-tongued, designer-loving head of the Chrisley family. The reality series documented their extravagant lifestyle, parenting tactics, and, yes, unbeknownst to fans at the time, a financial hiccup.

In 2022, Todd and his wife, Julie Chrisley, were found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks out of more than $36 million through fake loans and falsified documents. Todd was sentenced to 12 years at the Federal Prison Camp in Pensacola, Florida. Julie, on the other hand, received seven years at the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky. Both began serving their sentences in January 2023.

But in a shocking turn of events, May 2025 brought presidential pardons for the couple. Savannah Chrisley, their daughter, revealed that President Donald Trump personally called her to share the news.

“It's a terrible situation, it really is,” Trump reportedly told her. “But it's also a great thing—because your parents are going to be free and cleared. I'm hoping we can make it happen by tomorrow. Does that sound good? We'll do our best to get it done by then.”

He added, “Give them my regards and wish them a good life.”

Just days later, on May 30, Todd stood before reporters at a press conference and maintained his innocence.

The couple, who married in 1996, share three children, Chase, Savannah, and Grayson. Todd also has two older children, Lindsie and Kyle, from a previous marriage to Teresa Terry.

Though Todd's Instagram post read like a touching tribute to his son, several online noted that it also felt like a calculated reentry into the public eye. Savannah had already documented Grayson's big college move, but Todd's timing added fuel to the family's growing post-prison media momentum.

And yes, we do expect there's more to come.

Especially after Savannah confirmed that filming is already underway for a brand-new reality series. The show is expected to follow the Chrisleys as they reunite and rebuild their lives after incarceration.

A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley)

One Instagram post doesn't mean Todd is ready to start vlogging or launching a podcast (yet), but it's clear the wheels are in motion. Fans are already speculating about what's next. Could we see another show, a public rebrand, or a deeper dive into faith-based content? Who knows!

For now, Todd appears to be focusing on the three things that have always defined him, which family, faith, and a flair for the spotlight.

“Full House” actor John Stamos got emotional when he shared his thoughts on the death of The Beach Boys star Brian Wilson. Wilson's family revealed the news of his passing on Instagram on Wednesday, June 11. He was 82. Following the news, Stamos posted three photos on Instagram of himself and Wilson, reflecting on the impact the musician had on his life.

A post shared by John Stamos (@johnstamos)

Stamos shared his thoughts in a lengthy and beautiful statement. “Brian Wilson didn't just soundtrack my life…he filled it with color, with wonder, with some of the most unforgettable, emotional, joyful moments I've ever known. It's hard to put into words what it meant to stand beside him, laugh with him, play his music with him,” he wrote.

Stamos praised Wilson for the many qualities he had, including being a “gentle, soulful, funny, complex, beautiful man.” Wilson's music had a tremendous impact on the “Fuller House” actor, and he revealed in his tribute that he had been a fan of The Beach Boys since childhood.

“Brian gave the world Pet Sounds, God Only Knows, and Wouldn't It Be Nice. Songs that didn't just play in the background of our lives, they shaped who we were,” he continued. “They shaped who I became. His music made me feel things I didn't know how to say. It made me want to make people feel the way his music made me feel. So much of my life and career, so much of me, exists because of what Brian created.”

Stamos ended his post by sending his love to Wilson's family.

A post shared by Brian Wilson (@brianwilsonlive)

On Wilson's official Instagram account, his family posted a photo of him sitting on a bench and smiling. In the caption, they announced his death. “We are heartbroken to announce that our beloved father Brian Wilson has passed away,” the statement read. “We are at a loss for words right now. Please respect our privacy at this time as our family is grieving. We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world. Love & Mercy.”

Many people are grieving the “Wouldn't It Be Nice” singer's death, and in addition to Stamos, other celebrities have made statements to honor Wilson. This includes Kim Basinger, who commented on the Instagram post with a heartfelt message. 

“Brian …. you and your music has made my life a far more beautiful journey than it ever would have been…….. you taught me how to dream with the music and sounds you created….. extraordinary…… with every note with every lyric… “ she wrote. “I was more and more convinced that nothing in this world was impossible… You took us to heights and places we will never feel and experience again…..Have a blessed journey… Brian …May you find peace…. Freedom …and a piano waiting for you….right there in Heaven…”

Executive produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, Jackie Jesko's film traces the iconic journalist's life and career.


							By 

	Daniel Fienberg


Chief Television Critic


	It's a familiar routine: Famous person dies and each network's news division works quickly to cobble together (or finish off) a tribute special that answers a few basic questions — “Why was this person significant?” mostly — in a satisfying way that can be delivered within days of the death.


	Tribute packages like that aren't really “documentaries,” but they serve a valuable purpose for grieving or simply curious fans.







	
	
		
					Barbara Walters: Tell Me Everything		
	


The Bottom Line

	
	A decent, if thin, primer.
	



Venue: Tribeca Film Festival (Spotlight Documentary)Airdate: Monday, June 23 (Hulu)Director: Jackie Jesko

								1 hour 35 minutes			






	The problem with Jackie Jesko's new documentary Barbara Walters: Tell Me Everything, premiering at Tribeca ahead of a Hulu launch, is that for much of its 95-minute run, it feels exactly like one of those immediately posthumous overviews.

	Especially in its first half, Tell Me Everything tries to emulate the iconic television journalist by guiding audiences through basic information, and eventually asking the tough questions, or at least touching on provocative issues. But it only rarely pushes deeper than hero worship.

	The conceit of letting Walters' own interview tactics steer the documentary isn't a bad one, but as executed here, it isn't interesting either, which is a pity since Walters was absolutely interesting. The doc showcases Walters' approach use of seemingly basic questions to set her subjects at ease before sneaking in the blunt or pointed queries. But since Jesko isn't actually talking to Walters, it's hard to know whom she thinks she's setting at ease and to what end.


	The first half of the documentary traces Walters' path from childhood to her early reporting endeavors to her time at Today and then ABC Evening News. Jesko takes us through the sexism Walters experienced along the way — one condescending male nemesis after another — before ABC gave her the chance to do the long-form TV interviews that helped an industry find a then-unprecedented blurring of lines between celebrity and news.

	











	She interviewed presidents, dictators and actors, and the footage is exceptional, if familiar. Walters sitting awkwardly with Harry Reasoner at the ABC Evening News desk. Walters sitting far less awkwardly with Anwar al-Sadat and Menachem Begin. Walters sitting amiably with the likes of Bette Midler and Clint Eastwood. The interviews with various producers/colleagues, plus Midler as a representative of the tier of stars Walters was both friendly and professional with, are decent. But two-plus years after Walters' death, there's nothing here that indicates a deeper understanding courtesy of the passing of time or the presence of these particular talking heads.


	In the second half of the documentary, things get significantly better, as we follow Walters into her peak years and get some insights from figures like Katie Couric, Oprah Winfrey and Connie Chung, who followed in Walters' footsteps. There are interesting sections on Walters' famous Rolodex, the competitiveness of interview booking in the '80s and '90s, and a fantastic segment on Walters' famous sit-down with Monica Lewinsky, featuring memories from Lewinsky and from Winfrey, who thought she had the interview herself only for Walters to sneak in and snag it. A bunch of people who aren't Diane Sawyer spend a lot of time circling the nature of the Sawyer/Walters rivalry.


	Sawyer, however, is not present, which is a running theme when it comes to the most difficult topics on the documentary's plate. Jesko knows the stories she needs to tell, but she doesn't necessarily have the interviews that she needs to tell them properly. Sawyer's absence is a big deal given how crucial the documentary believes that dynamic to be. Walters' frequently estranged daughter Jacqueline isn't here, either, which is a big deal given how the thesis of the film ends up being “Walters chose her career over love and over family.”

	











	The handling of the rest of Walters' personal life is left to people without direct personal knowledge, so there's completely hollow speculation about what was or wasn't happening in the relationship (or “relationship”) between Walters and Roy Cohn — one of those odd facts that many people already know, but will blow a few minds — or her multiple marriages to Merv Adelson, who isn't even mentioned. Instead, we're taking a lot of personal details on faith from Cindy Adams — whose presence and expertise are at least explicable given her stature as an iconic gossip columnist — and from a makeup artist whose exact role in Walters' life is never explained. (That makeup artist, Lori Klein, worked with Walters for 29 years. I know this from press notes, not the documentary.)


	The most emotionally affecting piece of Tell Me Everything isn't even from Tell Me Everything. The parade of female journalists who appeared on Walters' last episode of The View is presented in full, and it somehow provides, without resorting to voiceover or analysis, an efficient overview of Walters' cultural impact far more potent than anything the doc contributes on its own.


	I think it's clear-eyed and reasonable for a documentary about any hard-working figure to follow its story to a conclusion of “Can you have it all? No. But here's why that's OK.” Would you ever get a documentary about a male figure asking the same question? Certainly not. And does Barbara Walters: Tell Me Everything fully interrogate its own conclusions? Not really. It's a simple and respectful documentary that, had it come out a month after Walters' death, would have made its point decently. It's in taking that step back and using the distance afforded by time for something more substantive that it falls short.

The Celebration of Pride '25, presented by Paramount+ FYC, brought a slew of guests from the LGBTQ community and allies to West Hollywood. 


							By

The Hollywood Reporter partnered up with GLAAD for the Celebration of Pride '25 party Wednesday night that brought a slew of guests from the LGBTQ community and allies to West Hollywood. 


	Several stars stopped by the celebration, presented by Paramount+ FYC at Sunset at Edition, to dance, chat and, most important, gather as a community — something GLAAD's Anthony Allen Ramos emphasized was critical. “I think more than ever it's important to be loud and proud and vocal,” Ramos told THR before the large crowd gathered at the event, which also served as a celebration of GLAAD's 40th year.

	“The more that we can come together during Pride and remind the world that we are just like everyone else, we are everyday people, but we're also super creative when it comes to the work that we do in the entertainment industry and beyond,” he added. “It's unfortunate that we're having these new challenges, but if you look back at history, we overcame it, and I'm hoping that [with] Pride, everyone feels like we can do it again.”

	The event featured plenty of stars, including the cast of Prime Video's Overcompensating, who stopped by THR's portrait studio and red carpet. Much of the cast shared how they're celebrating pride this year. I've been to a few events. I go with the flow, and I try to watch as many gay things as possible,” creator and star Benito Skinner told THR on the red carpet. “I also treat myself. I'm like, ‘It's Pride, I need a new top,'” he said, jokingly clarifying “not like that.”

	











	Skinner's co-star and longtime comedy partner Mary Beth Barone had a pretty simple answer. “I'm going to have sex with women,” she said. “I think that's the best way I can do it.”

	A running theme of the night — through speeches by THR's co-editor-in-chief Maer Roshan and GLAAD's Zeke Smith and from comments from attendees — was the importance of celebrating Pride this year.


	“We're surrounded with queer talent [and] with allies who support our community. The idea that we get to celebrate now more than ever being authentically who we are, that is a weapon,” What We Do in the Shadows star Harvey Guillén told THR during the event. “The weapon is that we are who we are and we have ourselves, our allies. Literally who we are is our weapon.”


Ghosts star Danielle Pinnock echoed Guillén's sentiment. “I'm a proud ally. I would not be where I am without the LGBTQIA community and more specifically the Black LGBTQIA community,” she added.


	“We're in a time where it is a hot mess, honey, with our leadership and the queer community right now, what pride means to me is independence. It's inspiration,” she continued. “We have to keep our creativity going because even when they say no, we have to say yes. I hope everyone in the community continues to move forward.”


	Other attendees included Yellowjackets' Samantha Hanratty, Raven-Symoné, Adam DiMarco of Overcompensating, Scott Hoying of Pentatonix, former SNL castmember Sasheer Zamata, Wilson Cruz and Lance Bass.

	The Primetime Emmys nominating ballot is live, voting began yesterday, and all this phase one voting, FYC events, and furious jockeying for attention by seemingly every member of the White Lotus cast is coming to a head. Meanwhile the official ballot brought the sad confirmation, as reported by Deadline, that in the Outstanding Talk Series there were only 13 entries, one short of triggering a 14th nomination so that means there will be only 3 nominees this year and thus you are only allowed to vote for 3.  The Daily Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night with Seth Meyers and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert were nominated in the category last year, as they all were the year before, with Daily Show winning both times (including with past host, Trevor Noah). One of them, along with 9 other hopefuls on a list that also includes The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Real Time With Bill Maher, and John Mulaney's weekly Netflix series are in danger of being blanked in the once robust category. This continues to cause annual consternation among those in Late Night, but if I were still on the Board Of Governors (as I was for 6 years representing the Writers Branch) I would just simply vote to set a minimum number of 4 nominees and a maximum number of 5 and be done with it.

	Therefore knowing the dwindling odds here, and the fact that no broadcast network series has even managed a single win since Late Show With David Letterman in 2002 (from 2003 it has been either Daily Show in various incarnations, a couple for Colbert Report, both Comedy Central, or HBO's stranglehold with Last Week With John Oliver which finally was forced to move to Scripted Variety Series where it now beats SNL),  late nighter's are hedging their bets and also trying to find refuge – and Emmys – in the Outstanding Short Form Comedy, Drama, Variety Series category. On this ballot there are 14 entries this year triggering 4 nominations. Of those 14, more than one third of them come from Late Night: Overtime With Bill Maher; Late Night With Seth Meyers: Corrections; The Tonight Show During Commercial Break; The Daily Show: Desi Lydic Foxsplains, and the brand new entry, The Rabbit Hole With Jimmy Kimmel. 











			Watch on Deadline		







	As opposed to Fallon's Tonight Show  cleverly trying to win an Emmy for their commercial breaks since for years  they haven't been able to get nominated for what is actually on the show itself, Kimmel's shorts called The Rabbit Hole With Jimmy Kimmel are satirical takeoffs on various conspiracy theories. They are produced outside the series itself under the guidance of JKL executive producer and head writer Molly McNearney and writer/producer Jesse Joyce, both of whom joined me on a zoom earlier this week to talk about the concept that debuted on the JKL You Tube channel a couple of months ago. McNearney explained that Joyce, also a writer for the series, constantly pitched the idea of this bit parodying video podcasters who peddle political conspiracies, but there was just no time in a monologue segment to do it justice, thus the spinoff to the internet.


	“Jesse is an impeccable, meticulous researcher, and he's often trying to get bits like this into our show. Unfortunately, we don't have time for a six-minute conspiracy bit in our monologues,” McNearney told me. “But we really wanted this to live, and the best place for it is online, for two reasons. One, that's where we have the space for it, and two, that's where these conspiracies live. Jesse was very passionate about writing these and putting them together and Jimmy was excited to parody these conspiracy theorists online, and you know, at a time where we have a president who speaks in conspiracy theories, it felt like a very significant time to parody.”


	The premiere episode dealt with cellular network technology that travels a path to tying 5G to Obama, Five Guys to the band Toto, and Tanya Harding to cell tower provider Crown Castle. Kimmel's tag line is “I'm just asking questions” and it leads to wild, but meticulously researched places such as tying the Moderna vaccine to Auntie Em from The Wizard Of Oz,  or the size of Elon Musk's “tiny testicles” to a line Nixon says on the Watergate tapes describing someone as “a little nuts”. To do that Joyce went through the Watergate tapes and stumbled on to that one line as – Voila! – a connect the dots moment of absurdity. Time travel, Windmills, waffle houses and more are other starting points for going down the ‘rabbit hole' with long and winding crazy conspiracy theories. “Don't believe anything you hear – unless you hear it from me”, Kimmel says at the end of every episode.


	Taking an average of 2 full 10 hour days just to connect the dots and do the extensive research, Joyce claims they are easy and dumb but that he can make a plausible argument out of anything. “If you go deep enough, because it's like the whole thing with conspiracies is just taking something random and small and just assigning tremendous value to it,” he says. “If you allow your brain to do that, you can make all kinds of spurious connections to nonsense, and yeah, and my head just kind of does that. The way they work is you have to lay a lot of track to get the fullest effect,” at which point McNearney noted you can take information and manipulate people very easily, you can just kind of make “truth” out of anything. A recent example would be Trump reposting some MAGA supporter's theory that Joe Biden was executed years ago and it was really a robot running the country as President Biden.


	Joyce points out conspiracy theories have been around throughout history by people ill-informed on just about everything. “Now, because of Twitter and YouTube and everything I have to hear about it all day long, from all these morons.  It feels overwhelming, like they're everywhere, but I feel like there have always been just as many conspiracy dingbats,” he says.

	











	McNearney says their You Tube channel has 21 million subscribers and a lot of viewers are watching their show, or parts of it, online so viewing habits have really changed. “The priority, every day, is to put all the best material on our show, but we also know that a lot of people are watching it on their phones, and they're not watching an hourlong show at home on the couch anymore. So, we are trying to make it as easy to digest as possible online, and we do it with our monologue and the best moments of our guest interviews,” she said. “And then something like Rabbit Hole gets to live entirely online, which we think is where it belongs, you know, at the center of misinformation, the internet.”


	Check out a recent episode of The Rabbit Hole below: 


	As for a possible Emmy for this? “I mean, you never know with these categories. There's so many different categories out there, but it's good to start thinking outside of just Emmys for broadcasters, a lot of opportunity there. So, we're grateful,” she said. “But It would really be great if Jimmy won an Emmy for conspiracy theories, you know?”


JULIANNE NICHOLSON IS HOLDING A HOT HAND FOR EMMYS


	Speaking of conspiracy theories how is this for one? Julianne Nicholson is really Jack Nicholson's daughter.  Actually that is not so far fetched as the other above mentioned crazy conspiracies on the internet. I mean I am asked sometimes if I come from the Hammond Organ empire.  So on our recent zoom I was curious if she was indeed asked a lot if she was related to the most famous Nicholson of them all. “Probably more so in the first decade,” she told me. “but you know, not as much as you would think, actually. And you know my answer? I would say if I was related to Jack Nicholson, you would've heard of me a long time ago.”


	Great answer, and one this Emmy winner (for Mare Of Easttown) certainly doesn't have to use much these days. A lot of people have definitely heard of Julianne Nicholson in her three decade career, and this year she is having quite a season with lots of awards buzz for not one, but two genuine shots at nominations. As the cheekily named Dance Mom thrust into instant TV fame, and not quite ready for it, in Hacks, Nicholson is a good bet in the Guest Actress in a Comedy Series category, while her role as the duplicitous tech mogul in Paradise is getting lots of talk about a Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. Of course she is no stranger to the Emmys. She already has one for her moving role as Lori Ross in 2021's Limited Series, Mare Of Easttown as Supporting Actress in a Limited Series, Movie or Anthology. A double win this year would land her Emmys in all three different acting categories, a feat that certainly confirms her versatility as an actor who can switch from genre to genre and drama to comedy with a great deal of success. But let's not jump ahead of ourselves. The nominations have to come first and that would be the same kind of testament to Nicholson's prodigious talents, as if we already didn't know this.


	In terms of the roles, she really loved being asked to do such a wild character on Hacks, and has her “Dance Mom” figured out. “I think she just wants to dance, to start, but I think there is something a little unfulfilled in her, and she is just ill-equipped to deal with, you know, the trappings, and that was what was so much fun, to be able to do so…you know, that arc, that very extreme arc, happens in three pretty short episodes,” she said. “You see the whole roller coaster for her, and I just think those creators, those writers, they're just so smart and fearless about what they ask of their storytelling and their actors to do, and it just always pays off, as far as I can tell.”

	











	As for the extreme physicality required for this comedic turn? “I'm glad you mentioned that, actually, because it was one of the things I loved about it, to use my body in that way, because it's true. Normally, I feel like my work is sort of, I don't know, heart-centered or head-centered, and so, to be able to just let loose in your body, in that way, was so fun, and it is exhausting. I cannot imagine how Lucille Ball did that so many times. I mean, I was beat after three episodes,” she laughed.


	And she also really got to switch gears by playing a villain, a rare female villain in Paradise in which she co-stars with Sterling K. Brown and James Marsden. It has been renewed for a second season. “Again, it's so fun to play something like I've never done before. You know, when you've been doing it for a couple of decades, almost three, now, you wonder if maybe you're going to have to start repeating yourself, and it's so nice to keep getting to explore new types of characters. I thought Dan (Fogelman, the creator) was so smart in introducing her backstory so early on in the season. For me to be able to have an understanding of where she came from, but also, obviously, for the audience to have a little bit more, hopefully, empathy or understanding. I mean, of course, she goes to the extreme, but there's a little bit more of why she is who she is when we meet her in present-day Paradise. I loved it. I think she's fascinating,” Nicholson says about the character nicknamed Sinatra. “I think that it's fun to be the boss. It's fun to be the most powerful person in the room. It's fun to be all those things without having to be over the top, or physically intimidatingor raising your voice. It was fun to sort of go around and find other ways I could bring that sort of power and maybe nefariousness, Is that even a word, to that character.”


	Yes that is a word, and also she is showing us a tech billionaire as villain, something that in the past few months has been increasingly emulated in the world for real, more than ever, but Nicholson said it wasn't what they were thinking. “None of what's happening now was even on our minds when we were actually making it, and to have it sort of be playing out is definitely alarming, to say the least. I think they surpass even, you know, our entertainment.”


	Nicholson also is really happy about the names of these two characters this season. “I think I have the two best names of the season, between Dance Mom and Sinatra,” she happily proclaims. “They're both names that people have latched onto. Like, the name is a very big part of the character, for each of these people, which is not always the case. So, that's been really interesting, too. You think it could be many things, but ultimately, I think it was the president's dad, Cal's dad, who said that I'm like Sinatra because his son, President Cal, was like Peter Lawford (Sinatra's Rat Pack friend and co-star). He's the one that nobody takes seriously, right? He's, like, for the ride. He's just one of the pack, but Sinatra, when she comes in the room, everyone's eyes are on her. Everyone pays attention.”


	So she is halfway through shooting season 2 but isn't sure how it ends, but the show is planned for a 3 season arc and she is on board for anything. Nicholson certainly is busy as she also plays a top CIA head in the feature film, The Amateur with Rami Malek, and completed a BBC series, Dope Girls in England where she lives. She hopes that one finds its way to the U.S. as well.

Okay, yes, it's true that there is a literal Supernatural episode titled "Jump the Shark," but, ironically, that was nowhere close to the actual shark-jumping moment that would later shift the series' tone into what would essentially become parody over time. There are a lot of opinions about when exactly Supernatural began to turn for the worst. Some say that anything after Season 5 could be discarded as the original mytharc was complete and series creator Eric Kripke stepped down as showrunner. Others say it was the Leviathan arc or the fact that Sam (Jared Padalecki) didn't look for Dean (Jensen Ackles) when he was trapped in Purgatory. But perhaps the most obvious moment that the series officially went off the rails was at the end of Season 9, when Dean became a full-blown demon.

After being killed in mortal combat against the angel Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) in the Season 9 finale, "Do You Believe In Miracles?," Dean opened his eyes to reveal himself to have become a demon. Having taken on the Mark of Cain in order to battle Metatron and Abaddon (Alaina Huffman), Dean learned that the mark was (apparently) irreversible and would ultimately turn him into a demon upon his death, cursing him to live forever. This led to the very short-lived Demon Dean (or "Deanmon") arc in Season 10's opening episodes, which, frankly, betrayed what so many people loved about the show. For years, Supernatural had pushed Dean into becoming more cozy with certain monsters and demons. We saw this with his relationship with Benny (Ty Olsson) in Season 8 and again with Mark A. Sheppard's Crowley over the years. It was these small compromises that led to Dean becoming the very thing he swore to hunt, all coming to a head the moment he opens his newly blackened eyes at the end of Season 9.

Dean becoming a demon and succumbing to the wickedness that comes with that never felt right. Sure, the series cites Season 3's "Dream A Little Dream Of Me" — which shows Dean a vision of himself as a demon — as "foreshadowing" this, but it doesn't really work. For starters, the series never actually intended to turn Dean into a demon. Rather, that scene from the third season was a way for Dean to wrestle with his own death after making a demon deal in "All Hell Breaks Loose" to bring Sam back from the dead. It was never meant to allude to the fact that Dean may actually become an evil spirit, so the whole thing feels tacky and like a misuse of the show's larger mythology. Furthermore, Supernatural didn't even commit to Demon Dean. Rather than turning him into a cold-blooded monster (as so many demons are), he's portrayed really as just another jerk with black eyes. To make it worse, Dean is human again after only a few episodes, but the show would never be the same.

Dean spent much of the Mark of Cain arc in Seasons 9 and 10 struggling with his temptation toward brutal, graphic violence. It was an interesting medium to explore those tendencies that already existed in the character, and it was a promising new direction for the series. However, when it came to Demon Dean, the whole thing was terribly inconsistent. Why wouldn't Dean's demon self be even more violent than the human version of him that bore the Mark? Why was Demon Dean all bark with no real bite? It didn't make much sense. In the end, Demon Dean was nothing but shock and awe. It never contributed anything substantial to Dean's long-term arc, and it only opened the door further for the show to assassinate his character.

In many ways, Demon Dean is a perfect example of how the second half of Supernatural's 15-season run would often introduce a new plotline, character, or story, only to forget about it entirely. While not the first time this would happen (or the last), it was one of the more obvious changes made to a lead character that never really amounted to anything. Of course, what it did manage to do was give the series precedent to change Dean into someone his younger self would hardly recognize. Wanting to kill Jack (Alexander Calvert) for no reason after years of befriending "friendly" monsters, saying "yes" to becoming possessed by Michael at the end of Season 13, and even killing Death (Julian Richings) at the end of Season 10 (as if the Winchesters never learned anything from their consequences) all occurred after Dean was transformed into a demon. If the show hadn't crossed this line, it may not have crossed some of those others either.

Dean got a bit confused over the years...

Demon Dean represents the gradual shift in Supernatural as the show became more of a parody of what made it great originally. The early seasons were great because it was a road horror show that followed two brothers as they hunted ghosts, monsters, and demons, only to eventually take on the Devil (Mark Pellegrino) himself. It had clear direction and follow-through. Even when the show fumbled to find a new voice in Seasons 6 and 7, it maintained its grip on who Sam and Dean were (for the most part). Season 8 continued to offer more promise for the show, but by the end of Season 9, it felt that the show — and Sam and Dean as characters — had become a spoof of what it once was. As the show went on, Dean felt more like a stock character (compared to his younger self), and while we still got some meaty material in select episodes, the show grew beyond what made it work so well at first.

So much of this can be traced back to that brief Demon Dean arc. It was a moment where the show, just threw an idea at the wall to see if it would stick. When it didn't, Supernatural moved on. This same technique would occur over and over again as the show ran for more seasons, and it's no wonder that Dean's arc had to ultimately be resolved on the spin-off series, The Winchesters. Make no mistake, Supernatural had great moments throughout its entire run, but there's a reason that the first half of the show is far more beloved than the second — and with plotlines like Demon Dean, we can see why.

Supernatural is available for streaming on Netflix.

For so long, we've wondered if we were alone here in this big, cold, dark universe. 

Supposed sightings of highly advanced aircraft zipping through our skies gave us hope that maybe one day we would be able to make friends with a celestial neighbor. Or, a lot of those sightings could have been fictionalized by the government to distract from their secret projects. 

This idea comes to us in the form of a report, not from some Internet forum board filled with crackpots, but from actual investigative journalists pushing their work in The Wall Street Journal.

According to an investigation by, again, The Wall Street Journal, in a story backed by the recently retired head of the Pentagon's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Force, Sean Kirkpatrick, the Pentagon spent years sowing discord and doubt among the American populace by making people think we've been visited by aliens. When, in reality, it was all stuff fictionalized by the Pentagon to distract the public from what was really going on.

And the “what was really going on part” is just secret projects developing technology that they wanted to keep secret. Kirkpatrick says he launched an internal investigation and found that the U.S. government fed us strange tales of UFO sightings to throw people off the scent of classified weapons programs. 

That glowing orb in the sky wasn't an extraterrestrial; it was your tax dollars at work. They were being used to distract you while the government built a mobile EMP device that simulated the effects of a nuclear detonation, but without the destructive blast.

Take one 1967 incident at a nuclear missile bunker, for example. A guard saw a “reddish-orange oval” floating near the front gate, and not long after, the base's nukes mysteriously shut down. If this were a TikTok video, this is where the X-Files theme would play. But the real culprit was an experimental electromagnetic pulse generator that glowed orange when charged.

According to the report, even military brass got fooled by some of these distractions. For decades, new commanders of top-secret Air Force programs were shown a photo of a supposed alien spacecraft and told their mission was to reverse-engineer it. The program, dubbed “Yankee Blue,” wasn't real. The photo was fake. And many officers didn't find that out until way later, if ever.

Now, is this report itself a part of a vast disinformation campaign to further muddy the waters, to further blur the line between real and fake, between a legitimate UFO sighting and a government false flag operation? Who knows. 

The answer to all of that is probably yes and maybe some no, but also probably more yeses than nos. We're all going to have to find security in the fact that we're going to die one day without ever knowing for sure. 

But considering how the federal government has spent the past eight years basically screaming at us that aliens are real and that they regularly visit us, and yet we still don't seem to care about it, I don't think we're going to care if we ultimately receive a definitive answer on any of this. 

Those big-headed, gray-skinned freaks better start blowing up some landmarks if they want us to truly start caring about them.

Are you passionate about abandoned villages and eerie sites with decaying buildings? Photographers are often intrigued by deserted places that were once bustling (or had big plans to be), such as Hashima Island in Japan, once a hub for the rich, and Burj Al Babas, in Turkey, a Disney-style ghost town with 587 abandoned castles. If you're a fan of ghost towns and abandoned structures, there's a lesser-known village worth adding to your bucket list of places to take your camera for uncanny photographs.

A remote Texas town is facing serious trouble thanks to an abandoned oil well. Let's explore what this means for the people living there.

The so-called UFO village in Taiwan has attracted photography lovers for years thanks to its unique houses, most of which have been abandoned for decades. Here's everything you should know about this bizarre yet eerily cool site, from its construction in the 1970s to the many paranormal stories associated with it and valuable tips for those planning to visit.

Located in the remote region of Sanzhi in Taiwan, the UFO village, also known as Sanzhi Pod City, Wanli UFO Village, and Sanzhi UFO Houses, is an abandoned site that was created to attract plenty of tourists but never achieved success. Built in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this vacation resort was meant to attract visitors thanks to its unique houses designed by Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, which are shaped like flying saucers and cubes. Visitors could rent one of these futuristic ocean-front accommodations and spend their vacations enjoying all sorts of water activities. However, the project failed.

Today, it is a mostly abandoned village with some of the most unusual buildings in the world. Lovers of bizarre buildings, such as the famous Kunsthofpassage's singing wall in Dresden, will surely fall in love with these houses shaped like UFOs, cubes, and hovering saucers. The accommodations featured bright colors and were intended to look as if made of a single piece.

Unfortunately, Taiwan's UFO village project was never truly successful. Several reasons contributed to its downfall. First and foremost, the high costs continued to increase compared to initial expectations. On top of this, there seem to have been legal and bureaucratic problems concerning permits and ownership rights of the land.

Additionally, the local economy was also hit hard in the 80s. While the real estate industry in Taiwan was booming in the early 1970s, the country faced a massive energy crisis in the following decade, which negatively impacted construction work. Work on the vacation resorts resumed again in 1989 and 2010. However, the project was eventually abandoned due to a lack of funds.

Some of the reasons contributing to Wanli UFO Village's failure include a lack of media coverage, poorly chosen materials, including fiberglass and plastic that could not properly insulate the houses and didn't last over time, and the high costs to rent out the accommodations. However, another reason contributed significantly to the site's downfall: eerie stories about paranormal activity.

It's no secret that many Taiwanese people are highly superstitious. Unfortunately, the UFO village soon became known among locals due to strange stories and eerie accidents. People reported strange lights and noises, which, although difficult to verify, surely didn't help advertise the site.

Some spooky stories also circulated about the proximity of the village to an alleged Dutch cemetery. Many Taiwanese believe that when graves are not properly taken care of, the deceased buried there may come back, causing great misfortune. Rumors spread about body parts found during construction work, builders falling ill, and unexplained accidents. None of these have ever been verified, yet they all contribute to the failure of the vacation resort.

While the UFO village was never truly used for its initial purpose, it remains relatively popular among photographers and those passionate about eerie and spooky places. If you plan to head to Taiwan soon and would love to check out this place, below is some helpful information.

Remember that while the village is considered mostly abandoned, some people still live here, so respect their privacy and avoid taking pictures of their homes.

The UFO village is located at Feicui Bay (翡翠灣) in the northern town of Wanli (萬里). You can reach this site by car or public transportation, such as a bus or train. Google Maps tends to be reliable in the country, but you can always ask locals for extra help. Once you're in the village, you can make the most of your trip to this extraordinary site by enjoying your afternoon at the beach, trying activities such as paragliding and surfing, or visiting the nearby Yehliu Geopark, known for its unique geological formations.

Looking for a ghost town with a fascinating history? The ex-capital of this U.S. state may be the perfect option. 

Abandoned villages have always fascinated tourists with their spooky and eerie vibes. There are plenty of options, from Vulture City, a ghost town in Arizona, to Terlingua, Texas, one of the USA's most underrated ghost towns. If you're a fan of these places and are about to head to Taiwan, add UFO Village to your bucket list!

The Colorado River basin has lost a Lake Mead's worth of water in the last 20 years — and scientists say we're passing a "critical point" where pumping groundwater will become too expensive.

Stark new satellite data reveal that the Colorado River basin has lost huge amounts of groundwater over the last few decades, with some research suggesting that this groundwater could run out by the end of the century.

But is that really the case? And if so, what could be done to prevent that happening?

While groundwater is being depleted, it's unlikely the water will ever run out completely. However, continued drainage of the basin could make the water table fall so far it's basically inaccessible, experts told Live Science.

The Colorado River snakes through seven U.S. states (Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and California) and two Mexican states (Baja California and Sonora). Some 40 million people, including those in Phoenix and Las Vegas, depend on it for their water needs. But as supplies of this surface water have dried up over the past two decades — reaching record lows — more and more people have been pumping groundwater from far below the surface, mainly for agricultural use.

To get a better idea of how much groundwater is being extracted, Jay Famiglietti, director of science for the Arizona Water Innovation Initiative at Arizona State University, and his colleagues turned to data from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite missions. These satellites track changes in Earth's gravity field to measure shifts in the amount of water above and below the ground, and when combined with data on snowpack, surface water and soil moisture, this information can allow scientists to estimate how much groundwater has been depleted.

The researchers estimate that since 2003, pumping from wells has drained about 28 million acre feet (34 cubic kilometers) of groundwater from the Colorado River Basin. This is akin to the capacity of Lake Mead, the largest U.S. reservoir, which sits behind the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River. The study was published May 27 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

About three-quarters of the groundwater depletion is happening in the river's lower basin, largely in Arizona, where water is pumped from desert aquifers to irrigate farmland, according to the study. In these largely rural areas, farms aren't usually hooked up to municipal water systems, and instead rely on water pumped from wells on the property. Because the wells are private, there is often no municipal, county- or state-level measurement of how much water they are drawing up.

Famiglietti and his colleagues estimate that annual groundwater losses in the basin averaged more than 1.2 million acre-feet (1.5 cubic kilometers) and if the trend continues, it could lead to water shortages and limit food production.

"We're passing a critical point where it is getting more and more expensive to go deeper into the aquifer, and the water quality is dropping," Famiglietti said.

Dozens of wells have dried up in the area. Collapsing aquifers have caused land subsidence, and created fissures.

Ryan Mitchell, chief hydrologist at the Arizona Department of Water Resources, who was not involved in the new study, told Live Science that he welcomes the paper's findings and is concerned about the levels of estimated groundwater depletion in some areas. However, he takes issue with a sentence in the paper that suggests that an Arizona Department of Water Resources simulation indicated "complete depletion by the end of the century." He said the simulations don't indicate complete depletion of groundwater at all, let alone by the end of the century.

The groundwater won't run out, he said, but neither GRACE satellite data nor measurements of water use will tell us exactly how much water is left in aquifers.

"It's almost like it's an unknowable number in the same way that if someone said how many grains of sand are on the beach, you could make some assumptions and make some guesses but you can never actually know the exact amount of sand grains," Mitchell said.

Bridget Scanlon, a research professor in the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas at Austin, and her team recently used GRACE data to assess the implications of drought in the Colorado River basin. They saw similar patterns, finding that there was a period of high groundwater use as irrigation expanded between the 1940s and 1970s. Then, the amount of groundwater recovered during a wet period in the early 1980s and 1990s.

But since then, the picture has differed depending on how areas are managed. In "active management areas," or areas where water use is monitored, the levels of groundwater have stayed roughly level. In these areas, groundwater is pumped, but based on how much is drawn up, management agencies can divert more water to the depleted area to filter back down to the aquifer.

In unmanaged areas, no agency tracks how much groundwater is pumped, so agencies don't know when to replenish the aquifers. High extraction in unmanaged areas is driving the overall draining of groundwater, Scanlon told Live Science.

"We can't manage what we don't measure," he said. "It shows that if you have rules in place and you keep a close eye on water use and you actively manage it, you can kind of keep it at a sustainable level."

One thing is for sure: Waiting for precipitation to end the drought and replenish aquifers won't be enough. Studies imply that the flow of the Colorado River is expected to continue to decline thanks to climate-linked reductions in snowfall and rainfall — and that means there will be less surface water to use, less water to recharge aquifers and more reason to extract water from underground.



Drilling deeper wells is one solution, but there are problems with that, Famiglietti said. At some point, it will cost millions of dollars for a deep-enough well that will have high energy costs to pump water, he said, and that water is likely to require treatment.

"As you go deeper into the groundwater, that water has been sitting around in contact with soil and rocks for a long time, so it's dissolving solids and salts," Famiglietti said. This can lead to water that is salty, poor-tasting or that contains high levels of arsenic. "And because these are often refilled by agricultural water, they [are] collecting higher concentrations of pesticides and fertilizer," Famiglietti said.

Another option is to reduce water use, by, for example, changing what is farmed, to shift from water-intensive crops like alfalfa, Famiglietti said. "It can't be business as usual," he said. "We have to think about what our priorities are for water use."

"I'm as concerned about tomorrow as I am about 100 years from now," he said. “It's very clear that we need more groundwater management in the lower basin, which is mostly in Arizona. Only 18% by area is managed, and there's an awful lot of depletion happening outside of those areas."

Every expert Live Science talked with suggested that extending the area covered by active water management areas would help — first, by keeping tabs on what is being used where, and then trying to replace what is used.

As part of such schemes, water could be brought in from elsewhere, Scanlon said. For example, this already happens when San Antonio buys water and pipes it from East Texas more than 150 miles (240 kilometers) away.

"Groundwater is a finite resource," Mitchell said. "You need to be able to let it recharge naturally or be able to replenish what you use. He said Scanlon's research shows that "we're doing OK in the active management areas, and we're not doing so hot in the areas where we don't have some kind of framework in place."

A legislative bill to extend the areas that are actively managed has been proposed in Arizona, but similar ones have stalled after facing opposition. Those opposed say restricting water doesn't protect existing agricultural use of groundwater and will stifle economic growth. Some also object to water use being decided at the state level when they would prefer smaller water districts with locally elected directors.

"We're not trying to spy on anyone; we just want to know what the water uses are," Mitchell said. "But it's hard because trust in governments is at an all-time low. We are trying to put things in place to help the mom-and-pop domestic wells — those folks who can't afford to drill 2,000-foot [600 meters] wells because it's just too deep and too expensive. We want to try to help them protect their water resources."

A scientist has sent a chilling warning to the world after the discovery of a UFO adorned with mysterious and bizarre inscriptions, suggesting a monumental shift in our understanding of extraterrestrial life.

Dr. Julia Mossbridge, a cognitive neuroscientist and researcher into unidentified aerial phenomena (UAPs), the modern term for UFO sightings, suggests that humanity may soon have to confront the reality of alien existence and enter a new phase of comprehension.

This comes amid increasing revelations about supposed encounters with UFOs and extraterrestrials. Notably, an odd, spherical object found in Colombia is thought by some scientists to be a fragment of UFO technology.

The artifact features symbols reminiscent of ancient scripts, such as runes, and scientists have employed artificial intelligence in attempts to decode the cryptic writing. Dr. Mossbridge shared with Fox News: "We are entering a time when we are starting to recognize as humans we don't have the control that we thought we had over everything."

She warns that the potential unveiling of extraterrestrial beings could plunge numerous individuals and societies into turmoil as they grapple with the reality of their presence, reports the Daily Star.

"One of the mistakes we make is [saying] because I think I understand this, everything I think today is true," she remarked, noting that it leads to confusion when something arises that doesn't "fit our model of the world."

Mossbridge herself remains doubtful about the sphere being a genuine UFO, despite public conviction. "The sphere itself seems kind of like an art project," she commented.

"If an artist is doing this, why is that? Well, I think it's partly the same reason. It's because we're learning that we don't understand what's in our skies or our waters. And there's something going on that's essentially bigger than us."

Conversely, Dr. Jose Luis Velazquez, a radiologist who examined the sphere, found no evidence suggesting human creation.

"It is of artificial origin, in that it shows no evidence of welding, and its internal structure is composed of high-density elements. More testing is needed to establish its origin," he stated.

According to Mail Online, his research team utilized AI to help decode the design, interpreting it as: "The origin of birth through union and energy in the cycle of transformation, meeting point of unity, expansion, and consciousness - individual consciousness."

They suggested: "We interpret it as a message to humanity, encouraging a collective shift in consciousness to help Mother Earth-especially considering the current issues with pollution and environmental decline."

In a similar vein, three-fingered alien mummies discovered in 2017 in the Nazca desert have been puzzling scientists, who now believe they are approximately 1,200 years old.

Often brushed off as merely an art project, experts now believe that the "alien" mummies of Peru may have been victims of murder. Scientists studying the enigmatic three-fingered bodies with elongated skulls have made new discoveries they assert confirm the specimens are '100% real'.

The injuries they sustained suggest they met violent ends - possibly even assassinated. Unearthed in 2017 in Peru's Nazca desert, the mummies were unveiled to the world in Mexico two years later as potential fossilized remains of extraterrestrials not part of Earth's evolutionary chain.

Supernatural fans have flocked to social media in their droves after Netflix shared a post relating to the hit series.

The official Netflix account posted a GIF of Dean Winchester (played by Jensen Ackles) covered in blood on X (formerly Twitter), with a quoted post which read: “you're a sick f*** if you think people covered in blood is hot [sic].”

The post sent fans into a frenzy as they all demanded the same thing.

One person commented under the post: “UK netflix does not have supernatural!! Why? [sic].”

A second posted: “Supernatural isn't even ON Netflix in Germany but amazon prime instead.”

Someone else echoed similar sentiments: “Supernatural isn't even on Netflix in my country (Bulgaria) and I think you should fix that immediately.”

A fourth disgruntled fan said: “You are so right. Now, what about your announcement to put Supernatural in your playlist in my country (Romania)? I think you should do it.”

Another person noted: “supernatural ain't even ur show bro [sic].”

Others were furious at Supernatural being removed from Netflix after having access to it on the streamer.

One irate Supernatural fan wrote: “@netflix Can you give us one good reason why you are discontinuing Supernatural on your service?

“It still has and always will have a rabid following, with new fans popping up all the time. Many cannot afford the DVDs. I don't understand your reasoning. It HAS to make money.”

“Yeah...so don't take Supernatural away from us,” said a second.

A third wrote: “aren't you removing spn from netflix in the us... [sic].”

A fourth fan was left confused and wrote about the post: “Netflix does this mean you're planning on keeping SPN in the US and not letting it leave by the end of the year?! [sic].”

Supernatural is currently available to watch on Prime Video in the UK for those with a membership. For a fee, you can also watch the fantasy series on Apple TV+ or YouTube.

Netflix US currently has Supernatural available on its service, but is scheduled to leave the platform on December 18, according to CBR.

The CW series Supernatural aired for a whopping 15 seasons between 2005 and 2020, following monster hunter brothers Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester.

Over the course of the series, the pair hunted down all manner of supernatural beings from demons and ghosts to monsters.

During its time on screens, Supernatural became the longest-running American live-action fantasy TV show.

But it seems nothing compares to the success of Supernatural with subsequent spin-offs failing to hit the mark with fans.

Supernatural: Bloodlines got a backdoor pilot in 2013 but failed to be picked up by the network.

In 2017, Wayward Sisters was launched as a backdoor pilot in season 13 of Supernatural but failed to be picked up.

Later, there was Supernatural's prequel series The Winchesters, focusing on Sam and Dean's parents and narrated by Ackles. Sadly, this was cancelled after one season.

Supernatural is available to watch on Netflix until December 18

Brooklyn Beckham has been feuding with his family over reports that he's fell out with him famous parents, David and Victoria.

After the news of him reportedly not planning to attend his dad's pending knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list.

However, a source close to Brooklyn denied this and told Daily Star: "This seems to be another deliberate attempt to misrepresent the truth, and it only serves to distract from this honor being bestowed on Brooklyn's father."

But what does tarot say about the family's relationship at the moment? We spoke to celebrity pyschic Inbaal Honigman in collaboration with https://www.casino.org/uk/ about her hot take on the family family feud.

The expert revealed: "The Beckham clan's relationship is represented by the Ace of Wands card, a fiery Tarot card that describes how everyone in the family has a strong personality and a lot to say for themselves.

"They're in the midst of the situation right now, emotions are running high, and therefore any action, by any family member, will just throw fuel on the fire.

"At this stage, and for the next four weeks, the Tarot predicts that things can only intensify and deteriorate before they start to recover.

"Blocking each other's socials, sending public barbed comments, and taking their sibling rivalry to the max, the coming month brings no relief from this strife."

What does the future have in store for the Beckham family relationship? She explained: "This situation is not a permanent one. There are hurt feelings all over, and some things are going to get worse before they get better.

"The 3 of Swords Tarot card, nicknamed 'Sorrow', reveals that the fiery emotions are rooted in pain. In such a big family, it's easy for a sibling to feel left out, and instead of sharing and communicating, they choose to act out. Brooklyn isolated, and in his hurt, and most likely did some things that caused the rift to escalate.

"There's no hate there, nobody dislikes anybody.

"They'll make amends, and a healing will start, but not in the next few weeks.

"Starting August, says the 'Strength' Tarot card, someone from outside the family will start to bring people closer together. The Beckhams will heal."

But the ultimate question this week is will Brooklyn attend his father's knighthood ceremony? "Unfortunately, the Tarot doesn't show Brooklyn at his father's knighthood ceremony.

"One of the brothers is trying to advocate for this presently. Brooklyn's younger siblings are reaching out and asking him to turn up to the event, because those photos are for life, and the siblings know how sad it would make David, if he's not able to share his special moment with all his children. But his firstborn won't be able to make it that day."

Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz's relationship is reportedly being prioritised over his relationship with his family, and some fans have been wondering if they marriage will last the tension.

We asked Inbaal if Brooklyn and Nicola's relationship will last the stress, and she said: "Both Brooklyn and Nicola are very much committed to their relationship, and are both 'family first' type of people. They value stability and love sharing their lives with each other.

"The 3 of Wands Tarot card indicates that temptation is never too far away, but their family values and mutual love keep them together.

"Nicola herself would like to see Brooklyn reconcile with his family."

Conspiracy theories and Boeing safety concerns resurface.

A devastating air crash occurred on Thursday afternoon when Air India Flight AI 171 (Boeing 787 Dreamliner), crashed shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad's Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport. The plane, which was bound for London, crashed into a medical college complex, killing 241 people and leaving only one survivor.

The flight was carrying 242 passengers and crew members, including 168 Indians, 53 British nationals, seven Portuguese citizens and one Canadian. Former Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani was among the passengers.

While investigations are underway, the exact cause of the crash remains unknown. Boeing and Air India have both extended condolences to the families of the victims.

Speculation grows online, blaming Pakistan, Khalistanis and more

In the absence of confirmed information, social media has become a breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Various users have suggested sabotage, pointing fingers at Pakistan's intelligence agency, Kashmiri separatists, and pro-Khalistani groups, especially in the wake of a recent terror attack in Pahalgam.

Some theories have tried to link the crash to the Indian Prime Minister's upcoming visit to Canada for the G7 summit, implying that extremist elements may have targeted the flight because of past threats made against Air India. Others have speculated about the lone survivor's actions, suggesting he might have interfered with the emergency door, although aviation professionals have ruled out this possibility due to pressurisation safeguards.

Additionally, questions have been raised about Air India's use of a Turkish firm for maintaining its wide-body aircraft, though no evidence has surfaced linking this to the crash.

Boeing's Dreamliner under scrutiny again

Thursday's tragedy has brought fresh attention to Boeing's long-standing manufacturing and safety issues, particularly involving its 787 Dreamliner.

Although Boeing maintained a strong safety record for 14 years, recent incidents have raised serious concerns. In December 2023, a Boeing 737-800 crash in South Korea killed 179 of the 181 people on board. The aircraft burst into flames after hitting a concrete wall at the end of a runway.

The 787 Dreamliner series, used in the Ahmedabad crash, has faced a number of technical problems since 2013. That year, the entire fleet was grounded due to incidents of battery fires. Later, Boeing had to suspend all Dreamliner deliveries for almost two years because of manufacturing defects, including structural gaps and use of non-compliant materials.

Whistleblower's suspicious death revives doubts

Concerns about Boeing's practices grew even further earlier this year when John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's South Carolina plant, was found dead shortly after testifying in a legal case involving Boeing. Barnett had previously warned that some safety procedures were being overlooked and that defective parts were being installed.

Although authorities ruled his death a suicide and found no signs of foul play, many social media users have connected his death to Boeing's internal issues. His earlier warnings about poor production quality have resurfaced in public discussions following Thursday's crash.

Boeing's past crashes and legal troubles

Boeing is still recovering from the fallout of two previous disasters involving its 737 Max aircraft, which crashed in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people. In May this year, the company reached a settlement with the US Department of Justice that allowed it to avoid criminal prosecution for those incidents.

Despite Boeing's assurances that it has corrected past errors, critics continue to question the company's approach to safety and quality control.

Investigation begins

A detailed investigation into the Ahmedabad crash has begun, with Indian authorities expected to work alongside international aviation experts. Boeing has confirmed that it will cooperate fully with the inquiry.

Public is advised to avoid spreading misinformation or jumping to conclusions. Baseless theories can hamper the investigation and add to the trauma experienced by the victims' families.
