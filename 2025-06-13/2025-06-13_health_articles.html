                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new case report was published in Volume 12 of Oncoscience on May 22, 2025, titled "A rare case: Pure Sertoli cell tumor uncovered in atrophic ovary during postmenopausal vault prolapse evaluation." In this case report, corresponding author Naina Kumar from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and team describe a rare ovarian tumor in a 70-year-old postmenopausal woman. The tumor was found incidentally during surgery for pelvic organ prolapse. This unusual finding demonstrates the importance of careful tissue evaluation during routine surgeries, especially in older women who may show no symptoms of ovarian disease. Sertoli cell tumors of the ovary are rare and usually occur in younger women. While some of these tumors may produce hormones, the tumor in this case was non-functional and was discovered only through microscopic analysis after removal during surgery for an unrelated condition. During the procedure, both atrophic ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed as part of standard surgical care. "Her medical history included Whipple's surgery six years ago for periampullary carcinoma (pT1aN0), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (1000 mg/m² IV infusion weekly for 7 weeks, a week of rest, and then weekly infusions for 3 weeks in each 28-day cycle)." Because the tumor was diagnosed at an early stage and confined to the ovary, no additional treatment was needed. The patient recovered well from surgery and remains in good health under regular follow-up. The authors emphasize that early-stage tumors like this one are generally not aggressive and have excellent outcomes, especially when detected early. This case emphasizes how rare conditions can go undetected in postmenopausal women, particularly when symptoms are absent. It also highlights the value of thorough inspection and histological analysis during pelvic surgeries. Identifying such tumors early, even when incidental, can ensure appropriate management and long-term health monitoring. By reporting this case, the researchers contribute to broader clinical awareness of rare ovarian tumors and support best practices for surgical evaluation in gynecological care.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Dozens of HIV experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received emails on Wednesday revoking notices they received 10 weeks ago that laid them off. Damage to their projects may be permanent, however, and ongoing restrictions on their research will harm lives, multiple HIV scientists at the CDC told KFF Health News on condition of anonymity because of fears of retaliation. The researchers were laid off in early April, just before they put the finishing touches on in-depth, national surveys about HIV. Health officials and policymakers use the data to design HIV programs that more efficiently curb the spread of infections and save lives. For example, a 2023 survey revealed that about half of adults under age 30 who were living with HIV weren't on treatment steadily enough to keep them healthy and prevent them from spreading the virus to others. Treatment rates were far higher for those over 50. As a result, health officials doubled down on outreach to younger generations. However, in April, state and local health officials found themselves cut off from their CDC counterparts after the layoffs. Emails from the Department of Health and Human Services told staff their roles were "either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency." Marti Merritt, a project coordinator at the Illinois state health department, was flabbergasted that she and other state employees had invested more than a year into the surveys only to have them go dark in the final phase. "It's like the data has gone into a black hole," she said. Evidence shows that preventing HIV is far cheaper than treating people once they're infected. A doctor and HIV expert reinstated at the CDC this week said the late termination of the surveys would waste millions of taxpayer dollars that have already been spent on data collection. Two large, long-standing efforts, the Medical Monitoring Project and the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system, cost around $72 million, he said. "Two years' worth of data from 30,000 participants will be unusable, and therefore wasted," if the projects can't be finished, he said. To resume the surveys, he and other CDC researchers would need a green light from higher up because the grants covering these surveys ended while they were on administrative leave in May. Merritt has conducted interviews for the Medical Monitoring Project for about 20 years, she said, but the Illinois health department has now assigned her to other tasks. Other health departments have laid off or reassigned employees dedicated to HIV surveillance, too. But it would take time, further delaying the next round of surveys — if those begin at all. "These surveys aren't lights that you turn on and off," said John Brooks, a researcher who retired from the CDC's Division of HIV Prevention last year. However, the surveys would be further impaired by actions related to Trump's executive orders targeting words such as "gender" that researchers use to learn who has HIV, who is at risk, and why. This has meant altering data on two populations disproportionately affected by HIV: transgender people and men who have sex with men. "I care about the transgender patients I see, and it's so hurtful to see them treated this way by the government." "There was a lack of funding," he said, "but they didn't censor science or try to control science like they're doing now." A terse email to CDC employees from Tom Nagy, chief human capital officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, reviewed by KFF Health News, simply refers to the notice regarding the reduction in force and says, "That notice is hereby revoked." In an email response to queries, Andrew Nixon, HHS director of communications, wrote, "HHS is streamlining operations without compromising mission-critical work. Enhancing the health and well-being of all Americans remains our top priority." "We've been getting paid this whole time even though we've not been allowed to work, and that doesn't feel good when you're a dedicated civil servant," said one reinstated employee.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>They can overheat, burn, or lose effectiveness over time, and they rarely adapt to real-world conditions like cold air or damp weather. Moreover, many heating devices are bulky, immobile, and unable to detect when therapy is actually needed. These shortcomings highlight the urgent demand for smart, wearable solutions that can monitor the body's needs and deliver safe, stable, and timely heat. Due to these problems, intelligent thermotherapy devices must be further explored and developed. On May 13, 2025, researchers from Dalian University of Technology unveiled a flexible, wearable thermotherapy system (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00912-8) in Microsystems & Nanoengineering. The system marks a step forward in wearable health technology, addressing the limitations of conventional devices and offering patients a discreet, reliable tool for daily therapy and protection in varying conditions. Layered with an Au temperature sensor, Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based humidity sensor, and Joule heater, the device conforms closely to joints, such as knees, and performs reliably during movement. Using real-time data processed by a flexible circuit and Bluetooth-enabled feedback loop, the system can adjust heat output within 1 second, maintaining temperatures with less than 0.1°C variation at 45°C. This innovation supports multiple applications: programmable on-demand therapy with customized heat cycles; daily thermal protection that automatically activates in cold weather; and moisture control to combat joint-stiffening humidity. On-body tests showed the heater could raise local skin temperature even outdoors, while humidity levels dropped steadily during use. Most strikingly, the team used photoplethysmography (PPG) to measure blood flow and confirmed that thermotherapy via this system significantly boosted local perfusion—an essential factor in pain relief. The design also proved durable through 1,000+ use cycles, remaining accurate during walking, stretching, and running. By combining high precision with real-world practicality, this soft, wearable system delivers clinical-grade function in a form factor that patients can use every day. Our goal was to make thermal therapy truly wearable—not just portable, but adaptive and intuitive. By integrating precise sensors and closed-loop control into a stretchable format, we're giving patients the ability to receive therapy in real time, tailored to their specific environment and condition. Beyond arthritis relief, this technology signals a new direction for wearable health systems. Its modular design, environmental responsiveness, and soft mechanics make it well-suited for integration into clothing, bandages, or therapeutic garments. For chronic conditions sensitive to temperature and humidity—such as circulatory issues, muscle injuries, or autoimmune disorders—the platform could offer customized support. Additionally, the same sensing-feedback-heating architecture might be adapted for wound care, smart rehabilitation, or ambient-responsive materials. As digital health advances, the marriage of microscale electronics with human-scale needs could reshape how therapy is delivered—not in clinics, but directly on the body, wherever and whenever it's needed most.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Identifying effective anti-cancer drugs and combinations is essential for successful treatment. However, manual 3D cell culture workflows are often time-consuming, inconsistent, and error-prone, hindering their adoption for high-throughput drug screening. This system enables automation of the entire cell culture process, including automated processes for plating, media exchange, passaging and culture monitoring in response to compound treatment and endpoint assays. Following a 48-hour incubation, spheroids were treated with various anti-cancer compounds at multiple concentrations for 3–5 days, after which staining and imaging were conducted. During the cell culture automation, spheroids were monitored using transmitted light to assess phenotypic changes, including growth inhibition and spheroid disintegration. Additionally, ATP content was measured utilizing a CellTiter-Glo assay, with luminescent readouts obtained using the SpectraMax® iD3 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. A concentration-dependent decrease in ATP content was observed, as well as inhibition of spheroid growth and increased cell death in response to the anti-cancer compounds.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>According to a new study, presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) Care of the Athletic Heart 2025 conference, sleep apnea may be more prevalent in younger female athletes than previously believed, especially among female athletes with higher levels of training. While obstructive sleep apnea has been observed in younger male athletes, the prevalence in female athletes and the association with cardiovascular risk is largely unknown. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common sleep-related breathing disorder, impacting about 18 million Americans, and is prevalent in both men and women. It occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway, causing patients with OSA to repeatedly stop and start breathing when sleeping. Symptoms include excessive daytime sleepiness, loud snoring, waking during the night and gasping or choking. There is a lot of overlap in symptoms of sleep apnea and sleep deprivation, which is unsurprisingly quite common among these athletes. Some symptoms that might clue in an athletic trainer, coach or clinician that an athlete may be experiencing or at risk for sleep apnea include not feeling well-rested despite a full night of sleep, snoring very loudly, gasping or choking while sleeping. There may be more subtle signs too, including difficulty concentrating or irritability. Accurately diagnosing sleep apnea is important, as a range of treatment options-such as CPAP, mandibular advancement devices, or even surgery-can significantly improve quality of life and, depending on disease severity, potentially reduce long-term cardiovascular risk." Austin Rim, MD, a cardiology fellow at Emory University in Atlanta and study's lead author Softball players made up the largest proportion of female athletes, followed by volleyball and basketball. "We found in this cohort that sleep health, not even considering sleep apnea, was poor among athletes, with 36% reporting poor sleep quality and 22% reporting that they had trouble staying awake at least once in the past month while eating or engaging in social activities," Rim said. "Ensuring good sleep hygiene among these athletes is low-hanging fruit for improving overall health in this population," The study recorded anthropometrics (the systematic measurements of the human body to define a person's size and form), blood pressure and pulse wave velocity-a measurement that quantifies arterial stiffness, a precursor to hypertension. AHI is a key metric to diagnose and assess the severity of sleep apnea by determining how many apneas and hypopneas occur per hour. OSA is diagnosed either by an AHI greater than five events per hour accompanied with associated symptoms like daytime sleepiness or unrefreshing sleep or an AHI score greater than 15 events per hour regardless of symptoms. No athletes had a measured AHI over 15 events per hour. The study found greater age and lean mass were independent predictors of sleep apnea, which the researchers said suggests sleep apnea may become more prevalent with higher levels of training in female athletes. "Ideally, a future study would include multi-campus projects that track athletes over several seasons, compare men and women directly, and evaluate whether treating mild apnea reduces these early measures of cardiovascular risk. Treatment of OSA in older trials through CPAP haven't always been shown to mitigate risk, so it would be helpful to see if treatment at a younger age could improve on this," Rim said.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>About 30% of all respiratory tract infections are caused by coronaviruses, leading to widespread illnesses and, in some cases, to epidemic and even pandemic outbreaks, as we experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the development of groundbreaking technology that enables the design of prophylactic vaccines, access to those vaccines is not equal across the globe, especially in low-resource countries, and also other hesitations prevent their adoption. Therefore, fast-acting antiviral drugs with broad activity against multiple respiratory coronaviruses and the ability to be rapidly distributed as oral treatments are urgently needed. In 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, a multidisciplinary team of computational biologists, and infectious disease, medical chemistry and drug development experts formed at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at Harvard University. By creating a cohesive AI-enabled and physics-based molecular modeling and drug discovery pipeline built around film industry procedural animation software, they identified the orally available, FDA-approved drug bemcentinib, as a potential antiviral agent. However, to further optimize its activity with follow up support from Open Philanthropy-Good Ventures Foundation, they used this chemical compound as a launch pad for developing a more specific and effective antiviral drug with efficacy against a broad range of coronaviruses. During COVID-19, many research groups sought to develop drugs that target the external surfaces of Spike proteins shared by coronaviruses, which bind to receptor molecules on the surface of host cells and mediate virus entry. "We thought that constant regions that remain hidden while the virus initially binds to its host cell, but become accessible during a critical time window when it prepares itself for membrane fusion could be ideal sites. Targeting those could be a way to essentially lock the virus in at the pre-fusion stage before it can release its genetic material into the cytoplasm of host cells," said first-author Charles Reilly, Ph.D., a former Wyss Principal Scientist who led the project with Ingber. "The major challenge lay in identifying these moving cogs for which we could design drugs that could work as a universal wrench for multiple coronaviruses." To accomplish this complex modelling, they essentially animated a variety of structural snapshots of the Spike protein that other researchers had captured at different stages of virus binding and fusion in X-Ray crystallography and other studies. This "molecular dynamics simulation," based on actual physical features of the Spike protein, allowed them to generate "synthetic data" in which they could glean regions in the so-called S2 subunit of the protein that underwent large-scale mechanical transitions. By applying AI methods to their synthetic data, they were able to pinpoint a specific site within one of those mechanically highly-active regions that revealed itself at a pre-fusion step before facilitating the Spike protein's embedding within the host cell membrane. This key site had potential to function as a binding pocket for drug compounds that would gum up the works to prevent membrane fusion and viral entry and, importantly, it was shared by different members of the coronavirus family. The highest-ranking drug that was also orally available was bemcentinib, which in their AI-enabled simulations and molecular docking studies remained strongly bound across multiple structural changes the entire region was undergoing, eventually freezing it at the pre-fusion stage. In fact, the team, with drug development expertise of Wyss Senior Principal Scientist Sylvie Bernier, Ph.D., and Wyss' Senior Director, Translational R&D, Ken Carlson, Ph.D., demonstrated that bemcentinib potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells expressing the ACE2 receptor on their surface by preventing its entry into the cells. Interestingly, the infection-blocking effect of bemcentinib had also been observed by other researchers, and bemcentinib had actually improved clinical outcomes in a clinical trial with hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Joel Moore, Ph.D., a talented medicinal chemist on the team, designed a series of novel compounds, the best of which, dubbed WYS-633, inhibited the entry of SARS-CoV-2 viruses into lung cells just like bemcentinib did and, importantly, without binding to AXL. WYS-633 also prevented SARS-CoV-1, MERS, and multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants from infecting cells, suggesting that the approach could indeed lead to a broad-spectrum antiviral drug against multiple coronaviruses. To further improve the drug-like features of WYS-633, also with an eye towards oral bioavailability, the team performed another round of medical chemistry, AI-enabled computational analysis, and in vitro testing, which culminated in WYS-694, an antiviral compound 12.5-fold more potent than WYS-633. "While additional computational predictions using Google's AlphaFold 3 machine learning algorithm supported our central hypothesis, we will still have to demonstrate that WYS-694 precisely binds to the target site we identified in the Spike protein's S2 subunit through detailed structural studies, and that the interaction alone and no other potential target enables the antiviral activity," said Reilly. "But our findings are extremely compelling and open up a new path for dealing with viral outbreaks." "By aiming for an orally available drug that broadly inhibits multiple coronaviruses, even as a prophylactic treatment, we deliberately set the bar at maximum height," said senior author Ingber. "Yet, our integrated approach merging new AI-driven computational and experimental technologies has proven to be incredibly powerful in achieving this goal. Beyond producing a promising new drug that could be useful in future respiratory pandemics, this approach holds great potential for the discovery of drugs against a number of other virus families utilizing membrane fusion proteins, including influenza, HIV, Ebola, Measles, and others." Ingber is also the Judah Folkman Professor of Vascular Biology at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital and the Hansjörg Wyss Professor of Biologically Inspired Engineering at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Additional authors on the study were Shanda Lightbown and Austin Paul.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A study published June 12 in the Cell Press journal Current Biology demonstrated that scientists can identify individuals based solely on their breathing patterns with 96.8% accuracy. These nasal respiratory "fingerprints" also offer insights into physical and mental health. In mammals, the brain processes odor information during inhalation. This link between the brain and breathing led researchers to wonder: since every brain is unique, wouldn't each person's breathing pattern reflect that? Most breathing tests last just one to 20 minutes, focusing on evaluating lung function or diagnosing disease. But those brief snapshots aren't enough to capture subtle patterns. You would think that breathing has been measured and analyzed in every way. Yet we stumbled upon a completely new way to look at respiration. Noam Sobel, Author, Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel Sobel's team fitted 100 healthy young adults with the device and asked them to go about their daily lives. This high-level accuracy remained consistent across multiple retests conducted over a two-year period, rivaling the precision of some voice recognition technologies. "I thought it would be really hard to identify someone because everyone is doing different things, like running, studying, or resting," says author Timna Soroka of the Weizmann Institute of Science. "But it turns out their breathing patterns were remarkably distinct." Moreover, the study found that these respiratory fingerprints correlated with a person's body mass index, sleep-wake cycle, levels of depression and anxiety, and even behavioral traits. For example, participants who scored relatively higher on anxiety questionnaires had shorter inhales and more variability in the pauses between breaths during sleep. Soroka noted that none of the participants met clinical diagnostic criteria for mental or behavioral conditions. The results suggest that long-term nasal airflow monitoring may serve as a window into physical and emotional well-being. "But it might be the other way around. If that's true, we might be able to change the way you breathe to change those conditions." The current device still faces real-world challenges. A tube that runs under the nose is often associated with illness and may deter adoption. The device also doesn't account for mouth breathing and can slip out of place when sleeping. The team aims to design a more discreet and comfortable version for everyday use. Soroka and Sobel are already investigating whether people can mimic healthy breathing patterns to improve their mental and emotional states.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>Adding nivolumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year overall survival among patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to findings from a phase 3 trial presented at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 annual meeting. The survival benefit was more pronounced in patients who achieved a pathologic complete response or a presurgery clearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). “In this trial, we found that the use of neoadjuvant nivolumab plus chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer overall survival than chemotherapy alone, along with long-term benefit regarding event-free survival,” the authors wrote. “These findings support the hypothesis that neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy can have a profound impact on the course of a patient's life when paired with the curative potential of surgical resection.” This study, led by Patrick M. Forde, MB, BCh, PhD, Trinity St. James's Cancer Institute, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, was published online in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented at ASCO. Additionally, several subgroups in the exploratory analyses were too small for adequate statistical comparison, requiring cautious interpretation of these results. This study was funded by Bristol Myers Squibb. Five authors declared being employees of Bristol Myers Squibb, with some holding stock or stock options with the company. Several authors declared working as consultants or having other ties with various sources including Bristol Myers Squibb. This article was created using several editorial tools, including AI, as part of the process.</p>

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>First, a large-scale real-world study reporting no significantly higher risk of cancer in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to bDMARDs, and second an abstract looking at whether the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) which are causing waves in many fields including diabetes and obesity might offer cardiovascular protection in RA. Romain Aymon and colleagues set out to assess the cancer incidence in RA patients treated with JAKi compared to biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARD), using data from 13 registers. Cancers were linked to treatments within 5 years of cessation or until follow-up loss, death, or study end, whichever came first. But further statistical analysis found no significant difference in the incidence of either cancer type between JAKi and TNFi, nor between JAKi and OMA. A sub-analysis was performed on patients aged 50 and older who had at least one cardiovascular risk factor – mimicking the inclusion criteria from ORAL Surveillance. But similarly to the overall population, there was no significant difference in the incidence of either cancer type between JAKi and either bDMARD group. This could be due to UV light, but immune alteration has also been linked to increased risk – including in people with RA, but largely with data from the pre-biologic era. New work has set out to assess the risk of keratinocyte cancer in modern RA patients initiating treatment with b/tsDMARDs, including the risk of a second keratinocyte cancer. 21,121 people were identified from the Swedish Rheumatology Quality Register. When compared to TNFi, the hazard ratio for a keratinocyte cancer was 1.72 with JAKi and 0.81 with OMA, Among RA patients with a history of keratinocyte cancers, the hazard ratio for a second diagnosis was 2.76 for JAKi versus TNFi, and 1.54 for OMA versus TNFi. Presenting the work, Viking Huss said "these findings suggest that people with RA treated with a JAKi have a higher incidence of a first keratinocyte cancer, primarily driven by basal cell carcinoma. These findings support the notion that skin examination would be beneficial in this population, and skin cancer risks with JAKi treatment should be monitored. It is well-known that as well as increased cancer risks, people with RA are prone to cardiovascular complications, and in ORAL Surveillance JAKi were associated with adverse cardiovascular events. Conversely, GLP-1RA have demonstrated possible cardioprotective effects in other patient populations, with some agents now specifically approved for reducing cardiovascular risk. The work assessed primary outcomes occurring within 5 years, including the incidence of acute coronary syndromes, cerebral infarction, acute peripheral arterial thrombosis, deep venous thrombosis, and overall arterial events. The results show that patients taking a GLP-1RA had a significantly lower risk of acute coronary syndromes and deep venous thrombosis, with a trend towards a lower risk of acute cerebral infarction and peripheral arterial disease events, although the difference was not statistically significant. The overall incidence of cardiovascular events was significantly lower in GLP-1RA group. A survival analysis showed comparable probabilities between the two groups for all studied outcomes, with no significant difference in median survival. These findings underscore the potential of GLP-1RA to reduce certain CV risks in people with RA being treated with JAKi. However, not all effects were significant, and there remains a need for further research to validate the results.

                <p class='hidden' class='text-gray-500'>A new study published in PLOS Mental Health has explored whether having a sibling born preterm (before 37 weeks of gestation) affects the behavior of children born at term. In a study by the University of Oulu, researchers found no evidence that siblings of preterm-born children experience more behavioral problems than those with only term-born siblings. However, children without any siblings showed higher levels of behavioral difficulties. The study analyzed data from 65,711 children aged 14 and under, using information from birth cohorts in Denmark, Norway, Italy, and the Netherlands. Behavioral data were gathered using parental reports via the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Child Behaviour Checklist. The results showed that children with preterm-born siblings did not differ significantly in behavioral outcomes compared to those with only term-born siblings. In contrast, children without siblings had higher internalizing and externalizing scores. While the study did not identify a behavioral risk associated with having a preterm-born sibling, it highlights the need for further research. The authors note that the mental health of siblings and larger sample sizes for specific subgroups should be included in future longitudinal studies. Children with preterm-born siblings remain an understudied group that could potentially be at increased risk of mental health challenges. The researchers emphasize that continued investigation could provide essential evidence for targeted support, especially if future studies reveal specific vulnerabilities among siblings of preterm-born children. The research was conducted as part of the European Union-funded LifeCycle project but was a larger collaboration involving projects such as LongITools and ATHLETE, part of the European Human Exposome Network. The LifeCycle project created the EU Child Cohort Network (EUCCN), which brings together data from 17 cohorts across Europe and Australia, and is featured in the larger European Health Research Data and Sample Catalogue developed in the other projects.
